18-04-2020||News||Covid-19: How will the people of Delhi respond as this crisis unfolds?||Parts of Delhi have been sealed. Others will open up slowly, as the lockdown continues in its second phase. But it will move into a lower gear soon with some services resumed and some mobility restored. How will the citizens of Delhi respond as this unfolds? Will there be a replay of some of the misanthropic acts that marred Delhi’s image in the days before the lockdown or will it be a more encouraging story?A quick recap of the lockdown media reports preceding and just following the first lockdown and into the second one reveals distressing stories of doctors, nurses, lab technicians and airline crew being turned away from their rented accommodations, heart-rending visuals of migrant workers and their families trudging many long miles on foot because their employers and landlords turned them out and appallingly xenophobic assaults on people from the Northeast. Those were the shameful pictures of a warped urban conscience that emerged in those days. While sporadic incidents also occurred in other cities, Delhi reported each of these types of inhumane behaviour in shocking synchrony of misanthropic misconduct. Health care providers being denied entry into their residential accommodation is mindless stupidity apart from the meanness of the act. Don’t the landlords or neighbours who deny entry into the colonies or homes realise that these are the persons they have to turn to for care when someone in their family has to deliver a baby, get a child vaccinated, seek lifesaving treatment for a heart attack, get serious trauma repaired after a road accident or get any other kind of medical attention and care? Ironically, returning family members from Covid-19-affected countries were warmly welcomed but those who strive selflessly to save lives were treated as a threat to health when they returned from a neighbourhood hospital.The airline crew members who ran relief missions to bring back Indians stranded in Covid-19-affected countries were denied entry into their homes by the self-appointed guardians of their colony’s health. What if one of their loved ones was trapped in a foreign country? It should not even require an element of self-interest to appreciate the dedication of those who undertook humanitarian missions. Common decency will do. The plight of the migrants was far worse. Their eviction from their homes and shelters was an inhuman act of heartless cruelty, at a time when they had lost work and wages. Their trek on foot, seeking safety and social support in a faraway home, was a sight that tore into the conscience of any sensitive viewer who saw the pictures. The stoicism of these poor people was saintly in comparison to the churlish conduct of those who tossed them out when solidarity was most needed. The cruelty of some police personnel berating and beating them, as they wended their weary way to a distant destination, was shocking. It was a malevolent abuse of police power directed at the homeless and helpless who were also guiltless. When they return, they should not be treated as virus carriers as they are coming back from a low-exposure zone to a high-exposure zone.The xenophobia against anyone who looked Chinese was not only a display of ignorance about India’s geography and diverse population profile but also a criminal act of discrimination. Physical assaults against such persons amplify the criminality but even racist verbal abuse is culpable. I was dismayed by the fact that bystanders did not intervene, though some of them recorded and posted the shameful episodes on social media, for the rest of us to watch with mounting revulsion. Discrimination and recrimination against fellow Indians, based on ethnicity, social class or religion must be cast away when the need of the hour is unity.What had happened to the capital of India? Dilli, tumhara dil kahan gaya tha? (Delhi, where has your heart gone?) This is a city where many families which relocated from Pakistan after Partition found new homes and opportunities to rebuild their lives. They were then received with care and compassion. Has there been a generational change since then? Or is it that this city bade goodbye to humane conduct in 1984 when rioting mobs savagely set upon innocent Sikhs? Why is it that those who live in houses built by the poor offered no shelter to them when they were trapped by a lockdown? Have the middle and upper classes of Delhi socially distanced themselves from the poor to such an extent that empathy has been extinguished?No. I would like to believe that these acts were aberrations. Many who live in Delhi were distraught at these incidents which brought shame to the city. The Sikh community repeatedly came forward with laudable acts of social solidarity and provided admirably egalitarian support to the poor and vulnerable. Other citizens spoke up in public to decry the abhorrent acts. The media reported the incidents prominently and conveyed the collective outrage of decent citizens. The central and state government authorities set about the task of protecting health care providers, relocating migrants to shelters and warning louts against xenophobic acts. They also initiated disciplinary action against errant police personnel. Can we hope that by the end of the lockdown, Delhi will have rediscovered its soul? Even if it has a limited statehood status, it must become the capital of social solidarity.K Srinath Reddy is president, Public Health Foundation of India.

The man, Amit Paldi, was arrested from Sampla district in Haryana on Friday.Police said that around 6.30am on April 10, a van was stopped by a team in central Delhi’s Ranjeet Nagar. Police checked the vehicle and found 3,120 bottles of liquor concealed inside empty cartons of milk. The occupants of the car, later identified as Amit and Vikrant, had also pasted a fake pass, supposedly issued by north Delhi district magistrate’s office, on the car’s windshield. The two were arrested from the spot. Deputy commissioner of police(central), Sanjay Bhatia said,”When we questioned the two occupants of the van, they said Vikrant’s aunt had died of Covid-19 last week and that he and Amit were also possibly carrying the infection. They were then taken to hospital and kept in isolation”. Police said the two men were then taken to the Lok Nayak hospital, where their samples were taken and they were sent to quarantine. Police said that while the hospital authorities were conducting a second test for Covid-19, after the first tested negative, Amit escaped from hospital. Police said he walked to Sampla, about 60km from Lok Nayak hospital. An officer said Amit, who works in a crockery factory, has landed himself in more trouble by lying about the disease and escaping police custody. Vikrant, who is still in isolation, will be released, because he has been granted bail in the liquor smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/arrested-man-who-escaped-from-hospital-after-lying-about-having-covid-19-nabbed-again/story-pVFYNJ0z5np1sfSq0F455M.html

18-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Parents from NCR drive through states to fetch kids in Maha hostel||A couple in their fifties from Gurugram embarked on a 1200-km journey across four states on Friday, amid the nationwide lockdown, to bring their son home from his college hostel in Aurangabad.Their 25-year-old son is one of the 450-odd students of the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Aurangabad, who are stranded in the hostel since March, after a teacher, who had returned from abroad, tested positive for Covid-19 on campus. After the case was detected, all students were quarantined in the hostel until March 26. However, after a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 23 and later extended till May 3, the students were unable to return home. IHM, Aurangabad, principal and director Satish Jayaram refused to comment on the issue.Although the institute has not asked students to vacate the premises, several parents are making road trips across states to bring their children home. “The institute is taking good care of the children but we are worried that necessary social distancing norms are not being followed. Moreover, there is uncertainty over when the lockdown will be lifted so we decided to drive to Aurangabad to pick up our son,” the parents, who are working professionals, told HT. They had booked flight tickets on two airlines for April 15 for their son, but the flights were cancelled after the lockdown was extended. They then procured a curfew pass from Gurugram to Aurangabad and back. The parents took turns and drove non-stop for around 19 hours to reach Aurangabad in Maharashtra, crossing Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. They reached the hostel on Saturday and soon after, started their journey back home. Another man, also a working professional from the national capital region (NCR), will start his journey on Sunday to bring back his son. “We tried to bring our child back by booking a chartered flight but permissions were difficult to come by.... Hence, we were forced to make these long journeys.”Aurangabad district collector Uday Chaudhuri said, “Some parents got in touch with us. They are panicking but there is no reason to as students have completed their quarantine and are safe. However, if parents have proper curfew permissions from a competent authority, they can pick up their children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-from-ncr-drive-through-states-to-fetch-kids-in-maha-hostel/story-4BQ8s7prjnrEWAEPbGCjBN.html
18-04-2020||City||Infrastructure work begins across Mumbai Metropolitan Region||Almost a month after the work for the infrastructure projects came to a standstill owing to the nationwide lockdown, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is implementing most of the projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), said it has resumed works at some of the sites. Joint metropolitan commissioner BG Pawar said the work on the Kalyan Ring Road and the Rajnouli road overbridge at Bhiwandi have commenced, even as the MMRDA has received the nod to start work for the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) on Friday. Meanwhile, the work on the Kalanagar flyover is also expected to start from Monday. MMRDA had earlier planned to open the flyover for motorists by next month. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “We are starting with the work outside Mumbai first. We have 11,000 labourers at different project sites and we are progressing gradually with the work.” Despite the delay in the infrastructure works owing to the lockdown, Rajeev said MMRDA has worked on major policy decisions in the past one month. “Since March 9, MMRDA officials have had 85 meetings via video-conferencing. We have finalised our second branding vision document, which enlists all the signages for Metro projects. We have also worked on a transit-oriented development policy. We are aiming to make optimum use of digital tools to continue working,” said Rajeev.The MMRDA has, however, revised the bidding schedules for at least 10 major projects by a month, owing to the lockdown. Some of the projects include procurement of rolling stock for the Monorail, a master plan for salt-pan lands in MMR, an urban design master plan for the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) and the Mumbai Eye project at Bandra reclamation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infrastructure-work-begins-across-mumbai-metropolitan-region/story-oV498QMYYysU9HykH1V2HI.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||Isolation is new normal for 34-yr-old Covid-19 survivor from Worli||For the 34-year-old Mumbaiite who recently recovered from Covid-19 after testing positive in March, isolation is the new normal. He believes it was his decision to isolate himself that ensured no one else in his family contracted the infection. Now, even after he has tested negative for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, he is voluntarily extending his isolation. “I have to do this to ensure I stay healthy and my family and friends stay safe. I’ve almost forgotten what normal feels like,” he said.The 34-year-old runs a company that sells tickets for sporting events around the world. On March 14, when the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a global pandemic, he was in the United Kingdom and had tickets to return to Mumbai on March 16. He was showing no symptoms at the time. “I stuck to the plan and once I reached Mumbai, I immediately started safety and hygiene protocols,” he said. “Just awareness about the virus and understanding how to avoid it can save us from spreading it further,” he said. Once in Mumbai, he isolated himself completely. “I’d informed my family to stay at a safe distance and I never left my room,” he said. However, within a week of his return, he developed a cough and got himself tested at a private hospital. The results showed he was positive for Covid-19. “On March 27, I admitted myself to Wockhardt Hospital where I spent around 10 days. I was discharged only after two tests within 24 hours showed negative results,” he said.After returning home on April 9, he has chosen to remain in isolation for the benefit of his family. “Since there isn’t a remedy, I decided to ensure that even after recovering, I’ll continue self-imposed isolation to let my body fully recover.” He said he plans to stay in isolation for 40 days since the first symptoms appeared. “This is the new normal, I guess,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/isolation-is-new-normal-for-34-yr-old-covid-19-survivor-from-worli/story-W2ZdHXHE4Ah3RrNsosoGEI.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||Schools unable to pay teachers as parents yet to pay fees||A few days after the Maharashtra education department asked schools to not force parents to pay fees during the lockdown, teachers working in several private schools have now requested the government to allow at least partial payments. In a letter to the education minister, several teachers have stated that schools are not able to pay them their salaries, because they have not got fees yet. “While asking schools to not force parents into paying the fees is a good step, many schools are not even receiving partial payments because of the circular. With this, schools are now unable to pay their teachers. Many such schools in the city and other parts of the state are yet to pay teachers. The government can make an addition to the circular and state that those parents who can pay fees or those who can make partial payments, can do so,” said Uday Nare, a teacher from Hansraj Morarji Public School in Andheri..Teachers said that most schools who had collected fees until April this year are also using the circular as an excuse to not pay up. “They are using the government circular as an excuse to delay payments. We request the government to also act against such schools,” said the teacher who works at a private school in Kandivli. On Friday, state government announced that parents from across the state can complain to the district education officers if schools insist on paying fees during the lockdown period. The announcement came after several parents complained about schools not adhering to the March 30 circular asking them to give exemption in fees until the lockdown ends..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-unable-to-pay-teachers-as-parents-yet-to-pay-fees/story-0tN3KQ5pc3KogbwFSroI5J.html
18-04-2020||Lucknow||UP minister demands ban on Tablighi Jamaat||After the Enforcement Directorate registered a case against Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad and other members of the outfit, Uttar Pradesh minister Mohsin Raza urged the Centre to consider banning the Jamaat which was founded by Deobandi scholar and Saad’s great grandfather Mohammad Ilyas al-Kandhlawi in Mewat.Raza, who is the minister of state for minority Welfare, Waqf and Haj, said he had demanded a probe into TJ’s activities and was happy that the central government had acted. He said, “I had urged the Centre to probe their funding because it needs to be known from where the religious society gets financial support. I am happy that an investigation is underway now.”The Jamaat has been in the news ever since several Jamaatis, including those from abroad who attended a congregation at Tablighi headquarters at Delhi’s Nizamuddin, had tested positive. Maulana Saad has already been booked by the Delhi police under the Epidemic Disease Act.The Talblighi Jamaat members had spread out in different parts of the country, including Uttar Pradesh, after the Delhi congregation. A senior cleric close to the Tablighi Jamaat said while the financial matters of the Jamaat were clean, their stress on religious preaching alone had led to divisions. He said the prominent Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband had banned activities of Tablighi Jamaat, its own ideological off-shoot, from the campus. “It’s true that Darul Uloom had banned their activities after the Islamic seminary was split on ideological lines,” said an influential cleric from Deoband, adding that the ban was largely to prevent Deoband students from being trapped in ideological differences. The ban still stays. The Deoband cleric said Tablighis erred by not following the Covid-19 prevention protocol of social distancing though he blamed the media more for what he called was the ‘systematic targeting’ of Muslims. The cleric disagreed with the UP minister over his questioning the intentions of Jamaat and its leader Maulana Saad. “Maulana Saad is a pious man. We may differ ideologically but I will have to admit that there isn’t anything wrong with his intention. It’s just that we prefer ‘ilm’ (knowledge) over purely religious matters,” the cleric said.Raza said it needed to be known how the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat came up in Delhi’s Nizamuddin? “They have a grand building there and it’s time all of it is probed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-minister-demands-ban-on-tablighi-jamaat/story-rYi0cjgtcUc8nH1AvkVWTP.html
18-04-2020||Lucknow||Harassed Meerut doctor appeals to IMA for help||A group of residents, who allegedly attacked Dr Prashant Bhatnagar, was harassing the doctor’s family for over 10 days and adopting different ways to pressurise the family to vacate their rented house.In a letter written to the Indian Medical Association to seek help for justice, Dr Prashant Bhatnagar said that he was an associate professor in community medicine department of LLRM Medical College in Meerut. He and his parents lived in a house in sector 6 in Shastri Nagar locality for over 7 year and residents had no complaints. But things changed in the past 10 to 12 days as he was being seen as someone who spread corona and residents adopted different ways to harass him and his family. Dr Bhatnagar said that he often moved between his home and college and a few days back the residents locked the colony’s gates. He somehow managed to get keys which they again took back, which created problems for him. The same group of resident placed the make shift kiosk of guard at his parking. When he resisted they attacked him and his hand was fractured. Dr Bhatnagar’s father Vimal Bhatnagar also levelled similar accusations. He said that an Ashoka tree was cut because they used to throw its dry leaves in the nearby open area and people were scared that it may spread corona as his son was a doctor in the medical college and prone to infection.He also charged the police with siding with the accused. He said that cops in Nauchandi police station misled him about helping in writing a complaint and directed him to write what they dictated. “They ignored my repeated queries that why the issue of corona had not been included in my complaint and that it was incomplete. But they didn’t hear me and later declared that the incident had nothing to do with corona and the scuffle broke out on the issue of placing the kiosk for the guard,” he said. He said the police were working under pressure and said that the IPS son of a neighbour might be behind twisting the case.SHO of Nauchandi police station Ashutosh Kumar rejected the charges and reiterated that the incident was a fallout of dispute over placing guard room in front of Dr Bhatnagar’s house. He also denied the charges that police were working under pressure. “ I have heard about an IPS posted in MP whose family lives in the colony but nobody telephoned either him or senior officials in this regard,” said the SHO. A case has been registered against some residents on the complaint of Dr Bhatnagar’s father Vimal Bhatnagar but no arrests have been made yet. Meanwhile, Dr Bhatnagar had appealed to the IMA for support in his fight for justice. IMA’s secretary for Meerut Chapter Dr Anil Naushran said that a letter had been received from Dr Bhatnagar for seeking support. A meeting of IMA was convened on Saturday to discuss the issue and it was decided that the IMA would extend its full support to Dr Bhatnagar in his fight for justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/harassed-meerut-doctor-appeals-to-ima-for-help/story-mDWyTDMPbk0ZbycURgoyoM.html

18-04-2020||Lucknow||State govt has a budget of ₹50 crore for the elderly, says UP social welfare minister||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to all to take care of the elderly, especially those suffering from co-morbidities during the current extended Covid-19 lockdown, the focus straightaway was on Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state with an estimated 18 million senior citizens.Not only are the elderly bracketed in the high-risk group abut they also among the most vulnerable to domestic abuse (Helpage India survey).It has been nearly four years since the state government notified the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens and Dependents Act, but only a handful of cases, mostly from Rampur, have been reported so far.UP’s social welfare department is funding old age homes in all 75 districts.This is in addition to several private old age homes as well as some ‘pay and stay’ ones, which are functional.Hindustan Times caught up with UP’s social welfare minister Ramapati Shastri on the steps the government was taking to ensure the elderly, especially the destitute, stay safe amid the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Excerpts:UP has a huge elderly population, many of them destitute. What is the government doing for them?Well, only recently after increasing the old age pension for destitute to Rs 500 per month, we also just deposited two months’ pension in the accounts of nearly 50 lakh (5 million) elderly. Then we are providing 100% funding for old age homes in 74 of the 75 districts where, along with food, shelter and other things, we also take care of their medical and recreational needs. The one in Deoria, which was shifted to Kushinagar, is going to be functional again.We realise that the elderly are among the high-risk groups and entry of outsiders to all old age homes is currently barred to guard them against infection.How many elderly are there in old age homes at present?We have 5400 elderly in our fully funded homes across the state. And our old age homes have the capacity to admit more for each has a capacity to admit 150 elderly. We are providing masks, encouraging the elderly to use gamchas (multi-purpose wraparound) and also appeal to donors to come forward. But please avoid approaching old age homes directly for safety reasons. We encourage donors to contact us through local officials.But how can elderly destitute, or those abused at home and requiring help, get admitted to these homes?They can contact us through welfare officers in the district or officials of the local administration. In many cases, NGOs get them admitted.Are your old age homes big enough to ensure social distancing, especially keeping the present Covid-19 situation in mind?Yes, in most places we have old age homes whch are big enough, above 10,000 square ft or so. And, our officials are in touch with the elderly through video chats and video conferencing. What is the amount the state government spends on their stay, food, medicine and other things?Well, the government has set aside a budget of Rs 50 crore (Rs 500 million). So, the government allows NGOs running these old age homes to rent a home for up to Rs 90,000 per month.On an average, Rs 75 per day is roughly spent on each elderly person’s food, Rs 200 per month is kept aside for their medical needs and another Rs 150 monthly for recreational needs.Don’t you think the amount of Rs 75 per day per person for food needs to be reviewed?Yes, a proposal was raised to increase it, but let me tell you that this is an average amount. So the food is prepared in bulk. There is a different menu each day.It was in 2016 that the state government framed the rules for the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens. Have there been cases?Yes, there are. Though there are cases of abuse, but at the end of the day most parents, including those ill-treated by their children, often end up withdrawing the cases after children apologise. But yes, we would like to assure the elderly that the state government is there.

18-04-2020||Lucknow||Corona spread under control in UP, says govt||The state government on Saturday claimed that the spread of the coronavirus in Uttar Pradesh was under control.Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said Uttar Pradesh was the country’s most populous state with a high population density. Yet, in comparison to other states, the Covid-19 cases and the number of deaths were less in UP, he said.Several districts, including Pilibhit, Maharajganj, Hathras, Prayagraj, Bareilly and Shahjahanpur had got rid of the corona tag after the infected patients in these districts recovered and there were no fresh cases there, he said. The central government had lauded the efforts of the Uttar Pradesh government and directed other states to follow the UP model to control the spread of coronavirus in their respective states, he said. “If we analyse in terms of population, UP would have been the fifth most populous country had it been a separate nation. In comparison to the national average, there were less coronavirus positive cases in UP,” he said. The state government was able to control the spread of the coronavirus due to the joint efforts of various government department employees, who were working round the clock in coordination with sanitisation workers, police personnel and frontline health workers, he said.The state government had identified the hotspots and divided them in three categories to control the spread of the virus, he added. The first category included 179 hotspots in 15 districts, the second had 93 hotspots in 25 districts and the third category included seven hotspots in five districts, he said.The health department and police teams surveyed 11 lakh people in category one hotspots, 12.88 lakh people in category two hotspots and 20,000 people in category three hotspots, he said.UP’S COVID TALLY 869A state government officer said 869 positive cases were reported in 49 districts till Saturday.

18-04-2020||Delhi||Speeding car hits scooter in Janakpuri, one killed; driver arrested||A 37-year-old man, who worked as a plumber and had gone to repair a water pump in Dwarka, was killed and his friend was injured after the scooter they were riding on was hit by a speeding car in west Delhi’s Janakpur area on Friday evening. Police said they have arrested the car driver, a 20-year-old resident of Janakpuri, who was driving on the wrong carriageway. The driver has claimed that he was returning after distributing food packets to the homeless. Investigators claimed that neither of the three people involved in the accident had curfew passes to drive during the lockdown.According to the police, the accident was reported around 6.45pm from near B3 Block on Dharam Marg in Janakpuri. A police team that reached the spot found that a Hyundai Creta car had hit a scooter in a head-on collision The scooter was being driven by Ashutosh, 23, and his friend who rode pillion was Rizab Shah, 37 — both residents of Mahabir Nagar in Tilak Nagar. “Both were taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital. While Ashutosh survived the accident with injuries to his leg and is under treatment, Shah succumbed on Saturday morning,” said a police officer. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said the car has been seized from the spot and the accused, Rudraksh Khanna, a resident of Janakpuri, who was driving the vehicle, arrested. “A case under Section 304 A for causing death due to negligence and rash driving has been registered against Khanna. Post mortem will be conducted on Sunday to ascertain the cause of death and for further legal action,” Purohit said.A police officer probing the accident, said Rudraksh Khanna’s father is a government contractor. “On enquiry he said he had stepped out of his house amid the lockdown to distribute food packets to the homeless. His medical examination did not show any signs of alcohol in his bloodstream at the time of the accident. He was alone in the car. Because many carriageway have been closed due to the lockdown, Khanna was driving his car on the wrong carriageway. Both Khanna and the two men on scooter were in violation of the lockdown, “ the officer said. “What we know is that Rizab had gone to repair a water pump in Dwarka. Ashutosh had taken him to Dwarka, because the person who needed the plumber was his employer. The accident took place when he and his friend were returning home. Both were wearing helmets. He is survived by his wife and their toddler. He was the only earning member in his family,” Sapne Shah, Rizab’s aunt, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/speeding-car-hits-scooter-in-janakpuri-one-killed-driver-arrested/story-Bvc8ZILj2knJ8O3PaplZRK.html

According to the police, the man had allegedly hit her wife with a bat several times after tying her up. He then allegedly hid her body in the bed box, locked his room and fled the spot. The victim was identified by her first name, Shahnaz, a native of West Bengal, the police said. The woman and her husband worked as cook at the PG accommodation. The police said that both of them were staying there for the past one-and-a-half months.The incident took place on Friday night when the suspect and victim had a heated argument over something, the police said. The victim’s body was found on Saturday around 11am by the police after the landlord of the PG house lodged a complaint.In the police complaint, the landlord said that when he saw that their room was locked from outside, he approached the police.

18-04-2020||City||Covid hospital to cater to virus positive pregnant women||The district health department on Saturday said Covid-19 positive women or women suspected to be infected with the virus will now be taken only to Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital, a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, for deliveries. Earlier, all pregnant women were taken to New District Women Hospital at Gaushala Road for deliveries.“From now on, the deliveries of any Covid-19 positive patient or women suspected of being infected with the virus will be taken up at a dedicated Covid hospital which is an L2 category hospital in Ghaziabad. Such cases will not be referred to the Women Hospital. We have also directed the 102/108 ambulance service officials to take such women to the Sanjay Nagar hospital and not the Women Hospital,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad.The state family welfare department on April 13 had rolled out directions stating that such women patients must be taken to L1/L2 category hospitals and three of four ambulances should be regularly disinfected and deputed for ferrying such patients. The directions also stated that newborn babies of positive or suspected cases should be treated at Sick Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) at Covid hospitals and not at regular SNCUs.Under the three-layered Covid healthcare facilities, the Uttar Pradesh government has divided Covid hospitals into three categories: L1, L2, and L3. The L1 hospitals are for positive cases with no health issues, while L2 hospitals deal with positive patients who have health complications. The L3 hospitals attend to critical positive patients.The 100-bedded Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital is an L2 category Covid hospital. Health officials clarified that pregnant women from hot spot areas will be taken to the Women Hospital for delivery.“The women who arrive from hot spot areas cannot be termed as suspected cases, so they will be treated at Women’s Hospital. If such women patients come to dedicated Covid hospitals, they and their newborns are at risk of getting infected with the coronavirus disease,” Dr Gupta added.Meanwhile, the officials at Women’ Hospital said there has been a sharp decline in the number of deliveries at the facility in the past few weeks amid the lockdown.“At an average, 18 deliveries would take place at the hospital everyday, and now amid the lockdown, the figure has come down to an average of about 12 deliveries per day. The catchment area of our hospital is about 10km in different localities which include many areas where migrant workers live. We can attribute the decline in the number of deliveries to the recent exodus of migrant labourers who returned to their home towns,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of the hospital. She said a major chunk of women patients come from areas like Khoda, Kaila Bhatta and Old Ghaziabad City.After the countrywide lockdown was announced, thousands of workers in Delhi-NCR had left for their home towns. Hundreds of buses were deployed by the UP State Road Transport Corporation, with help from Haryana Roadways, workers were ferried to their respective home towns in Uttar Pradesh on March 28 and 29.The Women Hospital is a 100-bedded facility inside the MMG Hospital complex and has a staff of about 150 doctors, nurses and other health care workers.“We are taking every precaution at the hospital, and recording an extensive history of patients and checking them for any coronavirus related symptoms. We also got all our staff, including 42 doctors and nurses working at the front-line, tested nobody has been detected with Covid-19 so far,” Dr Tyagi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/positive-pregnant-women-or-those-suspected-to-have-virus-will-be-taken-to-covid-hospital-only/story-Qf9yCzVesI6kfnYW4YjvnI.html

In another step aimed at a return to normalcy, Faridabad deputy commissioner Yashpal Yadav announced that the revenue department would also start the registry of property deeds, as directed by the state revenue department, Monday onwards.The respective industrial units that restart operations will have to follow social distancing rules prescribed by the state government and Union home ministry. “We are moving towards a phased resumption of manufacturing across the state, and as per government directions, industrial units outside containment zones will be allowed to operate from Monday. The standard operating procedure (SOP) in this regard is being prepared by the government and everyone will have to follow it,” said Yadav, adding that the final decision in the matter will depend on when the SOP is issued.On Friday, Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala had told HT that industries outside the municipal corporations and containment zones would be allowed to function from April 20. Faridabad is a major industrial centre in Haryana and a number of large manufacturing units are located in the district. The containment zones in the district are Sector 3, Sector 11, Sector 16, Sector 37, Sector 28, Badkhal, Green Field Colony, AC Nagar, Fatehpur Taga, Khori, Chandpur Arua, Mohna and Ranhera.Yadav also said industries that are allowed to function if they follow safety protocol to avoid the spread of Covid-19, including calling in 50% of staff, ensuring staggered entries and exits, maintaining a six-feet distance between workers on factory floors, making sure staff members wear masks, and disinfecting work areas on a regular basis.As for the registration of property deeds, Yadav said, “There will be 30 registrations a day, and the e-appointments will be done in a staggered manner. Officials will also ensure social distancing, and only a single executant and witness will be allowed inside,” he said.Directions to local hospitalsThe Faridabad deputy commissioner on Saturday issued directions to local hospitals and chemist shops to share details of customers who have sought treatment or bought medicines for influenza-like illnesses (ILI). “The chemist shops may provide data regarding the patients, who came to the shop without prescription from the doctor and found suffering from ILI. If any person is found positive later on and discloses that he/she has visited some hospital or chemist shop and they failed it to report to the authority, in that eventuality action under Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Epidemic Act 1897 and under provision of IPC would be taken,” said the order issued by deputy commissioner.Yadav said that apart from medical establishments, they have also asked urban and local bodies, resident welfare associations, and other groups to share information in this matter, claiming it is crucial to test patients suspected to have Covid-19, and take action to stem the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/industrial-units-outside-f-bad-civic-body-limits-may-return-to-life-from-monday/story-387LXEKGkuYroWW2jS1CiM.html
18-04-2020||City||Astaire Gardens forms emergency response team to make life easy in lockdown||Gurugram: Soon after Covid-19 cases started emerging last month in the city, Astaire Gardens in Sector 70 created an emergency response team (ERT) to tackle the unprecedented situation. Since then, the team has been coordinating all the efforts to ensure that life under the ongoing nationwide lockdown goes on without any major hiccups.Besides, the gated society, which houses about 350 families, has taken a number of steps aimed at containing the spread of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The ERT comprises members of the residents’ welfare association (RWA), representatives from various blocks and the builder, who are working in tandem to contain the spread of coronavirus disease. “We constituted the team early on as more and more updates regarding Covid-19 started emerging. We coordinate our efforts and ensure that needs of residents, especially senior citizens who are at greater risk of being contracted the deadly virus, are met. We help them with essential supplies such as medicines, or any other requirement that arises,” said Neehar Ranjan, president of the RWA.Rahul Srivastava, a member of the RWA and the response team, said that the ERT worked as a point of contact with the senior citizens. Srivastava said, “We have details of all senior citizens with us. Whenever there is a delivery at the gate, the security guard informs the block-wise ERT members who go and collect the deliveries. The supplies are then delivered to the senior citizens.” Srivastava said that senior citizens could reach out to the team for all kinds of assistance, including household work if required. “While we have not received any request from senior citizens regarding household work so far, an arrangement has been worked out if the need arises,” he said.Asha Malhotra, 64, said that senior citizens like her were being taken care of. “We are not facing any problem. Whenever our deliveries arrive at the gate, they are collected by the members of the response team who bring them to our doorsteps,” said Malhotra, who lives with her husband and has been managing the household work on her own.The society has barred the entry of part-time domestic helps such as maids, cooks, drivers, car cleaners, and dog walkers, among others. Entry for external vendors such as food delivery persons has been restricted. Residents are required to collect the belongings from the main gate. All persons entering the building with deliveries are thermal scanned and mandatorily required to use sanitizers, the RWA said, adding that a makeshift washbasin has also been placed at the entrance.In view of the lockdown, the society has provided all essential staff members with boarding and lodging facilities within the condominium. “It was becoming difficult for our support staff to commute with restrictions in place. Moreover, we felt that any unnecessary exposure was not safe. To resolve the issue, we made arrangements within the society for the whole shift. Looking after their health and accommodation is necessary since they are the ones who keep the society running,” said Ranjan.The staff have been housed in two floors of a villa while residents have taken the responsibility of providing them with rations and other requirements. “We have around 10-12 people living on the premises for the day shift and a skeleton staff for the night shift. They have been provided with ration and induction cookers,” said the RWA president.While the condominium does not have grocery shops within the complex, it has tied up with a retail outlet that delivers at request. “In order to restrict the movement of residents and provide them with safer options, we tied up with the retail chain. Every week, the retail chain puts out a form seeking details of the commodities required by residents,” said Ranjan. Guards on duty ensure that residents adhere to physical distancing protocols and stand at a distance from each other. “We realised that there is a rush of people whenever essential services are delivered at the gate. The guards monitor the situation and ensure that people collect the deliveries one by one in a designated spot. The retail chain calls up residents one by one and asks them to collect their order,” said Ranjan.The condominium has also been utilising the provisions supplied by the MCG for helping people residing in the neighbouring slums in Parla village. “Once or twice in a week, we reach out to the MCG’s provisions facility which sends a truck of supplies. We buy from them and distribute rations among domestic helps and others in need in the nearby sites. We give out packets of rice, pulses, and flour,” said Ranjan.Since the lockdown started, the condominium has been maintaining a record of persons moving out. “Whenever a person is stepping out of the society, we note down the details and the reason for which the individual is stepping out. We have around 350 families. After monitoring the movement of people, we have realised that about 40 people are moving out on an average daily,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/astaire-gardens-forms-emergency-response-team-to-make-life-easy-in-lockdown/story-bevH2qRrbQKNFs2JYfD3XI.html
18-04-2020||City||Navjot Sidhu defies CM’s order to wear masks at public places||Even as Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has made wearing masks mandatory for everyone at public places in the state as a measure to combat Covid-19 outbreak, Congress MLA from Amritsar Navjot Singh Sidhu continues to step out from his house without mask.On Saturday, Sidhu was out to donate 1,000 N95 masks to frontline healthcare personnel of Amritsar and Taran Tarn civil hospitals, and the Government Medical College here. It was his fifth public visit since curfew was imposed in Punjab and he did not wear mask during any of these visits.On Friday, he was among the people of his Amritsar east constituency to distribute ration. The persons accompanying him in his SUV were also without masks.In a video conference with state officials on Friday, the CM ordered police not to spare anyone moving around without masks.In his first visit after the lockdown, Sidhu reached out to the people of his constituency on March 31 to distribute essential grocery items to them. On April 9, he visited Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (GNDH) to distribute masks and sanitisers to hospital staff. Six coronavirus patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital at that time.On the same day, the CM ordered that wearing masks will be mandatory in the state and asked the health secretary to issue detailed guidelines in this regard.On April 13, Sidhu distributed protection kits to healthcare and sanitisation workers at GNDH, again without mask.Notably, Amritsar commissioner of police (CP) Sukhchain Singh Gill on Saturday issued a statement that the police will not make any compromise in cases of violation of the CM’s directions and action will be taken against anyone found at a public place without mask. Gill, however, was not available for comments over Sidhu’s violation despite HT repeated phone calls.To a media query on Friday as to why he did not wear mask, Sidhu kept mum and just smiled. Through social media later, he cited WHO guidelines, saying a healthy person does not need to wear a mask.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navjot-sidhu-defies-cm-s-order-to-wear-masks-at-public-places/story-q8PZROWYT5PYL5fXOUmvbL.html
18-04-2020||City||Residents suffer as MCG wrongly pastes ‘home under quarantine’ stickers||Gurugram: Amid the growing fears over the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, many residents of the city have found themselves at the receiving end, with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) incorrectly pasting ‘do not visit, home under quarantine’ stickers outside their houses, despite them not being under the quarantine list.Ashutosh Batta, a resident of DLF Phase 1, said that he discovered the sticker on the floor of his driveway last week, with an address that was not his. He used social media to complain to the MCG, but despite response to his message, no action has been taken as yet.His bigger concern, Batta says, is that the family it was meant for could easily be roaming around, with their neighbours unaware they are meant to be under quarantine.“The address and the name of the person mentioned in the sticker were completely different from mine. I tweeted to the MCG about this and also got a response from the civic body. I expected further communication from them but nobody has contacted me. I am worried that those who need to be under quarantine are roaming freely in the city, and their neighbourhood is completely unaware of it,” said Batta.RS Randhawa, a resident of DLF Phase 2, says MCG workers mistakenly put a sticker meant for his daughter, who married earlier this year and now resides on Sohna road, outside his home without speaking to him beforehand.He said that due to the stigma attached with the stickers, he has faced problems with the delivery of essential items while garbage collection workers have also refused to collect waste from his house ever since, even though sticker is no longer there.“I ordered some items online, but the delivery boy refused to even keep the packet outside my gate. Even after the quarantine period was over, and I was permitted from authorities to remove the sticker, the garbage collectors still refuse to pick my household waste. I have no choice but to dump the garbage every day outside my office located nearby from where waste is collected,” said Randhawa.Similarly, a complaint by a resident on MCG’s social media account highlighted the incorrect details in the sticker pasted outside the person’s home such as the quarantine period starting from June 4-18 and the address mentioned as “Sector 7 or Sector 10A”.“@MunCorpGurugram. We are wondering how the quarantine would start from 4th of June, 2020?, (sic)” a tweet by @rude_front stated.Over the last month, MCG officials said they have pasted ‘home under quarantine’ stickers outside 6,900 houses across the city. “Regarding pasting of stickers outside incorrect addresses, it needs to be remembered that the MCG is only assisting the district administration and health department for this objective. We receive a quarantine list from the health department based on which we paste stickers outside people’s houses. We do not have a mechanism in place for corroborating or verifying the information. On the matter of incorrect dates, there have been several cases of a clerical error from our end which we are in the process of rectifying,” said a senior MCG official, privy to the matter.Ashish Singla, medical officer and nodal officer of the MCG for Covid-19, declined to comment on the matter. However, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “The quarantine list was provided by the health department and we have asked them to review it.JS Punia, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said that an updated quarantine list is being prepared. “We are preparing the updated quarantine list to check if there were any errors in the database regarding the name or the address of the person under quarantine and accordingly rectify it. In addition, we will also be updating the list to create a separate database of those whose quarantine period is now over and the MCG can now go to their residences and remove the stickers,” said Punia.As per MCG officials, a quarantine list from the health department is divided into four categories depending on the number of houses falling under each MCG zone. Each joint commissioner of the MCG is then tasked with the responsibility of getting their staff to paste these stickers, which are usually done by members from the sanitation, taxation, or establishment wings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-suffer-as-mcg-wrongly-pastes-home-under-quarantine-stickers/story-pxNzgFh906IBgORkPOfc7L.html
18-04-2020||City||In times of lockdown, govt school students use WhatsApp for online studies||Teachers like Avrati Agrawal, who also heads a basic education school at Nabipur in Muradnagar block, are making the most of WhatsApp to teach her students during the lockdown period. The Uttar Pradesh government has also initiated various online modes of teaching and learning to ensure that students of basic education schools do not miss out on studies.“We have created student groups and are sending them study material in audio and video formats and also as online links. With these aids, they can learn at their own pace even while staying at home. We also send them worksheets and assignments to keep them up to date with lessons. They can send us back pictures of completed assignments and we grade them and send them our feedback,” Agrawal said.She said about 40-45% students of basic education schools have at least one smartphone available in their family.“We have asked students having basic phones to visit their classmates nearby who have smartphones and then copy the assignments from them. We have cautioned them to maintain proper social distancing and to compulsorily use masks and sanitisers. The aim is to reach out to maximum number of students during this lockdown. Even if we are able to reach out to about 50% students, it would mean that much less effort when schools reopen,” she added.According to official sources, the basic education schools in UP are not likely to reopen before July.The officials of the district basic education department said they have an enrolment of about 84,000 students in Ghaziabad schools (classes 1 to 8). According to them, some 880 groups have been created on WhatsApp for sharing content and they have further connected to students and parents as well for continuing studies during the lockdown.Officials said one of the apps, ‘Diksha’, has 5,000 videos available for learning besides QR-codes for accessing e-books and e-content. The state government has also made arrangements for scheduled programmes on television and radio.“The online content and classes are now available to our students through Doordarshan (UP), radio (All India Radio) and other online apps. The state government has also decided that students of all basic education department schools will be promoted to the next class this year as their examinations were held up due to lockdown,” Brij Bhushan Chaudhary, basic education officer, said.Social activists have welcomed the move to have online teaching and learning for basic education school students. “A majority of children in these schools come from weaker sections of society. So, the government must focus on roping in IT firms so that connectivity issues that these children may face are resolved. Teachers should also be provided with more resources,” Vikrant Sharma, a social activist from Raj Nagar Extension, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-times-of-lockdown-govt-school-students-use-whatsapp-for-online-studies/story-M9Hb2gArUln3Xpejw3CtqJ.html

Her other contacts near her place of residence are also getting traced. A list is being made but we are yet to find the source of infection,” CMO added.The CMO added that before her delivery at Nandgram, the woman had also gone for consultation at a private medical college. “We have sent to isolation the doctor of the medical college for now. The doctor who took up her delivery had later assisted in one more delivery at a different hospital. So the doctor as well as the staff of the other hospital has also been sent to isolation. In all, 28 persons who came in contact with her during her treatment and otherwise have been sent to isolation so far,” CMO Dr Gupta added.A staff member of the hospital in Nandgram, where the woman delivered, said, “The woman was showing symptoms of Covid-19, but her family was reluctant in telling us her medical or travel history.

But most of us are also struggling to feed our families. I have two children, including a 10-year-old daughter, and elderly mother-in-law with no wages coming in. Anganwari workers move among masses to discharge duty, but we have no protection kits,” she adds while preparing raw food packets at the temple.After the lockdown, anganwari workers have been directed to provide ration at the doorstep of beneficiaries. These recipients are entitled to up to 1kg each of wheat flour, sugar and rice for a fortnight as readymade ‘panjiri’ is not in supply since last month. But workers say neither the administration nor any social organisation has provided them hand sanitisers or masks. “We have been directed to supply uncooked material, but bags have not been provided to us. We borrow carry bags from our neighbours and even the beneficiaries. We have no means to carry the food material to the households,” says Gurcharan Kaur, in-charge of Awa Basti that has about 40 beneficiaries.Manpreet Kaur, a worker from Amarpur Basti, said the state government should provide insurance to anganwari workers. “Most of the workers are widows and they should have a sense of security for their next of kin while discharging duty in these challenging times. Our association has decided to stay away from screening of households for suspected Covid-19 cases if anganwari workers are not provided protection kits,” she said. District programme officer Avtar Kaur said the issue of delayed salary being looked into by the state-level officials. While lauding anagwanri workers for efficiently distributing dry ration, she said the department has no provision to provide hand sanitisers and protection kits for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anganwari-workers-carry-onwork-without-salary-safety-kits-in-bathinda/story-m4SRwY8LKxkAV4XeBg0RDK.html

The state has received no money from the Centre to fight the coronavirus,” said Amarinder, in response to Harsimrat’s series of tweets in which she claimed that Punjab received funds and grains to deal with the crisis. Asking her to cross-check her facts before shooting out of her mouth, the CM said instead of using her office as a central minister to help out her own state, Harsimrat was shamelessly indulging in petty politics based on blatant falsehoods.“You should be ashamed of spreading such false propaganda on such a major issue,” said Amarinder to the Akali leader.The CM pointed out that the Rs 2,366 crore referred to by her on the GST account was Punjab’s money. Moreover, Rs 4,400 crore of the state’s money was still pending with the Centre, he added. “You couldn’t even get our own pending arrears released,” he quipped.On the 10,000 tonnes of grain claimed by Harsimrat, he said the state received only 42 tonnes of pulses so far, which was a joke given the state’s requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-money-received-from-centre-to-fight-covid-punjab-cm/story-OqbQnhITOcAdDPJjsYKnXK.html

18-04-2020||City||Lockdown leads to decline in crime, but sharp hike in online fraud||When the National Crime Records Bureau puts together statistics pertaining to crime in India in 2020, they will show a sharp decline in crimes like burglaries, robberies, chain and mobile phone snatching, carjacking, pickpocketing, etc. during the lockdown period, but a steep spike in online fraud.Obviously, with people locked up inside their homes and no movement on the streets, thieves have little opportunity to pursue their trade, but online fraudsters have become extra active and are finding new ways of cheating consumers of their hard-earned money. A Gurugram resident—a senior citizen—who lives alone and pays all her utility and credit card bills by cheque, says she constantly received calls from her telecom service provider about the non-payment of her bill. She also got messages asking her not to drop the cheque in a dropbox, but to pay online. She had no idea how to pay online and was worried that her only link to the outside world—her cellphone—might be cut off. So when she got a call reminding her about the non-payment of her cellphone bill and offering to help her make the payment online, she was quite glad and readily provided all credit card details necessary for executing the payment.She realised that she had been duped when she got a message showing a spend of ₹10,000 on her credit card and continued to get reminders from her cellphone operator about non-payment of the bill. There have also been complaints of such fraudulent calls from people claiming to be from power supply undertakings, offering consumers assistance in paying bills online, through a link specially created for easy payments. While some have fallen prey to such scams, many have escaped by exercising caution. Fraudsters mainly play on consumers’ anxieties related to the lockdown and the virus. There are thus offers of ‘guaranteed’ cures for Covid-19. There are fraudulent calls claiming to be from a bank or a credit card company, offering short-term loans on attractive rates of interest or re-scheduling of existing equated monthly instalments. The calls invariably end with the extraction of bank account details or credit card details. There are also hoax calls, selling airline tickets for a future date at throwaway prices and insurance policies covering coronavirus treatments at a very nominal rate. There are phoney offers of work from home, refunds of cancelled tickets or hotel stays, sale of groceries at throwaway prices—the list is long. I have also heard of e-mails from a ‘relative’ or a ‘friend’ said to be down with Covid-19 and needing money urgently for treatment. Another trick is to promise, through e-mails, a huge cash prize if you answer questions pertaining to Covid-19.In all of them, the attempt is to withdraw money from consumers’ bank accounts or mobile wallets or credit cards through vishing or links sent through text messages or e-mails.A friend told me that she got two calls from someone claiming to be from her telecom service provider, offering to help her get a better and cheaper tariff plan. The first time she got the call, she said she was not interested. The second time, she fell for it and agreed to have the plan changed. However, when she was told that she had to confirm her identity and was asked for her date of birth, alarm bells rang and she disconnected. These are difficult times and consumers must exercise utmost caution, whether answering a call, an email or a text message. Utilities and banks have been warning consumers that they never ask for their bank/credit card details, date of birth or OTP number. This is a warning that consumers must remember at all times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-leads-to-decline-in-crime-but-sharp-hike-in-online-fraud/story-BBF4RNJJNjFLoYG74sHxgM.html

Besides, the 16th floor of the NDMC headquarters has been sealed as the 56-year-old engineer’s office was on that floor, officials said. According to the officials in the NDMC, the engineer had complained of “breathlessness” on Wednesday and was taken to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital from the NDMC headquarters. The officials said the engineer, who is diabetic and has high blood pressure, has no history of foreign travel. “He had no history of foreign travel. But as a senior engineer, he was responsible for the maintenance of NDMC’s Charak Palika Hospital in Moti Bagh. This is a Covid-19 screening centre and at least one positive case has emerged from here. Besides, he also frequently went to NDMC’s Bakkarwala flats in west Delhi which have been turned into isolation centres for suspected Covid-19 patients,” an NDMC officer said.Another NDMC official said that the engineer had attended several meetings as he was unaware of the suspected transmission. The 16th floor of the headquarters has at least 10 offices of the engineering department of the civic agency. Assistant press and information officer of NDMC, Om Prakash, said, “One of our engineers has tested positive for Covid-19. Contact tracing as per protocol is being done and necessary action would be taken. The NDMC is disinfecting his office and entire building.”This is the first case of an employee working at the NDMC headquarters testing positive for Covid-19, the officials said. On Thursday, the state government had sealed the Chandni Mahal police station after two constables, who lived inside the station, tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ndmc-disinfects-its-parliament-street-headquarters-as-engineer-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-JZtfbAtIbGGYQtIxbE9lJK.html

Before allowing vendors to move in the area, thermal scanning is done to detect fever and it is being ensured that the vendors wear face masks and gloves while selling vegetables.Councillor of ward number 82, Bhalla said earlier he used to conduct screening of only those residents and officials, who used to visit his office. But, now, after district mandi officer (DMO) Jasbir Kaur and other police officials, who were deputed in the mandi, have tested corona positive, they initiated thermal screening of the vendors from Saturday, as vendors get supply from the market only and they had also been visiting the market in the past. He has also provided coverall suits to his office staff, who conduct screening. Bhalla said no vendor was being allowed to sell vegetables without wearing a face mask and gloves and he appealed to residents to maintain social distancing while purchasing vegetables and fruits from vendors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-ward-82-councillor-initiates-screening-of-street-vendors/story-t7Lc2H2yOxaU4Dwo7ArclK.html
18-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 lockdown: Rule with a tender touch, not iron hand||The experience of the lockdown has been mixed. While its extension was warranted to arrest the spread of Covid-19, now it needs to be executed with lessons learnt in the last few weeks. It is fine for the law enforcing authorities to be strict, but people’s problems too need to be resolved with sincerity.It is not easy to sit at home, even though one retired as a Colonel from the Army years ago. Inactivity and lack of outdoor exercise take their toll. Think of those who have been laid off, lost their jobs, and those whose salaries have been slashed by over 30%. Most of all, the heart goes out to the millions of daily wagers in the country who are without work today. Most of them are without a roof over their heads, at the mercy of others for food and shelter. Where is their dignity and self-respect? They are missing their families and parents, possibly living hundreds of kilometers away, who could also be suffering .That is why many of them are protesting, earlier at Surat, and now in Mumbai’s Bandra. They want to go home to be with their families, and old parents, to look after them. Their anxiety is understandable.Taking care of daily wagersThis is why I feel the lockdown should be imposed carefully. It should be humane. These daily wagers should have been taken care of in a much better way. Most of them have migrated to the metropolises from smaller towns and villages. They do not have ration cards where they work, so they are deprived of government welfare schemes like free ration or monetary help.The Delhi government made a sincere effort to house them centrally at a number of facilities, giving them regular food. Kerala also looked after its people well, and arrested the infection. Why couldn’t Maharashtra do it? Why were these poor people sleeping on the bridge/open areas without regular food or water?The rich and the advantaged are the ones who have brought coronavirus to India from abroad because of which the poor are getting infected.Yes, these are the disadvantaged communities that have helped the rich become wealthier by building their properties and working in their industries.Aren’t they then entitled to a dignified life?From canvassing to door-to-door feedingRemember election time, when every MP and MLA candidate makes it a point to visit each poor man’s house with folded hands for votes? The whole party machinery is activated, with cadres and local leaders reaching out to each and every family in their constituency, making tall promises for their welfare. Now, in a lockdown, with the poor going hungry, where are those leaders? Why can’t they visit each house now with the same gusto and ensure the welfare of their people? Why can’t they ensure that a basic minimum amount is given even to those who do not possess the ration card of the place they work in? Why can’t they reach out to the families of the migrants in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar and assure them that their sons and daughters are in safe hands?Yes, the government has to do more. It has to ensure the mental and physical health of people, particularly of the migrants and daily wagers. It is not the iron hand, but a warm heart which will make the extended lockdown a success.We the people also need to be responsible citizens. Let each one of us adopt a poor family in our lane, street, locality, and take care of them during the lockdown. Let’s share our blessings and emerge as better persons. The nation then is bound to win.The writer is a star blood donor, and at present the convenor, INTACH, Ambala Chapter.

18-04-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Siberian specks in a PGI sky||How about rare birds delivered at the proverbial doorstep of a householder? Yes, to none else but the Covid-19 curfew can be attributed the credit for an astounding avian sighting. Bird watchers cooped up in their balconies have maintained a hawkish eye on surrounding flora and the skies above while seeking to alleviate curfew boredom. One of them grabbed a fleeting opportunity to photograph the cryptic passage through our lives of rare Black storks from the Siberian Palearctic.It so happened that Upendra Goswami was sipping evening tea in his balcony at Chandigarh’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) residential quarters last Sunday when he noticed four to five storks coming in from the city’s south-east and circling high above amid the soars of local Black kites. They were specks but his keen eye had gleaned a novelty. He fetched his long lens and captured the storks before they took a graceful glide to the north-west horizon where nestle Shivalik check dams.Very few of these storks wintering in India halt in the tricity’s adjoining wetlands. They halt briefly before migrating to western/central India in early winter or while journeying back to Siberia as the Indian spring’s first sparks singe their Palearctic wings. Over the decades, the tricity’s well-heeled and fast-wheeled covey of birders has notched up less than a dozen sightings from Morni hills, Chakki Modh, Kaushalaya/Siswan dams etc. Goswami’s photographs are a first in that they capture a tricity flyover by these rare birds. His unique capture elevated Covid-19 balcony birding to an entirely different pursuit, distinct from the staple curfewed fare of native sunbirds, parakeets and hornbills photographed while making merry in our untended gardens!Were Covid-19 not upon us like the most horrific of sci-fi nightmares, some birders would have ventured out of the tricity to birding hotspots and trudged knee deep through marshes. Photographers staying put at home would not have kept their eyes peeled outwards while sipping balcony tea, presumably in deference to the routine remonstrations of their better halves! So, there was a good chance that had normal times prevailed birders would have missed spotting the flyover of last Sunday’s storks over urban density.To lend a life story to the fleeting black specks or put in another way, those blessed migrants not needing curfew passes to head home, I consulted Gopinathan Maheswaran, a scientist with the Zoological Survey of India. He authored a research paper, Black Stork Odyssey, with Czech ornithologists, Miroslav Bobek, Lubomir Peske and Frantisek Pojer. They assessed migration based on satellite tracking of storks under the project, New Odyssey. An assessment by other Indian ornithologists regards the species as “an uncommon, wary, winter and passage migrant to India” and sounds an alert: “The wintering population of storks in India reduced alarmingly.”“The Black storks that visit India mostly come from Siberia and Mongolia. The storks that visit western/northern India come from Siberia while storks that visit eastern India come from Mongolia. I strongly believe that the storks that visit Chandigarh region should belong to the Siberian population, which breeds there in such regions as the Ob river,” Maheswaran told this writer.I put to Maheswaran questions on possible routes storks take from the Chandigarh region, estimated distances they fly and days taken to reach Siberia. “If these storks sighted over Chandigarh follow the same route taken by storks earlier (as revealed through satellite telemetry studies), they might have crossed Pakistan, Afghanistan, part of South-west China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and then to Siberia. These storks on an average travel 4,000-5,000 km one way and it takes roughly 15-20 days; it clearly shows that they stop in between and that is how a few storks were sighted in Chandigarh,” explained Maheswaran.A perilous passage lies ahead for our storks, who passed us by like stoic, aerial marathoners on a Lindbergh odyssey. Satellite tracking revealed that storks were shotgunned while flying over or halting in Pakistan, POK and Afghanisthan. For example, a satellite-tagged stork christened, ‘Katerina’, was hunted in the Indus Valley near Nanga Parbat while on a brief halt after having flown over the mighty Karakorams, ‘Petr’ was likely shot in the Afghan Hindukush and ‘Altynai’ on the Indus river.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-siberian-specks-in-a-pgi-sky/story-YdAbXuAe6ze2bagcRXefiP.html

All I wanted was to take care of my children, give them clean food, hot water, maintain their hygiene and leave the rest to God,” said the 32-year-old mother.Throughout the isolation period, the girls’ father was in a different hospital tending to his dad, who had initially tested positive for the disease.Now both cured and home, the girls had contracted coronavirus from their grandfather, who had returned from Saudi Arabia in March. Except the three, no other family members have contracted the infection.Zahra, a homemaker from uptown Srinagar, said the news of the three testing positive devastated the whole family. “It is now we know that people can recover as well, but three weeks ago we knew the disease was nothing but fatal,” she said.The 21 days of quarantine with her daughters in the hospital was a life-changing experience for Zahra. Though in same room, she kept distance from her children, wore protective suit day and night, and maintained constant hygiene. “My children would ask me to hug them, sleep beside them, but I would tell them that I was sick and needed to avoid contact. The younger one was difficult to pacify at times,” she recollected, adding that she would weep at times, but hide it from the kids.The girls’ tests came negative for fifth times and were discharged on April 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-in-kashmir-mother-stuck-by-minor-daughters-side-till-recovery/story-ZF7lXYXD4x09oaoYKQCJ1M.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||State asks Muslim community to not gather for prayers, celebrations during Ramzan||The Maharashtra government on Saturday asked the Muslim community to not come out for prayers, iftar and other festivities during the holy month of Ramzan. It has asked the community members to strictly follow the lockdown guidelines and social distancing rules by performing all the religious practices at home.Following directives from union minority affairs ministry, Jayashree Mukherjee, additional chief secretary of state minority affairs department issued the instructions on Saturday.“The holy month of Ramzan is starting shortly. During this month, Muslims in large number gather for daily prayers at mosques and at other public places. They also come together for iftar and taraweeh (special evening prayers). However, considering the present situation, such large gatherings are likely to help in spreading Covid-19. This ultimately may lead to large number of deaths. It is in the interest of the Muslim brothers,” states the order.Muslims are expected to follow all the lockdown restrictions issued by the state government even during the Ramzan. They must not gather for daily prayers, iftar, taraweeh and other religious practices at mosques, building terraces, open grounds etc. They must perform daily prayers, taraweeh and have iftar at home only, as all the religious gatherings have been prohibited,” it says further.The state government has also asked all the divisional commissioners to create awareness in the community by taking help of religious heads, social activists, political leaders and NGOs.State minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said that they are trying to create awareness among the people so that lockdown rules can be strictly followed during Ramzan month as well. “There is already a sentiment in the community that the restrictions should be followed. Many religious heads have also issued appeals on their own level asking the community to offer namaz and other practices at home. We are also trying to create awareness in this regard,” Malik said.Muslim scholars have also welcomed the move. Maulana Mehmood Dariyabadi, general secretary, All India Ulema Council said, “It’s a good initiative. We have already issued an appeal to the community to maintain social distancing and not to gather for prayers, iftar and taraweeh at mosques. People can fast and perform prayers at home. There is no need to come out. I believe all the sects of the community are on same page in this regard.” The council is an association of religious scholars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-asks-muslim-community-to-not-gather-for-prayers-celebrations-during-ramzan/story-umr5lztDaULixeAUy3bocN.html

Leaders of different associations rued that local traders have stored a large number of products before the lockdown and are expecting to sell the products after the lockdown period was over. They said, “As the local traders are already reeling under losses, the crisis for them will deepen further as the demand for the products will decrease with the supply of non-essential products by e-commerce companies during the lockdown period. This step will also defeat the purpose of the ‘Make In India’ initiative of the Union government.” President of the Punjab Chapter of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) Harkesh Mittal said, “If e-commerce companies started the sale of non-essential goods, then the local trade industry would witness its impact in the coming time.”Mittal said the CAIT will also take up the matter with the Union government and demand withdrawal of the decision.President of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal Arvinder Singh Makkar said apart from impacting the trade industry adversely, the decision might also contribute to the spread of the deadly virus.A Delhi incident, wherein a pizza delivery boy, was found corona positive and 72 families had to be quarantined is a recent example.YAD SEEKS PACKAGE FOR MIDDLE CLASS, TRADERSDistrict resident of the Youth Akali Dal (YAD) Gurdeep Singh Gosha regretted that the state government had failed to announce a package for the middle class and traders.Gosha demanded the government should announce a relief package for electricity bills, school fees, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-traders-oppose-decision-allowing-e-commerce-companies-to-supply-non-essential-goods/story-re3HJhfVqCjmZyf2gDvpmO.html

Happiness Class is a new and unique curriculum that was launched by the state government in 2018 to develop self-awareness and mindfulness among students. The First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump had also attended a session at a government school earlier this year.“At a time when there is so much stress and anxiety around Covid-19, the Happiness Class make us more positive. From the laughter activity to mindfulness, our parents participate in these activities with us and this makes it more fun. Till now, we were being told about the activities over the phone. The online lessons will be a step closer to the classroom experience,” Jha said.His mother, Rinku Devi, said, “We have been doing all the activities recommended in the Happiness Class with our son, but it will definitely be better when we will be able to see the teachers while performing the activities. The time chosen for the classes (4pm) is also convenient because we are generally done with our household chores by then.”Since the Covid-19 lockdown, the Delhi government has used multiple remote-learning measures, including video conferences, automated text messages and pre-recorded voice calls, to ensure there is no academic loss during the pandemic. Teachers have also been disseminating learning material over WhatsApp.While launching the classes during the third live session of “Parenting in the time of Corona”, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the classes would help in dealing with present times. “The current situation is something that has not been witnessed ever by our parents or grandparents. Our goal is to sail through these times by shredding our anxiety and worries,” he said.“We need to bring our families together and stay united. Practising mindfulness together can be one such activity which would help all of us to ease our anxieties.”Bhavna Sawnani, a mentor teacher who has been working on the Happiness Curriculum, said, “We will give instructions in a simplified manner so that everybody can follow. The sessions will start and end with mindfulness. There will be an activity or a storytelling session everyday with questions which will make participants think about traits like respect, gratitude, care, and compassion among other things.” The government has also launched a Happiness Blog which lists out the syllabus and content of their flagship Happiness Curriculum. A senior official in the education department said they plan to introduce an option for live feedback in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-kicks-off-online-happiness-classes-for-students-parents/story-fqegWXuSvbTUkUFohBvLUN.html

She was discharged from the isolation ward of Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital (KCGMCH) after her second consecutive report turned out negative.After being welcomed with flowers in her locality, which was sealed soon after she was tested positive, she said. “I couldn’t have won this battle without the support of doctors, my friends and family.”In her message to the people, she advised not to worry even in the event of contracting the infection and fight it with positive thinking. “There is no need to worry about coronavirus, and people should come to the hospital as soon as they develop the symptoms,” she added.She urged them to follow the government’s guidelines and remain inside their homes during the lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.However, the source of her infection is yet to be traced. Meenu, along with a woman doctor and a staff nurse, were reportedly posted in the general ward of KCGMCH where Karnal’s first Covid-19 patient Gian Chand (58) was admitted between March 25 and April 1.Meenu’s recovery has been considered as a big achievement for the doctors of KCGMCH as now there is no coronaviurs patient in the district and out of the six patients, five have recovered and one had died earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cured-karnal-nurse-gets-rousing-welcome-at-home/story-ObGd3wVhuSmLsS99aX42oI.html
18-04-2020||City||Cluster schools, block offices to get new computers in Ludhiana||In an initiative taken up by Punjab government, 1,500 cluster schools and 228 block education offices across the state will be provided new computers with latest technology and printers in the next three months. Cluster schools are the centres of excellence (within each school grouping) responsible for dissemination of information to the district education office.TENDERS FLOATEDThe government’s move will prove beneficial at the cluster as well as the block level as the equipment they have are more than 10-year-old. Tenders have been floated by the Punjab Information and Communication Technology Education Society (PICTES) and in the coming days, the selected agency will deliver the equipment to the respective schools and offices.Each cluster primary school will get one computer and one printer, while block offices will get two computers and two printers each. In Ludhiana, there are 112 cluster primary schools and 19 block offices that will get the new equipment.At the cluster level, the head teacher and other staff handle various responsibilities regarding gathering of information about the enrolment in schools, evaluation of answer sheets, marking duties to staff and other works.As per sources, there was a dire need of providing computers and printers at the cluster level as a lot of data is first collected and then sent to the block offices. A cluster level employee, requesting anonymity, said, “We have two computers and both of them freeze several times resulting into a delay in the works.” “Under our cluster, there are 18 schools and whenever we are instructed to send the data, we face issues as the system either get slow or shut down. We require new systems to send the information to the schools quickly,” he said.At the block level, a block primary education officer (BPEO) and his/her staff are responsible to send the consolidated information of schools related to the attendance of students, teachers and head teachers to the district education office. Ludhiana-1 BPEO Tripta Rani said, “We had received computers from a high school years ago but they are non-functional now. We have arranged laptops and computers at our own level to send the required data to the district authorities.”DELIVERY IN 3 MONTHSConfirming the details, PICTES assistant manager (hardware) Yadwinder Singh said, “Tenders have been floated and the selected agency will deliver the equipment within next three months to the cluster schools and block offices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cluster-schools-block-offices-to-get-new-computers-in-ludhiana/story-NT7MTJiiafEmCn4OdAWGvJ.html

Few zoonotic diseases are also covered under this medicine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mc-ngos-commence-deworming-of-stray-dogs-in-ludhian/story-VzdepOSTF2WtJobH9D4MiK.html

18-04-2020||Chandigarh||During a lockdown, aerobics can be your best bet||About two years ago, after suspecting that my blood pressure was higher than normal I went to the doctor to have it checked. As expected, he gave me a prescription to control it, advising that exercise such as brisk walking will also work like medicine.Apart from adhering to the daily intake of the prescribed dose, I made it a routine to follow a combo of jogging-cum-walking for about 30 minutes daily. That helped, though I could not completely shed the dependency on medicine.I was eager to try various yogic/breathing exercises to control my blood pressure. Many videos and television programmes, particularly the one by Baba Ramdev, inspired me. I left jogging and started practising anulom vilom and kapalbhati (both breathing exercises).Instead of any perceptible benefit, to my dismay, the blood pressure level was elevated. When I talked about it to some friends, including a yoga teacher, all of them found fault with me and advised me to do it slowly, exercising patience. I felt discouraged and resumed my combo.However, recently, after the coronavirus menace forced everyone to remain confined within the four walls of their homes, I was deprived of my routine of jogging-cum-walking. Once again, the thought of practising anulom vilom and kapalbhati, came to my mind.This time, more determined to perfect the art of breathing, I watched all the videos once again and then switched to TV channels to take a good look at the yoga guru doing all sorts of exercises.Then, I started devoting my early mornings to yoga; performing the exercises with caution and precision. Alas! The outcome, once again, was rather discouraging. Soon I was desperately searching for an alternative.We had already exhausted the stock of shuttles and hence no game of badminton with my son was possible; the market was shut because of the curfew. But as you know, necessity is the mother of invention. I looked at the basketball ring that was fixed on the wall; then searched for the ball and luckily found and pumped some more air to get the desired pressure. Then, I started playing two games a day, one each in the morning and evening, managing to throw the ball in the basket at least 50 times. To account for the wear and tear of my joints in this age of 63 plus, I would pedal the stationary bicycle for about 20 minutes two times a day.The scheme worked; I felt very light and fresh and knew that my arteries and veins benefited from these aerobic exercises.My blood pressure levels too stabilised and the medicine dosage was reduced. Really, there is no dearth of alternatives provided you have the will to find the one.gursharansinghpau@gmail.comThe author is professor and former dean of postgraduate studies Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.

18-04-2020||Education||IIT Kharagpur builds disinfection tunnel for campus visitors in coronavirus time||The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur has set up a disinfection tunnel for sanitizing visitors to the campus during the ongoing lockdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, an official said on Saturday.The tunnel has been installed at the sole entry point of the campus for essential services staff such those involved in cleaning operations and once the lockdown is lifted, it can be of use to screen visitors until the threat of COVID-19 is gone, he said.While passing through the tunnel, a visitor is sprayed with a disinfectant solution coming out of a high-pressure air compressor.The system to automate the process of disinfecting visitors was developed by Prof Mihir Sarangi, Associate Professor Mechanical Engineering, along with faculty and staff members from various departments.“The output material is like mist and highly effective as it covers a larger surface area unlike liquid disinfectant.Also, it does not need any drainage,” Sarangi said, This mechanism is, however, a supplement for hand washing or the need to wear face masks in public. Hand wash stations have been placed just outside the disinfection tunnel, he said.The product prototype has been built indigenously at the IIT Kharagpur in less than a week while the campus is under lockdown.The prototype is now fully operational at IIT Kharagpur and is used for all people entering the campus.The commercial model for the product has been estimated to be available for Rs 4 Lakh.IIT KGP Director Prof Virendra K Tewari said such technologies can be quickly built and employed at any location which has a daily influx of essential service providers. “Our campus is like a mini township which, in the current situation, requires automation of hygiene and safety protocols for essential service providers who are coming out of their homes every day to serve at the campus and also the campus community who are interacting with these visitors,” he said.Tewari said more such innovations to assist Indias fight against COVID-19 are underway.

The police, however, reached the spot following a tip-off and cleared the area.While the arhtiyas and their staff managed to flee the spot, police booked four persons who were buying vegetables from the mandi and impounded their vehicles. The four have been booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.To reduce the rush at the mandi, the district administration has earlier decided to allow arhtiyas to sell the produce only to enlisted ward vendors and that too only between 4am and 10pm. However on Friday, the arhtiyas reportedly also sold vegetables to the street vendors. Ludhiana sabzi mandi arhtiya association has condemned the incident and sought strict action against the arhtiyas who were operating illegally to earn profits in the time of this crisis.Association president Gurkamal Singh said, “The arhtiyas are putting the lives of vendors at risk by running the market illegally. Strict action should be taken against them.” He added that thermal scanners should be put up at the entry point of the mandi and proper sanitising work must be carried out from time to time.Investigating officer ASI Raj Kumar said that the police had received a tip-off following which they conducted a raid at the spot. “No arhtiya or staff was found at the spot but police have booked four buyers who were carrying the vegetables to their vehicles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahrtiyas-choose-profit-over-life-operate-mandi-illegally-four-booked/story-e6BbQ19gBqc90EEZR4E6FJ.html

We will send the schools concerned another reminder, if required. Then we will think about future action with the power vested on us,” he said.The official refused to name the schools saying it would not be proper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/wb-govt-to-issue-reminders-to-schools-that-hiked-fees-in-covid-19-time/story-DKX3Dq7qoRhu4iAKxC3zTP.html
18-04-2020||Chandigarh||J&K’s village of mutes silently braces itself against Covid-19||Nestled in the lap of the Himalayas is Dhadkai, a village comprising of mostly deaf and mute people. As the world buckles under the onslaught of the novel coronavirus these residents have braced themselves to combat the deadly infection.The residents of this silent village, 260km north of Jammu, are as aware of the virus as their counterparts in other parts of the world and are taking all precautions to contain the spread of the virus besides adhering to the lockdown norms.Gandoh sub-divisional magistrate Dr Pritam Lal Thappa said, “A local teacher is raising awareness about the disease among residents through sign language. Some trained officials from the social welfare department have already spoken to the villagers once, another round will be conducted on Sunday.”Local teachers and officials have been briefing villagers about the importance of social distancing, maintaining personal hygiene and what one should do in case they experience flu-like symptoms.Bhalessa block development committee chairperson Mohammad Hanief, 60, has five deaf and mute children. He says, “Some residents may be deaf and mute but they are sharper than us. They are following lockdown norms and are not allowing outsiders to enter the village. They also maintain social distancing and can be seen discussing precautions in sign language.”“The administration has provided sanitisers and masks to villagers and has been raising awareness among the villagers about dos and don’ts,” he says.FIRST CASE OF DEAFNESS, MUTISM DETECTED IN 1901The first case of deafness and mutism was detected in 1901 and by 1990, the village had 46 such cases that rose to 120 over the years. Today, the village has 88 deaf and mute people.The village has a population around 5,000 people and two panchayats.NO SPECIAL SCHOOLSThe chairperson says, “It is unfortunate that the government has not opened any special school for such children.Dhadkai B village sarpanch Haji Mohammad Hanief said, “My panchayat has 55 families with deaf and mute members. However, they all know the infection spreads through coughing and sneezing.”35-year-old Ghulam Mohammad says, “Two of my brothers, Munir Ahmad and Mohammad Iqbal, are deaf and dumb but they also know about this fatal infection and keep asking me about latest updates.”“They know that this is a fatal infection that has already taken a heavy toll on human lives across the world. In fact, they keep tabs on infected areas in J&K,” said Mohammad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-s-village-of-mutes-silently-braces-itself-against-covid-19/story-OYIhKZ0NuBLMSYGNRKo1IK.html
18-04-2020||Patna||Khaini stays out of list of banned tobacco products in Bihar||The recent curbs on consumption of tobacco products, excluding khaini (chewing tobacco), at public places, has raised doubts on the efficacy of Bihar government’s recent order in a bid to prohibit people from spitting, which spreads novel coronavirus (Covid-19).In Bihar, 20.4% of adults take khaini, while 4.2% smoke bidi. Together, they are the two most commonly used tobacco products in Bihar, according to the latest Global Audit Tobacco Survey (GATS-II) survey (2016-17), released in May 2018.It is an accepted fact that khaini chewers spit more. Bihar has, however, kept khaini out of the ambit of the ban.Patna was the latest among 25 districts out of Bihar’s 38 to extend the ban on tobacco at public places on Friday.“Implementation of the ban has to be effected by respective district administrations. It is not the job of the health department,” said health minister Mangal Pandey.“Khaini being pure tobacco is outside the purview of food safety and standard act of India. If you mix tobacco with something edible, like gutka, then it can be banned. I know it’s a bit counter intuitive but that’s the law,” said principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar.Sources said, decision not to ban khaini is more “of a political nature than anything else.”Bihar has been proactive to issue orders banning liquor, pan masala and other tobacco products, but is silent on banning khaini. The state has, however, failed in implementation of the several ban orders, said a pan shop owner, an income tax payee, who requested anonymity. “Like liquor, pan masala and tobacco products continue to be sold through the vegetable vendor channel, despite the nationwide lockdown,” he said. “A particular brand of pan masala, which costs Rs 750 for a pack of 50 small sachets, is being sold at Rs 1,100. It is absolutely ridiculous if the government thinks it can prohibit people from spitting by banning tobacco products, which are sold with impunity,” he added.As per the April 13 order, a person could be fined Rs 200 and/or imprisoned up to six months if s/he was found to be consuming tobacco, including cigarette, bidi, gutka, pan masala, or tobacco at public places, which included roads, government and private offices, health facilities, educational institutions, police stations. The GATS-II report also said that 23.5% of adults in Bihar use smokeless tobacco and 43.4% of men, 6.9% of women and 25.9% of all adults either smoke tobacco and/or use smokeless tobacco.“Consumption and use of tobacco poses threat to public health... Spitting can cause serious diseases like coronavirus, encephalitis, tuberculosis, swine flu, etc., as it induces secretion of saliva in the mouth,” said Bihar’s principal secretary (health), Sanjay Kumar.“In terms of number, 2.5 crore population of Bihar in the age bracket of 15-49 years consume tobacco in different forms,” he added.“As per the GATS II report, Bihar’s overall adult tobacco had reduced from 53.5% to 25.9%, a significant reduction by more than 50%. However, consumption of smokeless tobacco was still very high, with 23.5% adults out of the 25.9% who consume tobacco, indulging in chewing different forms of tobacco, which is major cause of spitting in public that leads to spread of Covid-19,” said Deepak Mishra, executive director of Socio Economic and Educational Development Society (SEEDS), which is also the technical support partner of state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/khaini-stays-out-of-list-of-banned-tobacco-products-in-bihar/story-GuLQApL7ouIc1z50i8gFAM.html

18-04-2020||City||Working in the times of pandemic:Government should provide insurance cover to vegetable, fruit vendors, says Ludhiana wholesaler||With a big share of public service workers getting covered under a health insurance cover, vendors who are living hand to mouth should also be covered by the government, said Rakesh Bhatia, a fruit wholesaler based in vegetable market, Jalandhar Bypass. “Similar to the government staff such as health workers and sanitation staff, vegetable and fruit sellers, including wholesalers and vendors, are also playing an important role amid the ongoing lockdown. As vendors come in contact with a large number of people on regular basis, the government should also take responsibility of their health,” he said.Bhatia, who along with his 71-year-old father Vijay Kumar Bhatia used to operate the wholesale shop, said he has not let his father come to work since the lockdown was imposed due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. The trader also says that as elderly people are at more risk of the virus’ outbreak, his father stays at home, while he visits the vegetable market from 7am to 8am daily. “I largely stay at home as chances of getting infected in the vegetable market are extremely high,” he said.43-year-old Bhatia, who is a resident of Civil Lines, also said that some of the wholesalers have decided not to operate their business for this week. The wholesalers’ move comes after assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kumar Kohli who was posted in the vegetable market tested positive for coronavirus and passed away on Saturday.‘MISUSE OF PASSES A CAUSE OF WORRY’Talking about his business nowadays, Bhatia said they suffered huge losses due to the “misuse’ of ward-wise pass system started by the district administration. “We have suffered huge losses since the lockdown was imposed. I have personally suffered a loss of Rs 4 lakh as not many people are purchasing fruits these days,” he said. The news of the ACP testing positive made us close down our business for sometime as our priority is survival and not money, he said.Besides running a wholesale business, the Ludhiana resident also runs a non-governmental organisation (NGO) ‘Waheguru Blood Seva’. Earlier this week, they conducted a blood donation camp at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and collected 62 units of blood. “The camp was held amid all the preventive measures against the infection,” he said. On being asked what he does during his spare time, the city-based trader said he watches Ramayana and Mahabharata with his family and plays carom with his two children to beat the lockdown blues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-in-the-times-of-pandemic-government-should-provide-insurance-cover-to-vegetable-fruit-vendors-says-ludhiana-wholesaler/story-5nq85KWvdZ21C1a4EjinHK.html

The application was developed in response to numerous unverified reports on social media of animals and birds being spotted in human settlements. The app lets people upload past as well as real-time records of such incidents on one platform.“The idea is to understand and document human-wildlife interface during the lockdown. Though it is an extremely difficult period due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the opportunity of such a study has also never arisen in the past,” said Dr Dhananjai Mohan, director, WII. “While our forest staff is already on field as part of essential services and can document changes in the wild, we request citizens to adhere to social distancing norms and not step out or violate lockdown rules for their submissions,” he added. Currently available for only Android phones, the app has options to upload an existing image or take a picture, add the name of the species and what the animal, bird or reptile is called in their regional language and the global positioning system will collect the coordinates. WII will then study the data’s authenticity and add it to their records.After the lockdown is lifted, the wildlife body plans to share this data with state governments and also publish detailed state-specific and national reports.The app will be made available on Google Playstore next week and is currently available at https://wii.gov.in/lockdown_wildlife_tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/now-an-app-to-record-wildlife-movement-during-lockdown/story-u0gIL6OsQyIT69oB3QNLpJ.html

I have asked officials to inquire into the matter and submit a report to take further action,” Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson of Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights told PTI.  The Rajasthan government had launched a sanitary pads distribution scheme among school-going girls of the state in respective schools and aaganwadi centres to promote menstrual hygiene. Experts said the problem has risen in almost all districts of the state due to lockdown and poses a risk of infection among girls. “The menstrual hygiene is a big issue and can be ensured if the state government releases directions in this regard to district collectors. The problems is being faced in almost all districts of the state and girls are being forced to use clothes pieces,” said Dharamveer Yadav, the state program manager, Child Rights and You (CRY).  He said a few district collectors have issued directions to the Education Department to release the stock under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) so that the sanitary pads be delivered at door steps.  Union Minister Smriti Irani, during a video conference, has directed state authorities to ensure that sanitary pads are made available at grassroots level, he added.

18-04-2020||Chandigarh||Khattar govt appeasing e-commerce firms at cost of small shopkeepers: Surjewala||Senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala on Saturday accused the BJP government at the Centre and in Haryana of appeasing e-commerce companies at the cost of ruining businesses and livelihoods of 10 lakh small shopkeepers in the state. He said the government is giving a monopoly to e-commerce firms in selling non-essential goods by denying the same to small shopkeepers. Addressing the media via video conference, Surjewala said the anti-trader and anti-shopkeeper decision of the BJP-JJP government should be reconsidered. He demanded protection to the small shopkeepers by permitting them to deliver goods in their local areas at the doorsteps of customers via contactless home delivery. This will help in achieving the goal of social distancing, while supporting economic revival for the country, he added. Highlighting the woes and problems of retailers, Surjewala said the stalled businesses during the lockdown has resulted in huge losses for the entire MSME sector. The shopkeepers and local traders have made heavy investments in their businesses and goods worth lakhs of crores were lying in their shops and godowns. Despite the closure of the business, the shopkeepers are paying their rents, fixed electricity bills on commercial rates, commercial taxes and heavy interest on their investments.After April 20, the e-commerce companies will be free to sell fridges, TVs, computers, mobiles, textiles, jewellery, and other non essential goods, but the shopkeeper’s business has been stalled until May 3, Surjewala said.Surjewala asked the Khattar government to answer if it would waive off shopkeepers’ electricity bills, commercial taxes and give them special exemption in GST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-govt-appeasing-e-commerce-firms-at-cost-of-small-shopkeepers-surjewala/story-F7PZggmvIQTwgQoLAFmKZN.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||Lockdown rent woes for students living in PGs and rented accommodation||As a result of the ongoing lockdown, students living in rented accommodation and PGs are struggling to pay rent. Even though the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) has issued an order according to which landlords cannot demand rent from students, workers and migrant labourers for a month. The order by MHA states, “Where ever the workers, including the migrants, are living in rented accommodation, the landlords of those properties shall not demand payment of rent for the period of one month.”The order also states, “If any landlord is forcing labourers and students to vacate their premises, they will be liable for action under the Act.” Still, students are being asked to pay rent, even for rooms that are presently unoccupied as students are stuck in other places. Mayank Yadav, a student of Delhi University, says, “I have paid the rent for the month of April. I initially requested my landlord to suspend the rent for a month but they did not. Making an issue about this will just get me kicked out from here and I cannot afford this right now. I cannot travel back to my home town in Uttar Pradesh. My parents have been sending money for my rent and expenses, but in this time of crisis, it is difficult for them as well to manage everything on time.”Chon Beno, a student preparing for UPSC in Delhi, says, “I have been asked to pay the rent for April and I have paid it. Nothing in my PG has changed since the lockdown and it’s the same. We all have been asked for the rent. My roommates might have asked for suspension of rent or reduction in the amount but we have all paid the full amount .”Many who were not in Delhi during the lockdown are also being asked by their landlords to pay the rent for the unoccupied room. Surjkanta Saikhom, student of Delhi University’s Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, who is in Manipur presently, says, “Even when I got back home they called me twice a day for the rent. Though I left Delhi on 20th March and I paid the rent on March 28th. None of us are staying there and still we are being hounded to pay the rent.”Follow HT Life&Style for more updates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lockdown-rent-woes-for-students-living-in-pgs-and-rented-accommodation/story-gQkhRF0GKsuDgf8sKkAv3I.html

The second phase of lockdown ends on May 3.Bihar State Educational Infrastructure Development Corporation (BSEIDC), which caries out construction work for schools, colleges and universities across the state, will also start working on projects in different parts from April 20. This will help create employment and develop necessary infrastructure.The functioning of the directorates will mean that the department will get fully functional down the line even as school teachers, appointed through the panchayati raj system since 2006, remain on strike for the last two months.Terming the appeal from education minister, Krishna Nandan Verma, to the teachers to join work as a ‘cruel joke’, they have been demanding talks with the government on their demands and withdrawal of punitive action against them. However, the government does not seem to be in a mood to hold talks at this time, when the state is grappling with the pandemic.Schools and colleges are unlikely to open in near future. The government has already promoted all the students of class 1-11. The class 10 board exams have already been completed in the state and the evaluation will be completed once the lockdown period ends, while class 12 results were announced before the lockdown was implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-education-dept-to-resume-work-from-april-20/story-SU9tGVHazkYkLNGWHgCBwN.html

18-04-2020||Real||Covid-19 update: Bengal real estate body seeks govt help to bring labourers back at construction sites||A real estate developers’ association in West Bengal has sought permission from the state government to bring labourers back at the project sites after the Centre allowed to resume construction works with some restrictions during the ongoing lockdown, an official said on Saturday.The industry body urged the state government to allow movement of workers from their home towns and native villages after the Centre had given its nod to restart construction activities from April 20 on those projects where labourers are already available at the sites.“We have written to the state government seeking permission to start works at the construction sites and reopening offices in a partial and phased manner,” Credai West Bengal president Sushil Mohta told PTI.But the challenge with most of the projects has been availability of workers as many labourers hailed from districts and they left for their homes immediately after chief minister Mamata Banerjee had announced the lockdown, he said.“We have also urged the state to allow us to bring labourers back from their home districts such as Medinipur, Murshidabad, Bankura and other areas,” Mohta, also chairman of the Merlin Group, said.Citing a similar experience, National Real Estate Development Council, Maharashtra vice president Ashok Mohanani said majority of workers are migrant labourers and have returned to their native places at this time.“Reverse migration has hit the real estate sector which has resulted in a labour shortage,” he said.There are 8.5 million workers in India engaged in building and other construction activities.The guidelines issued for restarting economic activities during the lockdown “do not allow travel of labourers to construction sites”, an industry expert said. Labourers available at construction sites can commence work from April 20 in strict adherence to social distancing norms, he said.“We have committed to undertake sanitisation exercise at sites and ensure that social distancing norms are followed,” Mohta said.The industry has also sought permission to bring construction materials at the sites during the ongoing lockdown imposed to check the coronavirus outbreak, he said.Real estate sector has been passing through a challenging time due to financial crisis, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/covid-19-update-bengal-real-estate-body-seeks-govt-help-to-bring-labourers-back-at-construction-sites/story-3283ccWvc2L6OINIE2BMII.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The wedding and the coronavirus||It was to be a “sustainable wedding.” There would be no plastic, for instance. And everything was to be ethnic. The food would come from a traditional Old Delhi kitchen. Music would be provided by the Sufi qawwals from the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Out of 750 guests, a few were flying in from Germany, the groom’s country.All the venues were in Noida, where the bride lives.The reception was falling on Easter.And then the coronavirus gatecrashed, and Tanvi Misra’s wedding plans were cancelled.“Mom and Dad were heartbroken,” says Ms Misra, 29, chatting on WhatsApp from her home in Noida. Her parents were nevertheless determined to go on with the plans “but I realized that it was too risky since our guests included a lot of elderly folks and people with medical issues.”So, here she is, nursing her heart in Sector 31, while her groom, Nico Rittmann, is in faraway Hamburg where he works as a police officer. He is currently deployed in the city’s coronavirus emergency service. Ms Misra herself is pursuing a Master’s in the German city of Leipzig.For the moment the woman is trying hard not to suppress her spirits. She has a broad smile—the photos are taken through the mobile screen that connects her to this reporter. She gets up to show her framed portrait with Nico; it is placed beside the portraits of her parents and grandparents.Technically, she’s already married—they signed the legal papers late last year in a townhall in Copenhagen, Denmark. But without any friend or relative to share the joy.The April shaadi was to be the big thing, at least as suggested by Ms Mista’s ambitious plan for the festivities.She met Nico four years ago in Wustrow, a village in Germany where she was on a fellowship provided by the German government. The encounter took place in a bar. “Nico claims that he fell in love with me right there, as he heard me discussing the Rohingya crisis with a colleague who was leaving for Myanmar soon.”He moved to her pad within two weeks and the rest is history.Ms Misra flew back to India this February to prepare for the forthcoming celebrations. Nico was to arrive early this month with his family.Now her parents are aiming for the wedding ceremony in the winter, assuming that pandemic will be history by then.Despite the upheaval in her life, Ms Misra realises that disappointments caused to her by the coronavirus are too minuscule in relation to those of others, which range from job losses to starvation. “The cancellation of my wedding reception is a small inconvenience in the larger perspective,” she admits.And yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-wedding-and-the-coronavirus/story-EbayDvVkjPc3sgKDkgTSfP.html

18-04-2020||Lucknow||‘Samosa, gutka, pizza, paan’: Covid-19 helpline in UP gets these requests||It’s not yet dawn. A helpline set up after the coronavirus outbreak crackles into life. There are panic calls for essentials like medicines but some callers demand rasogullas, samosas, and even pan and gutka, admit officials. The chief minister’s helpline number 1076 gets a frantic call from Ram Ratan Pal, who suffers from high blood pressure, that his stock of medicines is exhausted. Officials manning the control room swing into action, arranging their delivery in Lucknow. In Gautam Buddh Nagar district, Shankar Singh dials the number for food essentials. The ration is delivered at his doorstep, officials say. Ram Ratan and Shankar are among the one lakh beneficiaries so far of the CM’s helpline. Uttar Pradesh’s police helpline recently got a strange call when an elderly person made an “urgent request” for rasogullas. The cop who answered the phone thought it was a prank. But when a volunteer delivered the sweets in Lucknow’s Hazratganj, it was found that the man in his 80s really needed them. He is diabetic and his blood sugar level had dipped sharply. But reports suggest that many demands may not be that urgent. Those answering the police helpline 112 have been baffled by requests for betel leaf, gutka and hot samosas (with chutney). The samosas were indeed delivered. But the man who made the call had to pay the price – he was asked to clean out a drain. Police were also not amused by a demand for pizza in Rampur, where district authorities are punishing those making such calls, reports say. Some callers have even asked for liquor. There have also been reports of house-bound children pleading with the invisible “police uncle” at the other end for chips, cakes, ice cream and pizza. Trained to enforce law and order, personnel deputed with police response vehicles (PRVs) are now also performing a new role during the nationwide lockdown. Thousands of them are engaged in providing emergency services sought through the 112 helpline, an official said. They fulfil demands for food and medicines and look into complaints about shopkeepers overcharging for essential commodities. There are 35,000 PRVs across the state. “Since the lockdown started, the PRV jawans have been working round the clock to meet the demands of people calling on the helpline number,” Additional Director General of Police Asim Arun, who is in charge of police emergency services, told PTI. Around 1,100 police personnel man the helpline phones. “There have also been calls for shifting pregnant women for delivery, and the aged and sick to hospitals. Policemen working with PRVs have helped them by arranging ambulances,” Arun says. The department has set up the infrastructure for women personnel on helpline duty to take the calls at their homes, the ADG says. The 112 helpline is also linked to fire and ambulance services and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/samosa-gutka-pizza-paan-covid-19-helpline-in-up-gets-these-requests/story-ytmLcrXTkesxblID1VtGkO.html
18-04-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand witnessing ‘war-like situation’ due to Covid-19: HC||The Jharkhand high court on Friday expressed concern over the spread of novel coronavirus infection in different parts of the state, observing that a “war like situation” has arisen.Hearing a bunch of public interest litigations (PIL) on different aspects of Covid-19 pandemic, a division bench of chief justice Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad wanted to know if the government was well prepared to deal with this situation. “Whether the government has a road map for this and sufficient man power and resources to handle the situation,” the bench questioned.It sought a detailed reply from the government by April 24, the next date for hearing.The bench asked advocate general Rajiv Ranjan to file a detailed affidavit mentioning government’s response on strict implementation of lockdown guidelines issued by the centre for Covid-19 hot spots.The bench also wanted to know the state’s preparedness to deal with the pandemic, especially in the ensuing holy month of Ramadan. It also took strong umbrage at news reports that highlighted how people were violating lockdown orders in Ranchi’s Hindpiri locality, the epicentre of Covid-19.The bench read out excerpts from a letter forwarded by one Arun Kumar Dubey on violation of lockdown orders in Hindpiri. Treating Dubey’s letter as a separate PIL, the court said that Hindpiri’s two contractors had attended a meeting of the water board at the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC), while five residents of the area fled to Lohardaga when the entire locality was sealed.“How can people come out of their houses and wander on streets when the whole area has been sealed after being declared a potential hot spot?,” the judges observed, seeking the government’s reply.Citing another news report, the court sought the government’s explanation regarding action taken against Ranchi deputy commissioner for allegedly allowing buses to transport labourers to Sahebgunj and Pakur on instructions of a minister in the state government cabinet.The court wanted to know that whether the people, who had escaped at the instance of the deputy commissioner, were traced and tested for Covid-19.Advocate general Rajiv Ranjan, however, defended the government, arguing that Hindpiri has been sealed with corrugated sheets and all 15 entry and exit points have been blocked.Ranjan said that demands made by the government from the Centre to send masks, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), testing kits, ventilators and rapid testing kits have not been complied with. The state has only 5,000 testing kits at its disposal, the advocate general said.The bench also queried with regard to the preparedness of doctors and facilities available at RIMS and other government hospitals in the state.While dealing with a PIL filed by Gulab Chandra Prajapati on the issue of cremation and burial of Covid-19 positive patients, the advocate general informed the court that a separate burial ground was identified in the city’s outskirt area of Bundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-witnessing-war-like-situation-due-to-covid-19-hc/story-U1zK9EvRlYXvojw5bKPC4O.html
18-04-2020||Bangalore||DBT not possible for unorganised sector in Karnataka: Report||Amid fears that people from the unorganised sector are running out of cash to meet their daily expenses, the Karnataka government said there was no data available for such labourers, who can be provided financial assistance under the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme.“The government does not have data of people in the unorganised sector such as drivers, farmers, domestic help and others. If we have to deposit directly into their account, we need data..,” State Labour Minister A Shivaram Hebbar told PTI.The minister said a situation borne out of the Covid-19, where the entire nation has been lockdown was never anticipated. To him, the pandemic has given an opportunity to gather information about the unorganised sector. “This Covid-19 has taught the department and the workers a lesson that we should be prepared for a situation like this. We have learnt that all the information about labourers should be available with the labour department,” Hebbar conceded.The minister opined that the the department should have had the list during the good times but nobody bothered to have it.“During the good times nobody bothered about it -- neither they (beneficiaries) asked for it, nor we thought of it.,” Hebbar said.Now that the pandemic has struck, the government is focusing only on not letting anyone starve to death. A three-level preparation has been made -- at the village level, Taluk level and the city level, the minister said. Village anganwadis have been stuffed with food items to be cooked for the needy, whereas in Taluk level, government hostels have been turned into shelters for the labourers, he said noting that lakhs of philanthropists in cities have come forward to feed the people from unorganised sector. “The basic objective of our government is no one should starve to death. The issue of organised or unorganised sector comes next,” he explained.On the fear of large-scale retrenchment, the minister said notices have been served on all the industries that no one should be expelled from the job.However, Hebbar underlined that the industrialists today are as much in distress as the workers and his department was taking into account everyone’s concern. A decision will be taken in this connection by the government in the next two days, to provide assistance to small enterprises to keep them afloat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/dbt-not-possible-for-unorganised-sector-in-karnataka-report/story-EuaJtR8i4u07jAqn8ooGMP.html

The outbreak of coronavirus has adversely impacted the business of these outlets. After it was announced that all nightclubs will be shut down in the face of the pandemic, professionals employed at these places are having a tough time — be it the one who’d prepare your favourite concoction, belt out the hottest music tracks or the bouncers who ensure your safety.Mohit Chopra, a mixologist, feels that the nightlife business has been impacted big time, as compared to other businesses. “As our business depends on the daily inward stream of people, we would be paid half the amount. Some daily workers have been asked to go back to their home towns,” he says.Bartenders, servers and other professionals are feeling the pinch of the impact of Covid-19 on the hospitality industry. Udit Nagar, a bouncer, says, “The worst affected are people like us, who are part-time workers. With a constant stream of income, we tend to live a certain lifestyle, and now all of that has gone for a toss.” Satish Daggar, another bouncer, adds, “We can’t be sitting at home for two weeks or till whenever this gets contained...we will die of hunger. We need to pay our rent.” A post shared by DJ AJ (@djajmumbai) on Feb 10, 2020 at 5:38am PSTPopular DJs echo the sentiment. Mumbai-based DJ AJ feels due to the shutdown, there’s a cascading effect, because it’s also affecting the servicing industry and inventory management. He says, “My performances for April and May which were to take place in Italy, Maldives, Turkey, Beirut and Bali, are on hold. They are not yet cancelled, but we don’t know the (new) dates yet. But looking at the positives more than the negatives, it’s a good way to spend some family time.”Read: It’s the time to (virtual) disco as DJs take their music onlineTalking about the financial impact, DJ AJ says, “It depends on the kind of gigs I do, which range from a non-contractual gig for 90 minutes for ₹75,000 to ₹1 lakh, and performances at private events and weddings that go up to ₹1.5 lakhs, which are on hold at the moment.”However, some believe that now is the time is to re-energise and rejuvenate. Delhi-based DJ Sumit Sethi says, “There were several gigs of mine that got cancelled in the month of March due to the closure of nightclubs and other gatherings. But I’m taking this space and isolation to create music, focus on content and studio, connect with my inner self to improve skills.”Interact with author/@sanchita_kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/city-s-nightlife-faces-the-blues-amid-the-pandemic/story-Mi6LueMuKPPAvtqSmdv2DI.html

Locked inside home with family, we are expected to share household chores and also spend time with kids. So, actually there is not much time, to pen down your thoughts, like I used to have earlier,” said the UPite over the phone.Talking about the ongoing circumstances which have put all the industries including entertainment on long hold, he said, “It’s no doubt a very difficult phase for the entire world. And there is no solution in sight for now so the only way is to follow social distancing and listen to our government. Like everyone else, I too was almost set to go ahead with my work when the lockdown was announced. Since then, I am home and am creating a bank of episodes for one of my ongoing show. In such times we have realized the importance of having some backlog to bank on.” Writer of ‘Ekkees Toppon Ki Salaami’ and digital series ‘Chinese Bhasad,’ Qazi is also busy co-writing another script for a film which is expected to go on floors later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/i-have-been-busy-writing-to-create-a-bank-of-episodes/story-Mm2k4W3R8x7vB65Gvd10lK.html

But I don’t agree with it because, like everybody else, I am missing my outdoor life. Suddenly, an urge to go out and meet people normally like before has cropped up in me too but like all I can’t help it,” he tells over phone.So has the writer in him taken a back seat? The young writer from Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh is quick to revert with a big no! “Nothing can take away the writer in me. I am writing pieces everyday — some for online and much for future work. Like, I am working on a script of a film and a web show. I am a bit slow and letting all what is happening around the world to seep in me to use it for future references in my stories. Like, World War II gave maximum real-life tales to the writers to forward them to upcoming generations, it will be ver much similar after this outbreak fades.”He wants all the big celebrities to come forward and help the daily wagers in various industries, “This is the time when they need us the most and I am proud of my colleagues and actors who are doing so much for the daily wagers. It’s time to give them back and show our gratitude.” Solanki is looking forward to his web-series slated to release soon. “Yes, it has big names from Bollywood associated with it but it’s in the post production stage. As a writer I have tried adding number of emotional and political elements to the story. Also, I am awaiting the release of the OTT film ‘Freedom’ that I co-wrote with Dibakar Banerjee. Then penning down my own script is also in pipeline.”His last co-written release ‘Article 15’ did give him fame and award both. “Like any other creative person, I too love to be known for my work. Getting award is like an icing on the cake but still for me my audience’s reaction matters most as it’s for them that I write,” says the IIT-Roorkee graduate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/it-s-time-to-show-our-gratitude-towards-all-the-daily-wagers/story-2n2JIRUzKwpOfcetb70DCL.html

Pilibhit was the first district in the state to shed the corona tag earlier this week.The carefully drawn plan involved sealing affected areas, sanitization, tracking the contacts of Tablighi Jamaat members and those who travelled in the same train coaches with them, besides keeping a tight vigil on the porous India-Nepal border in the district. The strategy paid off when all six Covid-19 patients in Maharajganj tested negative for the Sars-Cov-2 virus for the second time. There was no fresh coronavirus case in Maharajganj at present and the reports of 36 family members of the six patients were also negative, said district magistrate Ujjwal Kumar.The district administration decided to discharge all six patients from hospital and shifted them to a quarantine facility for observation, according to state government guidelines.To make sure that no other person was infected with coronavirus in the remaining villages, health department teams collected five samples at random from the villages and sent them for tests, the district magistrate said. “All the samples tested negative; it was a major relief for us,” he said. A fortnight ago, Maharajganj was in the news after Tablighi Jamaat members, who attended the congregation organised in Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi last month, arrived in the district. Soon, the district police raided dozens of villages near Kolhui town, where many of them were staying. The Tablighi Jamaat members and their family members were taken to a quarantine facility in a school at Kamhariya Bujurg village. Subsequently, the district administration collected information about their travel details. Four villages and the market area of Kolhui town were sealed.The health department and police teams surveyed 7,500 people and screened 40,000.The villages and markets were sanitised and people were directed to stay home and follow social distancing norms,Kumar said. After Tablighi Jamaat members arrived in Maharajganj by train, officials alerted the Gorakhpur, Kushinagar and Deoria authorities as people of these districts had travelled in the same coaches as some of the infected patients. All the passengers were tracked and screened, but they tested negative, Kumar said.The porous India-Nepal border in Maharajganj was sealed and samples of villagers nearby were collected for tests, he said.“We are keeping our fingers crossed, the population of Maharajganj is around 25 lakh. A majority of the people are settled in the rural areas. There is a large movement of the migrant population from neighbouring Bihar and Nepal. Vigil has been tightened, mandis (markets) are being opened in the morning. Public places are being sanitised,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/sealing-sanitizing-tracking-how-up-s-maharajganj-became-coronvirus-free/story-8SOTQslSEasG8qxv4gOG6O.html
18-04-2020||Education||Private schools in Bihar withhold salaries of teachers, cite low fee collection||While the government’s order to private schools for waiving fees for the months of March and April brought some respite to parents, scores of teaching and non-teaching staff in the state capital are facing the fallout of the order as they have been denied full salary this month. The authorities of several private schools cited low fee collection this month as the reason behind the pay cuts. Some schools have even asked their employees to wait for their salaries till additional fund is arranged. A TGT science teacher complained that half amount of his salary has been denied by the school despite engaging in online classes. He said, “I had worked till March 19 as school was open. After lockdown, the school management engaged all teachers in preparing online study materials and lectures. However, I received only 50% of my salary.”A PGT teacher of English said that he received 40% of his salary adding that the school management promised him to pay the remaining amount by April-end.Another PRT teacher said the school management has been keeping a mum on payment of employees. She said, “School has not released the salary of March yet, despite working for 15 days. I am doubtful that the school may deny salary of April implying zero working day owing to the lockdown.”HT has deliberately not disclosed the identity of teachers to protect their interests.On the other hand, principal of a private school, pleading anonymity, said, “Due to low fees collection and very few new admissions, the school is facing financial constraint. The school management has withheld a certain amount of employees with handsome salary in order to pay non-teaching staff. However, the arrear amount would be released in the upcoming month, depending upon financial condition of the school.”On April 13, the state education department instructed all private schools not to take any fee, including transportation charges, for the lockdown period of March and April. However, schools conducting online classes have been allowed to charge tuition fee. Following the government’s decision, Private Schools and Children Welfare Association (PSCWA) wrote to the chief minister on April 14 to reconsider the fee waiver decision. Shamael Ahmad, national president of PSCWA, said, “The private school owners are having a tough time in paying hundreds of their employees without any income. Apart from teachers, the school needs to pay to their non-teaching staffs and rent as well. Without fees collection, meeting all expenses would not be possible, especially for small schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/private-schools-in-bihar-withhold-salaries-of-teachers-cite-low-fee-collection/story-aolnBAXmCZJRg21Z1x3MsI.html

18-04-2020||City||Lockdown in Ludhiana: BJP, SAD leaders highlight ‘bias’ in ration distribution||Accusing the administration and local Congress of uneven distribution of ration among migrant workers, former cabinet minister and BJP leader Satpal Gosain and local Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor Gurmail Singh Jajji held separate protests in their respective areas on Friday.While Gosain initiated a three-day, relay hunger strike at his house in Kidwai Nagar, Jajji sat on a protest near the Bhagat Singh statue installed on Bahadurke Road. Jajji said he will continue the protest for three days, and if the administration failed to solve the matter, he will proceed on hunger strike outside the deputy commissioner’s office on Monday.Gosain said a large number of migrant labourers and underprivileged people had gathered outside his house 10 days back, following which he contacted deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal and municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar to distribute ration among the needy. MC secretary Surinderpal showed up a few days later and demanded a list of beneficiaries. Gosain said though they handed over two lists of over 450 families three days ago, ration has not been distributed among the needy.Jaggi accused the district administration and Congress party of adopting pick-and-choose policy in distributing ration.He alleged that while the state government was supplying ration for the poor, the administration, in connivance with local Congress leadership, was giving it to a leader of the party. This Congress leader, he alleged, was providing the supplies only to the families supporting him, while a considerable fraction of migrant workers and their families were left fighting hunger. The workers had been gathering outside his house for food, which forced him to hold a protest in their support, he said.Jajji further alleged that the MC had provided supplies only once, and they were also sanitising the ward on their own with little to no support from the civic body.BJP LEADERS MEET DC Five BJP leaders, including former deputy mayor RD Sharma, former councillors Inder Aggarwal and Amrik Bhola, Deepak Sharma and Rohit Sikka, also met the DC over improper distribution of ration among the underprivileged. Sharma alleged that the administration was distributing ration through Congress leaders, including MLAs and ward-level leaders, only to the party supporters. However, workers, whose list was provided by BJP leaders, had been left out. Aggarwal urged the DC to ensure the administration supplied ration to all people on the lists provided by respective councillors.On his part, DC Pradeep Agrawal said sector officers deputed by the administration were distributing the ration. “The concerns raised by BJP leaders will be addressed and the administration will ensure that the supply reaches every needy person in the district,” he added. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said the civic body had distributed ration once, and now the DC’s office was handling the distribution. He said anyone in need of food can contact the administration via its helpline numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-in-ludhiana-bjp-sad-leaders-highlight-bias-in-ration-distribution/story-OEqhJ0HdtoDpiXstSXjv8O.html

Among the four patients are three cops – Basti Jodhewal SHO sub-inspector Arshpreet Kaur, her driver ASI Sukhdev Singh and ACP Kohli’s driver constable Prabhjot Singh. Residents of the police flats near Sarabha Nagar police station were left jittery after SI Arshpreet, who lives there, tested positive. Disinfection was promptly carried out at the flats, while the Basti Jodhewal station was sanitised twice.The SI has no travel history, but she was deputed at the vegetable market, along with ACP Kohli and other cops. She was also part of the team tracing Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended the Markaz event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area.District mandi officer (DMO) Jasbir Kaur, the fifth confirmed patient on Friday, had attended many meetings with ACP Kohli, besides others with deputy commissioner Pardeep Agrawal, commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.ROW OVER QUARANTINED COPS BEING SENT TO NATIVESPlaced under quarantine at their government quarters on Club Road, four security personnel, two readers and the driver of ACP Kohli were asked by their neighbours to return to their home towns. Following objections by the residents, who are also police staff, the cops left for their natives in Khanna, Moga, Ferozepur and Sangrur, inviting controversy for the police department. Panchayat of Chowas Jakhepal village in Sangrur took exception to the police personnel being made to travel when they were supposed to be in quarantine. The Sangrur health department also wrote to the Ludhiana police commissionerate objecting to the decision.Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said the cops attached with ACP Kohli were sent to their home towns following protocol. They were informed about the precautions to be taken and quarantine notices had been pasted outside their houses. The police chief said all police personnel were asymptomatic, and hence been placed only under home quarantine. “They will receive better care back home,” he added.PANIC GRIPS COMMISSION AGENTSPanic gripped commission agents at the vegetable and grain markets of the city as they had been conducting meetings with DMO Jasbir Kaur for issuance of wheat procurement coupons for farmers and making other arrangements at the markets.President of the Sabzi Mandi Ahrtiya Association, Gurkamal Singh, said several agents and other workers left the markets as soon as the DMO’s news spread. He said thermal scanning should start at the entry point of the market and the area should be properly disinfected.Market committee chairman Darshan Lal Baweja said the markets will remain open, and he had sought a substitute for the DMO from the Punjab Mandi Board. No other board officials were quarantined in Ludhiana, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-ludhiana-cops-testing-covid-19-positive-sends-ripples-in-police-circles/story-2gI2j31SilP3xURDy8TCgP.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||To keep an eye on home quarantined, Mumbai cops appoint society residents as ‘monitors’||With an increased work-load on police personnel as they are forced to concentrate more on high-risk red zones, cops have roped in society residents to ensure that those ordered home quarantine do not step out of their houses. Home quarantined people are those who may have been exposed to the Sars-Cov-2 virus which spreads Covid-19 and are isolated to see if they develop symptoms of the disease. Mumbai police have identified ‘monitors’ in hundreds of residential societies across the city where over 46,332 home quarantined people are staying. Each home quarantine person has a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) stamp on their hand. “Since we need to focus more on enforcing movement restrictions in containment areas and at the same time also check the movement of those home quarantined, we have turned residential societies’ chairmen, secretaries as ‘monitors’ to see if home quarantined are not stepping out of their homes. We have shared contact numbers and have asked them to inform us if any home quarantined person steps out,” said Viresh Prabhu, additional commissioner of police (central region). The senior officer added that police personnel are also posted at the gates of these societies, even security guards and watchmen have been asked to be more vigilant. “The concerned police station regularly co-ordinates with the personnel and check status. Our patrolling staff also look for suspects on the street and check their hand for home quarantine stamp. Surprise checks are also being conducted to ensure that nobody steps out,” Prabhu said. In the city, 12 first information reports (FIRs) have been registered for violation of home quarantine orders, police said. Around 11,368 people finished their quarantine period while over 3,271 are in institutional quarantine facility in Mumbai.

The cabinet sub-committee comprising seven senior ministers, in a slew of decisions, has decided resume online registration of the properties and permit the use of 25% district planning fund for health services among others. It has also allowed to release the remaining part of the March salary of doctors, police with immediate effect.The sub-committee headed by deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar in its meeting held on Monday has given nod to more than a dozen proposals. The state government had deferred the payment of elected representatives and government employees for March due to dwindling revenue collection in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak. Doctors, police, homeguards who are the frontline warriors in the war against the pandemic too were due to the decision owing to the deferment of 25-50% of cut the salary. The sub-committee has decided to release the remaining part immediately. To avoid the loss of the revenue coming through stamp duty and registration due to the lockdown, the decision of resuming the registration online was also taken.To make funds for health services easily available, the government also decided to allow the district administration to spend 25% of the district planning committees’ funds on Covid-19 related infrastructure. This would facilitate district administrations to spend around ₹245 crore at their level.

It also decided to ease restrictions on agricultural activities and facilitate grain supply to community kitchens and selling the grapes to the wineries directly. It will also allow e-commerce delivery of all goods and commodities, including food, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electrical and electronic appliances.The state has also asked parents to complain to the district education officer if schools insist on paying fees during the lockdown period. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad made the announcement. “We have issued a circular asking schools not to ask for fees considering the current situation. However, I’m getting several messages from parents across the state alleging that schools still asking for fees to be paid. We urge the parents to register their complaints with the concerned district education officer so that the circular can be implemented in letter and spirit,” Gaikwad said, in a video message on Friday.The circular of the school education department was issued on March 30.With the support of the state government, a telemedicine helpline was also started from Friday. The helpline will let people to know if they are infected or not, guide them about the epidemic and will also clear their doubts, if any. All this will be done with the help of expert doctors. ”A person will only have to call on 9513615550. The interactive voice screening system will ask 3-4 questions to the person based on the replies, it will be routed to the relevant doctor who will call back the person and guide him after taking more details,” said Kartik Sahoo from Maharashtra State Innovation Society. The project is started in association with National Health Mission, Maharashtra State Innovation Society, a group of start-ups named ‘Telemeds Versus Covid’ and Pune Platform For Covid Response.The state government has also allowed cane cutters who have migrated from one district to another for work within the state to return to their villages. There are over 1.31 lakh cane cutters who are stuck in other districts due to lockdown and are currently staying at 38 sugar factories. The order that was issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta states, “The sugar factory owners will have to make all the travel arrangements to drop them at their respective villages.

18-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh industry stares at layoffs, pay cuts for sustainability amid Covid-19 lockdown||The industry and businesses in Chandigarh have started resorting to sharp salary cuts amid government instructions not to fire employees.Salary cuts by at least 30% to 50% will be enforced by the industry as it looks to reduce its expenditures to sustain during the nationwide lockdown.There are around 3,000 medium and small scale manufacturing and service sector units in the city’s twin industrial areas employing around 30,000 workers.“More than 90% industrial units have paid salary for the month of March to their workers as was directed by the advisory of the central government. But from April, most the factory owners are not in a position to pay more than 50% of the salaries to all levels of workers,” said Naveen Manglani, president, Chamber of Chandigarh Industries.Industrialists say while factories were operating till March 22, in April, these will remain closed for the entire month.“With Chandigarh identified as a hotspot and categorised in red zones, it is unlikely that factories will start working even in May. This is an unsustainable situation for the industry where no income is being generated for such long period. Unless the government intervenes, most of the factory owners will not be able to pay its workers,” said Pankaj Khanna, president, Chandigarh Industries Association.At least 50% of wage cut, say industrialists, is allowed in case of layoffs. “Labour laws allow the industry to pay 50% in case of layoffs for 90 days, when the factory is closed for at least 15 days. So, at least this much salary cuts will be banked upon by the industry. The 50% that we can pay should be allowed to be compensated in the form of working overtime on Sunday and holidays in the coming year,” said Manglani.Industry insiders say April is very crucial for the industry’s sustainability. “These are tough times for all sectors including IT. If there is no financial package from the government, then major layoffs and pay cuts will be a natural option for the industry,” said, Sarvjeet Singh Virk, managing director, Finvasia.GOVT INTERVENTIONS ON INDUSTRY WISHLISTIn a letter to the director industries, Chandigarh, the industry bodies have demanded, “The principle of ‘compensatory off’ should be applied to all the employees across the board for all the non-working days due to Covid-19 in the financial year 2020-21. Alternatively, lay-offs as provisioned in existing labour laws should be allowed.”Also, industry representatives have requested employer’s contribution for EPF and ESI during 2020-21 should be compensated by the government. MSMEs should be appropriately incentivised for paying wages without work during the lockdown period.“These concessions have to be made for the industry so as to not only sustain it but also its workforce,” said Khanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-industry-stares-at-layoffs-pay-cuts-for-sustainability-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-1R4qMb0bHkJXbCy0ngSpcJ.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||After overcharging plaints, more price caps for private hospitals treating coronavirus patients in Mumbai?||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may add further caps to the price of Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals after receiving complaints of inflated bills from patients and doctors. While experts have welcomed the move, some private hospitals have raised concerns because they are running at financial loss.Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani said he has received complaints of overcharging and will soon meet with representatives of private hospitals to discuss the issue. “Along with private hospitals, I have also received complaints about private laboratories who are charging extra for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. We are looking into the matter and trying to bring a standardised price rate,” he said. A doctor, who works in a BMC-run isolation ward, has filed a complaint with the civic body and state health department on the issue of inflated charges at private hospitals. “There is need to bring regulations on the daily usage of PPE,” she said.In March, the BMC allowed 12 private hospitals to set up isolation wards to treat Covid-19 patients. These hospitals can charge either Rs 4,000 per day or restrict bed charges to 50% of the total bill. However, the guideline did not mention costs of testing, safety kits and diagnosis. Patients have since complained that private hospitals are overcharging. A 56-year-old resident of Dadar and her husband tested positive for Covid-19 and were admitted to a private Hospital in south Mumbai on April 3 and April 4 respectively. When they were discharged on April 12, their hospital bill was Rs 4 lakh. “We didn’t know it costs around Rs 20,000-Rs 30,000 per day. They [the hospital] included the price of safety kits in the bill,” said the woman.Private hospitals point to the sharp rise in the price of PPE (each kit costs between Rs1,200 and Rs1,500). A doctor can wear the PPE for four hours at a time. This along with medicines and bed charges results in high costs. “Private hospitals have to buy their own PPE and if the municipal corporation wants to put a blanket on the bill price, they should provide the safety kits to hospitals free of cost. Hospitals across the state are facing monetary loss. So they can’t afford to shoulder the responsibility of PPE,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra.However, Kakani said, “There is no need to use a single PPE kit for an individual patient. They can treat several patients wearing the same safety kits. So, it is unfair to charge each patient separately.”Health experts have welcomed the move to standardise the price of Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals. “This is a pandemic situation so there is need to bring a standardised price rate not only for PPE, but also for medicines, ventilators and other services. If we keep the service charges open-ended, private hospitals will exploit it to meet their own financial needs,” said health expert Dr Anant Bhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-overcharging-plaints-more-price-caps-for-private-hospitals-treating-coronavirus-patients-in-mumbai/story-nWEp0eA68QtPEI0AFy42UJ.html
18-04-2020||City||Coronavirus lockdown: 3 travel by internal road to reach Gujarat, lynched near Mumbai||Three people were lynched by a mob of around 200 tribals at Kasa in Palghar district late on Thursday after they had taken an internal road, owing to the lockdown, to reach Gujarat. The police have arrested around 100 people in the case and they will be produced before the Jawhar court on Saturday. According to assistant police inspector Anandrao Kale of Kasa police station, the tribals from Gadhchinchale village mistook the victims — two priests and their car driver — to be thieves and attacked them with stones, sticks, sickles and knives. “The priests — Sushilgiri Maharaj, 30, and Chikne Maharaj Kalpvirkshagiri, 70 — were travelling to Surat in Gujarat to attend the funeral of another priest. As the Mumbai-Ahmedabad National Highway has been closed owing to the lockdown, their driver Nilesh Telwade, 30, took the internal roads to reach Surat,” said Kale.When the van reached Gadhchinchale village, the mob stopped the vehicle and questioned the driver on where they were going. Finding them to be suspicious, the mob dragged the three outside and attacked them. “Telwade managed to make a call to us, after which we rushed to the spot. We tried to save the three but the mob began pelting stones on us also. Bhagwat Sonwane, deputy superintendent of police, Jawhar, had to fire in the air to control the mob,” said Kale.Six police personnel have also sustained injuries and the police vehicles have been destroyed. “We rushed the victims to the government hospital but they were declared dead before admission. Their post-mortem reports are awaited. We have registered cases under sections 188 (disobedience), 307 (attempt to murder), 302 (murder) and 353 (obstructing government servant on duty) of the IPC against the accused as well as under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” said Kale. This is the second such attack in Kasa in a week. On Monday, Kale and three policemen were injured, while the car of skin specialist Dr Vishwas Valvi was destroyed at Saarni village in Kasa, when they were attacked by 250 tribals. The team had been to the village to distribute food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-3-travel-by-internal-road-to-reach-gujarat-lynched-near-mumbai/story-9d2ZHo2LeqH4LjtV2MyXVM.html

Fifteen of them are nurses, while the remaining ones are other staff members. Wockhardt Hospital now has the most number of Covid-19 positive staff members in the state.“The staff members who were detected positive were already quarantined at the hospital. As per protocol, we ran a second set of test on them and found 26 new patients. All these patients have been kept in the isolation ward of the hospital,” Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC, said. The hospital is also awaiting the reports of 58 other staffers. Wockhardt Hospital’s outpatient departments and non-emergency services had closed operations and it was declared a containment zone last week after 56 of its staffers were diagnosed with Covid-19. As the hospital was sealed, several patients have been also quarantined inside it. Their relatives are now worried. A man who’s wife is quarantined at the hospital told HT that nurses continued to attend her despite being asked to remain in quarantine. “The hospital has played with the lives of patients by letting the infection spread among staffers. I can’t even take my wife out of the hospital,” he said. Meanwhile, head of the hospital, who has also been diagnosed with Covid-19, has been shifted to Nanavati Hospital after his condition started deteriorating. According to sources at Nanavati Hospital, his condition is stable now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/26-staffers-of-wockhardt-test-positive-for-coronavirus-count-touches-82/story-PYVu4MmjK6zPYhZOiihnOO.html
18-04-2020||City||Mumbai’s Dharavi area sees 15 new coronavirus cases, 1 death||Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) claimed the city saw 77 cases, its lowest in 12 days, Mumbai’s emerging hotspot, Dharavi, saw 15 new cases on Friday, bringing the total count to 101. Also, a 62-year-old man from the area was declared dead at Sion hospital, pushing the toll to 10. Before this, the lowest count for the city was 72, reported on April 5.The slums in Dharavi are spread across an area of more than 240ha and house around 8.5 lakh residents. With a population density of 66,000 per sqkm, it is one of the most cramped areas of the city. Of the 15, three new cases were reported in Matunga labour camp, Muslim Nagar and Indira Nagar, two at Social Nagar and one each at Dr Baliga Nagar,Laxmi Chawl, Janata society and Sarvoday Society, said a BMC official. BMC officials confirmed that most cases found in Dharavi were high-risk contacts of positive patients and have been quarantined.Of the total cases, the highest (21) have been reported in Muslim Nagar, followed by Mukund Nagar (18) and 10 in Social Nagar.On Thursday, Dharavi saw its highest spike in the number of patients, with 26 new cases. The first case in Dharavi was reported on April 1, following which there has been a rapid surge in the number of positive cases, which may soon pose a challenge for civic authorities. There are fears that the number of cases could be higher, as many people with symptoms may not have been tested yet.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G-North ward, said. “Till date, we have almost screened 33,000 patients and marked 34 containment zones with six red zones. We are screening almost all high- and low-risk contacts of the patients.” Meanwhile, the BMC plans to ramp up testing, with measures such as more testing centres, fever clinics, drive-through centres, parking lots and private lab testings. The BMC has completed 35,500 tests across the city so far, an average of 2,697 tests per million. It has traced 57,700 contacts of positive patients, of which 2,120 have tested positive. While 57,700 people have been advised home quarantine, 11, 368 people have completed the 14-day quarantine period. The civic body said that it has started seven Corona Care Centres - Level II, which have a capacity of 519 beds, and 473 patients who are positive, but asymptomatic are isolated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-s-dharavi-area-sees-15-new-cases-1-death/story-jqtoyjjrxTwuBkvKxJxk4M.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||Two Covid-19 patients give birth; babies safe||Two pregnant women, who have tested positive for Covid-19, have delivered babies who tested negative for the disease, at BYL Nair Hospital. Both the babies are healthy and have been shifted to a different ward to avoid any possible infection.According to the hospital, the women tested positive after taking admission in the obstetrician gynaecology department of the hospital for delivery. “As per the new protocol, it is essential to do Covid-19 test before delivery. They did not know that they are carrying the virus till the report came out,” said a doctor from the hospital. Soon after the babies were born, samples were taken from them for testing. “The reports of both the babies have come negative. However, we will again do their testing after a week to avoid false reporting,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital. These newborns will be fed milk from human milk bank as their mothers will have to recover completely before breastfeeding the babies. Meanwhile, a resident doctor from the department has been diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. She has been admitted in the isolation ward of the hospital. Four of her contacts have also been quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-covid-19-patients-give-birth-babies-safe/story-E0DQXjnGWcDQ9d0wq4IXMP.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||Raheja Hospital flouted safety rules, alleges staff||Days after a dialysis patient was found Covid-19 positive at Raheja Hospital, medical staff complained that the hospital has violated government rules by not closing the unit for fumigation. The staff further alleged that the hospital administration didn’t carry out the compulsory testing of staffers who were exposed to the patient. The hospital, however, has refuted the allegations and claimed all safety measures were taken and that staffers were wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) hence they didn’t require testing.A patient, suffering from kidney ailment, had visited the hospital on April 7 for routine dialysis. But after the procedure, he complained of breathlessness and fever. The patient on April 10 tested positive for Covid-19 and was immediately admitted in the Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital. The hospital claims that the unit was sanitised after the patient was shifted. According to ‘Expert guidelines for dialysis centres in Covid-19 pandemic’ released on April 8, “if any staff or any patients of dialysis centre is found positive for Covid-19, then this dialysis centre should be closed for one day (24 hours) and the centre should be fumigated...All the patients and staff of the concerned dialysis centre should be tested.” “We refuse to go home until the hospital runs a Covid-19 test on us. After repeated protests, the hospital has given us an accommodation on the sixth floor of the hospital. My son keeps requesting me to come back home but I cannot in a bid to maintain their safety,” said a staff of the dialysis unit. The hospital, in a statement, said, “A patient had come to the hospital for routine dialysis on April 7, post completing his Dialysis the patient complained of breathlessness and fever. We had him tested for Covid-19, and as per protocol the dialysis machine and the artificial kidney division (AKD) was immediately sanitised. The patient was reported to be Covid-19 positive on April 10, and he was immediately admitted in the Covid-19 ICU facility at the hospital. The patient has now tested negative on two successive test reports and is fit to be discharged.”One of the patients has also filed a complaint with the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) seeking action against the hospital. A copy of the complaint is available with HT. “When I called the hospital to complain, the officer insulted me and asked me to visit civic-run hospitals for dialysis. The hospital is already at a loss due to the lockdown so they don’t want to shut their dialysis centre which is an important source of income for them,” said the patient. According to the hospital, they have taken all required precautions and hence it is not required to test or quarantine asymptomatic staff even if they may have come in contact with any Covid-19 positive patients, as long as they are wearing the mandated PPE kits. The hospital also said, “At the time of the said patient’s last dialysis at the AKD, all AKD staff including technicians, nurses and housekeeping staff were wearing appropriate PPEs as per hospital protocol. All staff members in the AKD were continuously monitored and none of them developed any symptoms. Two nurses who reported to have some cough were duly tested, and both have tested negative for Covid-19.”On accusation about sanitisation of the unit and testing of staff, the hospital said, “All dialysis machines and the entire artificial kidney division is sterilised after every use; all protocols that have been laid down are rigorously followed. With strict infection control processes in place, we are committed to the war against Covid-19, and are taking all necessary precautions to safeguard the health of all patients and caregivers. Also, as per hospital policy, all the patients are screened for Covid-19-related symptoms before they are admitted. With all these precautions in place, it is not required to test or quarantine asymptomatic staff if they may have come in contact with any Covid-19 positive patients, as long as they are wearing the mandated PPEs.”Hospital issues statement, denies the allegations A patient had come to the hospital for routine Dialysis on April 7th, post completing his Dialysis the patient complained of breathlessness and fever.

18-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Police personnel guard containment zones in battle against Covid-19||Police Naik Sagar Waghole has been manning the check-post near Green Park in Kondhwa which is a containment zone in the city for Covid-19 (coronavirus) caused by Sars-Cov-2 virus. The entrance and exits of sealed off areas are guarded by the police personnel. Waghole speaks to HT about his role.1) What exactly is your role in this pandemic?We ensure enforcement of the lockdown which has been announced to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19. There are additional check-points in containment areas. The entrance and exits of sealed off areas are shut and are covered by us. We make sure people follow the lockdown rules in the containment zones.2) How does your day begin and roll out?My day begins at 6am and ends around 9pm every day. I wear all the required safety gear while leaving from home. We make sure the rules of lockdown are strictly followed by the residents, but it is for the benefit of all. Some volunteers bring food packets for us but that is not daily. I carry my tiffin every day. 3) What precautions are you taking?We have been given masks and gloves. Some people got the use-and-throw masks, some of us got these cotton gloves that can be washed. We have been given instructions to not touch anyone or anything that can cause transmission of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. While on duty I ask for valid documents and look at them for verification but maintain distance.4) What is your view of the Covid-19 situation in Pune?Most of the city streets are empty after the lockdown was announced on March 24, but some people do not follow the rules and are on the streets for no valid reasons. ‘Police Mitra’ help us in such circumstances, but now there are so many seized vehicles at the police station that there is no space to accommodate anymore.5) What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?The persons in the healthcare sector are working non-stop during this time of crisis. We cannot comment on them from here. Our day is spent in enforcement and we see various people providing relief to the needy who have been affected due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-frontline-police-personnel-guard-containment-zones-in-battle-against-covid-19/story-DsW6JUyAWCYTQDBEZpscDO.html

18-04-2020||Pune||Lockdown gameplan: Footballer Hiba Faquih plays it cool as she juggles workout, baking||Sport has always been a priority in my life”, says 24-year-old Hiba Faquih who stays near NIBM road. Faquih started playing football at the age of 14. In the last edition of the Indian Women’s League (IWL), she represented Baroda FA. She has also represented the Maharashtra state women’s team for seven years. Faquih, who is extremely passionate about the game said, “I cannot begin to state how much I have learned from football and in order to do my bit and give back to the sport, I decided to pursue my masters in sports management from Loughborough University, UK”.Faquih has also acquired the AIFF D and AFC C Football Coaching licenses and has coached a few girls’ teams in Maharashtra. At a very young age, she has worked with some of the professional sports league events around the globe. Daily routineWorking on several sports events requires me to travel frequently. Some of the leagues I have worked on previously include the ICC Champions Trophy and Women’s World Cup, Indian Super League, Indian Premier League, Premier Badminton League, ICC Cricket World Cup. Anyone who works in sports will surely agree and understand the difficulty of having a daily routine as you are required to work odd hours as well as on weekends. As I cope with the hectic schedule, I try and play as much football. Luckily for me, there is always a friend who is organising a small five-a-side game. I also participate in several competitive leagues around the year which includes the IWL and few other local tournaments.Lockdown routineI really struggled at the start as I am someone who is always on the go. However, I decided to make the most of this time to spend time with my family and have a regular workout routine. It took me a little while but I finally came up with a time-table in which I spend the first half of my day working from home. After wrapping up work, I have dedicated an hour or 90 minutes to a work out regime, comprising of various stretches and floor exercises.In the evening I cook and do household chores. The whole family has dinner together and then we play some board games or watch TV before going to bed.No gymSince I am unable to go out and play football like I usually do, I try and work on my fitness and strength, as that is something I usually do not get the time to do. With the time I have, I follow several home workout routines every day. I do some bodyweight exercises as well. Since I do not have access to gym equipment, I have to make the most of what I have at home, so sometimes I use a backpack filled with books as weights, and go up and down the stairs to include cardio in my lockdown routine.HobbyI do have a creative side in me which finds peace and happiness in painting, gardening, and baking. I dedicate some time of the day to either one of these activities as it helps me keep my mind off things. I believe it is very important for people to spend some time doing what they enjoy. I hope all of us can continue doing the same even after the lockdown comes to an end in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/this-footballer-plays-it-cool-as-she-juggles-workout-baking/story-ldCgtUbtPDAlJSBcLzH9UI.html
18-04-2020||Pune||Sassoon Hospital staff upset over dean’s transfer||Resident doctors, nurses and other staff of the state-run Sassoon General Hospital on Friday expressed their displeasure over transfer of dean Dr Ajay Chandanwale amid the coronavirus pandemic.Representatives of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), nurses, Class III and IV employees assembled at the main premises of the hospital and registered their displeasure over Chandanwale’s transfer. He was transferred from the post of the hospital’s dean to joint director, directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).In the letter, MARD states, “The transfer of the dean at this crucial time of fight against Covid-19 stands baseless and we strongly oppose it.” MARD representatives denied of any protest and said that the hospital staff had gathered to bid adieu to the dean who was leaving on Friday morning. “It was only a gathering not a protest and all staff ranging from class four to class one had gathered to bid farewell to Dr Chandanwale. We wore black bands to condemn the transfer but did not stop any operations as it would hamper the treatment of patients. Dr Chandanwale has always taken care of the staff and the hospital. The high mortality at the Sassoon hospital is because the patients come at a critical stage with severe co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic liver and lung ailments or have been refereed from a different hospital,” said Dr Prashant Munde, General Secretary of MARD Pune wing Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “A group of doctors and health officials had come to me on Friday with a few demands which also included their objection to the transfer of Dr Ajay Chandanwale. I have asked them to send their objections to me in a written format and I have assured them that I would do whatever is possible in my authority and forward the remaining complaints to state government.”Nurses face issuesThe Maharashtra State Nurses Association (MSNA) has written a letter to the Sassoon hospital stating the difficulties while working with Covid-19 patients. The letter states that less PPE kits and no access to essential items makes working there difficult. A member of the organisation requesting anonymity said, “We are given pizza and burgers which were ordered from outside. This is unhealthy. Nurses are the ones who are in close proximity with the patient and hence we should at least be given decent food. There is also lack of safety equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sassoon-hospital-staff-upset-over-dean-s-transfer/story-XUxIH3htsvHr2AxAz1fcJN.html
18-04-2020||Pune||Pune police tie up with NGO’s to set up central kitchen to feed needy||The Pune Police in association with 160 non-government organisation (NGO’s) and Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has set up a central kitchen to cook food for at least 40,000 people in the city.According to police, this move will help the NGO’s to distribute food to the needy without the hassles of volunteers running from pillar to posts during the time of lockdown.Commissioner of police K Venkatesham, said, “We want to reduce the number of volunteers out on the streets and we are taking the help of the NGO’s to provide us with the raw material and the cooked food which we will distribute using the police force.”“We have set up a social policing cell at the commissioner’s office where we have three officers and 20 constables handling the phone calls from people who need food,” he said.He also said that there are five vehicles specially allotted for collecting the food and distributing in five zones of the city. Samairah and Vaishali Patkar who have been co-ordinating for many volunteer groups discussed the issue with the commissioner of police K Venkatesham and thus it was decided to establish a central kitchen.“The lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 (coronavirus) has impacted the labourers, needy and those in hostels and through this central kitchen may can be feed,” said Samairah.“IRCTC was already running the kitchen, hence we thought of using their platform to help make more cooked meals and serve the needy. We also realised that there was duplication of ration or the essential raw materials and people were stocking that instead of using it,” said Vaishali, hence the team derived at opting for cooked meals for the needy across the city.The staff strength at the IRCTC kitchen is 25 people working in a 2,000 sq ft kitchen. Piyush Farkande, chief supervisor, IRCTC, said, “The lockdown has drastically impacted livelihood patterns, with the poor struggling to even get daily meals. We provide bulk cooked food in paper plates, which is collected by volunteers from various NGO’s.”According to PI Prakash Khandekar who is part of the social policing cell, “There are many people in need of food in areas like Kondhwa, Katraj Ambegaon, Bhosari, Chakan, Wagholi, Parvati and Dhanori, where our vehicles will take the food and we will serve them.”Samairah said, “We have received donations from NGOs like Hope for Children foundation, an NRI PhD Student with her group has raised Rs 2 lakh and Mahindra and Mahindra company Chakan has donated Rs 5 lakh so far for the cause.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-police-tie-up-with-ngo-s-to-set-up-central-kitchen-to-feed-needy/story-pdjfYk86gLheEV4WQs4UgO.html
18-04-2020||Chandigarh||Now, Chandigarh residents can get tested for Covid-19 at private lab for ₹4,500||Any resident who wants to get tested for coronavirus can now get it done at a private lab in Chandigarh at a subsidised rate.This was decided in the daily review meeting chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Friday.The development comes on the day Chandigarh witnessed two new cases — a 50-year-old Dhanas man working as a sanitary attendant at the PGIMER and a woman in her 50s from Sector 30 — after a four-day lull, taking the total to 23, while a 30-year-old man from Sector 21 became the tenth patient to recover.SRL Diagnostic in Sector 11 has been authorised to collect samples and test them at subsidised rates of ₹4,500 per patient.On the criterion set for the test to be undertaken, Arun Gupta, principal secretary, UT administration, said, “If a person fulfills our criterion, then the government is committed to do the testing free of cost. But no criterion has been set for private testing.”For conducting the test, a private lab will require three documents from a person requesting a Covid test—prescription from a qualified physician, government photo-identification and a filled specimen referral form.Currently, the testing is being done at three government facilities—PGIMER, GMCH-32, and IMTECH, Sector 39.4,800 RAPID TESTING KITS FOR UTGupta said the central government has also dispatched 4,800 rapid testing kits, which will be utilised after consultation with the medical team. “As per protocol of the ICMR, only persons with influenza-like symptoms for more than seven days will be tested with rapid testing kits,” added Gupta.Also, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said baby milk food will be provided to mothers with small children. While the administration has been supplying cooked food and ration, there were demands that children were not getting enough milk, he said.MC commissioner KK Yadav said all traders in Sector 26 market have been directed to keep sanitizers with them at all times. He said all delivery boys have been mandated to wear gloves and masks so that there is no risk of infection while distribution of ration and vegetables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-chandigarh-residents-can-get-tested-for-covid-19-at-private-lab-for-4-500/story-GTw1Agd4BUmIodp5wTC4QK.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||Migrants stuck in city suffer as porta cabin shelters turn ovens||The rising summer temperatures in Delhi has added to the woes of thousands of migrants who are stuck in the city after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), was extended till May 3. Hundreds of them who are living in porta cabin shelters have to contend with the unbearable heat as these box-like metallic structures have turned into ovens due to lack of ventilation. The mercury had crossed the 40 degrees Celsius mark three days ago, which is four notches above the season’s average. The city recorded a maximum of 37.8 degrees Celsius, two notches less than that recorded on Thursday, and a minimum of 23.8 degrees Celsius.Besides 259 regular shelter homes for the homeless in the city -- of which 112 are porta cabins, 111 in buildings and 36 in tents -- the government has converted 256 school buildings into shelters for migrant workers. As many as 1,435 school buildings have been converted into food distribution centres. Sitting outside a blue porta cabin shelter in Yamuna Bazar, which has been his home for the past 20 days, Anil Kumar Jatav said it becomes suffocating inside during the day as the roof heats up. “It is difficult to spend the day inside as the shelter feels like a furnace when the sun is at its peak. Although the shelter has ceiling fans, they hardly have any effect in the absence of ventilation,” said Jatav, a rickshaw puller who hails from Bhind in Madhya Pradesh. He had stayed back in the city for his arthritis treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences but he later learnt that the out-patient services have been suspended. Shiva (who goes by first name), 27, housed at a porta cabin near Paharganj, said he keeps washing his face and head to beat the heat. “I was brought here by the police when the bus services were cancelled after the lockdown. I used to live in a rented room. I had no idea the heat could be so harsh in here. Back at the room, we had a cooler also. I hope that the government does something to help us survive the heat till the lockdown is over,” he said. Shiva used to work at an eatery at West Delhi’s Janakpuri and belongs to UP’s Hardoi.Officials in the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), the nodal agency for arranging shelters for the homeless in the city, said by next week, roofs of porta cabins will be painted white to control the heat. They said they will also install air coolers inside shelters and provide drinking water to its inmates. Bipin Rai, member, DUSIB, said, “We had a meeting to discuss the measures for a summer action plan. We have already placed an order for at least 500 air coolers. The shelters run from buildings already have air coolers and we are repairing and cleaning them for use. Also, we will place earthen pots at all shelters so that inmates get clean, cold drinking water.”The situation was better at shelters in buildings, which are better ventilated. “It does feel hot in the day but we sit in the compound under the shade of trees. We are able to sleep well in the night with fans running. After some days, we will need coolers, when the heat becomes unbearable,” said Ram Nath, 53, who lives at a shelter run from a school building in New Rajinder Nagar. Nath is from Bihar’s Muzaffarpur and used to work at a bag-making unit in Paharganj. However, social activists working with the homeless said every year, many homeless people die of extreme heat and dehydration. “This year, with a larger number of people being housed at shelters because of the lockdown, it becomes imperative that authorities ensure there are adequate arrangements to prevent heat strokes. They should also ensure availability of drinking water as well as medical aid,” said Sunil Kumar Aledia, founder, Centre for Holistic Development (CHD) and national Convener of National Forum for Homeless Housing Rights. He added that many people have to wait for a long time to even get drinking water delivered to them. “This situation needs to be addressed with the utmost urgency to ensure that people don’t suffer during the lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/migrants-stuck-in-city-suffer-as-porta-cabin-shelters-turn-ovens/story-6sZo1ZLKNiFGNjVVNut2xJ.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to give Rs 100 per swab as incentive to teams collecting community samples||To incentivise collecting samples from Covid-19 clusters for community testing, the Delhi government has decided to pay each team involved Rs 100 per sample. This sum would be divided among members of the team with a highest share going to persons actually engaged in collecting the swab.The incentive would retrospectively be payable from April 12, when the teams started collecting samples from hot spots in the city-state. Till Friday, April 17, 2,983 samples had been collected.“The incentive, per team, would be worked out in such a way that the person exposed to maximum danger will be given the greater share of the incentive. For example, if there are eight members in a team with two persons taking the samples then the total amount (number of samples x Rs 100) would be divided by 10 (to create 10 parts of the sum) and the two sample collectors would receive two parts each,” according to an officer order by Delhi’s health department. Earlier this week, the government had decided to start testing people in containment zones to understand the spread of the disease. In the absence of rapid testing kits at the time of taking this decision, the government had decided to go ahead and conduct 20,000 RT-PCR tests in these areas. Not only is the test more expensive, it also puts healthcare workers at a higher risk.“For an RT-PCR test, the healthcare workers have to take a swab sample from the back of the throat. When that is done the patients tend to cough releasing aerosols that might contain the virus and infect the healthcare worker. The healthcare workers have to be in complete protective gear. It is much more difficult that simply taking the blood for an antibody test,” said another official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-give-100-per-swab-as-incentive-to-teams-collecting-community-samples/story-PQliTPEW0KO1qLhzaEvpgI.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||7 Bihar labourers hired a cab to sneak out of Delhi, to go home. Their story||As thousands of migrant workers flocked to east Delhi’s Anand Vihar late last month in the hope of catching a bus back to their hometown, seven had remained oblivious to the developments and had stayed put inside their house in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar. These seven daily wage labourers had then missed out on the slim opportunity.Nearly three weeks later, on Thursday evening, they thought they had a fresh opportunity. After days of convincing, the men had managed to convince a Toyota Innova driver to drive them to their village in Vaishali district of Bihar. By evening, they were ready with two bags stuffed with one set of clothes each, two kilos of beaten rice, some jaggery and two water bottles. Around 11pm, the men packed themselves into the six-seater Innova and set out on an arduous and uncertain journey towards home.They had barely driven for an hour through the inner lanes of the city when their journey came to an abrupt halt. A police picket in south Delhi’s Kotla Mubarakpur area had spotted them. The car had to stop.“Our hearts sank at that moment,” said 18-year-old Barun Kumar.“The seven men were moved to a shelter home in Kotla Mubarakpur, where they were provided bedding and meals. The police also ensured that the advance they had paid to the driver was refunded, “ said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south).The men were let off without any legal action, but the driver, Shakeel Ahmad, has been booked under the Indian Penal Code and the Epidemic Act.DIDN’T KNOW HOW LONG THE LOCKDOWN WILL LAST“We don’t know how long the lockdown will last. It may continue for three months or may go on for six months,” said 40-year-old Anil Rai. The men had decided to return to their village after the lockdown would end on April 14. Their house owner had waived off their rent and helped them with rations. But on Tuesday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the lockdown was going to be extended till May 3, the desperation grew. They visited Labour chowk near their home, but couldn’t find any work. “Back in our village, the wheat crop is ready and waiting to be harvested. It would go waste if we don’t return home. Every year, we spend two months in the village to harvest the crop, but this time we couldn’t make it. Our families kept urging us to return home,” said Rai.After the lockdown was extended,they started looking for any vehicle that would take them home. On Thursday, they found one driver, Shakeel Ahmad, who was willing to drive them home. He wanted Rs 37,000 for 1,000-odd ride to Patna. From there, they were ready to walk the next 30-40 km to their village in Vaishali.BORROWED MONEY“We borrowed money on interest from someone in our village. He transferred the money to a shopkeeper in Raghubir Nagar and we paid a commission to him to get the cash,” said 28-year-old Teni Rai. An advance of Rs 7,500 was paid to the driver, with a promise to pay the remaining amount once they reached Patna.“In all, we had Rs 500 cash in our pockets,” said Rai. The seven hadn’t really thought through their plan. For one, how would they get past the many check-posts that have been erected along the national highways and state roads. “The driver told us that it was his responsibility (to get us through the police checking,” said Teni. They wanted to believe him. They did.According to a senior police officer, the driver had planned to steer clear of the main roads and drive through the city’s colony lanes at night.“He planned to take offbeat routes while travelling through Haryana and Uttar Pradesh,” said the police officer. It would probably add some 200 km to their journey. So be it, they said.They had planned to mainly travel at night to avoid detection. They had calculated that it would take them three days to reach home. It seemed worth it.“Right now, we are just thankful we didn’t lose the advance we paid to the driver,” said one of them, Karu Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/seven-labourers-try-taking-cab-back-to-bihar-stopped-at-kotla-by-cops/story-vovbImPZrId583GGn1LYsM.html
18-04-2020||Pune||Provide PPE and other safety equipment: MSNA writes to Sassoon management||As the medical staff are at the forefront in the fight against Covid-19 (coronavirus) and tirelessly working to save patients affected due to Sar-Cov-virus nurses they struggling to get necessary safety equipment.The Maharashtra State Nurses Association (MSNA) has written a letter to the Sassoon hospital management requesting to provide all necessary facilities and safety equipment for the doctors, nurses and cleanliness staff actually working at the Covid-19 patients’ ward.Recently three nurses working at the Sassoon hospital tested positive and it is alleged by the association members that it was due to lack of good quality PPE kits given to them.In the letter given by the MSNA dated on March 31 it was stated that, “While fighting against this deadly disease it is important to provide all the necessary safety equipment to doctors, nurses and cleanliness staff at the hospital working at Covid-19 patients ward. The safety of doctors and other medical staff is of utmost importance and our request to the hospital authorities is to take our responsibility and provide high quality PPE kits, masks, hard scrub and hand sanitizers.”Since the operations began at the Sassoon Hospital, initially the working staff of nurses which included both male and female nurses were given residential accommodation within the hospital premises. Later on they were shifted to nearby two hotels in Mangalwar peth area.“Initially the nurses were using the safety kits which are used for HIV Aids patients and that were not appropriate while working on the Covid-19 patient ward. All the three nurses who tested positive were the same who worked in the initial phase with these kits and now they are infected with the disease,” said one the members of the association who didn’t want to reveal his name. “Similarly we are not even provided with healthy food. Our demand is the state government should look in to the matter and provide us with the necessities,” he said.Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar under whose authority the Sassoon Hospital administration comes said, “Today I held a meeting with the staff of Sassoon Hospital and we discussed on various issues. Especially about the PPE kits, now a committee has been formed within the hospital which will check the PPE kits which are donated or bought by the hospital from various sources. It should be according to the guidelines given by the ICMR and if not they will be rejected.”“Apart from that about the issues which nurses are facing about food and residential problems at the hotel, I am personally monitoring it and have discussed it with the Pune district collector. Soon we are going to work on solutions on all these issues and address it,” he said. 37 of 44 deceased did not have any foreign travel history||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/provide-ppe-and-other-safety-equipment-msna-writes-to-sassoon-management/story-cWQfoOo9948hWJFMJs5yGL.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||Govt tells private schools to charge only tuition fee during lockdown||The Delhi government on Friday asked private schools in the city not to charge parents anything other than tuition fees till the educational institutes reopened after the Covid-19 lockdown.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said private schools will not be allowed to increase fees without the government’s permission. He also asked these schools not to charge three months’ tuition fees at a time.The overall fee structure of a private school is usually divided under various heads — tuition, transportation, developmental charges and annual charges.HT on Wednesday reported that several private schools in the city revised their fee structure amid the lockdown without seeking prior approval from the government.“We have got several complaints about schools hiking fees and also levying charges for transport, which is not even being utilised during the lockdown...Schools cannot charge anything beyond the tuition fee,” Sisodia said.He said the rule will be applicable to all schools, irrespective of whether the institutes are built on government land or private.“No school can charge three months’ tuition fee (at a time); the fee has to be collected monthly,” he said.Sisodia also said private schools cannot deny students access to online classes in case parents are not able to pay fees during the lockdown.Though schools and colleges are closed owing to the ongoing lockdown, they are conducting online classes. An umbrella group of around 400 private schools partly welcomed the Delhi government’s directive. “We agree with the government’s decision of not charging transport fee during the lockdown. And schools are in agreement with the payment of fees on a monthly basis,” said SK Bhattacharya, president of The Action Committee of Private Unaided Recognised Schools in Delhi.“However, we don’t agree with the decision of not charging the annual fees amount component because majority of schools have fixed expenditure that cannot be met without the annual charges. We can take the annual charges in instalments, if needed,” he said.The annual fee is a sum schools charge over and above the tuition fee, and which they generally use for the maintenance of electricity, water and other essentials on the campus. While majority of schools charge it once a year, some take the payment every six months or every quarter. The Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) on Friday also issued a notice to this effect to private schools, directing them not to charge parents anything other than the tuition fee.“No fee, except tuition fee, shall be charged from parents, till further orders. Heads of the schools shall not demand and collect tuition fees from parents on a quarterly basis. The fee shall be collected on a monthly basis,” the order said.“The schools shall, in no case, deny access to online education to any student who is unable to pay fees due to financial crisis arising out of the ongoing lockdown,” it said.The DoE further asked schools not to revise the fee structure in the 2020-21 session till further orders.All private schools were also asked not to stop the salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff members citing unavailability of funds. “Arrange funds in case of any shortfalls from the society or trust running the school,” the DoE order said.The DoE has warned schools that action under Disaster Management Act , which has been enforced in the city in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, can be taken in case of non compliance.Amita Wattal, principal of Springdales School in Pusa Road,said that the schools can manage till the lockdown with the tuition fee but annual fees and other components will be required immediately after re-opening. “The government should immediately lift these condition after the schools reopen. Otherwise, the schools will face major financial issues,” she said.Meanwhile, the All India Parents Association (AIPA) welcomed the Delhi government decision. “The government has taken a very balanced decision taking into consideration interests of parents, schools and teachers and other staff working with schools,” said Ashok Agarwal, president of the association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-tells-pvt-schools-to-charge-only-tuition-fee-during-lockdown/story-dbZ9qQeVFIY3IyHRn6vAvK.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Tablighi Jamaat head says he has joined Delhi Police probe, asks for copy of FIR against him||The head of the Tablighi Jamaat, Maulana Saad, has written to the Delhi Police seeking a copy of the first information report (FIR) against him and seven others. Police had filed a criminal case against Saad and six other top officials of the Jamaat on March 31 for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings, issued to contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in the Capital.In the letter, Saad has asked the police if they have added any new Indian Penal Code sections to the FIR.Delhi Police officers, requesting anonymity, had on Wednesday confirmed that they had added Section 304 in the FIR against Saad.Section 304 of the IPC, related to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, is a stringent section, unlike the other sections of Epidemic Diseases Act which had been levied in the FIR initially. A person convicted under Section 304 of the IPC could be sentenced to a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment. In a letter to the case investigating officer, Saad has written that he had joined the investigation by replying to the police’s two e-mails sent earlier this month. Saad’s lawyer Shahid Ali confirmed that they wrote to the police on Thursday. “We have given a letter to the Delhi Police stating that we have replied twice to the notices issued to us. We also asked them about media reports related to a particular section that has reportedly been added to the FIR. We also sought the copy of the FIR. We have reiterated that we are always available for cooperation in the investigation. We have not received any notices or summons to join the investigation except for some information they asked of us in their two letters.”The FIR, filed March 31, was first registered under sections of the Disaster Management Act as well as IPC sections which included criminal conspiracy (120 B), a negligent act likely to spread disease (269), malignant act likely to spread infection (270), disobedience to quarantine rule (271) and defying prohibitory orders (188). The maximum punishment, if convicted, under those sections is a two-year prison term with a fine or both. Last month, police officers and state government officials had evacuated more than 2,300 persons from inside the Markaz building in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, where they had gathered for a religious congregation of indeterminate length. The meetings continued despite orders by the Delhi government banning all religious events (March 13), restricting gatherings to 200 people (March 16), and then putting a four-person limit (March 21) on all gatherings. The Nizamuddin area was also declared a containment zone after the evacuation. At least 21 evacuated persons had then tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2. Earlier this month, police had sent two questionnaires to Saad, containing 29 questions related to the Tablighi Jamaat and the gatherings between March 10 and 15. In the first notice, which had 26 questions, sent on April 1, the investigating officer had sought details of CCTV cameras inside the building and had asked Saad to preserve the footage. The police had asked for details of all the people, including foreigners, present in the building last month. There was also a question on the steps taken by the management to disperse the gathering after the government had issued the prohibitory orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tablighi-jamaat-head-writes-to-delhi-police-seeking-copy-of-fir-against-him/story-jKb5lKsDopbwz7YaRZjXtJ.html
18-04-2020||Noida||Juvenile Justice Board wants police to release detainees from police stations amid Covid-19 lockdown||The Gautam Budh Nagar juvenile justice board (JJB) wants the police to release detainees directly from police stations in light of the observation homes being emptied to avoid any transmission of coronavirus (Covid-19).The Supreme Court on April 3 had instructed that juveniles in detention homes be sent back to their families amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown. The decision was taken for the welfare of the juveniles and to avoid an outbreak of Covid-19 in enclosed spaces. According to officials, the Gautam Budh Nagar observation home located in Phase 2 had 184 detainees of whom 58 have been released on interim bail, so far, in the care of their families.“Two juveniles were sent to us recently for a serious and heinous crime, respectively. One of them, a 15-year-old boy, was released on Thursday. He is from Jhansi and was brought in by the Ecotech 3 police in connection with a case of theft. We have instructed the investigating officer to make the necessary arrangements for the boy to be sent home,” said Aneet Singh Bhagel, JJB member, GBN.He said the board wants that juvenile detainees with a sentence of less than seven years be directly granted bail from the police station, which anyway is a provision.“Any new juveniles who are coming in are being kept in quarantine for a few days before they are allowed to mix with the other juveniles as a precautionary measure. We are taking all measures to ensure that there is no outbreak in the home and the detainees are all doing well. There are frequent inspections. Currently, we have 127 juveniles who are staying with us and we are working on the release of more of them. It would be better if the detainees who have a sentence of less than seven years were granted bail directly from the police,” said Baghel.The detainees are released after an undertaking is signed by a parent or guardian and action will be taken against the signatory in case the juvenile violates the conditions of release.Police officials, meanwhile, said that no order has come to them so far.“In any case, if there is a sentence of less than seven years, they can be granted interim bail directly by police. However, in case of an arrest, we have to produce them within 24 hours in front of a juvenile justice magistrate and then whatever the court decides will happen,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-juvenile-justice-board-wants-police-to-release-detainees-directly-from-police-stations/story-MIn2D3p3p1NIUaRixin4XM.html
18-04-2020||Noida||Teen kills self for failing to get enough likes on TikTok||An 18-year-old man allegedly took his own life on Thursday at his house, which falls under the Sector 39 police jurisdiction. Family members alleged that he was unhappy because he failed to receive enough likes on his social media content. No note was recovered from the spot.According to police officials, the teenager lived with his father. Both of them worked in a private firm in Noida. Due to the ongoing lockdown, the youth was mostly at home and was making videos and sharing them across the popular social media platform, Tik Tok.“It seems that for the past few days, he had been troubled that there weren’t enough likes on his videos. He had even shared this with his father,” said Shailesh Tomar, station house officer(SHO), sector 39 police station.He said that police officials got a call on Thursday evening from the father who said that his son had hung himself from a fan in their house.“A team was rushed to the spot and the body was sent for an autopsy. No suicide note was recovered from the spot and a preliminary investigation revealed the reason of death was most possibly receiving less fewer likes on social media. The father was in no condition to provide any more details,” said the SHO.Police officials spoke to a few neighbours, who confirmed that the youth had been upset for the past few days and was staying up at night to make videos. The victim’s body was handed over to the father following the autopsy.“The police team had to break down the door to recover his body. From what the family and neighbours have said it seems that he was depressed because his videos were not getting enough likes for the past few days. That could be why he took such an extreme step even though no suicide note was recovered from the spot. A probe in the matter is underway,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.The family is from Malda district in Nadia. Police officials suspect that the youth may have been under peer pressure for fame on social media but so far the father has not filed any official complaint against anyone.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-teen-kills-self-for-failing-to-get-enough-likes-on-tiktok/story-I4uTsEgqHlsiIF3lLEsGUO.html
18-04-2020||Noida||Coronavirus lockdown causes crime to cower in Gautam Budh Nagar district||Crime has significantly dropped in the Gautam Budh Nagar district during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown this year between March 25 and April 14, as compared to the same period in 2019. In the first two weeks of April crime figures dropped by over 83% compared to last year.This has also helped to bring down the total crime in the district till April 15 this year.GB Nagar commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said that, along with the lockdown that has restricted people’s movement and strict vigil by the police, the introduction of the commissionerate system in the district in January too helped. “The new system was implemented on January 16. From that day, 794 cases relating to different crimes have been registered so far in the police stations of the district, which is only 66% of the cases registered during the same time last year. The cases related to rape and POCSO Act have been reduced to 24, which is less than half than the figures of these crimes during that period last year,” he said.The CP said they have improved interpersonal skills of the force, which will further check the crimes in the district. “We are leaving no stone unturned to make the policing more people-centric, so that people can get more responsiveness at their police stations concerned,” he said.Former Delhi police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma agreed that the new system infused professionalism into the force.“Before the commissionerate, the circle officers (COs) used to supervise cases. But, now senior IPS officers have come in place of those COs. It is obvious that with more professional and competent staff, number of crimes will go down significantly. What is really expected now is that the police must move quickly to reinforce and maintain these numbers, while anticipating and preventing new crime tendencies and opportunities,” he said.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, the additional DCP, who has worked in GB Nagar in both the police system, said, “The more focussed ‘beat’ policing has virtually paralysed the movement of criminals from neighbouring districts. Earlier, they used to enter the district from some transit points. After committing the crime, they often used to return their respective places. With the introduction of new police system, which has more personnel who are well-equipped, criminals have feel it will impossible for them to give them the slip. Lockdown has worked as the last nail in the coffin,” he said. Supreme Court lawyer and criminologist Rajesh Kumar said that although the numbers look good now, the force must keep their vigil even during the lockdown. “Crime science and criminology pays particular attention to crime opportunities and how they are affected by lifestyles of people and routine activities. For example, when a person goes out, he or she experiences more interpersonal crimes, like snatching or an assault, while at the same time, their unguarded home is more vulnerable to burglary. As people are living in their homes, rate of these crimes has reduced substantially,” he said.But, this need not always be the case, he added.“South Africa has reported that dozens of schools have been burgled, trashed or burned to the ground and state-owned utility Eskom reported an increase in cable theft and vandalism during their lockdown. It also increases the risk children and elderly face in the confines of the homes. Lockdown can also cause greater friction in the family relationship and divorce rate is likely to goes up just after the lockdown ends. Wuhan has reopened to see its divorce rate double, with family experts saying the rush for couples to separate is because of rising conflicts caused by the 70-day-long quarantine enforced in the Chinese city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/corona-causes-crime-to-cower-in-noida/story-3SQQTAXNLjldNaRRZrcLGL.html
18-04-2020||Noida||Noida skips foundation day celebrations, employees donate Rs 86 lakh to fight Covid-19||Noida observed its 44th foundation day without fanfare on Friday, with a focus on fighting the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. Since its inception, the Noida authority and the Uttar Pradesh government have celebrated the foundation day of this industrial town with cultural events every year, but this year the celebrations were shelved as the focus is to take effective measures to contain the spread of Covid-19.“We congratulate residents on the occasion of 44 years of establishment of Noida. The Noida authority, which is associated with the establishment of the city, is committed to make Noida a smart city. During this Covid-19 pandemic, we are taking multiple effective steps to ensure food distribution to the needy,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority. Permanent employees of the Noida authority on Friday took an inspiring step and donated a total of ₹75 lakh towards the fight against Sars-Cov-2. The authority gives a certain amount as reward to their employees annually on the foundation day of the city.“On this foundation day, we decided to donate 50% of this amount (₹75 lakh) towards operations to fight Covid-19,” said Rajkumar Singh, president of NEA.They donated a total of ₹40 lakh to the chief minister’s Covid Care fund and ₹35 lakh for food for the needy.’“Permanent employees donated a total of ₹35 lakh for arrangements of food to be distributed among daily wage workers, homeless, dependent and other needy people in the city. The money has been given for the Meals on Wheels project, under which 1,50,000 food packets will be distributed daily to the needy till May 3, beginning Friday,” said Ashok Sharma, vice-president of Noida employees association (NEA), a registered organization for employees.The contractual staff donated a total of ₹11 lakh to the chief minister’s Covid Care fund.The authority has deployed three low-floor CNG buses to transport 15,000 food packets daily to needy in the city till May 3, 2020.According to officials, the authority, since March 23, has been distributing at least 85,000 food packets daily. Now, from Friday, the authority will distribute 1,00,000 food packets.“We needed to increase the number of food packets. And the contribution of NEA has helped us in arranging 1 lakh food packets to be distributed daily till May 3,” said Maheshwari.The authority’s employees and the Noida Metro Rail Corporation had earlier donated a total of ₹51 lakh in the chief minister’s Covid Care fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-skips-foundation-day-celebrations-employees-donate-86-lakh-to-fight-covid-19/story-SkxjA6LOJBDudoy9amHitJ.html
18-04-2020||Noida||RBI’s repo cut evokes mixed response from developers, factory owners||The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) move to cut repo rate has evoked a mixed response from developers and factory owners in Noida and Greater Noida. The RBI has taken the step to address liquidity issues of banks and housing finance companies, which may impact the real estate sector and industry at large.The move may not address all prevailing financial crisis that the real estate sector is facing currently, said experts.The RBI on Friday announced a series of measures to infuse liquidity in the system and provide relief to borrowers amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The RBI has cut the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points — from 4% to 3.75% — encouraging banks to “deploy surplus funds” and lend more, a move that will, in turn, result in cash in the hands of the borrower. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.Repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks in the event of a shortfall of funds. The reverse repo rate is a mechanism, wherein the RBI borrows money from banks, in case of excess liquidity in the market.The RBI has made available an additional ₹50,000 crore liquidity for National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), Small Industrial Development Bank of India (Sidbi) and National Housing Bank (NHB).“₹10,000 crore additional funds will be available for real estate projects with the banks after the RBI’s decision. But it will have limited impact because the RBI is yet to allow restructuring of existing loans taken by builders. Via video conferencing with minister of state (independent charge) of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, on Friday, we demanded that existing loans should be rescheduled and, developers should get additional time to repay the remainder and fresh loans should be provided to fuel growth,” said RK Arora, president of the Uttar Pradesh chapter for National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), a builders’ group.The RBI has made available ₹25,000 crore, of the ₹50,000 crore, to rural areas and ₹15,000 crore for industry, besides the ₹10,000 crore for real estate sector.“The benefit of rate cut must be passed on to retail customer by banks. The rate cut will provide some liquidity to banks, but the RBI must issue strict instructions that the actual benefit must be passed on to retail customers,” said Getambar Anand, ex-national president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) and the chairman and managing director of ATS Group.Noida Entrepreneurs’ Association, which has least 10,000 factory owners as members, said that the new announcements will not help them deal with the crisis caused by the pandemic. “When every big or small business is shut and funds’ liquidation is stopped completely, the recent announcement has no meaning as we are failing to repay existing loans. The recent announcement only allows banks to give more loans, whereas we require interest-free loans and permission to start our businesses,” said Vipin Malhan, president of NEA.However, CREDAI president for West UP, Prashant Kumar Tiwari, said, “The RBI’s move will address the liquidity crisis being witnessed by the real estate sector. We hope that the government will take more decisions to boost growth in this sector.” CREDAI members had also interacted with Puri via videoconferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/rbi-s-repo-cut-evokes-mixed-response-from-developers-factory-owners/story-EUD6yOY3TB20hrSSXarszM.html
18-04-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad’s government blood bank runs dry amid lockdown||The only government blood bank at MMG District Hospital in Ghaziabad is running very low on inventory as the Covid-19 lockdown has badly affected the donation drives usually conducted by medical facilities and social organisations in the district. As only 10 units of blood were available with the MMG Hospital on Friday, the health department is planning to set up mobile units for doorstep collection of blood, officials said. According to the officials, the government blood bank has capacity to store 500-600 units at any given time and about 100-150 units are generally available to meet daily requirement in normal days. Last month, there was collection of 223 units and issuance of 231 units, the officials said.“The number has come down drastically this month. Till April 16, only 64 units were collected and 60 units issued. Donations have been severely affected due to the ongoing lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. People are not willing to come out, though we have appealed through social media for blood donation,” said Dr Dipti Varshney, in-charge of the blood bank at MMG Hospital.According to drug inspector Puran Chand, the Ghaziabad district has a total of 17 blood banks, of which 16 are with the private medical facilities. “Till April 16, we had a stock of 634 units of blood. For blood donation, the guidelines say that every donor be tested for coronavirus,” Chand said.“We are checking donors for any symptoms, and asking if they have any contact with Covid-19 patient or travel history. The other five mandatory tests, including HIV and hepatitis, are being done,” Varshney added.According to the officials, they are reaching out to people through the social media and making calls to pursue them for donating blood. Some voluntary donors who received the messages for blood donation said that they were ready but moving out is a major issue.“There is restriction on movement of people during the lockdown. In present times, people are also avoiding to go to any health care facilities in order to avoid any infection. So, some mobile units can be roped in by the health department for doorstep collection of blood,” said Namita Gaur, a resident and voluntary blood donor from Crossings Republik.State surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agarwal did not take calls despite repeated attempts.However, chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that the low inventory of blood units available at the blood bank is cause of concern.“We cannot hold blood donation camps as they will encourage public gathering. So, we have been asked to send mobile units for collection of blood. We have told our staff not to take blood from people who have any symptoms like fever, cold, etc and properly ask their history or if they have any contact with Covid-19 positive patients,” Gupta said.Dr AK Paliwal, the state programme manager from National Health Mission for Uttar Pradesh, said that it becomes vital for testing of every blood donor for coronavirus in present times.“However, there is a problem that test reports of Covid-19 generally takes three to four days to arrive after sampling. In such a case, the donor may not wait. So, we can use rapid test kits for detection of any infection. These kits give fast results probably within an hour. Though such kits are not available in Ghaziabad at present, they will be available soon. I will direct health department officials to make use of these kits and compulsorily test every donor beforehand,” Paliwal said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/lockdown-effect-govt-blood-bank-runs-dry-in-gzb-testing-of-donor-a-major-issue/story-7OzHLhuXJbNXEO5FMGBkxN.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra lost Rs 4 lakh cr: IIT-B||An Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) and ministry of human resource development initiative has calculated that the gross state domestic product (GSDP) — a monetary measure of the volume of all goods and services produced in a state — lost during the 21-day lockdown in India is Rs 4,86,710 crore or 3.46% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all goods and services produced in the country. The income lost by marginal and migrant workers due to the lockdown is almost 0.41 % of the GDP. Consumption expenditure has also fallen, including expenditure on entertainment, food and beverages. Lost consumption expenditure in 21 days of lockdown amounted to 0.56% of the GDP. In case of a two-month lockdown, the income lost by migrant workers may increase to 3% of the GDP and the GSDP loss could soar to 11% of the GDP. Maharashtra would lose the most in terms of production of goods and services, found the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-lost-rs-4-lakh-cr-iit-b/story-Qin83I4vCsxTDrP3jkxg3M.html
18-04-2020||Education||IIT- Gandhinagar to undertake study to find out survival of coronavirus in human waste||In an effort to build an early warning system for Covid-19, the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) has joined a global consortium of 51 premier universities and research institutes to undertake surveillance of sewage water to help determine and quantify excretion of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.On Friday, the group submitted their viewpoint paper to Environmental Science and Technology, a scientific peer-reviewed journal published by the American Chemical Society, underlining the need to survey wastewater for virus RNA during the ongoing pandemic that has affected more than 2 million people across the world.The aim of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is to help policy makers monitor the transmission of Covid-19 within a community. “The critical point here is that while it takes three to 14 days for an individual to exhibit symptoms, its occurrence in wastewater can been seen early and therefore it can be used as a warning sign, especially in densely-populated clusters,” said Manish Kumar, collaborator and assistant professor, department of earth sciences, IIT-Gn.The COVID-19 WBE Collaborative – a partnership between Sewage Analysis CORe group Europe (SCORE) network and the Global Water Pathogen Project – has laid out a standard protocol to ensure uniformity in data collection and inference.Recent studies have reported that in 27% to 89% of patients, the infection is accompanied by persistent shedding of virus RNA in stool. “Wastewater has been used in forensics for a long time – to check for the presence of narcotics, for instance. However, Covid-19 is tricky because we don’t know how long the virus survives in water. But it is worth knowing its presence in wastewater because the virus has an incubation period during which it gets excreted in some way,” said Kumar.Researchers said limited capacity for diagnostic testing coupled with individuals who are asymptomatic and oligo-symptomatic (displaying few symptoms) that go undetected leads to significant uncertainty in the estimated extent of the Covid-19 infection.Kumar will now seek permission to collect waste water samples from government authorities in Gujarat, and partner with Indian collaborators to extend the scope of the work across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-gn-to-survey-sewage-for-virus/story-AUCDzWvc5CpjG5PHGwJn3N.html

In view of the lockdown, now extended till May 3, the apartment has cut down the strength of its non-essential staff and provided all essential staff members with boarding and lodging facilities within the condominium to reduce the chances of exposure with the world outside the premises. Hemant Kumar, member of the condominium’s working committee which is coordinating all pandemic-related efforts, said that 23 staff members, including 10 security guards, had been housed within the condominium complex to meet the essential services.“We are functioning with bare minimum staff involved in the running of essential services such as water supply, sewage treatment plant and electricity. They are ensuring that the needs of the support staff providing essential services within the complex are met and they can work optimally in these unprecedented times. “We have accommodated our staff in two 4BHK flats, which have been bifurcated to ensure that optimum physical distance is maintained between them. Since they work in shifts, no more than 10 people occupy the two flats at any time. We have asked the building management to ensure that health check-ups of these workers are regularly conducted,” said Kumar.Residents at the condominium have also started a kitchen service for the staff.“One of our residents, who runs a tiffin service, has taken the responsibility of preparing food for all the staff and we are providing her with the necessary resources through contributions from residents,” said Kumar.He added that residents voluntarily contribute towards a fund which is being used to provide food to the staff residing within the complex. “People are stepping forward to donate funds which are being used to provide cooked meals to the staff. The complex has created a make-shift kitchen where food is prepared. We have made arrangements for preparation of food within the compound,” said Kumar.“I prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner for the workers and the menu is decided based on the availability of vegetables or ration that we are able to procure. The menu keeps changing after every few days,” said Priya Gupta, who cooks the meals.In line with the guidelines issued by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, the condominium RWA has barred the entry of part-time domestic help, such as maids, cooks, drivers, car cleaners, and dog walkers, among others. They have allowed the entry of domestic help in special cases where the occupants are either physically challenged or are senior citizens living alone. “Since we don’t have any senior citizen who lives alone, we asked one of the families that did need help with their elderly parents to house their help within their apartment for full time till the lockdown continues,” Kumar said. Entry for external vendors such as food delivery persons, meanwhile, takes place at the tower entrance. Residents are required to collect the belongings from the tower. All persons entering the building with deliveries are scanned for their body temperature and mandatorily sanitize their hands. Since the lockdown started, the condominium has been maintaining a record of every person moving in and out. “We are keeping a record of every individual’s movement, be it a resident or an outsider. Through record-keeping, we get an idea about the number of people from the condominium employed in essential services and need to step out. Besides, it helps us understand the other reasons due to which people are venturing out. We want to understand why people are going out so that a solution can be found, and the need addressed,” said Kumar.Though the condominium does not have permanent shops within the complex, it has made arrangements and put in place a makeshift shop with help of a resident who runs a grocery store in the vicinity. To ensure that physical distancing is followed at all times, in the area around the general store and other commonly used areas, barricades have been placed at a distance from each other besides circled markings. “Residents have been told to stay at an arm’s distance from each other and barricades have been placed so that people can maintain a gap while they queue for purchasing essentials. We have also made circled markings on the floor at a distance of 2 metres from each,” said Kumar.Besides, some other grocery and vegetable shops are located just outside the condominium and routinely deliver requirements to residents. “Some people prefer to buy their basics from shops outside the complex. For such people, we have set up a window during which they can order and get their requirements delivered. This is being done to curb unnecessary movement,” said Kumar.The need for cash has also been addressed as the nearest ATM is 3km away, making it impossible to walk down amid restrictions on movement. Residents had reached out to the administration after facing a cash crunch following which a mobile ATM has started visiting the location. Nikesh Goel, a member of the condominium’s working committee, said though residents were struggling to get cash, a more acceptable mode of payment, when the lockdown first started. “The situation has improved with the mobile ATM comes twice a week. Residents line up to withdraw cash, up to ₹20,000 per day, while adhering to physical distancing norms. Most importantly, it has helped us to curb unnecessary trips outside the complex,” said Goel.The condominium has also roped in a private firm that comes to sanitise the complex on a weekly basis. In addition, residents had reached out to the MCG which has also initiated sanitization drives. “Our society doesn’t fall within the MCG limits but we reached out to them and now sanitisation drives in the common are carried out in 3-4 days,” said Kumar. The condominium has also purchased a spray machine, similar to the one used by MCG, with which it has ramped up the frequency of sanitisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bptp-park-serene-works-for-its-workers-conducts-regular-medical-check-ups-to-keep-them-healthy/story-xFFv487glLvw7L83PZipqN.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||To keep an eye on home quarantined, cops appoint society residents as ‘monitors’||With an increased work-load on police personnel as they are forced to concentrate more on high-risk red zones, cops have roped in society residents to ensure that those ordered home quarantine do not step out of their houses. Home quarantined people are those who may have been exposed to the Sars-Cov-2 virus which spreads Covid-19 and are isolated to see if they develop symptoms of the disease. Mumbai police have identified ‘monitors’ in hundreds of residential societies across the city where over 46,332 home quarantined people are staying. Each home quarantine person has a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) stamp on their hand. “Since we need to focus more on enforcing movement restrictions in containment areas and at the same time also check the movement of those home quarantined, we have turned residential societies’ chairmen, secretaries as ‘monitors’ to see if home quarantined are not stepping out of their homes. We have shared contact numbers and have asked them to inform us if any home quarantined person steps out,” said Viresh Prabhu, additional commissioner of police (central region). The senior officer added that police personnel are also posted at the gates of these societies, even security guards and watchmen have been asked to be more vigilant.“The concerned police station regularly co-ordinates with the personnel and check status. Our patrolling staff also look for suspects on the street and check their hand for home quarantine stamp. Surprise checks are also being conducted to ensure that nobody steps out,” Prabhu said.In the city, 12 first information reports (FIRs) have been registered for violation of home quarantine orders, police said. Around 11,368 people finished their quarantine period while over 3,271 are in institutional quarantine facility in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/to-keep-an-eye-on-home-quarantined-cops-appoint-society-residents-as-monitors/story-ClypkyyUjM0HOfw6ZNKN6J.html
18-04-2020||Gurugram||Manesar industries likely to resume operations from April 20||Industries in Gurugram outside municipal limits shall be allowed to operate from April 20 onwards, while strictly following social distancing norms, the Haryana government said late Friday. Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) in this regard will be issued for the entire state on Saturday that each industry would have to strictly follow.Financially starved due to a sharp dip in revenue collection owing to the lockdown, the Haryana government inched closer to resuming commercial and manufacturing activity in the state from April 20, the day designated by the Central government for operationalising the enterprise.The industries and commerce department and labour department of the state government held consultations with industry representatives on Friday evening.Additional chief secretary, industries and commerce, TVSN Prasad, said they would issue guidelines for resumption of manufacturing operations on Saturday.“We have constituted district and block level committee to process approvals and monitor containment requirements including social distancing,’’ Prasad said. These committees will evaluate which factories or industries can be permitted to carry out operations.When asked about the opening of industrial units in Gurugram, which has been designated a red zone by the state government, Chautala said that only areas falling within the municipal limits of Gurugram had been categorised as such. “Industries in areas that are outside the municipal zone in Gurugram and aren’t categorised as a containment zone will be allowed to resume operations, with some riders. We will issue SOPs for statewide operations on Saturday,” he said. There are six containment zones in the district, as of Friday evening. The development means that around 2,000 units based in Manesar, including auto major Maruti Suzuki, could resume manufacturing Monday onwards, but at a limited capacity. On the other hand, Udyog Vihar, which falls within municipal limits, may have to wait longer to resume operations.A number of Manesar-based industrialists have repeatedly asked the government over the last few days to allow the resumption of industry, after the nationwide lockdown was extended, and threatening to plunge the economy and industries further into turmoil. “We are ready to start work and have already worked out SOPs for safe working, while maintaining social distances,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association. A Maruti spokesperson when asked about the matter said they could issue a statement only on Saturday, after the SOP is released. As per government directions, manufacturing units will be allowed to work with 50% staff, who will have to maintain a six-feet distance from each other within the units. The factories will have to ensure that entry and exit of workers happen in a staggered manner. The workers will have to wear masks and arrangements will have to be made to provide food inside the units. The union government has divided districts across the country into red, orange and green zones based on the number of Covid-19 cases in these areas. As per the government order, 170 districts have been marked red zones, 207 have been identified as orange zones, out of the country’s 720 districts. The red zones in Haryana are Gurugram, Faridabad, Nuh and Palwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/manesar-industries-likely-to-resume-operations-from-april-20/story-N9Od4nSHF7vs3Q8HGvJebO.html
18-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjabi singer held with 30gm opium||The Mohali police on Friday arrested a 29-year-old Punjabi singer Gurinder Pal Singh, popularly known as Vada Garewal, after 30 gram opium was recovered from his possession.Police had booked the accused at a hospital in Sohana, where the latter was admitted due to drug overdose. On the information of the hospital authorities, police reached the spot and started the investigation.A case was filed against the singer after police recovered 30gm of opium from him. To ascertain what drug had been consumed by the accused, the hospital authorities took the blood samples and sent them for forensic examination, the report of which is still awaited.Mohali deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ramandeep Singh said that police had received information from the hospital regarding Gurinder’s admission owing to drug overdose. “It was after the doctors declared him fit that the accused was arrested and sent to jail,” said DSP.Amid all this, a picture of the accused in the hospital was shared by another Punjabi singer Elly Mangat, who is also a close friend of the accused. Through the social media post, Mangat said that the accused was hospitalised due to some medical complications. He requested his fans to not believe in rumours that Grewal was hospitalised due to drug overdose.Vadda Grewal hailing from Sangrur had started his singing career in 2014 with the song “Rooh,” the lyrics of which were also written by him. Grewal has been a part of a few Punjabi films and web series including Gangland (2018), Shooter (2020) and Zindagi Zindabaad. He also made an appearance in the movie Nikka Zaildar 3.Garewal’s name had even been under Punjab Police’s radar for being too proactive on live videos during the Elly-Rammy Randhawa spat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjabi-singer-held-with-30gm-opium/story-YpaJjNJ8KV5oIYC5VDRStO.html
18-04-2020||Gurugram||10% of Gurugram’s biomedical garbage is related to Covid-19||In just one month since March 16 when Gurugram reported its first positive case of Covid-19, biomedical waste associated with the suspected and positive Covid-19 patients has come to account for about 10% of total quantum of biomedical waste generated in the district. The district is presently producing about 400 kilograms of Covid-19 related biomedical waste per day (against 3,800 kilograms of biomedical waste generated from other medical services) from 36 health care facilities, isolation wards and testing centres, and quarantined homes. This is according to data provided by Biotic, the district concessionaire for biomedical waste management.While the concessionaire directly collects Covid-19 waste from hospitals, testing centres and isolation wards, suspected or confirmed patients under quarantine have been provided yellow bags to dispose of possibly infected waste, such as head caps, masks, and tissues. The civil surgeon’s office is coordinating collection from these homes and quarantine centres, officials said. The waste is then sent to any of four collection centres in the district, where two Biotic vehicles dedicated only to collecting Covid-19 waste make pick-ups from. About 30 drivers and workers are involved in the collection of biomedical waste in the district. The waste is then incinerated at a common biomedical waste treatment facility in Sector 37, at temperatures of over 800 degrees Celsius. Another 30 plant operators and sanitation workers are involved in this process. “The usual municipal waste collector is not involved in collection and treatment of Covid-19 related waste,” said Neeraj Yadav, deputy medical superintendent, Gurugram.With non-essential surgeries being deferred and out-patient departments functioning at a decreased capacity, the quantum of routine (non-Covid) biomedical waste has dipped. “While the district was earlier producing about 5.5 tonnes of routine biomedical waste per day, this has now dipped to about 3.8 tonnes per day,” said Vikas Gahlot, spokesperson for Biotic.Quantum of covid-19 waste set to increaseThe National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) have issued guidelines for the safe handling and disposal of Covid-19 related waste. With India having expanded its testing criteria and capabilities for Covid-19, and experts predicting that the outbreak’s peak is still a few weeks away, the quantity of biomedical waste generated due to the pandemic is set to increase manifold. Dr Sushila Kataria, an internal medicine specialist at Medanta hospital who was involved in the treatment of 14 Italian tourists who were brought to the city from Jaipur, said, “Treatment of a confirmed Covid-19 case generates about 15 times more waste than an average patient. From what they wear to the plates you serve them food in, everything gets disposed.”In Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, the total amount of biomedical waste shot up by six times in the wake of the pandemic, explained Sourabh Manuja, an environment and waste management fellow at The Energy Research Institute (TERI). “We have also been seeing reports from the US and Italy, which are struggling to deal with the mountains of Covid-19 related waste,” said Manuja. However, Biotic’s Gahlot said, “There is no cause for alarm yet. Our facility in Gurugram can handle an intake of up to 20 tonnes of biomedical waste, Covid-19 and routine, per day. At the moment, we are operating at only 20 to 25% capacity per day, so for the foreseeable future we are equipped to handle an increase.” Lack of PPE for collection staff There are other issues, which have begun to plague the district’s biomedical waste management system. These include a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for those involved in collecting and treating waste, and an increase in operating capital.“We have a staff of close to 60 people, including drivers, collectors and waste handlers. We have had to pay them incentives to keep working in a high-risk scenario. With routine waste being reduced, and with costs of PPE going up, we are expecting a 30% dip in revenue for April,” Gahlot explained.Three-ply surgical masks, which Biotic was earlier purchasing at a wholesale price of 62 paise per unit, are now being purchased at Rs 11 per unit. Similarly, the cost of one unit of PPE has increased from Rs 400-Rs 600 to Rs 900-Rs 1,400.“More worryingly, there is a shortage of PPEs in the market. We only have stock for another nine or 10 days. After that, we will require some assistance from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram to procure PPEs. We have written to the MCG and to the chief secretary, Haryana, to help us procure them at cheaper prices through government channels. So far we have been buying PPEs independently,” said Gahlot.Challenge to waste managementExperts have said that both biomedical and municipal waste management systems in Gurugram, as with the rest of the country, will be challenged by the Covid-19 outbreak, particularly given their poor compliance with Central guidelines, such as the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016.“Only half of all health care facilities in Gurugram are following the necessary barcoding procedure, which helps us track how much waste is generated and how much is treated,” said an official in the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), who requested anonymity. Such a flaw in the system, according to TERI’s Manuja, may lead to inadvertent ‘leakages’ of hazardous waste, which, in turn, poses adverse health impacts for waste and sanitation workers.Equally worrying, experts said, is the fact that many households are now producing biomedical waste of their own, which may cause further transmission of the virus through surface contamination. A study, recently published in New England Journal of Medicine, states that the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, may continue to live on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours. “These are all materials commonly found in household waste,” said Natasha Zarine, a solid waste management expert from Aurangabad, Maharashtra, who is working with the municipal corporation there to improve working conditions for waste pickers during the outbreak. “Without proper segregation, one might be putting the lives of sanitation workers, waste pickers, and health workers at risk. Municipal authorities need to ensure full protective gear for these people,” Zarine added. Dr Rajib Dasgupta, associate professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, said, “While household items, such as fabrics and other surfaces, can be washed and disinfected, tissues, face masks and single-use applications which may contain nasa-pharngyeal secretions will remain infectious for some time, and must be disposed keeping this in mind. Those involved in sanitation work should be given full protective gear as they are more at risk.”With this in mind, experts have advocated for a third level of segregation to ensure that possibly infectious waste does not make its way into the general municipal waste system. “Given the general state of waste collection in India, the system will come under pressure. A third level of segregation is imperative to contain the outbreak, especially if the waste is infectious,” said Swati Sambyal, an independent waste management expert and former head of the Centre for Science and Energy’s waste monitoring programme.Both the NCDC and CPCB guidelines state that, for those practicing ‘home care’, all biomedical waste must be collected separately in yellow bags and handed over to authorised waste collector until it is picked up by the biomedical waste facility.What district administration saysAccording to health officials, such segregation is being enforced in homes where residents have either tested positive or have been advised to self-quarantine. Meanwhile, for other households at large, an advisory has been issued by the district administration to dispose of single-use items (such as masks) separately, and with adequate care. The advisory also clearly states that possibly infectious waste should be left alone, “in a tightly knotted plastic lined dustbin where it can be left for 48 hours to avoid spread of the virus”. In a press release issued on April 14, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, “Just as it is necessary to wear a face mask to avoid coronavirus infection, it is also necessary to safely dispose face masks after use. Anyone wearing the mask should take care to not touch the front of the mask, as it may contain germs. All the district residents should understand these methods of disposal to keep themselves and others around them safe.” While representatives of multiple private hospitals in the city declined to comment, or did not respond to requests seeking comment for this story, JS Punia, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “All medical waste must be handled and disposed of in accordance with the Centre’s biomedical waste management rules, which are adequate.”Meanwhile, Ecogreen Energy, the MCG’s concessionaire for solid waste management, is also taking precautions to protect general waste collectors from contracting Covid-19. A spokesperson for Ecogreen said, “Our waste collectors who are going to other homes have been provided masks, hand sanitizers, and briefed on how to stay safe. Garbage is being collected from people’s homes regularly and with great caution. Thermal scans and health check-ups are also being provided for all employees. Garbage cars are also being sanitized three times a day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-waste-accounts-for-10-of-gurugram-s-biomedical-refuse/story-Zf4FZR0UuPM8MIwrlPBvdP.html
18-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram businessman held for shooting at neighbour’s dog for ‘barking too much’||A 44-year-old man was arrested on Thursday for allegedly shooting at his neighbour’s dog with a pellet gun at a gated township in Sector 47, Gurugram. The police said the man allegedly shot at the dog because it was barking “too much”. The dog’s condition is reported to be stable and it sustained minor injuries. According to the police, the arrested man is a resident of a gated township in Sector 47 and is a businessman. In the police complaint, the owner of the dog alleged that her dog, of the St Bernard species, was shot at in the middle of his eyes on Tuesday. She further said the suspect allegedly shot it while he was standing in his balcony. “I am very shocked and dismayed at the brutal nature of our neighbours,” she added. The complainant said she had submitted ‘photographic’ evidence to the police regarding the incident. The police said they recorded the statement of the dog owner and filed a case against the suspect. A police officer privy to the investigating said, “We arrested him on Thursday. We are investigating the case.”A case was registered against the suspect under section 11 (treating animals cruelly) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and Section 428 (whoever commits mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animals or animal of the value) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sadar police station on Thursday. Police said that the arrested man was later granted bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-44-year-old-businessman-held-for-shooting-at-neighbour-s-dog-for-barking-too-much/story-lbJ6uHbgvgsukQEspmh5EL.html
18-04-2020||City||E-learning the way ahead for all students during lockdown, say HT Chandigarh readers||Experiment with e-learning options for the futureOne can access educational videos through WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube on smart phones. Authorities should hand out such devices free to needy students after enlisting the voluntary help of companies that manufacture them. It will be their historic contribution to a good cause during the lockdown. This expenditure would be peanuts compared to the huge sums of money squandered on building, infrastructure, and equipment in schools, which have a dismally low utilisation index. In fact, this has major scope for an experiment of far-reaching consequences. Its success would encourage the powers that be to test its validity as a sensible replacement for classroom taching. It would be “adventurous” digital learning that intelligently utilises electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom. In successful cases, it could point to a wholesome course, programme or degree delivered completely online. SS BhattiGet students to work together, support each otherAllow students to work together. One student may be good at writing while another may be more creative so they can support each other. Trying out new technology trends can actually be fun for not just the teachers but students too. As teachers adopt new approaches, they will find it gives new life into material and creates excitement among their learners. The significant benefits of integrating technology into the classroom are that it offers a certain degree of flexibility not found in the traditional model of education.Kirti Dhall, PanchkulaCompanies, NGOs must step forwardPost Covid-19 there a need to make children from both the economically and financially wrecked communities fit enough to continue with their right to education. NGOs, education assistance app companies and other major companies out there have an obligation in arduous times like these to divert their CSR budgets towards bringing the right e-learning resources and accessibility to the less privileged. The government is working a lot for the country and acting like a shield from the onerous world emergency in the wake of the Covid-19 and it is the duty of NGOs and financially brawny firms to lend a hand and help the country come out of the current catastrophe or else it’ll be curtains for our nation. Digital learning equity needs the much needed attention at the earliest.Rajesh Bansal, PanchkulaCommon, larger medium will workChildren from all strata of society can access e-learning if they are educated through a much common and larger medium. Schools and authorities can do this by broadcasting video lectures for students on All India Radio or Doordarshan and various other radio stations on specified time for specified classes. Time schedules should be circulated through various radio stations. NCERT books should also be translated into audio and video form.Saikrit GulatiTrain the teachersTeachers should be given adequate training for online teaching. Secondly, computers and smart phones should be provided to all the students. Thirdly, all villages and remote areas should have access to wifi. Fourthly, fast net speed and data resource should be ensured. Gurdev Singh, MohaliGive laptops to students in govt schoolsDigital learning for those who cannot afford mobile phones or laptops is possible only if each student gets a laptop in government institutions and teachers there are also given training in e-learning.Gurpreet S Malhotra, KansalCompanies should step forward to helpGiven that the fight against Covid-19 the coronavirus is going to be a long one, both the government and private school managements have a critical role to play in the digital empowerment of less privileged students and teachers. Companies producing digital equipment such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops should produce extra pieces for people who need it. NGOs and civil societies too should help the poor access digital classes. The government should also start digital classrooms for the lower strata so they do not lack in knowledge. The taxes paid by the aware citizens of India should be spent in this social cause and for the empowerment of less privileged students and teachers.Ishita Nara, Panchkula.Government schools should facilitate e-learningStudents of the lower strata join government schools where fees are exempted and food etc are provided free. Some of these schools lack basic facilities such as boards and chalks for even writing or even class rooms so it would be unreasonable to expect them to have digital learning mediums. Let the government educational institutes get all the digital means to teach them at their premises (with social distancing rules in place) and ensure they are exposed to learning that matches with the quality of education in other top schools.Suresh VermaTime to create special devices, softwareEconomically weaker people, bereft of even the three Rs, have access to network with cheap mobile sets. Digital distance learning is in vogue with many a university such as IGNOU, for higher classes. The focus now has to shift for imparting instruction at the primary level. For this, need of the hour is to design cheap mono-frequency-module mobile sets with audio-visual feature and in-built hard disc having flexible software containing study material separately for each class to obviate its misuse. These can be distributed free to EWS-children. Contact numbers of consultant teachers can be publicised. To start with, the above mobiles can be designed for nursery to Class-5. Post-Covid-19 era would warrant a sea change in our lifstyle.Lalit BharadwajStart with educational TV programmesWhile most of the children are able to access online lectures via the internet on smart phones or on desktops/laptops, there is still a group of children left behind, especially those who study in government schools. The government should start with certain television channels through which poor children can have access to education as now most of the families have television sets at home. The channels should have bifurcation according to different classes and lectures/programmes can be telecast during school timings. Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhLend students a helping handThe governments should provide digital facilities to needy students and teachers. The NGOs and civil society have not taken a keen interest in promoting digital classrooms in government institutions. It’s time everyone realised the critical role digital education can play for both teachers and students for ensuring the better future of the nation. It’s high time all key players came together to give especial attention to poor and government school going students.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliConduct English and technology classesIn the present scenario, it is very difficult to make lower strata people become tech savvy because either they don’t have smart phones, laptops or they are unable to handle apps like Zoom, Skype etc. Moreover, many are unable to understand the lectures in English. Audio recordings of lectures in Hindi can be sent to them. Those who are unable to access this facility can be taught later on when the schools reopen after the lockdown. For future e-learning, the government can provide them cheap smart phones at easy installments. The government should also make e-learning mandatory for specific topics to ensure teachers and students are familiarised with this process.Abhilasha Gupta, Mohali||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/e-learning-the-way-ahead-for-all-students-during-lockdown-say-ht-chandigarh-readers/story-biLEQBiER8gGhqsSXwh9mJ.html
18-04-2020||Mumbai||State clears plan for evacuation of over 1.3L intrastate labourers||The intrastate sugarcane migrant labourers stuck in districts away from their villages can finally head home as the state government cleared an evacuation plan on Thursday.As many as 1.31 lakh sugar cane cutters, largely from Marathwada, working for 38 factories have been stuck amid lockdown.The state government has allowed these workers to go back to their villages after they clear a health checkup by authorised medical officers and get a clearance certificate from them. The health checkup, transportation back to their villages as well as food along the way, the order says, has to be organised by the factories. The district collector will approve a list of workers willing to return home. The GR issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta stated that Maharashtra Sugar Co-operative Federation had informed the government of the stranded labourers who need to return to their own farms to harvest rabi crops. Social justice minister Dhananjay Munde tweeted, “The plan for your return to home has been approved and the government has issued directions for the same...”Meanwhile, the BMC announced that public toilets in Mumbai will be free for users during the lockdown as migrant workers are stranded in the city. ‘Did Shah call other CMs after protests?’ Maharashtra Congress chief and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat raised questions over the migrant crisis at Bandra. During a video conference, Thorat said, “Shah called up Uddhav Thackeray immediately after migrant workers flocked at Bandra on Tuesday.

18-04-2020||Delhi||Traffic cop who had tested positive for coronavirus released||A 49-year-old Delhi Police assistant sub-inspector, who was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital on April 7 after testing positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, was released on Friday released after his test reports showed no signs of the infection. The police said that six of the ASI’s family members, who had been quarantined at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Shahadra, were also released after a medical examination.The policeman, who was posted with the Hauz Khas circle traffic unit, was placed in isolation and home-quarantine on April 2. He had gone for a check-up at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where he was not recommended for a Covid-19 test due to few symptoms.However, as his condition deteriorated later, he had undergone testing at a private facility and was subsequently admitted to the Safdarjung Hospital. “He got his tests conducted at a private lab in Safdarjung Development Area and was found positive for Covid-19. Therefore, he was immediately admitted to Safdarjung Hospital for treatment. On April 9, his wife, who was also having a fever, three sons, a daughter-in-law and another woman who was staying with the family were quarantined at Rajeev Gandhi Hospital in Shahdara,” said a senior officer, who did not wish to be named.The deputy commissioner of police (South East), RP Meena, said the ASI’s family members were taken to LNJP Hospital on April 8 in a government ambulance and their tests were conducted the next day at the facility. A few neighbours of the family, who were in touch with the ASI, were also asked to quarantine themselves at home and report any symptom, Meena said.However, on Friday, the ASI’s test reports were negative for Covid-19 and he was discharged from the hospital. “His family members who were in Rajeev Gandhi Hospital were also discharged after their reports were negative,” he said.

As of Friday, 72 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in South district and eight containment zones have been identified. The process of drive-through testing involves filling out an online form, driving to the designated collection centre, displaying an identity proof, rolling down the car window, tilting the head back to allow the collection of swab samples from throat and nose, and then driving away. “We are located in the heart of south Delhi and accessible across a large catchment area. Our aim, currently, is to be of service to the community in the fight against Covid-19, and access to adequate testing is a must for so many people. The initiative by Dr Dangs Lab is a simple, easy and convenient way for people to come for testing, and minimises contact in the best way possible. We do hope this drive through the testing facility will be a help to many who need it urgently,” said Arjun Sharma, director, Select Citywalk.Dr Arjun Dang, the chief executive of Dr Dang’s Lab — one of the eight private labs approved in the city — said the decision to expand the number of drive-through centres was taken due to high demand at its first facility, in West Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh.“The West Delhi centre in Punjabi Bagh opened just last week and we have conducted approximately 150 tests there till now. To get a test done, the patient has to follow similar guidelines as with any other testing facility. The documents required will be a doctor’s prescription recommending the test, government-approved identification, and a TRF/proforma request form available online on the website. The person will also have to provide details of the car and registration number to ensure smooth facilitation. To ensure maximum safety and minimum exposure to both the patient and the medical staff collecting the samples, only one car can pass through the stretch at a time,” said Dr Dang. Each station has a dedicated sample collection officer for the procedure. The samples are collected from inside the car, through the window of the station by the designated medical officer. A series of signage is provided to guide visitors through the stations. The entire process, at the facility, is completed within 10-12 minutes. The reports are e-mailed and available on Dr Dang’s website within 24-36 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-second-drive-through-testing-centre-opens-at-south-delhi-s-select-citywalk-mall/story-xdfghWPsRMaf0a9ZU5sirK.html

After those delays, Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) officer incharge of crematoriums, Shrinivas Kandul, had said that steps were being taken to address the delays.A total of 49 persons have died of the Covid-19 disease in Pune as of April 17.On Friday evening, a Covid-19 body was brought to the Vaikunth crematorium from KEM hospital and as just two employees were present at the gas-fired crematorium, nothing could be done for almost one and a half hour .While the relatives maintained a safe distance as per the protocol, civic officials at the crematorium asked three sanitary staffers to put on the PPEs and assist in carrying the body to be placed in the furnace.Kandul acknowledged the delay said the situation needs to be fully appreciated. “We are trying our best to provide adequate staff. But the employees are also reluctant and unwilling to touch the body in spite of being provided with PPEs. The gas-fired furnaces are run by a contractor who has been told to increase the manpower for all the three shifts. He has assured to do so even as the PMC is making alternate arrangements,” Kandul said.Kandul said the issues at the Yerawada crematorium had been sorted out and there were no complaints of delays from there.He said that although six gas-fired crematoriums at different locations in the city had been linked to hospitals and earmarked for Covid-19 cremations, relatives had their preferences which was also a cause for delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-to-prevent-delay-conservancy-staff-assists-with-cremation-in-pune/story-8ITIu12ogT0cHwoHfaSQoJ.html

MPLAD funds can be used to upgrade facilities needed for Covid treatment. But converting ACI as an isolation centre is a bad decision,” said the minister.Last week, HT had highlighted that due to covid facility, ACI had to shift ICU patients to other rooms and patients requiring chemotherapy will have to use a dharamshala on campus. Also, 40 beds on the third floor of the ACI have been earmarked for Covid isolation facility.The minister accused the Congress-led Punjab government for poor distribution of dry ration among the underprivileged.MC commissioner Bikram Shergill said that 11,874 families have been provided dry ration kits between March 29 to April 16. He said the voluntary organisations have provided essential food items to 8,750 families till yesterday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-using-cancer-institute-as-covid-facility-harsimrat-to-punjab-govt/story-gbtF4SiIJQybXuVQhSYlbI.html

18-04-2020||Pune||7 members of Khadki family, Sassoon doctor and civic water dept employee among Covid-19 +ve||Seven family members of a Covid-19 positive patient in Khadki, a senior chest physician from Sassoon Hospital and a civic employee from Parvati water works were among those who tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus on Friday.The total number of positive cases on Friday rose to 501 in Pune and 52 in Pimpri-Chinchwad.On Friday, seven family members of a Covid-19 positive patient tested positive for the coronavirus infection in Khadki Cantonment, after which the entire area was sealed for the next three days as a precautionary measure.Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB) officials said a resident of the area had approached the Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Cantonment Hospital on April 7 with complaints of cold and cough. His swab samples were referred to Aundh Chest Hospital for the Covid-19 test which came positive on April 16. Eight family members were then put under quarantine, even as six tested positive for the virus. The remaining two family members have been advised home quarantine. None of them had a travel history outside Pune district.While swabs samples of other residents in the area were being collected for testing, the entire area was sealed on Friday. The total number of positive cases from Khadki Cantonment area is now eight.At Sassoon General Hospital, a senior chest physician tested positive two days after four nurses treating patients at the Covid19 ward in the hospital were quarantined for Covid19 infection.The doctor’s report came on Wednesday night and he was quarantined in the same ward where he was attending and treating patients along with the three nurses. District Collector Naval Kishore Ram confirmed the development and said the doctor was in a stable condition.“Since he is a pulmonary expert he got himself tested as soon as he got mild symptoms including sore throat and cold. He is now being quarantined at the hospital to continue his treatment,” Ram said.At the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), an employee working at the Parvati water works tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. The PMC then worked on a war footing and replaced the staff.PMC water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar confirmed the development and said, “We made alternate arrangements immediately and replaced the staff.According to Pawaskar, the employee had gone to visit a sick relative who was found to be Covid-19 positive. The PMC health department therefore took swab samples of all the family members and found that PMC employee was also positive, he said.Swab samples of all the employees who had come in close contact with this Covid-19 positive employee have been taken and the other employees have been asked to remain in quarantine, he said.Pawaskar said since a high number of positive cases are emerging from Bhavani peth area, he took a review two days ago of how many employees at Parvati water works were from Bhavani peth and other high risk areas. Accordingly, 20 employees were asked not to stay at home, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-members-of-khadki-family-sassoon-doctor-and-civic-water-dept-employee-among-covid-19-ve/story-g42gFfeTPTBJxzFJRGNBOI.html
18-04-2020||Chandigarh||HC asks Haryana to provide food, shelter to migrant labourers in Panipat||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday directed government to immediately examine and provide food and shelter to the migrant labourers stranded in Panipat. The directions in this regard were issued suo motu by the bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli acting on a plea in this regard. The matter was brought before the court by Indian Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), a labour union in Panipat, which had alleged that 4,314 migrant labourers in Panipat working in various factories were waiting for government help.The government had told the court that for providing food and shelter to the migrant labourers, nodal officers have been appointed. Helpline number 1100 has been notified and those migrant workers, identified by government teams, are being given ₹1,000 per week for a period of one month. As many as 29,533 labourers got themselves registered and after verification, 131,82 people, who were found eligible, have been granted the benefit under the government scheme, the court was told.The nodal officers are also monitoring the fair distribution of dry ration/cooked food and 772 people are residing in the 10 shelter homes set up in Panipat, the court was told, adding that any person in need of assistance even today can approach the authorities with his/her grievances and the same would be considered immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-asks-haryana-to-provide-food-shelter-to-migrant-labourers-in-panipat/story-0odCvquzYwIc3sqtbSbdFM.html
18-04-2020||Pune||Examine referral chain to investigate rising Covid-19 deaths at Sassoon, says Dr Arun Gadre||The abrupt transfer of the dean of BJ Medical College - Sassoon General Hospital, Dr Ajay Chandanwale, at a time when the Covid-19 death toll is mounting in Pune, is a misplaced step, public healthcare crusader, Dr Arun Gadre, has said.Rather than blame the hospital for the high number of deaths, the ‘referral chain’ needs to be investigated to identify weak links and reasons why patients were coming in an advanced/critical condition to the hospital, said Dr Gadre, a public healthcare crusader and coordinator of Sathi, a voluntary group for advocacy and training in health initiatives.The Maharashtra government, on Wednesday night, abruptly removed Dr Chandanwale as dean of Sassoon Hospital and he was transferred to Mumbai as Joint director of Directorate Medical Education.As of April 16, 46 deaths were recorded in Pune due to the Sars-Cov-2 virus of which 38 occurred in the Sassoon Hospital.While city politicians such as senior Congressman Arvind Shinde said he had complained to the government about alleged mismanagement by Dr. Chandanwale, the ousted dean had explained that most of the patients admitted to Sassoon were being brought in a very serious or critical stage with co-morbidity conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and asthma. “These patients come to Sassoon only when their condition is very serious and their survival becomes difficult despite our best effort,” he had said in an interview.About his transfer, he said, he would respect the order. The hospital, in a statement, had said that it was well-equipped with medical equipment, doctors and staff dedicated to the treatment of Covid-19 patients.Dr. Gadre said, “Late admissions could be one of the causes for the high deaths at Sassoon. It is my experience of 30 years that most government hospitals are used as ‘dumping grounds’ wherein patients are brought in at the very last stage. I would not like to use that word but that is the reality,” he said.Dr. Gadre noted that public hospitals like Sassoon and King Edwards Memorial Hospital (KEM) were heavily over-loaded with patients and were doing enormous work compared to their capacity. “Their image is unnecessarily being tarnished,” he said.About Dr. Chandanwale’s abrupt transfer he said, “As a doctor I felt that the fire was somewhere and the fire-fighting was being done somewhere else.”“The referral chain is weak somewhere. All the links in the chain- right from the testing stage to bringing the patient to the hospital- needs to be examined to find out where is the delay happening; why are patients coming late to Sassoon,” he said. Dr. Gadre felt that almost half the patients who had died could have survived had they come to Sassoon at an early stage. “This is what the government and the administration needs to tighten. If that is not done, the death toll at Sassoon is not going to reduce. This is the key issue that needs to be addressed and is not being addressed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/examine-referral-chain-to-investigate-rising-covid-19-deaths-at-sassoon/story-3mI1E1bBZHyPVHva9R9iWN.html
18-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt issues show-cause notice to LPU for violating Covid-19 lockdown norms||Days after a 21-year-old woman student and hostel inmate of Lovely Professional University (LPU) near here tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Punjab government issued a show-cause notice to the private institution for violating lockdown norms.In the notice issued on Thursday, the state higher education and language department asked Phagwara-based LPU, which also has foreign students on its rolls, to explain within seven days on why the no objection certificate issued to it should not be withdrawn for violating government orders and endangering the lives of 3,200 people, and many more.When contacted over phone, LPU additional director Aman Mittal said, “We have received the letter of the Punjab government and will file the reply.” He declined to comment further.‘IGNORED GRAVITY OF SITUATION’The notice said that the Punjab higher education minister had ordered the suspension of teaching in all institutions, including private ones, on March 13. “It has now come to light that in spite of the instructions, ignoring the gravity of the situation and jeopardising the lives of about 3,200 people and thousands of others to which infection can spread, you did not shut down completely,” the notice said.“Considering the highly infectious nature of the disease and despite the fact that there was sufficient time for you to send all students to their respective homes from March 13 to March 22, but for no reasons you continued with the functioning of the university and the hostels and made no effort to send them to their homes,” it said.MISLED LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONThe notice said: “It might be argued by you that the movement of students was not possible in the light of the complete lockdown. There is no denying the fact that norms about maintaining social distancing were flouted and the administration was informed that the university was shut and vacated, while that was not the case. It is amply clear that you did not pay any heed to instructions of the district administration on March 23 and kept it in dark. When the world is battling this deadly virus and the only remedy is complete isolation, your administration threw all instructions to the winds and put hundreds of lives at risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-govt-issues-show-cause-notice-to-lovely-professional-university-jalandhar-for-violating-covid-19-lockdown-norms/story-j6XlEzUjLgPFuJOTE09hpO.html
18-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: Bootleggers resort to innovative ways to smuggle liquor into Delhi-NCR||Ever since the 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) began on March 25, bootleggers are trying different ways to smuggle liquor from other states into the national Capital. Among the many who attempted to smuggle liquor defying prohibition, there was a sanitation worker who misused his curfew pass, a vegetable supplier’s driver who had covered liquor bottles with vegetables in his truck, and an Uttar Pradesh resident who tried to smuggle alcohol in milk canisters fitted to his bike.Delhi Police personnel, especially those posted at the Delhi-Haryana border have been instructed by their superiors to be extra vigilant and check for suspicious vehicles entering the city. In Dwarka’s police district, which shares its border with Haryana, the police have busted 17 cases of illicit liquor smuggling since March 25.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe police said that they have registered at least 60 cases under Excise Act since March 25.The government has ordered liquor shops across the city to shut down during the nationwide lockdown. It has not been included in the list of essential services, such as grocery, milk or medicines. Over the past one week, two break-ins have been reported at two liquor shops in Mundka and Roshanara Road. Though police officers did not reveal details of the Mundka case, in the Roshanara road case, the police suspect the theft is the work of amateur thieves. The thieves, an officer said, stole only a few crates and did not touch most of the liquor inside the shop. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakA senior Delhi police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that most of the illicit liquor is being smuggled from Haryana. “We busted an interesting case last week. At Bhalswa Dairy, we stopped a suspicious vehicle carrying vegetables to the Azadpur vegetable market. Movement of vehicles carrying vegetables is allowed because they come under the essential goods. Our two constables at the spot found the vehicle driver suspicious and signalled him to stop. On checking the mini truck, we found 70 cartons that had around 3,360 small bottles of liquor hidden under raw vegetables,” the police officer said. Over the last two weeks, the police have also arrested one of their own for smuggling. An assistant sub-inspector, who lived in Haryana, was caught on Monday while trying to smuggle around 1,432 small bottles of liquor from Haryana into Delhi. The police said the man wanted to make some money by selling liquor at a higher price.The police said that interrogation of many illicit liquor smugglers have revealed that the smuggled liquor is being sold in Delhi for at least three times its manufacturer’s retail price (MRP).In at least three cases, the police have also found people misusing the curfew passes. Two men, who were issued curfew passes for their vehicles as part of the municipal agency’s sanitation department, were arrested in Mundka for smuggling liquor. The police say that the two were carrying the liquor for their own consumption.“There were some who were desperate alcoholics and were smuggling it for themselves or their friends but in most cases, the smugglers were professional liquor smugglers. Because shops are closed in Delhi they are using this time to make money,” said an officer of the crime branch.In the case of a milkman who was arrested with seven liquor bottles last week at South Avenue near Rashtrapati Bhavan, the man had hidden the liquor bottles in four milk canisters. His interrogation revealed that he was carrying the liquor to Bulandshahr for his cousin’s birthday.Additional commissioner of police MS Randhawa said police officers across the city, especially those at the border, have been told to be extra vigilant to ensure there is no smuggling of liquor. “Smuggling of liquor is an offence. Our officers at the borders are checking suspicious vehicles since the lockdown was enforced. Apart from ensuring that only vehicles under essential services enter the city, our officers are also checking suspicious vehicles. Over the last few days, we have also busted many cases of illicit liquor smuggling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bootleggers-resort-to-innovative-ways-to-smuggle-liquor-into-capital-60-cases-filed/story-8ApbfR1a7Qpv0RQZKXkwAK.html
18-04-2020||World||Pak scrambles to track Tablighi Jamaat followers after Covid-19 cases rise||As the head of the Faisalabad chapter of the Tablighi Jamaat died of coronavirus on Friday, the Pakistan government has said it is still trying to trace and isolate thousands of members of the organisation who attended a religious gathering on the outskirts of Lahore in mid-March.This effort comes at a time when the Pakistan government and religious organizations, including the Tablighi Jamaat, are in talks over holding congregational prayers during the holy month of Ramazan that starts in about a week.There is confusion within the Imran Khan government on how to proceed. While Prime Minister Khan has not spoken his mind yet, his cabinet colleagues are divided on the issue.While de-facto health minister Dr Zafar Mirza has pushed for the ongoing restrictions on congregation prayers to continue, senior minister Shaikh Rasheed told the media on Saturday that he was not in favour of such a ban. Science minister Fawad Chaudhry, in a tweet, singled out the Tablighi Jamaat for the spread of the virus in Pakistan.It is this confusion, say observers, that will push up the numbers of those infected by Sars-CoV-2 virus in the days to come. With over 7,600 confirmed cases and deaths nearing 150 count, experts have warned that numbers could balloon in days to come.An important role in the spread is being played by the members of the Tablighi-Jamaat.Police officials say that about 100,000 people attended the Raiwind Ijtema, which is an annual event, at a time when the coronavirus crisis was brewing. The Jamaat estimates over 200,000 attended the congregation.This included the 3,000-odd people from abroad including China, Indonesia, Nigeria and Afghanistan, the organisers said. About half of them are now quarantined in Pakistan, the others left the country without being tested.Gaza’s health ministry confirmed last month its first two cases of coronavirus were Palestinians who had attended the gathering.On the whole, about 7,000 followers have been quarantined in Lahore, while all over Punjab 10,263 quarantined of which 539 have tested positive for the virus so far. Almost 600 members have been quarantined in Raiwind itself. In Sindh province up to 8,000 Tablighis have been quarantined.Local media quoted health officials in Punjab as saying that that the coronavirus cases are rising in Punjab because of the ‘carelessness’ of the Tableeghi Jamaat members who keep on meeting the public as a part of their preaching after their return to the areas they belonged to.Looking back, many have questioned why the government allowed the gathering to take place in the first place. One reason for this could be the cozy relationship enjoyed by the Tablighi Jamaat and the Pakistani establishment.The Jamaat has a big following within the Pakistan armed forces. A number of Generals have been members of the Jamaat. Many serving and retired officers attend the gathering each year. In the early 90’s, the head of the ISI - General Javed Nasir, was also a Jamaat member. Given such influence, it is hard, say observers, to challenge the Jamaat’s decisions.Some insist that the change would have to come from within the Jamaat. One of the leading figures of the Jamaat, Maulana Tariq Jamil, is considered a mentor by prime minister Imran Khan. The prime minister has repeatedly turned to the cleric for guidance on religious issues. It is believed that Imran Khan’s stance on the coronavirus is tempered by the statements made by Maulana Jamil.After the Lahore event, Tariq Jamil gave a speech in which he said: “God chooses who is infected and who is not, and God will save us.”By 1 April, Jamil had changed his views somewhat when for the first time he described the virus as life-threatening.But Jamil and others continue to resist calls for restrictions on congregational prayers. In fact, some fear that Jamaat supporters would resort to violence if forced to stay away from mosques. In the Punjab city of Layyah, a member stabbed a police officer while trying to escape from a Tablighi Jamaat centre as quarantining measures were being enforced.Negotiations have brought some results as well. Last week, Tablighi Jamaat elders sent out a letter to the movement’s followers instructing them to stop their door-to-door visits and not to congregate.And yet the Pakistan government is shy of a complete lockdown on prayers and other activities that the religious organizations are calling for. Possibly if the situation deteriorates, the army leadership will once again have to step in to let sanity prevail, say some.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-scrambles-to-track-tablighi-jamaat-followers-after-covid-19-cases-rise/story-UWGZq1lipoWVpiyXZs8hMN.html
18-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Donald Trump scales down US toll projection to 65K; backs, instigates protestors||President Donald Trump on Friday said he expects US fatalities from the coronavirus to be much lower than projected earlier because of a “lot of work” done by his administration and came out in support of protestors seeking removal of social-distancing restrictions in Democratic-ruled states.“Right now, we’re heading at probably around 60-, maybe 65,000,” the president told reporters at the daily White House briefing about his assessment of the state of the epidemic in the United States, where 37,079 people had died till Saturday morning, with 706,779 confirmed cases of infections.The president’s assessment is much in line with revised projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which has been routinely cited by White House experts and others. It has lowered its projection of COVID-19 deaths in the United States from 80,000 at the start of the crisis to 60,308 Covid-19 deaths in the United States based on the current social-distancing measures in force.Experts of the president’s White House task force had a more dire projection of up to $2.2 million if no mitigation efforts were undertaken and to 240,000 even if mitigation efforts such as social-distancing were enforced “perfectly”.There is much more optimism now based on an assessment that the United States has past its peak, a vast number of counties have not reported new cases in the last seven days, hospitalization numbers have dropped in New York state, the epicentre of the US epidemic, and there has been a flattening of the curve on other metrics.President Trump unveiled a set of federal guidelines Thursday for states to follow, at the discretion of the governors, to begin reopening the country based on the growing optimism among his experts and, equally, frustration among businesses, employers and employees ruined by the lockdown.Protestors have taken to the streets in varying numbers across the country demanding an end to the restrictions. Most of them have been identified as supporters of the president, who has backed them and acknowledged being in agreement with them.On Friday however, the president fired off a series of tweets supporting protests only in states ruled by Democratic governors. The language used in the posts was both supportive and incendiary. “Liberate Virginia”, “Liberate Michigan” and “Liberate Minnesota”, he wrote in separate posts.Michigan is among the worst hit states with more than 30,000 cases and 2,200 fatalities. Virginia has fared far better with a little more than 7,400 cases and 230 deaths. But neither state has reported declining numbers, a key “gatekeeping” criteria laid down by his administration’s reopening guidelines.The president justified his tweets when asked about them at the briefing and said the restrictions in these states were “very powerful” and “you can get the same result out of doing a little bit less”.The president has been eager to reopen the country and put it back to work as the epidemic has devastated the economy, shut down small and medium businesses such as restaurants, theaters and all other non-essential services, crippled large corporations specially in the aviation sector, and left 22 million people jobless.Disbursement of loans, grants and direct cash payments are underway to businesses and families from a $2.2 trillion relief package announced last month to mitigate the hardship. On Friday, the American president announced $18 billion in relief for farmers and ranchers, which include direct cash payments and farm purchases to be delivered to food banks.Grocery stores have limped back to normalcy from the early days of the epidemic when people cleaned up shelves fearing shortages. Food products are available in plenty now (not toilet rolls or sanitizers), but shopping is now subject to social-distancing guidelines, in varying degrees of severity.The use of face coverings such as masks are mandatory in public settings where social-distancing is not possible in some states, such as Florida.

As of Saturday, the UK-wide number of cases tested positive for the virus was 114,217 (day-rise of 5,526).The queen, who moved to the Windsor Castle after the Boris Johnson government announced lockdown and other measures in March, earlier delivered a rare message to the Commonwealth, striking an optimistic note: “We will meet again”.Krishan Arora, a doctor practicising for 27 years in Croydon, London, passed away after being infected by the virus, health officials announced. He is one of over 50 Indian and other non-white medical professionals who passed away in recent days.Unions warned on Saturday that the continuing shortage of personal protection equipment could lead to medical staff refusing to work in hospitals dealing with thousands of patients. Some hospitals reportedly asked the staff to use aprons instead of standard gowns.Sara Gorton of Unison union said: “If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it’s no longer safe for them to work. No part of the NHS should use this move as an excuse to ration supplies of gowns when they still have stocks. That would cause a damaging breakdown of trust at a time when staff are working under intense pressure.”Health secretary Matt Hancock admitted during a hearing of the House of Commons health and social care select committee on Friday that the NHS was “tight on gowns”, describing it as a “pressure point”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-sombre-birthday-for-queen-elizabeth-as-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-15-000/story-uexGtBBws6wV6njuWsQA7H.html
18-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: China cancelling clinical trials for lack of test subjects as case numbers fall||Several clinical trials of drugs including one of the first to be identified as a potential anti-Covid-19 medicine, remdesivir, have been cancelled in China because of the lack of testing candidates.As of Thursday, 598 novel coronavirus-related clinical trials had been registered in China but some 40 had been cancelled. According to a state news agency, Xinhua report earlier this week, in all three have been allowed to go ahead with clinical trials including one, which is now in the second stage.The application for these trials were withdrawn ahead of the deadline to register them earlier this week, Zhong Nanshan, who is leading the team of experts advising the Chinese government on Covid-19 outbreak was quoted by the China Science Daily.Zhong said the lack of available testing subjects was because the outbreak had passed its peak in China and the government had been able to contain the spread.The Chinese mainland reported a total of 26 new cases including 17 new imported cases of the novel coronavirus disease Friday, bringing the total number of imported cases to 1,566, the national health commission (NHC) said Saturday.Overall China has reported 4632 deaths and nearly 82800 cases of Covid-19.Since the third week of March, China’s daily increase in Covid-19 cases has been in the dozens with imported cases accounting for most new ones.The sharp drop in patients has hampered trials, Zhong said.According to Zhong many studies had to be cancelled because no one expected that China would control the epidemic so quickly.“Now there is no opportunity for large-scale clinical drug or treatment research in China,” he said.The clinical trial of remdesivir for treatment of Covid-19 involving mild or moderate cases has been suspended in China for the reason that the waning outbreak made it impossible to enroll enough eligible patients, according to clinicaltrials.gov, a website maintained by the US government. A separate trial of the experimental drug for patients with severe symptoms in China was terminated Friday for similar reasons, said Daniel O’Day, CEO of the American drugmaker, in an open letter.“The publication of data from the China remdesivir trials rests with the Chinese investigators, but we have been informed that the study in patients with severe symptoms was stopped due to stalled enrollment,” O’Day said.Seven clinical trials on the drug were initiated, the CEO said.An US health news website said the initial results from the drug’s trial have been positive.“A Chicago hospital treating severe Covid-19 patients with Gilead Sciences’ antiviral medicine remdesivir in a closely watched clinical trial is seeing rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, with nearly all patients discharged in less than a week,” STAT news reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-china-cancelling-clinical-trials-for-lack-of-test-subjects-as-case-numbers-fall/story-QBEj3ymu0UqzZFJWdeoWiO.html
18-04-2020||World||‘Game on if...’: Experts put stake on Oxford’s coronavirus vaccine trial results by May end||It will be ‘game on’ if ongoing human trials for a coronavirus vaccine in the University of Oxford show strong immune response by the middle or end of May, a senior academic on the UK government’s newly-formed taskforce on vaccines said on Saturday.Several vaccine-related projects are in progress in the UK and elsewhere. Sarah Gilbert of Oxford believes that a vaccine could be available by September. Business secretary Alok Sharma announced the taskforce and multi-million pound funding for projects on Friday.Academic John Bell, who is a member of the taskforce, said the UK currently does not have the capacity to produce the amount of vaccine it needs to tackle coronavirus, but “is in a really good place” for vaccine development.On the ongoing trial in Oxford and whether the vaccine could be produced in the near future, he said the real question was whether it would be effective: “We won’t get a signal for that until May. The crucial thing is you have to do a proper trial because safety is really important for these things.”“But if we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. And they may well get across the finish line by mid-August,” he told BBC.Bell and other experts such as Gilbert believe that the next challenge is to set in motion production processes so that it can be made widely soon.Bell added: “One of the reasons that we were rushing is to try and catch this wave of the disease. Because when the disease goes away there will be very, very few incident cases until we get a second wave”.“The team developing the vaccine are very keen to get it out in its trial now so that we can catch the remainder of this wave”.Announcing the taskforce at the Downing Street briefing, Sharma said: “UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts”.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible”.One new project led by the University of Oxford will trial an anti-malarial drug believed to have anti-inflammatory properties to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups.Other projects include Imperial College London testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies; and Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus.As of Friday, the UK had 14,576 deaths and 108,692 cases, as concerns mounted over lack of personal protection equipment for medical staff. Officials believe social distancing and other curbs are leading to a ‘gradual decline’ in the number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/game-on-experts-put-stake-on-oxford-s-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-results-by-may-end/story-AbH6Ihht4TwKXL04kEkFcI.html
18-04-2020||World||Covid-19: US, China, Britain and South Korea debate easing virus restrictions as economies falter||Governments around the world are wrestling with when and how to lift economically painful virus-control measures as unemployment rises and rent payments come due. Many places have mandated strict restrictions on movement to try to stop the spread of a new coronavirus that has infected more than 2.2 million people and for which there is no vaccine. The debate in the U.S. has taken on political tones. Republican President Donald Trump urged supporters to “LIBERATE” three states led by Democratic governors, tweeting the kind of rhetoric some have used to demand an end to stay-at-home orders that have thrown millions out of work. Most governments remain cautious, even as the economic toll rises. Public health experts warn that easing shutdowns must be accompanied by wider testing and tracing of infected people to keep the virus from coming back. South Korea’s Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said Saturday that new guidelines could be issued soon that officials have said would allow people to engage in “certain levels of economic and social activity.” America’s largest state, California, lost nearly 100,000 jobs in March. “We are now in a pandemic-induced recession,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. Texas and Florida, which both have Republican governors, took first steps toward easing restrictions. Top leaders of China’s ruling Communist Party called for deficit spending and a more flexible monetary policy after the economy shrunk 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year. The outbreak has killed more than 150,000 people worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally based on figures supplied by government health authorities around the globe. The number all but certainly underestimates the actual toll. Authorities said that almost everywhere, thousands have died with COVID-19 symptoms — many in nursing homes — without being tested for the virus, and have thus gone uncounted. In Britain, with an official count of about 14,600 dead, the country’s statistics agency said the actual number could be around 15% higher. An Associated Press tally from news media reports and state health departments indicates 6,912 U.S. deaths have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The U.S. government has not been releasing a count. China reported Saturday a nearly 40% increase in its death toll to 4,632 victims, reflecting a major upwards revision made the previous day by authorities in Wuhan, the nation’s hardest-hit city. The official death toll in the U.S. has topped 35,000, with more than 700,000 confirmed infections. Protesters fed up with the economy-strangling restrictions have taken to the streets in several U.S. states. In Idaho, where the governor is a Republican, scores of protesters not wearing masks stood shoulder-to-shoulder Friday. Some carried signs claiming the coronavirus is a hoax. “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, “ Trump said in a tweet-storm in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticizing the federal response. Cuomo “should spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining,’” the president said. Governors of both parties suggested they would move carefully, with some warning that they can’t do it without help from the federal government to expand testing for the virus. “The president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and is deadly,” Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state, said. Responding to pleas from governors for help in ramping up testing, Trump put the burden back on them: “The States have to step up their TESTING!” The American president, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to see businesses reopen quickly, had his health team lead an extensive briefing outlining that adequate testing capacity exists to get states through the first phase of White House guidelines on how they should reopen. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said stores could begin selling curbside, nonessential surgery could resume and state parks could reopen. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said municipalities could reopen beaches and parks if they could do so safely. But in Iowa, more than a dozen elected officials implored Tyson Fresh Meats to close a pork processing plant, saying the virus is spreading among workers and endangering employees and the surrounding community. Company spokeswoman Liz Croston said worker temperatures are taken before entering the plant, masks are required and cleaning has been increased as has distancing between workers. She said the company is focused on protecting workers and “continuing to fulfill our critical role of feeding families in this community and around the nation, while providing market continuity for hundreds of area hog farmers.” In Hawaii, Gov. David Ige ordered a moratorium on evictions of people from their homes for failure to pay rent in a state where more than one-third of the labor force has applied for unemployment benefits. Schools will remain closed through the summer, officials said, with plans undecided for the next school year.

The navy was carrying out a deep clean of the three ships to disinfect them.Taiwan has only reported 398 coronavirus cases and six deaths, a far lower number than many of its neighbours due to strict measures taken in the early stages of the outbreak to contain its spread.The president of Palau, Tommy Remengesau, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that his country of 20,000 people had not had a single case of the coronavirus and he was going to shut it off from the outside world to keep the virus out.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard Editing by Robert Birsel)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-to-quarantine-700-navy-sailors-after-coronavirus-outbreak/story-qWQbVyCRhvTJsaQFHZ0WJK.html

Another 1,832 have recovered.The largest province of Punjab registered 3,391 patients, followed by Sindh with 2,217, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 1,077, Balochistan 335, Gilgit-Baltistan 250, Islamabad 163 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir with 48 patients.The ministry showed that so far 92,548 tests have been conducted, including 6,416 in the last 24 hours.The steady rise continued despite hectic efforts to contain the spread.One of the biggest hurdles being faced by the authorities has been to convince clerics to stop congregational prayers in mosques.President Arif Alvi on Friday held talks with Jamaat-i-Islami chief Senator Sirajul Haq, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith chief Senator Sajid Mir and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Rana Tanveer Hussain over prayer congregations.He was poised to continue consultations on Saturday to convince the clerics from different sectors to avoid big gatherings in the upcoming month of Ramzan.Prime Minister Imran Khan is also expected to meet religious leaders to take them into confidence over the vital issue.So far Tablighi Jamaat has promised to cooperate and its chief Maulana Nazarur Rehman appealed to his followers to follow official direction in Ramzan.But a group of hardline clerics led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman and Mufti Taqi Usmani wanted to let the clerics decide the opening of mosques without any interference by the government.Meanwhile, Minister for Religious Affairs Pir Noorul Haq Qadri, who is also a religious leader, on Friday asked the fellow clerics to abide by the guidelines of the government in order to defeat coronavirus.On Friday, several incidents of violation of official directives were reported. But the situation was better than the previous Friday when scuffled took place between police and worshippers outside a mosque in Karachi.In stark violation of the government orders, a recalcitrant cleric of Red Mosque had been holding regular Friday congregation in the heart of capital Islamabad.Maulana Abdul Aziz refused to cooperate and the government was unable to remove him from the pulpit of a mosque which is owned by government’s religious affairs ministry.The government has said that only five worshippers including those who are associated with the affairs of the mosques are allowed to offer congregational prayers.Meanwhile, it was reported that two women who returned to Pakistan from India via the Wagah border tested positive for the novel coronavirus. They were part of 41 people that returned to the country, according to The Express Tribune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-struggles-to-rein-in-defiant-clerics-as-covid-19-cases-near-7-500/story-mGHEYdUje5O6my6XRqkfoO.html

As many as 1,058 patients are still being treated and 77,029 have been discharged from hospitals.On Friday, Wuhan’s officials announced that as of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases was raised by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869.No deaths due to Covid-19 were reported on Friday.The latest revision of figures came amidst sharp criticism of China by the US, the UK and other countries for its alleged under-reporting of the coronavirus cases, lack of transparency and cover-up of the origin of the viral strain, which emerged in Wuhan in December last year, reportedly from the local Huanan sea food market.The way Covid-19 cases were counted in China was changed in January and February, leading to widespread confusion over the extent of the health crisis in the world’s most populous country.But China denied that it had covered up the extent of its Covid-19 outbreak.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that the virus’s rapid spread had contributed to under-counting that resulted in China raising its death toll earlier in the day. However, he emphasised that “there has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment.” On Saturday. the NHC said 27 new confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported of which 17 were imported.The other 10 new cases were domestically transmitted.This included seven new cases in Heilongjiang province, bordering Russia where cases went up following return of large number of Chinese nationals from various Russian cities and two in Guangdong province and one in Sichuan province.No death was reported on the mainland, the NHC said.As of Friday, the mainland has reported a total of 1,566 imported cases, it said.Also 54 new asymptomatic cases, including three from abroad, were reported, taking their total to 1,017.Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.By Friday, 1,021 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in Macao and 395 in Taiwan including six deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-imported-covid-19-cases-rise-to-1-566-revised-death-toll-4-632-report/story-HqSve3ZP21kHREv04MzCKM.html
18-04-2020||World||Covid-19 virus accidentally leaked by intern at Wuhan lab: Report||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday acknowledged Fox News report that the novel coronavirus (nCoV) may have been accidentally leaked by an intern working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.The Fox News in an exclusive report based on unnamed sources has claimed that though the virus is a naturally occurring strain among bats and not a bioweapon, but it was being studied in Wuhan laboratory. The initial transmission of the virus was bat-to-human, the news channel said, adding that the “patient zero” worked at the laboratory. The lab employee was accidentally infected before spreading the disease among the common people outside the lab in Wuhan city.The Wuhan wet market initially identified as the place of origin, Fox News said, never sold bats. However, China blamed the wet market to deflect blame from the laboratory, the report said.Also Watch l ‘I’m not happy’: Donald Trump slams China over handling of COVID-19 crisisThe virus was being studied in the lab as an attempt by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to “demonstrate that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of the United States,” Fox News said quoting multiple sources.At the daily White House briefing of the US President on Wednesday, Fox News reporter John Roberts while asking Trump about the claims said, “Multiple sources are telling Fox News today that the United States now has high confidence that, while the coronavirus is a naturally occurring virus, it emanated from a virology lab in Wuhan, that, because of lax safety protocols, an intern was infected, who later infected her boyfriend, and then went to the wet market in Wuhan, where it then began to spread.”President Trump neither confirmed nor denied the report, but noted that “more and more we’re hearing the story a” and we’ll see.” “We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened,” the President added.When pressed by Roberts about whether he had raised Chinese lab security in his recent call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Trump said, “I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory. It’s inappropriate right now.”The news channel said that China initially made efforts to cover up the outbreak. Quoting a source, the report said that this could be the “costliest government cover-up of all time.” Sources also characterized the World Health Organization (WHO) as being part of a cover-up from the very beginning, the report said.As per a recent Washington Post, two years ago, the US embassy officials in China raised concerns about the insufficient biosafety at the Chinese government’s Wuhan Institute of Virology where deadly viruses and infectious diseases are studied.Though the institute, located quite close to the Wuhan wet market, is China’s first biosafety level IV lab, the US state department had warned in 2018 about “serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory”.

18-04-2020||World||Japan expands testing as Covid-19 infections mount||Japan, alarmed by rising coronavirus deaths and the spectre of the collapse of the medical system, is scrambling to expand testing with drive-through facilities and general practitioners helping to collect samples.For weeks Japan has limited its testing for the coronavirus, which emerged in neighbouring China late last year, despite calls from many health experts who see testing as vital to detecting and isolating cases and slowing the spread.Japan conducted about 52,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in March, or just 16% of the number carried out in South Korea, according to data from Oxford University.Experts say Japan’s strategy of keeping the number of PCR tests low has made it difficult to trace the disease as it spread in Tokyo and other big cities and led to a wave of in-hospital infections, crippling some facilities.The decision to expand testing came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week expanded a state of emergency, originally issued for Tokyo and six other areas, to the entire country, and warned of the growing burden on health facilities.“With help from regional medical associations, we will set up testing centres. If home doctors have decided testing is necessary, test samples are taken at these centres and sent to private inspection firms,” Abe told a news conference on Friday.“Thus, the burden on public health centres will be lessened.”While the measures marked a shift in policy, it remains to be seen how effective they will be, experts say, as Japan struggles with red tape, staff shortages and the absence of centralized decision-making with no single agency coordinating the response to the disease.There has been widespread criticism that phone lines for public health centres, set up by local governments and tasked to conduct screening for PCR test candidates, are always busy as people become more worried about infection.Tokyo remains the hardest-hit place in Japan, with a record 201 additional cases reported by its governor on Friday, for a total of 2,796.Japan’s total infections stand at more than 9,800, with 207 deaths, according to a tally by public broadcaster NHK.HELPING HANDAs part of effort to boost testing capacity, several general practitioners’ groups in Tokyo have stepped up to shoulder the task of examining potential patients and taking test samples from them, which is now conducted mainly by doctors working at large hospitals, who are already overstretched.“This is to prevent the medical system from crumbling. Everyone needs to extend a helping hand. Otherwise, hospitals would break down,” said Konoshin Tamura, deputy head of an association of general practitioners in Tokyo’s Suginami ward.“Also, in order for PCR tests to be conducted more widely, we need to get used to the whole process and see what the coronavirus really does,” said Tamura, who runs a clinic specializing in internal medicine and paediatrics.On the grounds of one of the four Suginami hospitals where general practitioners are taking turns to see suspected coronavirus patients, two white tents were put up this week in anticipation of more virus-related visits.In another bid to make PCR tests more available, the health ministry on Wednesday suggested to local governments that drive-through tests can bolster their capabilities.Kenji Shibuya, head of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College, London, and other scientists, have repeatedly said since early in the outbreak that Japan should introduce the type of drive-through testing that South Korea has.A day after the health ministry’s advice, the city of Chiba, east of Tokyo, launched drive-through testing, and several others are looking to follow suit.“It’s quite clear we will be seeing more and more patients who need testing. This is one of our ways to expand,” a Chiba official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-expands-testing-as-covid-19-infections-mount/story-3e2W2wDAI4d8JCpLWG776L.html
18-04-2020||World||Other countries will revise coronavirus death numbers like China, says WHO||The World Health Organization said Friday that many countries would likely follow China in revising up their death tolls once they start getting the coronavirus crisis under control.Wuhan, the COVID-19 epicentre, admitted missteps in tallying its death toll, abruptly raising the city’s count by 50 percent -- following growing world doubts about Chinese transparency over the outbreak.The WHO said Wuhan had been overwhelmed by the virus, which emerged in the city in December, and the authorities had been too swamped to ensure every death and infection was properly recorded.Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online, and there have been questions about the government’s recording of infections as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the crisis.“This is something that is a challenge in an ongoing outbreak: to identify all of your cases and all of your deaths,” Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead, told a virtual press conference in Geneva.“I would anticipate that many countries are going to be in a similar situation where they will have to go back and review records and look to see: did we capture all of them?”She said the Wuhan authorities had now reviewed their databases and cross-checked for discrepancies.Wuhan added 1,290 deaths to its toll, raising the total to 3,869, and added a further 325 cases, bringing the number of infections to 50,333.Van Kerkhove said that because Wuhan’s healthcare system was swamped, some patients died at home; others were in makeshift facilities; and that medics, focused on treating patients, therefore did not do the paperwork on time.Michael Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, added: “All countries will face this”.But he urged nations to produce precise data as early as possible, “because that keeps us on top of what the impact is, and allows us to project forward in a much more accurate way.”Also Read: Looking into reports that coronavirus ‘escaped’ from Wuhan lab, says Donald TrumpAfrica hope More than two million people have been infected with COVID-19, while, according to an AFP tally, more than 145,000 have lost their lives.Most of the cases and deaths reported so far have been in Europe and the United States.But WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned of a “worrying trend” emerging in Africa.At the WHO’s last daily count, there had been 11,843 confirmed cases and 550 deaths on the continent.“In the past week there has been a 51 percent increase in the number of reported cases in my own continent, Africa, and a 60 percent increase in the number of reported deaths,” the former Ethiopian health minister said.But his colleagues said the situation was not beyond control on the continent, given Africa’s long experience of having to battle fatal disease outbreaks.“We don’t believe, at this point, the disease has passed the capacity to be contained,” said Ryan. Wet markets So-called wet markets in China have been in the spotlight since the virus emerged, with some blaming them as the source of COVID-19.Wet markets are popular venues to buy fresh meat, vegetables and fish across Asia -- most selling common, everyday produce to locals at affordable prices, with some selling live animals, and sometimes wildlife.Tedros said they were an important source of food and work for millions, but they were too often poorly regulated and maintained.“WHO’s position is that when these markets are allowed to reopen, it should only be on the condition that they conform to stringent food safety and hygiene standards,” he said.“Governments must rigorously enforce bans on the sale and trade of wildlife for food.”An estimated 70 percent of all new viruses in humans come from other species, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/other-countries-will-revise-coronavirus-death-tolls-like-china-says-who/story-ur8M1wobaWuez1kiUn1eeI.html

18-04-2020||World||UN warns Covid-19 could trigger worst downturn in global economy since Great Depression||The Covid-19 pandemic could trigger the worst downturn in the global economy since the Great Depression, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday (local time).He released his warning in a policy brief, saying the pandemic-induced economic contraction is having “disastrous consequences,” including on the ability of countries -- and not just low-income countries -- to sustainably carry debt, Xinhua news agency reported.The brief said both middle-income countries, with 75 per cent of the world’s population and 62 per cent of the world’s poor, are also highly vulnerable to a debt crisis, lost market access and capital outflows.While in the best-case scenario, recovery in developed countries’ economies may start by the end of 2020 and then reverberate to developing countries, it is also possible that this may be the start of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, said the secretary-general.Speaking at the virtual World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings on “Mobilizing with Africa,” Guterres said that during this crisis the African Union and the African continent have shown unity and leadership -- two of the most scarce commodities.The secretary-general warned that, as with the climate crisis, the African continent could end up suffering the most from the crisis.Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed spoke by video to the Group of Friends on Food Security and Nutrition.She told them that, in the face of the current pandemic, it will not take much to tip millions of more people into food insecurity. An economic shock on the scale expected presents a real and present danger.The Food and Agriculture Organization, the African Union and international partners have issued a joint declaration in which they support access to food and nutrition for the most vulnerable in Africa during the pandemic.They described the food and agriculture system as an essential service that must continue to operate during periods of lockdown, curfew and other containment measures.“We have launched a Preparedness and Response Plan which required 38 million U.S. dollars for humanitarian, as well as social and economic recovery needs,” UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.“This Plan has been presented to national and international partners and will be updated shortly to include the government’s needs,” he noted.The number of deaths linked to the novel contagion reached 150,000 on Friday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

18-04-2020||World||UK sets up new Vaccine Taskforce as Covid-19 death toll hits 14,576||The UK has set up a taskforce to urgently find a coronavirus vaccine and prepare the industry to manufacture it at scale once it is developed, as 847 fresh death were reported due to the Covid-19, taking the death toll in the country to 14,576.Addressing the daily Downing Street briefing, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said on Friday the new Vaccine Taskforce, led by the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, is a collaboration between business and industry and academia. It is aimed at coordinating efforts to discover a vaccine, funnel resources and support to industry and research institutions and review regulations to remove any blocks in scaling it up, he said.“We cannot put a date on when we will get a vaccine. But we live in a country with a rich history of pioneering science, and with the government backing our scientists, we have the best chance to do this as quickly as possible,” said the Indian-origin Cabinet minister.Sharma also announced 21 new research projects to receive funds from a 14 million pounds government pot for the development of treatments and vaccines.“UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people’s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts.“The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible,” he said.Under details of some of the scientific work ongoing to combat the spread of the deadly virus, one new project is led by the University of Oxford to trial an anti-malarial drug, believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups. General Practitioner (GP) surgeries across the UK have been invited to take part in the groundbreaking trial, to ascertain whether it could reduce the need for affected patients to go to hospital and speed up their recovery.Other projects receiving vital government funding under the new taskforce include an Imperial College London initiative testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies and Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus. Public Health England is also studying how Covid-19 can be transmitted from person-to-person by determining how long it can survive in the air and on different materials found in hospitals and households like fabric, plastics, metals and ceramics. The UK has already pledged 250 million pounds to the international effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine under the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The latest announcement aims to make the UK a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing, building on existing research and development expertise.“We’re doing everything possible to save lives and beat this disease, and that includes working flat out with businesses, researchers and industry to find a vaccine as quickly as possible.“The UK is world-leading in developing vaccines. We are the biggest contributor to the global effort and preparing to ensure we can manufacture vaccines here at home as soon as practically possible,” UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sets-up-new-vaccine-taskforce-as-covid-19-death-toll-hits-14-576/story-ZFhETdYtKf3QSjKkIYi3QN.html
18-04-2020||World||Looking into reports that coronavirus ‘escaped’ from Wuhan lab, says Donald Trump||The US is looking into reports that the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 150,000 people globally, “escaped” from a Wuhan lab in China, President Donald Trump has said. “We’re looking at it, a lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Friday when asked if there was an investigation into whether the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn’t in that area if you can believe this,” he claimed. “That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone.... That bat is 40 miles away.” Earlier in the day, Fox News reported that the United States was conducting a full-scale investigation into whether the deadly virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. In an exclusive report, it said intelligence operatives were reportedly gathering information about the laboratory and the initial outbreak of the pathogen. Intelligence analysts are piecing together a timeline of what the government knew and “creating an accurate picture of what happened”, the channel quoted sources as saying. “A lot of strange things are happening, but there is a lot of investigation going on and we are going to find out,” Trump said. “All I can say is wherever it came from, came from China in whatever form, 184 countries now are suffering because of it.” Trump added that the US would end its grant to a level-IV lab in Wuhan. “(The) Obama administration gave them a grant of USD 3.7 million,” the president said. “We will end that grant very quickly.” A group of more than half-a-dozen lawmakers sent a letter to House and Senate leadership, requesting them to ensure that no future coronavirus relief funds be appropriated to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Meanwhile, lawmaker James Smith accused China of indulging in covering up the issue of coronavirus. “The communist Chinese government’s cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak allowed this virus to spread unchecked, threatening the health and stability of the free world. They must be held accountable,” Smith said. “When people in Wuhan began to fall ill with a mysterious SARS-like illness, instead of working to contain the virus, the Chinese Communist Party ruthlessly worked to contain the spread of information. This secrecy endangered millions of lives,” the Congressman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/looking-into-reports-that-coronavirus-escaped-from-wuhan-lab-says-donald-trump/story-9tcUFwcTh9xXjyyEC1uzCP.html
18-04-2020||World||Horrors revealed at coronavirus-hit Canada nursing home||Elderly residents left soiled and unfed after their caregivers fled the premises, 31 deaths in the space of a few weeks: a nursing home in Montreal has become the symbol of the terrible toll coronavirus is taking in Canada’s long-term care homes.The bleak situation discovered at the Residence Herron, in the Montreal suburb of Dorval, has triggered an investigation for gross negligence and a national reckoning about the conditions in long-term care homes which account for half the country’s more than 1,250 Covid-19 deaths.“I was sick to my stomach, I was really sick to my stomach,” Moira Davis, whose father Stanley Pinnell died at the Herron facility on April 8, told AFP.“All of a sudden these questions started flying through my head, ‘What could we have done differently? Why did nobody tell us?... Why, why, why?’“Called to the rescue after most of the staff deserted the facility, health authorities found residents dehydrated, unfed for days and lying listless in bed, some covered in excrement. Others had fallen to the floor. Two deaths had gone unnoticed for several days.At least five of the 31 recent deaths at the home have been officially attributed to the virus, with the others still being investigated by a coroner.From her home in Creighton, Saskatchewan, Davis said she became concerned about her 86-year-old father, who is believed to have contracted coronavirus a week before his death, as he sounded weaker and weaker on the phone each time they spoke.Davis says Residence Herron is a “poster child for what is wrong in our senior health care” -- but she is also certain it is not unique. “There are other homes, I am sure, in every country of the world, where families have experienced a similar situation.”“It scares me, it terrifies me to think that I am 60 years of age, and I may someday end up in one of these homes.” ‘Gross negligence’ In announcing the fatalities this week, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said it appeared to be a case of “gross negligence”: just two nurses had been left to care for 130 elderly residents. Further fuelling public outrage, Canadian media also revealed that the home’s owner had once been convicted of drug trafficking, fraud and tax evasion.For families, shock and anger mixed with the frustration of having been powerless to do anything, kept away by a ban on visits to the home to avoid contamination.Local health authorities have now taken control of the facility, and a Can$5 million class action has been launched against the owner alleging “inhumane and degrading maltreatment” for failing to ensure continued and adequate care.“On April 7, my mother was left in her wheelchair with a full, soiled diaper for three hours because no one responded” to the emergency button and her cries for help, Peter Wheeland told AFP, adding that she had diarrhea, one of the symptoms of the new coronavirus. “We weren’t able to communicate with anyone: We called the nurses’ station, we left messages, we did everything we could do to reach them and there was no answer,” he said, recalling being overcome with fear “that my mother could suddenly die.”Connie Wheeland has since been transferred to a hospital where she was diagnosed with Covid-19. She will not return to Herron. Rather than continue to pay the home Can$45,000 each year, once she recovers her son plans to set her up in an apartment and hire a private nurse to care for her.‘We love you grandma’ From the parking lot of the facility, Maxime Jacques, 35, along with his sister, wife and children, wave to his mother Jacqueline -- who from her room on the second floor can just see the sign they have hung on a fence: “We love you grandma.”“We feel a little let down,” says Jacques, who is still trying to find out more from staff about the 86-year-old’s health condition.The dire situation uncovered at the Residence Herron has come as little surprise for experts, who point to decades of insufficient funding for senior care -- where the work is tough, and the pay rarely above minimum wage.“We have neglected elderly care for a very long time,” Rejean Hebert, a former Quebec health minister.Responding to public outrage, Legault has called for health care workers to help feed, wash and tend to elderly residents at long-term care facilities across the province, where the staff shortage is estimated at 2,000 people. He also topped up the pay of care workers.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also Friday dispatched 125 military doctors and medics, requested by Quebec, to help personnel at the homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horrors-revealed-at-coronavirus-hit-canada-nursing-home/story-7YkH2kAhMekDnF1svNUszI.html
18-04-2020||World||China adds 1,300 deaths to Wuhan toll, citing early lapses||China on Friday revised upwards by nearly 1,300 the Covid-19 fatalities in the first pandemic epicentre, the city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late last year, admitting that the infection hit China harder than it initially projected. The addition, reported by state news agency Xinhua on Friday, brings the nationwide death toll up by nearly 40% to 4,636, the majority coming from the central Chinese province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located.“The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Wuhan as of the end of April 16 was revised up by 325 to 50,333, and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869,” Xinhua said in a report.The revision of Covid-19 numbers comes amid global doubts about the numbers that China’s national Health Commission (NHC) has been releasing daily since the end of January.“Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?” US president Donald Trump had said on Wednesday.And after China released the revised numbers, Trump tweeted on Friday: “China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the US, not even close!”In a notification released on Friday, the Wuhan municipal headquarters for the Covid-19 epidemic prevention and control said the revisions were made in accordance with related laws and regulations as well as the principle of being responsible for history, the people and the deceased.The notification listed four reasons for the discrepancy.It said that a surging number of patients at the early stage of the epidemic “…overwhelmed medical resources and the admission capacity of medical institutions. Some patients died at home without having been treated in hospitals.” It added that overworked doctors were “preoccupied” with saving lives and treating patients, which resulted in late reporting of Covid-19 toll.The notice said that due to a rapid increase of designated hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients, a few medical institutions were not linked to the epidemic information network “and failed to report their data in time”.The registered information of some of the deceased patients was incomplete, and there were repetitions and mistakes in the reporting, the health authorities added.“What lie behind epidemic data are the lives and health of the general public, as well as the credibility of the government,” an official in Wuhan told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-adds-1300-deaths-to-wuhan-toll-citing-early-lapses/story-jcGYeP2QOzrMFxFaep10kK.html

The broad scientific consensus is that the novel coronavirus originated in bats.Fox News reported on Wednesday that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory as part of China’s effort to demonstrate the capability of its efforts in identifying and combating viruses. Trump has said his government is seeking to determine whether the virus emanated from a laboratory in China.Also read: Trump says China’s Covid-19 deaths ‘far higher’ after Wuhan toll revised up“A lot of strange things are happening but there is a lot of investigation going on. And we’re going to find out,” Trump told reporters at the White House.Trump also cast doubt on China’s death toll, which was revised up on Friday. China said 1,300 people who died of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan - half the total - were not counted, but dismissed allegations of a cover-up.The US president said on Friday that many more people must have died in China than in the United States, which is currently the epicentre of the global pandemic and has reported the largest number of deaths in the world linked to the virus.Also read: Trump calls for reopening US economy. What’s next?“We don’t have the most in the world deaths. The most in the world has to be China. It’s a massive country.

18-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump announces $19 billion bailout for farmers hurt by slowdown||President Donald Trump announced a $19 billion bailout package for farmers hurt financially by the coronavirus crisis.The aid plan includes $16 billion in direct payments to farmers to boost their incomes, along with $3 billion in government purchases of meat, dairy products and other foods, the president said Friday at a White House briefing. The Agriculture Department will receive another $14 billion in July for further assistance.“This will help our farmers and our ranchers, and it’s money well deserved,” Trump said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe combination of direct payments to farmers and bulk government purchases of commodities parallels the approach the Trump administration followed in its $28 billion agriculture trade bailout over the past two years. Farmers and rural communities are a critical part of Trump’s political base as he seeks re-election.The commodities purchased will be distributed through food banks and other nutrition programs serving the poor, school children and the elderly.USDA PaymentsThe USDA will make direct payments of $5.1 billion to cattle producers, $2.9 billion for dairy and $1.6 billion for hogs, according to a statement from Senator John Hoeven, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee.Another $3.9 billion will go to producers of row crops such as soybeans, corn and cotton, while $2.1 billion is earmarked for producers of specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables. And $500 million will go for other crops, Hoeven said.The Agriculture Department will begin the food purchases by buying $100 million of fruits and vegetables per month, and $100 million per month each of dairy and meat, the department said in a statement.The closing of restaurants, school cafeterias and other commercial food service operations has upended the market for agricultural products, particularly dairy, meat and produce. The food-service industry is a disproportionate buyer of cheese, butter, meat, fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers are dumping as much as 8% of their milk, according to the Dairy Farmers of America cooperative.A shutdown of several slaughterhouses because of virus outbreaks among employees has further disrupted hog and cattle farmers’ ability to sell their livestock. At the same time, an oil price war forced ethanol plants to shut down, further depressing corn prices.Funding for the aid was included in the Coronavirus relief package Congress passed last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-announces-19-billion-bailout-for-farmers-hurt-by-slowdown/story-dh0LFpm9EpPrA4ggzSbPQL.html

18-04-2020||World||Donald Trump shares ‘unlockdown’ plan, calls to ‘liberate states’||Covid-19 deaths in the US spiked by a new record of 4,591 on Friday as President Donald Trump unveiled guidelines for reopening the country and appeared to practically lead, from his Twitter handle, the protests against the continuing lockdown in several states.Trump hit out at his political rivals including Democrat state governors, the World Health Organization and asked for ‘liberating’ locked-down states, some of whom had in fact extended the restrictions. He tweeted on Friday: “Today people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!”“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!LIBERATE MICHIGAN! LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”Protests have broken out in Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Kentucky, Utah and Wyoming demanding reopening of the country. On the WHO, Trump appeared to quote Lanhee Chen, a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institute, and tweeted: “Why did the W.H.O. Ignore an email from Taiwanese health officials in late December alerting them to the possibility that CoronaVirus could be transmitted between humans? ”The US death toll as of Friday morning was more than 35,300 and confirmed cases topped 680,500. The number of cases increased in New York state, the epicentre of the American epidemic, to nearly 226,200 with more than 16,730 fatalities.“We’re starting our life again,” Trump said on Thursday. “We’re starting rejuvenation of our economy... in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion.”States were expected to announce their own reopening plans but New York extended its shutdown to May 15; Michigan and Missouri had also extended their stay-at-home orders. The guidelines provide that the reopening be spread over three phases and laid down “gatekeeping” criteria for progressing from one phase to another. A state could decide to open up entirely or partially, based on criteria that include infection rates and ability of hospitals to cope.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he needed federal government help to ramp up testing and accused Trump administration of failing to provide funding to states. “That is passing the buck without passing the bucks,” he said. Trump pushed back, tweeting it was up to the states to “step up their testing,” and went on to attack Cuomo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-shares-unlockdown-plan-calls-to-liberate-states/story-tL3wjtEUZttgzv1CzdohoO.html
18-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump calls for reopening US economy. What’s next?||President Donald Trump wants to get the hobbled US economy back on its feet, but guidelines he announced for reopening the country are notably cautious and unspecific. So what comes next?No big bang As recently as April 8, Trump was saying “it would be nice to open with a big bang.” Instead, the world’s biggest economy will put a tentative toe in the water.The national lockdown is estimated to have saved hundreds of thousands of lives by quashing the rapid spread of the coronavirus.For Trump, though, the economic chaos that has ensued also poses a massive political risk with only 200 days until the November 3 presidential election. Some 22 million people have lost their jobs in just one month.What’s clear from the White House guidelines announced Thursday, however, is that reopening will be slow, cautious and very different across the huge country.The guidelines suggest three vague phases for relaxing social distancing and opening up travel and public gatherings. No timelines are given.“Light switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here,” Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the top government medical advisors, said.Who’s really in charge? Trump this Monday claimed he had “total” authority to set the pace of where and when the coronavirus lockdown ends.With Thursday’s announcement, he gave up on that, saying the 50 state governors will have full control.Some saw this as a retreat. But political analysts also say Trump wanted the benefit of the big White House announcement while shielding himself from what could be a messy process ahead of election day.With Trump standing back, this means the onus will rest with people like Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, Ron DeSantis in Florida, Gavin Newsom in California, and Greg Abbott in Texas.Trump will be on the sidelines, supporting or in some cases castigating, as he did Friday when he berated Cuomo for “ridiculously” demanding federal help to get tens of thousands of ventilators. Trump: ‘Liberate’ lockdown states Even the decision whether or not to keep up the quarantines is becoming a bitter left-right issue in radically partisan America.A grassroots anti-lockdown movement with strong links to Trump’s right-wing base has mounted protests in several Democrat-run states.On Wednesday, a large protest erupted in the Michigan capital, Lansing. Demonstrators clogged streets with cars, while a group toting rifles and handguns paraded on the steps of the legislature.On Friday, hundreds of protesters were reported to have gathered outside the home of the Minnesota governor. On Thursday, other frustrated Americans protested in Virginia.Trump made political hay out of the tensions, tweeting on Friday a call to “LIBERATE” the three states.Who’s reopening first? Trump said “large sections of the country” can “think about opening,” some of them “literally tomorrow.”He mentioned sparsely populated states with no major coronavirus problems like Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota.That won’t be so easy in states with more economic importance, however.New York and New Jersey, which are at the heart of the northeast corridor, have been hardest hit by the virus. Cuomo on Thursday extended New York’s lockdown for a month.In Washington state, which was hit early but has since controlled the virus, aerospace giant Boeing is set to become the first large corporation to undo its lockdown.Some 27,000 workers are due to resume work in the next few days, albeit with social distancing measures enforced.Texas announced plans Friday to relax restrictions within the next week on hospitals’ ability to perform elective surgeries, encourage shops to let customers order goods then pick up from outside, and open state parks.Florida allowed limited beach openings Friday and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer hopes she can allow “some relaxing” of one of the country’s tightest lockdowns on May 1.Testing times With governors left to make up their own schedules, rather than operate under a nationally coordinated plan, big questions remain over how the reopening can avoid letting the virus bounce back.One of the many issues lacking clarity is the reopening of domestic, let alone international travel. With some states largely virus-free, but others still in the grip of the pandemic, can people be encouraged to return to the nation’s empty airports?And how can states and businesses that have reopened be sure they are not silently becoming new incubators for the disease?On Thursday Fauci said the key was “early alerts and getting in there before they have a problem.”But experts say that kind of monitoring will require vastly increased testing capabilities.“The more testing, the more open the economy, but there’s not enough national capacity,” Cuomo said this week. “We can’t do it yet. That is the unvarnished truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-calls-for-reopening-us-economy-what-s-next/story-ORDUS8PUXkfwo1XJthMycO.html
18-04-2020||World||‘LIBERATE!’: Trump pushes states to lift stay-at-home coronavirus restrictions||President Donald Trump urged supporters to “LIBERATE” three states led by Democratic governors Friday, apparently encouraging protests against stay-at-home restrictions. Some states under Republican leadership edged toward easing up the mandates aimed at stopping the coronavirus.A day after laying out a road map to gradually reopen the crippled economy, Trump tweeted the kind of rhetoric some of his supporters have used to demand the lifting of the orders that have thrown millions of Americans out of work.“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA,” he said in a tweet-storm in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for criticizing the federal response. Cuomo “should spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining,’” the president said.Responding to pleas from governors for help from Washington in ramping up testing for the virus, Trump put the burden back on them: “The States have to step up their TESTING!”Trump claimed Friday that “very partisan voices” had spread “false and misleading information” about the nation’s testing capacity. But he said “we’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing.”At the same time, at least two states took their first steps toward easing the restrictions.In Florida, GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis said municipalities could reopen beaches and parks if they could do so safely. In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said stores could begin selling curbside, non-essential surgery could resume and state parks could reopen.Sensitive about persistent questions about the capacity for testing, Trump had his health team lead an extensive briefing Friday outlining that adequate capacity exists to get states through the first phase of the guidelines for how they should reopen.Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to see businesses reopen quickly and claimed earlier this week that he had total authority over the matter, even though the lockdowns and other social-distancing measures have been imposed by state and local leaders, not Washington.“We may be opening but we’re putting safety first,” Trump said.On Thursday, he outlined a three-step set of guidelines for easing restrictions over a span of several weeks in places that have robust testing and are seeing a decrease in COVID-19 cases, assuring the nation’s governors: “You’re going to call your own shots.”But governors of both parties suggested Friday that they would be cautious in returning to normal, with some warning that they can’t do it without help from Washington to expand testing.“The federal government cannot wipe its hands of this and say, ‘Oh, the states are responsible for testing,’“ said Cuomo, a Democrat. “We cannot do it without federal help.”West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican ally of Trump’s, said he would listen to medical experts in deciding how to move forward.“I am not going to do something that I feel in my heart is the wrong thing that’s going to endanger our people,” he said.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said Trump’s tweets about “liberating” states put millions of Americans at risk of contracting COVID-19.“The president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and is deadly,” Inslee said.The clash between Trump and Cuomo was personal, with the president complaining the governor hasn’t said thanks for the help he has received from Washington. Cuomo countered by saying: “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, send a bouquet of flowers? ‘Thank you to the federal government for participating in a federal emergency.’”Even in largely rural states with small populations, such as Wyoming, Maine and South Dakota, governors said they were not anxious to quickly resume business as usual.“Until we’ve got the testing up to speed — which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping — we’re just not going to be there,” said Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican.The University of Washington, whose computer models have frequently been cited by health officials at White House briefings, predicted Friday that Vermont, West Virginia, Montana and Hawaii could open as early as May 4 if they restrict large gatherings, test widely and quarantine the contacts of people who test positive.Iowa, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Utah, Arkansas and Oklahoma, however, are among states that would need to wait until mid-June or early July. About half the states should wait until at least early June to reopen, and all should gauge the capacity of their public health systems to handle outbreaks, the institute said.Worldwide, the outbreak has infected more than 2.2 million people and killed over 150,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally based on figures supplied by government health authorities around the globe, though it has becoming increasingly clear that the true numbers are much higher.The official death toll in the U.S. neared 35,000, with about 685,000 confirmed infections.The shutdowns have inflicted heavy damage on economies around the world. In the U.S., the crisis has cost at least 22 millions Americans their jobs, pushing the unemployment rate toward levels not seen since the Great Depression.Many Americans, especially in rural areas and other parts of the country that have not seen major outbreaks, have urged governors to reopen their economies. Protesters have taken to the streets in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia and Michigan, where more than 3,000 turned out on Wednesday in what looked like one of the president’s rallies, with Make America Great Again hats and Trump flags.Protests continued Friday, including one outside the home of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and another in Idaho, where the governor is a Republican.Public health experts have warned that easing the shutdowns must be accompanied by wider testing and tracing of infected people to keep the virus from coming back with a vengeance.Meanwhile, China, confirming long-held suspicions, acknowledged that the coronavirus death toll in the one-time epicenter city of Wuhan was nearly 50% higher than reported, amounting to more than 4,600.In Italy, Spain, Britain, the United States and elsewhere, similar doubts emerged as governments revised their death tolls or openly questioned the accuracy of them.Authorities said that almost everywhere, thousands have died with COVID-19 symptoms — many in nursing homes — without being tested for the virus, and have thus gone uncounted.In Italy, for example, where the official toll has climbed past 22,000, a government survey released Friday of about one-third of the country’s nursing homes found more than 6,000 residents have died since Feb. 1. It was unclear how many were a result of COVID-19.In Britain, with an official count of about 14,600 dead, the country’s statistics agency said the actual number could be around 15% higher. Others think it will be far more.The official death toll in New York City soared by more than half earlier this week when health authorities began including people who probably had COVID-19 but died without being tested. Nearly 3,800 deaths were added to the city’s count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liberate-trump-pushes-states-to-lift-stay-at-home-coronavirus-restrictions/story-kyMDKuB3yousHoy4tJWE8J.html
18-04-2020||World||US states, not federal government, must improve Covid-19 testing: Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump, whose administration has faced criticism over a shortfall in coronavirus testing capacity, said on Friday that individual states were responsible for developing testing capabilities.“It’s going to be up to the states to use that capability,” Trump told reporters at a White House briefing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The states have local points where they can go and the governor can call the mayors and the mayors can call representatives and everything is perfect and that’s the way it should work and always should work,” Trump said.Trump has repeatedly said that states - not the federal government - need to step up testing against the novel coronavirus, as the nation battles an outbreak that has sickened nearly 700,000 people and killed more than 35,000 people in the United States alone.The virus has also paralyzed the US economy, shuttering businesses and leaving 22 million Americans seeking unemployment benefits.As a result, the president, who had touted the strength of the US economy as central to his Nov. 3 re-election bid, has been eager to reopen the country as soon as possible.On Thursday, Trump unveiled federal guidelines for a three-stage process under which states could lift restrictions on commerce and public life as the pandemic retreated.Click here for Covid-19 updatesPublic health experts and some state governors have said businesses could only safely restart with a comprehensive testing program.Trump dismissed the response to his plan as political posturing.“Following the announcement of our reopening guidelines, there have been some very partisan voices in the media and in politics that have spread false and misleading information about our testing capacity,” Trump said.US Vice President Mike Pence said later at the briefing that states could double daily testing by “activating all of the labs” and that states had enough tests to launch phase one of the economic re-opening plan if they chose to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-not-federal-government-must-improve-covid-19-testing-donald-trump/story-lTjrztpMkhfejDGzQFDy3K.html
18-04-2020||World||‘Heartbreaking’ New York report gives details of coronavirus outbreak in nursing homes||New York, by far the nation’s leader in coronavirus nursing home deaths, released details Friday on outbreaks in individual facilities after weeks of refusing, revealing one home in Brooklyn where 55 people died and four others with at least 40 deaths.“Every death is heartbreaking,” said Dr. Roy Goldberg, medical director at Kings Harbor Multicare Center, a 720-bed home in the Bronx which reported 45 fatalities. “These have been surreal times.”The state’s accounting of multiple deaths at 68 nursing homes was based on a survey and is substantially incomplete. It accounted for less than half of the 2,690 nursing home deaths that have been reported in the state. It also didn’t include people who got sick in nursing homes, but then died at hospitals.But it was the first time the state provided any information about homes that, according to an Associated Press tally, account for nearly 40% of the nation’s 6,912 deaths in such facilitiesAt the top of the list with 55 deaths was Cobble Hill Health Center, a 300-bed facility in a 19th-century former hospital in a tony section of Brooklyn.Four ambulances arrived within an hour at the facility Friday, underscoring the ongoing crisis. Police showed up to assist with the removal of bodies, including one that was wheeled out the front door.The Cobble Hill home said in a statement that the deaths it reported were “based on the possibility of COVID-19 being a factor,” adding testing in nursing homes remains “extremely difficult to obtain.”“Although we’ve had an increase in deaths during the past few weeks, we have not been able to confirm that the deaths are specifically related to COVID-19,” the statement said.A total of 19 homes in New York’s report listed 20 deaths or more.The survey’s release came a day after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration reversed course and promised transparency about the worst outbreaks, after previously saying residents at the hardest-hit homes deserved privacy. Few states have released such information.Cuomo did not respond directly when asked at his daily coronavirus briefing why his administration had not alerted the public about the outbreaks sooner.“We’ve been talking about nursing homes every day for the past 30 days,” Cuomo said. “We’ve said 157 times the most vulnerable population are seniors, the most vulnerable places are nursing homes. ... I think we’ve been talking about it all along.”The state’s list omitted homes with fewer than five deaths.Connecticut released a similar list Thursday, reporting that eight nursing homes had at least 10 residents die. In Connecticut, nursing home residents account for 375 of the state’s 971 virus deaths.Officials at several of the nursing homes on the list said they were doing their best, and attributed the high number of deaths to the fragility of their patients and difficulty in keeping the virus out, rather than substandard care.“We have had our share of sadness,” Lina Scacco, an assistant vice president at Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care and Rehabilitation in New Hyde Park, where 38 people have died. “We’re all grieving here.”Scacco said the facility, whose residents include war veterans and Holocaust survivors was ravaged despite having infection control practices that exceed CDC and health department regulations and guidelines.Now, she said, they’re planning virtual memorials for residents who’ve died and grief counseling for staff members.“This has been devastating to our families,” Scacco said.Stephen Hanse, president and CEO of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living, said the figures reflect the fact that those facilities are dealing with extremely vulnerable patients.“Outbreaks are not the result of inattentiveness or a shortcoming in our facilities,” he wrote in a statement. “The very nature of long-term care is a high touch environment where social distancing is not an option. Staff are helping residents with bathing, dressing, eating and other personal daily needs.”He also blamed the state health department for worsening the situation by barring nursing homes from denying admission to patients with COVID-19 if they were medically stable.Nursing homes have been known since the earliest days of the outbreak as a likely trouble spot. A home in Washington state lost 43 residents early in the virus’s spread into the country.Italy, which was hit before the U.S., is also in the midst of a nursing home crisis, with health officials there estimating Friday that thousands of patients there have been killed by the virus.Yet even with that early warning, many nursing homes remained without adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. Testing for residents and staff remains spotty, at best.Federal officials in mid-March banned visitors, halted group activities and ordered mandatory screening of workers for respiratory symptoms, but by then the virus had quietly spread widely.Kings Harbor’s medical director, Goldberg, said staff members there created two dedicated COVID-19 units to treat infected patients and followed “every department of health and CDC recommendation and regulation.”“Obtaining PPE has always been a struggle,” he added, “but we’ve always stayed one step ahead.”New York state’s health commissioner, Howard Zucker, said the state is providing enough personal protective equipment for nursing homes and helping with staffing.“We’re working with each individual nursing home to address that. We contact them and if there’s a need for PPE ... we have stockpiles.”Many nursing home administrators also previously declined to release information, leading Cuomo to say this week that the state would begin requiring homes to inform patients and their families within 24 hours if a resident got the virus or died.Chris Laxton, executive director of the The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, applauded the state for releasing the data. But he said facilities still desperately need the state’s help.“We continue to be in urgent need of PPE, especially gowns, test kits, and surge staff, to limit staff from traveling between buildings and risking additional spread,’ Laxton said.Some nursing homes have disclosed information voluntarily that differed from the numbers put out by the state Friday.The state survey listed 10 deaths at the Montgomery Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, about 50 miles north of New York City, but facility Vice President Vincent Maniscalco said 21 residents have died recently. Eight of those patients, he said, had symptoms consistent with the virus but died prior to being tested.“It’s been a very trying time for the staff, to lose residents they care for day in and day out,” Maniscalco said.Outbreaks killed 46 at a nursing home in suburban Richmond, Virginia, and 22 at a home in central Indiana. County officials in northern New Jersey said Thursday that at least 26 patients had died at a nursing home in Andover.An Associated Press report found infections were continuing to find their way into nursing homes because screening staff for a fever or questioning them about symptoms didn’t catch people who were infected but asymptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heartbreaking-new-york-report-gives-details-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-nursing-homes/story-mvmpMBg5DO3hdtgrvTYYnO.html

A record increase of 35,715 new cases was reported on April 10.The infections and fatalities are spread unevenly across the country, with more densely populated places such as New York accounting for nearly half the total US deaths.Sweeping stay-at-home orders in 42 states to combat the new coronavirus have shuttered businesses, disrupted lives and decimated the economy, and some protesters have begun taking to the streets to urge governors to rethink the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-passes-35-000-cases-top-700-000/story-px11Lr1AWBIvxl0yLTqvxJ.html
18-04-2020||World||Trump says China’s Covid-19 deaths ‘far higher’ after Wuhan toll revised up||US President Donald Trump said Friday that China’s coronavirus deaths were “far higher” than it has admitted after the toll in the city where the pandemic originated was revised up by 50 percent.Global criticism is mounting against China over its management of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 145,000 people worldwide and hammered the global economy since it first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year. More than half of humanity -- 4.5 billion people -- are confined to their homes as governments scramble to contain the virus’s death march across the globe. World leaders are now looking at when -- and how -- to ease widespread confinement measures to revive an economy battered by what the International Monetary Fund calls the “Great Lockdown”. Trump is eager to restart business in the world’s biggest economy, while some hard-hit European nations are slowly creeping ahead on the path to normalcy, with some shops and schools starting to reopen.  China denies any cover-up The US leader announced this week a phased reopening of the United States -- one of his central preoccupations -- but on Friday turned his attention to China’s death toll after Wuhan’s city government added a further 1,290 deaths to the city’s fatalities. The revision brought the city’s total to 3,869 after many dead were “mistakenly reported” or missed entirely, adding to growing global doubts over China’s transparency.“China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!” Trump tweeted.The revised death toll out of China on Friday was specific to the city of Wuhan, not the country as a whole. The United States currently has the most reported fatalities of any country in the world, with some 33,000 deaths. Leaders in France and Britain have also questioned China’s management of the crisis, and French President Emmanuel Macron said it would be “naive” to think Beijing had handled the pandemic well. The virus is believed to have emerged in a wet market in Wuhan in December, but two US media outlets reported suspicions the virus accidentally slipped out of a sensitive Wuhan laboratory that studied bats.Beijing, which has come under fire at home and abroad for downplaying the severity and scope of the outbreak, hit back earlier Friday, insisting there had been no cover-up.“There has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. Life-and-death balance Governments around the world are grappling with the question of when to reopen society, seeking a life-and-death balance between unfreezing stalled economies and preventing a second deadly coronavirus wave.While Trump declared Thursday that the time had come for the “next front in our war” with a phased reboot of the US economy, others took the opposite path -- Japan, Britain and Mexico all expanded current restrictions.Despite the United States suffering a staggering 4,500 new deaths announced Thursday, Trump proclaimed: “We’re opening up our country.”The president’s approach was a step back from previous hopes for a sudden reopening however, and state governors were given the freedom to set their own plans to resume business.Lightly affected states can open “literally tomorrow”, said Trump, while others would receive White House “freedom and guidance” to achieve that at their own pace.In New York state for example -- where more than 11,500 people have died -- Governor Andrew Cuomo extended a shutdown order until May 15.In some of the world’s most vulnerable economies, lockdown measures are starting to pinch. Tobacco farmers in Zimbabwe fear a delayed start to the normally busy auction season, the lifeblood for thousands of growers in impoverished rural regions. “This year our harvest hasn’t been good at all... just average,” farmer Shaw Mutalepo told AFP, as workers in face masks crunched cured leaves into large bales.“We might have a delay (in selling) just because of the lockdown,” he added.  ‘Lost decade’ Meanwhile, there were more signs the global economy is imploding.China reported Friday its GDP shrank 6.8 percent in the first quarter, the first contraction since quarterly growth data started in the early 1990s.In the US, another 5.2 million workers lost their jobs, bringing the total number of newly unemployed to a staggering 22 million since mid-March.John Williams, a top Federal Reserve official, predicted it would take “a year or two” if not longer for the US to recover.The virus could spark another “lost decade” in Latin America, the IMF warned, while experts cautioned that freezing debt for poor countries will not save many developing world economies. ‘It’s awful’ Some European countries -- such as hard-hit Spain and Italy -- were embarking on a long road back to normality, with Venice residents strolling around quiet canals stripped of their usual throngs of tourists.Switzerland, Denmark and Finland were among those gradually re-opening shops and schools.In Germany, the government declared its outbreak “under control” and said select small shops will be allowed to reopen Monday and some childre would return to school within weeks. Infection rates there “have sunk significantly”, Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday, announcing the country’s plans to start producing up to 50 million masks a week from August to meet gaping market demand. Germany’s coronavirus deaths and infections have remained significantly below some of its worst-hit European neighbours, a fact which experts say is in part thanks to widespread testing. But Britain, which shut down later than continental Europe, extended its lockdown for at least three more weeks.It announced close to 850 new deaths on Friday, a slight spike from previous days that had seen fatalities start to draw down.And in Russia, recorded infections topped 32,000 as President Vladimir Putin warned that “the risks surrounding the epidemic’s spread are still very high, not just in Moscow but in many other Russian regions”. Around the world, people have come up with creative ways to bring back some social connection to their upended lives.In Rome an 18-year-old guitarist takes to his balcony every evening at sunset to play covers of Italian classics. “We decided to lend a hand to Italians: a message of hope,” Jacopo Mastrangelo told AFP from his patio.“We are accustomed to always seeing Rome full, teeming with people. Now the grass is growing between the cobblestones, everything has been left abandoned, and we decided to help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-china-s-covid-19-deaths-far-higher-after-wuhan-toll-revised-up/story-7iDsIDQjpLpG5dZCjyf8eO.html
18-04-2020||World||Italy declares victory over coronavirus in poorer southern regions||Italian health officials declared a long-sought victory Friday over the coronavirus in poorer southern regions that were less prepared for the pandemic than the richer north.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had warned six weeks ago that Italy’s ability to conquer Covid-19 depended on whether cases can stay largely contained to its northern epicentre around Milan.The disease has now officially claimed 22,745 lives in the Mediterranean country of 60 million people -- a toll second only to the United States.But Italy has still counted itself relatively lucky because the outbreak erupted in provinces with the best equipped medical staff.Conte decided to gamble early by imposing the Western world’s first peacetime national lockdown while the disease was still gathering force.His team argued that the short-term economic pain would pay off by saving the health care system and allowing the country to gradually reopen in the weeks to come.Italy’s top health officials said Friday that Conte’s big bet had paid off.“We have prevented the spread of contagions in southern regions,” public health council chief Franco Locatelli told reporters“This is now a fact supported by figures.”However, business leaders charge that Conte is doing unnecessary damage to the economy by extending the shutdown for too long. Levelling off The latest data from Italy’s civil protection service offered new reasons for Conte not to extend some of the strictest measures when they expire on May 4.They showed the number of people currently being treated for Covid-19 rising by only a few hundred for the first time since the outbreak began.The current number of cases had been going up by at least 1,000 a day for over a month.But they edged up by just 11 outside Milan’s Lombardy region on Friday.“In absolute terms, we have had had the highest number of recoveries since the start of the crisis,” civil protection service chief Angelo Berrelli told reporters. Conte also unveiled plans to roll out a phone app that could potentially help trace coronavirus infections and further stop the spread.The generally improving picture prompted the civil protection service to announce that it was suspending daily briefings and moving to a twice-a-week format.New tolls will still be issued daily. Standoff The leaders of Italy’s northern industrial heartland are pushing Conte to take another gamble and open as many businesses and industries as possible in early May.The shutdown has devastated once-booming factory towns and left millions furloughed or temporarily unemployed.Italy’s central bank said industrial production had declined by 15 percent in March and total economic output was set to contract by five percent in annual terms between January and March.But a standoff is emerging between the northern leaders and those south of Rome.Naples’s Campania governor Vincenzo De Luca warned Friday that he may have to “close our borders” to people from the north should those regions’ stay-at-home orders be lifted.The scale of business reopening will be determined by the number of deaths and recoveries reported over the coming days.Italy is still digging though data from individual regions to determine the true impact of its worst disaster since World War II.Previously undisclosed figures from its public health institute revealed that nearly 17,000 medics have been infected with the virus since Italy’s first Covid-19 death was recorded on February 21.Several Italian doctors have expressed fears that infected health care workers may have been unwittingly spreading the disease to their patients in the early weeks of the outbreak.A study released Thursday by the FNOMCeO medical association said Covid-19 has killed 125 doctors in Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-declares-victory-over-coronavirus-in-poorer-south/story-HUX91vA6u42K3UPEXm3CAO.html
18-04-2020||World||China’s economy contracts for first time in decades||China’s economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020, government data showed on Friday, confirming the damage done to the second largest economy in the world by the coronavirus pandemic. China’s gross domestic product stood at 20.65 trillion yuan (about $ 2.91 trillion) in the first quarter of 2020, down 6.8% year on year, data from the national bureau of statistics (NBS) showed Friday.Reports said it was the first time that the Chinese economy had contracted since the Cultural Revolution, which ended in 1976.State media reports said the 6.8% contraction translated to an economic loss of about 1.44 trillion yuan ($203.4 billion), which is equivalent to the GDP of New Zealand. The coronavirus first emerged China late last year, forcing the government to opt for an extensive countrywide shutdown of factories and businesses to contain the spread of the pathogen. The Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government has restarted manufacturing across provinces but the raging pandemic has severely disrupted the supply chain in the first three months, impacting demand globally.The impact of the pandemic on China’s foreign trade is expected to show in the second quarter with demand for goods from China – the world’s manufacturing hub – expected to plummet across the world.The pandemic has infected more than 2 million globally and killed more than 130,000; China has reported more than 4000 deaths although new infections have dropped significantly from their peak in February.“A breakdown of the data showed output of the service sector, which accounted for nearly 60% of the total GDP, dropped by 5.2%, while primary industry and the secondary industry saw a decline of 3.2% and 9.6%, respectively,” official news agency, Xinhua, said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-economy-contracts-for-first-time-in-decades/story-5jK30LFH0c1okBjZrweFEM.html

But the government ruled them out as Coved-19 casualties since one of them had twice tested negative for coronavirus and the second one had died of old-age related maladies. Both were over 80 years of age.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan credited the people of the state for their selfless corporation in the fight against the deadly contagion and hoped that the state would continue to keep the disease in check with containment efforts.

All these activities are being carried out in accordance with the requirements of the district administration.The RSSB statement said they had made optimal arrangements for the food and lodging of the 11,000 people at its centres in the country.The RSSB, which had started distribution of packed meals within a day of the March 25 lockdown ordered by the central government, has steadily raised the number of food packets made by its volunteers, the statement said.As of April 16, the RSSB distributes about 12 lakh packed meals every day through its 250 plus centres in the country. This includes the 1.25 lakh food packets that are distributed to 134 villages in the vicinity of RSSB Headquarters, Dera Baba Jaimal Singh Beas, the statement said.The meals are prepared by observing all norms of hygiene including social distancing. The volunteers involved in preparation of meals are medically examined and wear face masks, gloves and head covers, the statement said, underlining that the RSSB will provide support as long as the situation demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rssb-steps-up-to-ease-lockdown-blues-distributes-12-lakh-food-packets-daily/story-MdLfbggICYxNrSJzLVAu9N.html
18-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: 26 sailors at key Mumbai base test positive for Covid-19||In the single largest case of Indian military personnel being infected with the novel coronavirus, the navy on Saturday said 26 sailors from a key naval base in Mumbai have been placed under isolation after testing positive for Covid-19.The sailors from INS Angre --- a logistics and administrative support base under the Western Naval Command --- are being monitored at the navy’s premier hospital INHS Asvini. These cases have been traced to a single sailor who tested positive for Covid-19 eleven days ago. All the sailors live in the same residential complex. They are all in their 20s, except the oldest who is 47.“The detection of these Covid-19 cases is a result of meticulous contact tracing and aggressive screening/testing carried out by the Western Naval Command after one sailor tested positive on April 7 (he is among the 26). All these sailors continue to remain asymptomatic,” navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.Also read: Most of 25 navy men who tested positive for Covid-19 traced to single sailorThe cases have come at a time when the navies of the United States and France, are grappling with an alarming rise in coronavirus infections on some of their frontline warships. The first Indian sailor to test positive on April 7 contracted the disease from a retired sailor who was infected by his son who came to Mumbai from the United States, a naval officer said on condition of anonymity.The navy hasn’t had any Covid-19 case onboard any of its warships, submarines or air stations so far. INS Angre is under lockdown to prevent the spread of infection.“Since the sailor was tested positive for Covid-19, the entire unit (INS Angre) has been sealed off. Containment zones and buffer areas have been designated and frequent disinfection continues to be carried out as per protocol to contain spread by breaking the chain of transmission,” Madhwal added.The spokesperson said stringent quarantine and safety protocols have been enforced for personnel and their families at INS Angre, with door-to-door screening being undertaken for identification of more cases if any.In a recent address to naval personnel, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh stressed that it was vital to ensure that operational assets such as warships and submarines remained free of the virus and the navy was combat ready at all times.As reported by Hindustan Times on April 9, Singh told his men in a 15-minute video message that while they should hope for the best, the navy should plan for the worst.Also read: Vital to keep warships free of Covid-19, says Navy chiefThe navy chief said it was imperative to redouble efforts to ensure that navy personnel and their families stayed safe and healthy. “We are the last bastion in this fight. And if we who are supposed to be the care givers become care seekers, it will lead to a big problem,” Singh said in the message.The navy said on Saturday that it remained fully combat-ready and also prepared to participate in the national mission to fight the pandemic as well as provide support to friendly neighbours in the Indian Ocean Region.“Our assets continue to remain on patrol covering a vast oceanic swath from the Strait of Malacca in the east to Bab-el-Mandeb in the west, including undertaking Op Sankalp to provide reassurance and protection to our merchant vessels and anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden,” Madhwal said.All missions for coastal and offshore security continue unhindered, he added.Meanwhile, the army confirmed that a lady officer posted at the Military Hospital, Dehradun, has tested positive for the disease and the necessary contact tracing was being done. All primary contacts of the lady doctor are under home quarantine.In a statement on its latest Covid-19 case in Dehradun, the army dismissed reports that a large number of doctors at Lucknow were the lady medical officer’s primary contacts.“It is clarified that as per medical protocols none of the medical officers at Lucknow fall in the category of her primary contacts. It is further clarified that none of those doctors are symptomatic as on today. However, as a precautionary measure, they are being quarantined at their respective stations for 14 days before they start working in hospitals,” the army said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-26-sailors-at-key-mumbai-base-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-cl5E8tY4Pke3pHrk5PWMBN.html

18-04-2020||India||Sheer number of students swamp UP’s Kota evacuation plan, buses fall short||Around 6,000 students in over 200 buses left for their homes in Uttar Pradesh since Friday night but thousands of students from the state are still waiting for a ride and more buses are likely to be needed than the 250 Yogi Adityanath’s government had sent for the evacuation . Students thronged the pick up points marked by the Kota administration in the city during the lockdown. But more students arrived for boarding the buses than the stipulated number since Friday night.Nitesh Kumar Sharma, Media Marketing Head, Allen Career Institute, Kota said that “Our estimate of UP students in Kota was around 7,500 but there are many parents also who live with their wards in Kota and also many students are not enrolled in any institute but do self-study so roughly around 10,000 students are wanting to return to UP which has resulted in some shortage of buses”.Apart from several students enrolled in the coaching institutes, several other students also arrived for boarding the buses.He said that there could be shortage of buses for around 4,000 students of UP in Kota.Kota’s Additional District Magistrate, Narendra Gupta said 3,138 students have already been sent through 113 buses since Friday night and around 2,800 more students are being sent through the remaining 90 buses of UP but there is still need of more buses because of the number of students. To ensure social distancing, only 25 students are being sent in every bus with sitting capacity of over 60, he said.But Divisional Commissioner, LN Soni denied that there was any shortage of buses. “There is no shortage as such as buses are being filled gradually so that no crowd is gathered to flout social distancing but if there will be any shortage of buses then more buses will be arranged. UP government has sent 250 buses so far,” he said.Deputy Director, Public Relations department, Hariom Gurjar said that Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan government will also arrange buses according to the need to ferry students from Kota to UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheer-number-of-students-swamp-up-s-kota-evacuation-plan-buses-fall-short/story-ZH28upNupkuJaYhg7RiawJ.html

Till last reports were received at 5 pm, officials were trying to diffuse the tension by talking to the inmates.Most of the agitators were undertrial prisoners, officials said. The inmates separated the new and old jail complexes by locking the connecting gates.A police officer, who did not want to identified, said most of the agitators at Jalpaiguri central correctional home had been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.There were rumours that some guards were assaulted but officials did not confirm this. The inmates also ransacked security cameras placed inside the premises.There are around 1300 inmates in the correctional home, officials said. Among them, around 200 are undertrial prisoners. This is the biggest correctional home in north Bengal.This is the third incident of rioting inside correctional homes in West Bengal. Days after the lockdown started and bail hearings stopped in courts, there was violence at Baruipur correctional home in South 24 Parganas district on March 3.

18-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Bengal Governor alleges PDS scam, seeks urgent report from Mamata govt||Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has alleged there was a scam in the public distribution system (PDS) in the state, which was getting bigger by the day when the state needed to put up a united fight against coronavirus. He added that he had sought urgent details from the chief secretary’s office on the matter.“Covid 19 has to be unitedly fought on ground and not in media/public relations. No politics at all. Worried-PDS SCAM getting bigger by the day. PDS system is in virtual political hijack-a crime. Free ration for needy and not coffers. Defaulters be sternly dealt,” one of Dhankar’s many tweets on the issue said.Dhankar’s allegation is supported by BJP leaders, two of whom-- Darjeeling MP Raju Singh Bista and Alipurduars MP John Barla-- have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi claiming there was a scam in the PDS in Bengal. Bista has also spoken to Governor Dhankhar in this regard. Dhankhar’s tweet came two days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee acknowledged deficiencies in delivering ration to the needy and removed the state food and supplies secretary.“There is a problem with ration distribution, (it) is only about 10% of cases. We have to look into it and solve the problem,” she had said on Thursday.The state government has promised free ration to 7.5 crore people for six months. The state’s population is 9.13 crore, according to the census of 2011.Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded the resignation of the state’s food and supplies minister Jyoti Priya Mallick.“What’s the gain in making the secretary a scapegoat? It’s the minister who needs to be removed if he does not resign on his own,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said on Saturday.In another tweet, Dhankar said the PDS “SCAM BALOON” was getting bigger by the day and it involved “powerful ones”. He demanded a thorough probe to unearth “the sharks that hijacked PDS and denied poor and needy their due”.Mallick, however, refused to comment, saying that the chief minister had asked every leader and worker of the party to refrain from trading political barbs during the time of a crisis.In another tweet, Dhankhar wrote, “Concerned as regards illegalities and irregularities in making available benefit of free food grains to the poor and needy under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna, have sought urgent details through my office in this behalf from the State Chief Secretary @MamataOfficial”.Incidentally, the central scheme Dhankhar referred to has not been implemented in Bengal as the state has its own scheme. In Kolkata, senior Left leaders, including Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo members Biman Bose and Md Salim and Left leader in the Assembly Sujan Chakraborty were arrested while staging a demonstration against the alleged ration scam. The leaders maintained social distancing during the demonstration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-bengal-governor-alleges-pds-scam-seeks-urgent-report-from-mamata-govt/story-tLfYJ1B0mqDbYaJS1cqnyM.html

18-04-2020||India||Saudi Arabia’s Grand Mufti asks for holding Ramazan prayers at home due to coronavirus||Saudi Arabia’s topmost religious authority, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz al-Sheikh, has asked Muslims to perform Ramazan and the Eid prayers at home if the coronavirus outbreak doesn’t subside. The Grand Mufti’s statement was reported by the kingdom’s Okaz newspaper.“Ramadan’s Taraweeh prayer can be performed at home if it cannot be performed at mosques due to the preventive measures taken to fight the spread of coronavirus,” the Mufti is reported to have said.He added that the same will need to be followed for the Eid prayers if the virus doesn’t relent by then, necessitating continuance of social distancing measures.The month of Ramazan, which is slated to begin on the evening of April 23 this year and end with Eid celebrations, likely on May 24, is considered to be Muslims’ holy month, marked by day-long fasts and prayers to the almighty.Saudi Arabia had issued instructions last month to stop people from offering five daily prayers along with the Friday prayers inside mosques to aid in coronavirus containment efforts in the country.The kingdom on Sunday indefinitely extended the curfew to 24 hours a day to fight new infections that have grown rapidly recently.On Thursday, the Prophet’s Mosque in the holy city of Medina said that serving of evening meals in the mosque during Ramazan to poor people in need won’t be allowed as part of the breaking of the daily fast.Saudi Arabia currently has over 8,000 cases of coronavirus as per Worldometer, the website that tabulates and analyses all Covid-19 cases across the world, including over 90 deaths.India’s minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, too, had made a similar appeal to the Muslim clerics and other community leaders in India, asking them to encourage Ramzan prayers inside homes instead at public places such as mosques.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saudi-arabia-s-grand-mufti-asks-for-holding-ramazan-prayers-at-home-due-to-coronavirus/story-BZRacy1hxNJabaRPVcc2OP.html
18-04-2020||India||India toughens rules on investments from neighbours, seen aimed at China||The Indian government has brought China under the ambit of regulations that would prevent takeovers and acquisitions of Indian firms amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and an official said on Saturday any Chinese investments will now require the government’s approval.The move follows concerns that China could take over Indian companies at a time when their valuation has taken a massive hit because of the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic that originated in Wuhan nearly four months ago, the official said on condition of anonymity.The revision of the foreign direct investment policy to prevent opportunistic takeovers also follows China’s central bank buying a 1.01% stake in HDFC in the first quarter of 2020.Earlier, all investments from Pakistan and Bangladesh required the government’s approval for security reasons. The scope of this existing policy has been widened to cover all neighbouring countries that share a border with India, the official said quoting a government order.Without naming China, the order issued by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) on April 17 said the government had reviewed the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy “for curbing opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the current Covid-19 pandemic” and amended the FDI policy.“The change in policy will make it mandatory for all foreign investments from China, Pakistan and Bangladesh to go through the government’s scrutiny. So far, government permission was mandatory only for investments coming from Pakistan and Bangladesh,” the official cited above said.According to the order, “an entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route”. Other than investments from countries that share a border with India, non-resident entities – foreign individuals or companies – can invest in India without the government’s approval except in sectors where FDI is restricted, the order said.The order also requires the government’s approval for transferring ownership of an Indian company to any “existing or future” foreign investor belonging to the countries that share a border with India.India has 15,106.7 km of land border. The country shares land borders with Bangladesh (4,096.7 km) China (3,488 km), Pakistan (3,323 km), Nepal (1,751 km), Myanmar (1,643 km), Bhutan (699 km) and Afghanistan (106 km),but there are some exemptions for Nepal and Bhutan-based entities, the official said.Experts said the takeover threat is not completely ill-founded.Vikram Doshi, partner (tax and regulatory) at global consultancy firm PwC India said, “Covid-19 will impact several businesses, especially ones that are highly leveraged. It will open up takeover opportunities in many sectors.”“This press note is an attempt to place a check and give the government an opportunity to review such takeovers and investments coming into India from specific jurisdictions,” he said.Atul Pandey, partner in the law firm Khaitan & Co, said, “The notification by the government primarily intends to stem any attempts by Chinese firms to take control of Indian firms which have been affected and weakened by Covid-related lockdowns.”He added, “Any fresh investments by Chinese firms or any transfer of investments by existing investors to Chinese firms will be covered under this notification, and will require government approval.”Pandey said the government’s intention is clear in wanting to evaluate Chinese investments on a case-to-case basis. “However it is important to note that this notification will have the force of law once necessary amendments are introduced to the relevant FEMA [Foreign Exchange Management Act] regulations. Similar steps are being taken by the European Union and other jurisdictions like Australia,” he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi appreciated the move in a tweet: “I thank the Govt. for taking note of my warning and amending the FDI norms to make it mandatory for Govt. approval in some specific cases.”On April 12, he had cautioned the government against takeover threats. “The massive economic slowdown has weakened many Indian corporates making them attractive targets for takeovers. The Govt must not allow foreign interests to take control of any Indian corporate at this time of national crisis,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-toughens-rules-on-investments-from-neighbours-seen-aimed-at-china/story-2prXQ7PVSpMBFMJefTKYYN.html
18-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Some cases show neurological manifestations, says study||New Delhi: Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can, in some instances, lead to disorientation or delirium, say neurologists treating Covid-19 patients. While the focus has so far been on the effect of the disease on the respiratory system, as doctors treat more patients, they are beginning to notice and document new patterns.Neurologists are worried that some patients may be showing only neurological symptoms -- not other common symptoms such as fever and cough. If they are not monitored, diagnosis may be delayed. “Elderly patients with an infection, any infection including urinary tract infection can develop delirium. The general symptoms with fever could be confusion (delirium, encephalopathy). Loss of taste and smell are likely at the level of receptors in the mucosa,” said Dr Vivek Mathew, professor of neurology at Christian Medical College, Vellore which is treating Covid 19 patients.A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 10 based on data collected from January 16 to February 19 at 3 Covid -19 care centres at Wuhan, China which included 214 hospitalised patients found that 36.4% showed neurological manifestations. Compared with patients with non-severe infection, patients with severe infection were older and had more underlying disorders. These patients showed fewer typical symptoms such as fever and cough but more neurologic symptoms. Global trends seem to bear out the truth of those findings. “In Covid-19, we have so far seen primarily respiratory symptoms or primarily gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms but in the past 10 days, cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (a condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the peripheral nerves) have been documented in other parts of the world ,” Mathew added.Dr Col JD Mukherji, Principal Director and Head - Neurology at Max Super Speciality Hospital who is treating some Covid-19 patients says its still early days for India . “The general symptoms of the disease is headache, loss of smell and taste, fever, confusion. In China, cases of strokes, seizure and muscle injury have also been documented. We are on a learning curve in India. All of us will start seeing these cases as the numbers rise,” said Dr Mukherji.He listed the four ways in which the virus can affect the brain: direct viral injury, causing symptoms like viral encephalitis; an excessive immune response called cytokine storm which can damage the brain; unintended host-immune response where the immune response damages some other structure altogether “like the five cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (a condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the peripheral nerves) documented in Italy”; and indirectly, “in those whose immune response has been deliberately reduced through medication due to conditions such as myasthenia gravis (a neuro-muscular disease) or multiple sclerosis.”“There are no medicines for these neurological symptoms yet. If the entire body is in a cytokine storm, a monoclonal antibody can be used but they are expensive and may not be made available widely. In an Indian setting some steroids can be used which needs to be studied and decided,” said Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, Chairman, PSRI Institute of Neurosciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-some-cases-show-neurological-manifestations-says-study/story-Yevc0sexIVv7tRMyczwECP.html
18-04-2020||India||Now, an app to track wildlife straying outside habitats during lockdown||The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) is banking on an app called ‘Lockdown Wildlife Tracker’ that collects data of wildlife movement through human habitation during the lockdown period and which can help in wildlife conservation and management in the long run.It has been about a week since the app was launched and is mostly being used by officials. Dhananjai Mohan, director of WII said the application has been developed to track movement of wildlife during the lockdown. Videos of animal movements have been surfacing on social media from across the country since the app was launched amid the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus.“The data received on this application will help us learn more about movement of wildlife during the lockdown. This information is very critical in understanding the human-wildlife interface in the country. People can report sightings of animals in real time as well as at any later period and as it is GPS enabled, we will be able to understand the movement better,” said Mohan. But he cautioned wildlife enthusiasts not to venture out to take photos or videos of wild animals during the lockdown period. They should do that from the balconies and windows of their homes and not violate lockdown, he said.Once the lockdown is lifted, a national and state wise data will be released by the institute based on patterns of the animals’ movements. At present, the application can be downloaded from the website of WII, using the link https://wii.gov.in/lockdown_wildlife_tracker, and it will soon be available on Google Play store also.After downloading the application, one can upload photos along with GPS location of their sightings Officials said that this free to use application makes it convenient to keep track of what one sees, while making the data available for further analysis and interpretation.“Lockdown Wildlife Tracker app shall be available for download from Google Play store in a couple of days with more options, especially the bilingual version. After the lockdown period Wildlife Institute of India will share the data with the respective States and shall also come with detailed State Specific Reports and National Report.“The information collected as a part of this initiative during the lockdown phase shall help in wildlife conservation and management in the long run,” added the director.The important features of the application are, recording wildlife sightings anytime and from anywhere, upload sightings with photographs, quick entry tools making the recording experience short and simple and GPS enabled entries of all sightings.

Remaining active cases, too, are being monitored well,” Agarwal said.Agarwal noted the peculiarities and challenges faced by Kasargod to put this success story in the correct perspective. He pointed out that a large percentage of the district’s population lives abroad, which resulted in two waves of infections, first in Feb from a China-returned student and the second in mid-March after the return of individuals from the middle-east. The district is geographically distant from major cities and is farthest from the state capital and to add further to its woes, it was difficult to track expatriates that landed in large numbers at different airports before heading home. Agarwals praised Kerala’s strategy to appoint a special state officer in Kasaragod for seamless coordination. This special officer coordinated and monitored the functioning of district administration including between the line departments on the field and secretariat level.Kasaragod’s use of geospatial tracking through drones of people put in home quarantine, done under a highly effective campaign named #BreakTheChain for promoting social distancing was also praised. Agarwal said the district formed a core team of ‘Incident Commanders’ to attend to all Covid-19 related emergencies. Sec-144 was imposed in the entire district and all those with travel history were home quarantined. Identification of containment cluster zones through red colour coding was done and home delivery of essentials in these containment clusters was ensured.Highlighting the scale of the district’s response to the outbreak, Agarwal said that more than 17,300 contacts of positive cases were traced and quarantined followed by aggressive and quick testing, household surveys using ASHAA workers and health inspectors and setting up of Covid Care Centres and ICU facilities including operationalisation of Kasaragod medical college in just four days. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19One major distinct intervention of the district’s Covid-19 management was seen in quarantining of all primary and secondary contacts and also high-risk cases- those above 60 years of age—in isolation centres to prevent any chance of further transmissions.The district, Centre noted, was also not behind in social welfare initiatives to ensure poor and needy got free food and regular health checkups through ‘Care for Kasaragod’ initiative that saw the constitution of ‘Jana Jagratha Samithis’ at ward level for free food distribution to the poor and migrant workers. Shelter home and community kitchens were also started for this purpose. The district was also praised for keeping an effective check on black marketing, hoarding and price rise.“We got very positive and encouraging results when people returned (in Kasargod) after being cured of Covid-19. We have to work together in fighting this battle, in a whole-of-society whole-of-government approach,” Agarwal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-picks-kerala-s-kasaragod-covid-19-containment-model-for-high-praise-says-we-need-to-fight-together/story-4PdpnoQT7QZ83h8CLe2UzK.html
18-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Post-lockdown, exodus of expatriates worries Kerala||Kerala, which is on the verge of flattening the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) curve, is bracing for yet another daunting challenge. The weakening of oil prices coupled with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the oil-dependent economies in the Persian Gulf countries have led to uncertainties, as out of 1.8 million workers from Kerala in West Asia at least 200,000 are desperate to come back home after losing their jobs.The state government is looking at getting at these stranded expatriates back home after the ongoing nationwide lockdown, enforced initially for 21 days and since then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak, is lifted. The authorities are planning to repatriate the migrant workers in batches and lodging them in quarantine facilities for a mandatory 14 days. The government is working overtime to create accommodation for these Gulf returnees. Though many Covid-19 facilities have come up near four international airports in the state, more similar accommodations are required because of the anticipated bulk inflow of Gulf returnees. The state government has intensified searches for vacant flats, houses lying empty and even houseboats in the backwaters in Alappuzha that would be converted into makeshift quarantine facilities and Covid-19 hospitals.Kerala has reported 395 Covid-19 positive cases in the state to date, of whom 50% are either Gulf returnees or their contacts, as the state government is staring at an uphill task. Around 1.8 million people from Kerala work in the Persian Gulf nations, of whom over one million alone is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Last week, the UAE had threatened to impose restrictions on countries that refuse to take back their citizens, leading the state government to intensify its evacuation plans for the Malayalee expatriates.“Kerala is indebted to its expatriate population for the state’s rapid development and progress. We will try our best to bring them back. We know they are going through a harrowing time. We are with them. We will screen and quarantine them upon their return,” said state chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He has also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice seeking his intervention to repatriate the stranded Keralites from Persian Gulf countries.It is a double whammy for Kerala. While the state’s working-class population sought greener pastures in the Gulf, people from north India and the north-east filled the growing migrant labourers’ void in Kerala. The petro-dollar-fuelled a real estate boom in Kerala, as at least four million interstate migrant workers found jobs in the state at one point in time. Gradually, the boom has gone bust, and the migrant workers’ strength has dipped to 2.5 million after the central government’s demonetisation drive in 2016, triggering a crash in the realty sector.Kerala is grappling with twin issues. “The state has to do a fine balancing act. It has to keep its interstate migrant workers in good humour and at the same time bring the expatriates back home even though the remittances will take a beating, albeit temporarily. Migration is in an average Malyalaee’s genes. If not the Gulf, they will find another happy hunting ground soon. However, the next six months will be a struggle,” said Dr Irudaya Rajan, a migration expert and a faculty member at Thiruvananthapuram-based Centre for Development Studies.In 2018-19, the expatriates remitted Rs 88,000 crore, the backbone of the state’s money order economy.“Many countries had evacuated their nationals from West Asia. Our population there is huge. But India could have at least airlifted the sick and pregnant women, who are stranded there. Some of us feel that we are living in no man’s land. We hope that our evacuation will be expedited after the lockdown restrictions are lifted,” said KC Sajith, a Bahrain-based non-resident Keralite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-lockdown-exodus-of-expatriates-worries-kerala/story-kUrYlg1lqt8lYfm4cTUQPM.html

18-04-2020||India||Bengal to start pool sampling to detect Covid-19 carriers||The West Bengal government has decided to start ‘pool testing’ to detect asymptomatic carriers of the Covid-19 disease. This will help to further ramp up the testing record of Bengal, which has been repeatedly drawing flak for its low rate of Covid-19 tests.In pool testing, samples from two to five people are collected and tested in a single unit. If the pool tests negative then all individuals are regarded as negative. But if the pool sample is positive each person in the pool is tested individually to find out who is affected.This helps to increases the testing capacities and saves time, money and manpower.“In order to increase the capacity of the laboratories to screen more numbers of samples it has been decided to use pooled samples for screening of suspected Covid-19 cases in West Bengal,” read an order issued by the state government on Saturday.A top official of the state health department said that pool sampling will be done for asymptomatic patients in those areas where prevalence of the disease is less than 2% of the population.“Samples will be collected from asymptomatic patients during community survey and surveillance. Those suspects who have come in contact with Covid-19 patients and are living in areas where the disease has spread will not be included,” said the official.Saturday’s order came a day after the division bench of Calcutta high court comprising Chief Justice T B N Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee heard arguments on a writ petition and asked the government to inform what action was being taken to tackle the outbreak and how it was determining the cause of deaths. It also wanted to know what the government was doing to stop the spread of the disease and protect medical staff and doctors following guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organisation (WHO).Out of the 23 districts in West Bengal, at least 10 districts have not reported any case so far. Officials said that at least 81% of the cases are confined in urban areas with north and central Kolkata and urban areas of Howrah reporting the maximum cases. There is also a high prevalence of the disease in North 24 Parganas.“We will take samples of five people in one pool. The ICMR has already issued some guidelines for pool testing and those would be followed,” the official said.With allegations mounting that not enough tests are being done to detect Covid-19 patients in Bengal and numbers of persons infected with the deadly disease spiking every day, the Mamata Banerjee government had on Friday decided to test even the asymptomatic suspects who might be carriers of the virus.Till April 17 in Bengal only 4,212 samples were tested. Compared to this Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh had done 17,594, 18,029 and 20,298 tests respectively. “The more you test, the more you can detect asymptomatic carriers. Random sampling and pool testing are ways through which you can ramp up your testing record. This is a welcome step and the need of the hour,” Kunal Sarkar cardiologist said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-start-pool-sampling-to-detect-covid-19-carriers/story-cApfXgtT8wDR1ZIqIu0T8L.html
18-04-2020||India||India seeks to woo renewable energy firms shifting from China, plans manufacturing hubs at ports||The Centre has asked state governments and port authorities to identify land for creating new hubs for manufacturing renewable energy equipment as part of India’s efforts to attract firms shifting base from China amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre has written to the state governments and port authorities that the land identified by them should measure 50 to 500 acres and will be used for manufacturing hubs that will meet both domestic demand and seek global investments.The new and renewable energy ministry said on Saturday that at “a time when many companies are planning to shift their manufacturing base from China, it is [the] opportune time for India to bring policy changes for facilitating and catalysing manufacturing in India”.Tuticorin Port Trust and Madhya Pradesh and Odisha states have expressed keen interest in setting up renewable energy manufacturing parks. The Centre also plans to use Indian Railways’ vacant land to set up solar power plants of 30 gigawatt (GW) capacity. The railways plan to set up plants to generate 10GW in the first phase of the initiative. According to officials aware of the development, the renewable energy secretary chaired a meeting with manufacturing companies last week, and the ministry has been in touch with trade commissioners and representatives of several countries to invite them to invest in India. The Indian government also addressed the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum earlier this week and sought collaboration and investment by American firms, the ministry said. “These hubs will manufacture equipment like silicon ingots and wafers, solar cells and modules, wind equipment and ancillary items like back sheet, glass, steel frames, inverters and batteries,” said one of the officials cited above. India currently has the capacity to manufacture wind equipment of around 10GW, and it imports nearly 85% of solar cells and modules from abroad. “To incentivise domestic manufacturing, Government of India [has] already announced provisions to enable levying of Basic Customs Duty on import of solar cells and modules,” the ministry said. The ministry has also set up a renewable energy facilitation and promotion board to facilitate investments.“The Ministry has also strengthened the clauses in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to boost investor confidence. The three power and RE sector NBFCs, namely Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation Limitedand Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency have reduced their repayment charges to 2% for enhancing the fund availability for new projects in the sector. IREDA has brought out a new scheme for project specific funding to promote RE manufacturing in India,” the ministry said. India’s renewable energy sector has been tasked to meet its 175GW target by 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-to-woo-renewable-energy-firms-shifting-from-china-plans-manufacturing-hubs-at-ports/story-QWHBaLLfCuLxYIsy0eHvoO.html
18-04-2020||India||Govt tweaks FDI rules to shield domestic firms. Thank you, tweets Rahul Gandhi||Government approval will be necessary a company or an individual from a country that shares land border with India can invest in any sector, the Commerce Ministry’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) said Saturday.It said the government has reviewed the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy to curb “opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions” of Indian companies due to the current Covid-19 pandemic.Soon after the announcement, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who last week had asked the government to ensure that there are no predatory takeovers of Indian corporates amid the current economic slowdown, thanked the Centre for tweaking the rules. I thank the Govt. for taking note of my warning and amending the FDI norms to make it mandatory for Govt. approval in some specific cases. https://t.co/ztehExZXNcThe decision is likely to impact foreign investments, particularly from China which pumped in $2.34 billion in FDI between April 2000 and December 2019.An official said Indian corporates had expressed concerns about possible takeovers of distressed firms by Chinese companies. The DPIIT tweaked the rules by including individuals and companies of all countries that share land borders with India, effectively bringing Chinese individuals and companies under the new protocol. “An entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route. Further, a citizen of Pakistan or an entity incorporated in Pakistan can invest, only under the Government route, in sectors/activities other than defence, space, atomic energy and sectors/activities prohibited for foreign investment,” the DPIIT said in a press note.India shares land borders with six countries – Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Bhutan, Nepal and Pakistan.A company can invest in India, subject to the FDI policy except in those sectors or activities that are prohibited.Until now, government permission was mandatory only for investments coming from Bangladesh and Pakistan. The previous rule had said, “Citizen of Bangladesh or an entity incorporated in Bangladesh can invest only under the government route. Further, a citizen of Pakistan or an entity incorporated in Pakistan can invest, only under the government route, in sectors/activities other than defence, space, atomic energy and sectors/activities prohibited for foreign investment.” The DPIIT also put riders on the transfer of ownership any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction, “such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require government approval”.Last week, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had asked the government to ensure that there are no predatory takeovers of Indian corporates amid the current economic slowdown.“The massive economic slowdown has weakened many Indian corporates making them attractive targets for takeovers. The Govt must not allow foreign interests to take control of any Indian corporate at this time of national crisis,” he had tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tweaks-foreign-investment-rules-to-curb-opportunistic-takeovers/story-93jDE0mbun58VvVyiEv3CO.html

Lenain said the political authorities of the two countries have been working closely together from the beginning of the Coronavirus crisis. “It’s during tough times that the full significance of our partnership comes to the fore,” he said.Macron and Modi had a “long telephonic meeting” on March 31 and “fixed the areas of collaboration, discussed best practices, shared the latest information, particularly on research on a vaccine, and coordinated their international initiatives”, the envoy said.The foreign ministers of India and France regularly discuss the global situation and “that of our two countries in the face of this pandemic”, he added.The cooperation at all levels between the two countries amid the Covid-19 crisis facilitated the return of more than 2,200 travellers to France since the suspension of international flights, Lenain said.“These high-level discussions were backed by work on the ground for repatriating French citizens visiting India. Within a few weeks, thanks to the excellent cooperation of India’s central and local authorities, we were able to organise the departure of French travellers from Kolkata, Kochi, Goa, Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai,” he said.“But to reach these cities, we first chartered buses to bring them from Pushkar, Rishikesh, Dehradun, Manali, Mandi, Amritsar, Varanasi, Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Cochin, Hyderabad and Trivandrum,” he added, giving details of the major logistical exercise involved in repatriating French citizens.India has so far facilitated the return of some 35,000 foreign nationals from 48 countries who were stranded in the country due to travel restrictions.France is also among the more than 50 countries for which India has cleared supplies of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, described by some as key to treating Covid-19 cases. These countries will be provided the dug either through commercial sales or grants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-france-to-grant-special-aid-for-most-vulnerable-in-india-says-macron/story-AJof8tyrEgdzvI3QQeNEBL.html
18-04-2020||India||All together now||Does Katrina Kaif sweeping her floor or Malaika Arora preparing stew, and posting it on their respective social media accounts give you a sense of community? When we share our daily mundane chores online, are we looking for a sweet relief in these times of crisis? “I’m not sure about relief, but it’s giving me a loose sense of structure, an illusion of a routine when time seems to stretch ahead like a never-ending stream. My days seem to run into each other, and giving them any sort of order seems to be a tiny step back towards sanity. That said, were we to go back a couple of months to the time we all thought was ‘normal’, I’d have said this bordered on over sharing. But, on the whole, social media has made me feel connected, to people, to the community, to the world,” says 29-year-old Bengaluru based publishing professional, Chetana Divya Vasudev.As the pandemic continues to sweep nations, people have begun documenting their lives. “We don’t have any other form of relief right now other than relating to each other’s pain and agony,” says 29-year-old New Delhi-based development professional, Shubhranka Mondal.Once littered with clothing and vacations, the stories, posts, and captions we now see are about daily chores. “I think it’s also a form of interaction. We subconsciously crave interaction with others, and posting stuff and reactions lead to chats and conversations,” adds Ushna Mohan Iyer, a 28-year-old media professional based in Pune.However, how one uses a particular medium, varies. “I guess it depends on the person. And the nature of chores. For example, some people are vocal about their fitness goals online because they feel beholden to their online community and feel they can’t let them down. They use that as motivation to then get fit,” says Hyderabad-based Sana Mirza.Capturing and narrating our daily rituals also helps us bide time which might otherwise be spent worrying about the effects of the pandemic. New Delhi-based media professional, Udita Jain, says, “While a lot of this content makes you feel like ‘so?’, I think it helps people validate their own time by posting about it and knowing how people receive it. I agree that activities foster some sense of community. Singing, sewing, fitness and all other activities on social media reminds people that everyone’s in this together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/all-together-now/story-JFFADYhQSdzfGM5dbePe6M.html
18-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Sonbhadra district runs 683 community kitchens that cater to 24,000 families daily||Varanasi: Besides keeping track of quarantined cases and medical help required by residents, the control room at the Sonbhadra district headquarters has also been monitoring an additional input. Since March 30, the administration authorities of the state’s second largest district have been running 683 community kitchens. Home to 18 lakh people, over 43% of population belongs to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe groups who depend on forest produce and daily wage work. Due to the lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus, labourers have lost work and factories are closed.The community kitchens cater to around 45,000 people — 24,000 families — daily, chief development officer Ajay Dwivedi said. Around 40% of the kitchens are in remote villages in rough terrains like Dudhi, Ghorawal, and Myorupur. At least 250 villages are located in extremely tough terrains.Each kitchen also has an Anaj bank, to which residents and local businesses have contributed foodgrains, flour, lentils, rice and oil for making ration kits for the underprivileged. Till now, Dwivedi said around 176 quintal of flour, 203 quintal of rice, 36 quintals of lentils, 74 quintals of salt, 224 kg of spices, 2,759 liter of mustard oil and 89 quintal of vegetable. Much was distributed in 3,000 ration kits. Some is also used in the community kitchens.The administration has also provided a fund of Rs 10,000 each to gram panchayat to ensure that the community kitchen is well stocked. Opened in the compounds of primary schools, those employed in making mid-day meals are now cooking food for the larger community in the villages. Locals also help in packaging the food to deliver to all homes.Pyare Lal, a resident of Pharipaan area of Myorpur, however, did not receive food packets till a few days ago (others in his village did not face any problem). His neighbour, Jagat Vishwakarma took the matter up with assistant development officer (block) Shailendra Singh. Lal, who lives alone, now gets the food packet twice every day. Sanjay Kumar, a resident of Karahiya village in the rough terrain of Duddhi area said that till last week, he would receive only two or three poori and a small quantity of vegetable in the food packet that was delivered to him daily. Together with some other locals, he raised the issue of insufficient food to senior authorities and the District Magistrate e S Rajalingam instructed the panchayat secretary to visit the village and ensure that the needy receive a full meal from the community kitchen. “Since Monday, our food packets comprise six puris and sabji in the morning and six rotis with vegetable or dal chawal in the evening,” he said. Dwivedi said that strict monitoring was being done through video calling the village panchayat secretary and village head, who have been given the responsibility to look after the community kitchens, from preparing the food to delivering it, to find out whether the community kitchens are running properly and food packets with enough food are being delivered. As soon as a complaint is received, it is addressed immediately, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-sonbhadra-district-runs-683-community-kitchens-that-cater-to-24-000-families-daily/story-Cp2OQt9AWyzyFV4OmXDFsK.html

This has led to shutting down of all the construction works across Maharashtra. Consequently, construction workers have no work. They have to stay at home and are also facing a financial crisis as they have no source of income,” an order issued by the labour department said.“Considering this, the state government has decided to provide financial help to all the registered and active construction workers,” it said.The order came days after hundreds of migrant labourers, mostly from West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, gathered outside the Bandra railway station demanding that they be sent back to their homes. Only those workers who are registered with the state’s Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (BOCWWB) will be eligible to get the monetary assistance. Their registration is also expected to be active, which means renewed every year, said SC Srirangam, the board’s secretary and chief executive officer.Also read: Coronavirus cases in India rise to 14,378, death toll at 480Maharashtra has 22.70 lakh registered construction workers but only 12.18 lakh who are active, will get benefit of the decision, Srirangam said.Meanwhile, the state has decided to allow construction work in cities, including Mumbai and Pune, with a rider that prior permission from civic authorities will be mandatory.According to the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Friday, the state has given permission for all urgent pre-monsoon works.

This is a relatively slower increase compared to the previous 48 hours, when the country’s case count rose 28 per cent to 11,933. On Saturday morning, however, the number of coronavirus positive cases stood at 14,378.The country’s doubling rate of Covid-19 positive cases has taken a dip and currently stands at 6.2 days, at some places 8 days instead of the earlier three days, the Union Health Ministry had said on Friday. The dip in the coronavirus growth trajectory has a lot to do with the nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March. The lockdown was later extended till May 3. Before the first phase of the lockdown, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases was about 3 days, but according to data in the past 7 days, the doubling rate of cases now stands at 6.2 days. Doubling rate in 19 states and union territories are even lower than average doubling rate of the country, according to ministry data.ALSO READ | Coronavirus update: 25 Indian Navy personnel test positive for Covid-19So far this week, the number of cases has gone up by 64 percent (between Sunday evening and Friday evening). This is a slower increase compared to the previous five days, when confirmed cases had risen by 76 percent.Despite India’s Covid-19 trajectory tapering slightly, it continues to be steeper compared to Asian peers such as Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, and Pakistan. India’s curve is flatter than that of several Western nations where the virus has claimed far more lives. The country’s death toll as of Saturday morning is 480.India’s case count is now roughly double of what it was eight days ago. This is a slower rate compared to a few days ago, when cases were doubling every four days. At the current rate of compounded growth, the number of cases could rise to 20,000 by Tuesday.

Active cases exclude deaths and recoveries from the list of confirmed cases.The number of coronavirus patients in Maharashtra has already crossed the 3000 mark.National capital Delhi has the second most number of positive cases (1707), closely followed by Madhya Pradesh (1,186). Tamil Nadu also has a very high concentration of coronavirus positive patients.These are current figures and the state-wise distribution could escalate in the coming days.

18-04-2020||India||Centre tells states to use mobile tracking method for quarantine enforcement||The Union government’s telecommunications department is offering states the ability to mass track people using mobile network tower data, offering a platform that can let ground-level authorities create virtual geo-fences for those meant to be in quarantine, as well as a second service that can let officials send out SMS messages to people in a specific area for Covid-19 containment efforts.Officials in several states have acknowledged previously that they use mobile network information to monitor those meant to be under quarantine, but the Centre’s pitch to other states that are not using such services at present details how these tools work and the sort of legal authorization behind it. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe first service, a mobile device surveillance system called Covid Quarantine Alert System, uses cellphone tower – also called a base transceiver station (BTS) – data to determine the approximate location of a person. If this person has been put on a watch-list, the system throws up an alert if their phone goes out of that geographic area and connects to a different BTS, according to an official who asked not to be named.To put someone on a watch-list, state authorities will need to send the person’s phone number to the department of telecom (DoT). An alert will also be sent if a mobile number if switched off for too long, the official quoted above said, adding that the tracking will not work if people leave their phones behind.“As on April 16, we tracked the movement of 70,422 persons in states including Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. The service is authorised by the home secretary of the respective states and is allowed under the provision of section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph’s act for public emergency,” the person quoted above said.The law invoked, telegraph act’s section 5(2), is used for legal interception of telecommunications that is allowed in the Indian constitution under specific conditions, such as for national security and to prevent a crime. Breaking quarantine is a criminal offence under Section 188 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, which has been invoked since India declared the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) a health emergency.The second service, called Covid-19 Savdhan, too has been deployed by some states. “Covid-19 Savdhan allows messaging in a targeted geographic area, we can send message to targeted groups, narrowing it down to one mobile tower. It is of great use in the hotspots and containment zones. This is again being done in Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Sikkim, Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab and Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” the functionary quoted above said.To get more states to start using these utilities, the Union government first reached out through the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The DoT will now write to the chief secretaries of those that have not adopted it, the person quoted above said, adding that both services are free of charge. The official also said that states will not be passed on the names of the mobile phone users. “It is a non-intrusive way of checking if a person is within the tower area; we don’t monitor the phone usage,” this person added. A second official who occupies a senior post in the telecom department, said the tools have been developed by C-DOT to help health and disaster management authorities. “Covid Savdhan application, in particular, enables authorities to reach out to all mobile subscribers in any particular containment zone up to the level of individual mobile tower and convey targeted messages about health, well-being, water supply etc by means of SMS in local language,” this person added.The messaging service is available in all regional languages, and so far 26 million messages have been sent out through the platform for Covid-19 related communication till now. C-Dot is a government agency that develops computer applications for use in telecommunications.Experts said for the government legally use such surveillance mechanisms,there needs to be an order issued by the Union as well as the state governments. “The systems of mass surveillance which are being deployed are being done without any clear legal authority or limits. While the Telegraph Act does permit the government to place people under surveillance, it also contains safeguards which must be followed. It also remains an open question how the Central government’s cellphone tracking data will integrate with the data gathered by the Aarogya Setu app,” said Apar Gupta from the Internet Freedom Foundation, who was one of the lawyers in a PIL filed by the PUCL that led to the codification of the guidelines under section 5(2). “While there is a concept in health about disaster and epidemic tracking, those are applied only to people who fall sick. These steps are larger in ambit and the fundamental right to privacy is breached. The government should be transparent and issue orders, while letting people know that this is a temporary measure, that a complaint officer will be instated, and talk about how the data will be dealt with once the pandemic is over,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima of the digital rights group Access Now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-states-to-use-mobile-tracking-method-for-quarantine-enforcement/story-6lEzD9lNPuVQdhOSsgrSgJ.html
18-04-2020||India||Yogi Adityanath’s Kota evacuation plan puts Nitish Kumar in oppn firing line||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday came under fire from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the leading opposition party in the state, for not evacuating it students from Kota in Rajasthan but its ally, the Congress, sided with the state government.Lalu Prasad’s heir apparent and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav squarely blamed chief minister Nitish Kumar for washing his hands off students and migrant labourers stranded outside the state because of the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus.What has set the political cauldron boiling is the decision by Uttar Pradesh to send around 250 buses to evacuate approximately 7,500 medical and engineering aspirants from Kota, often described as India’s coaching capital for competitive exams.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.Bihar has been maintaining that the Rajasthan government should take care of the students in Kota and provide them security, as ferrying them back to their respective states was against the lockdown norms.In a televised message Saturday, chief minister Nitish Kumar assured people of the state, stranded outside, that his government was making every effort to extend all possible help to them through its resident commissioners and the disaster management department.Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) found support from an unexpected corner, with the Congress praising the chief minister on his stand.“The UP government has flouted lockdown norms by sending buses to fetch its students from Kota. The Congress government in Rajasthan has assured to extend facilities, including food, to the students there. On this, Nitish Kumar has agreed not to send buses to fetch its students. We support Kumar on this stand and in honouring lockdown norms. It is not just about the students in Kota. Lakhs of Biharis, who have gone out in pursuit of education and job, are stranded outside. We are with the government in its effort to contain the coronavirus pandemic. This is no time to play politics over it,” said Congress MLC and national spokesperson Prem Chandra Mishra.In an open letter, the RJD leader, however, asked Kumar how other BJP-ruled states were so capable (to protect the interest of their people), while Bihar, which had a coalition government with the BJP, found itself so “helpless”.He also said that Bihar was “indecisive” and “rude” in dealing with the hapless migrant labourers and students stranded outside the state during lockdown.Yadav said other BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh had shown empathy towards their people stranded outside and taken action to bring them home, while Bihar had left them in the lurch.“The Gujarat government had made arrangements to bring back 1800 people stranded in Haridwar in 28 luxury buses during the lockdown. Similarly, UP had dispatched 200 buses, which made several trips, to bring back its people from Delhi NCR, while it made arrangements to send 250 buses to bring back its 7,500 students from Kota,” said Yadav in his letter, which he also posted on his Facebook page.On April 13, Bihar had lodged its strong protest with Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla over what it said was flagrant violation of the lockdown norms by the Rajasthan government in issuing private vehicle passes for transportation of people to Bihar. It had even sought action against the Kota district magistrate for issuing private vehicle passes during the lockdown.Meanwhile, BJP distanced itself from the controversy, saying it was not the right time to play politics.“The Bihar government is assessing the whole situation and doing its best to serve Biharis within and outside the state. Our chief minister has ensured help to Bihar natives residing anywhere in the country. It’s not the time to play politics during coronavirus pandemic,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand.On UP’s action, he said, “India is fighting against coronavirus in the best possible manner under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. Every state is doing its best to serve its people. The UP government took the best decision in the interest of its native students, after assessing its situation.”The Janata Dal (United), however, was not the same page with the BJP on UP’s decision to send buses to Kota to bring back its students.“It is against the norms of lockdown,” said a JD (U) leader, requesting anonymity.Efforts to reach JD (U) spokesperson Niraj Kumar, also Bihar’s minister for information and public relations department, proved futile.Kota draws thousands of students from all over the country, including Bihar, who enrol in institutes to prepare for IIT-JEE and National Eligibility-cum- Entrance Test for undergraduate engineering and medical courses, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-2-0-nitish-kumar-gets-flak-for-not-evacuating-students-from-kota/story-vEPSXWzFds8nrgrTJpfOTI.html

He said the guidelines to allow limited activities after April 20 and the measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India amid the coronavirus crisis were also appreciated.The GoM met a day after the PMO held a preparatory meeting with officials of seven key ministries to go through the fine details of partially relaxing the ongoing lockdown, a move aimed at restarting activity in select sectors of the Indian economy.As reported by Hindustan Times on Friday, the meeting, chaired by PM Narendra Modi’s Principal Secretary P K Mishra, primarily focused on getting workers to factories and back, and on the systems and processes states need to put in place for effective implementation of the guidelines for a partial exit from the lockdown as laid out in a home ministry order of April 15.The partial relaxation of restrictions will allow economic activities to restart to an extent and also provide much-needed employment to people, especially daily wage earners.“The GoM appreciated disbursement of Rs 31,000 crore to more than 33.25 crore beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to mitigate the problems of economically weaker sections of population,” said one of the officials cited above.The second official said the ministers also examined suggestions to enlist services of retired doctors, health professionals and medical students in the final year of graduation to strengthen the national effort to combat the fast spreading disease.He said the GoM also reiterated its appeal to citizens to observe social distancing norms and stay away from participating in mass prayers or religious congregations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economic-action-in-non-hotspot-zones-begins-april-20-rajnath-singh-reviews/story-IvLsCfEzT385whIf936JtI.html

According to ANI, the private litigation, one of many such pleas, said the government should allow for “their safe travel to their hometowns and villages and provide necessary transportation” from cities to their homes.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers are stuck in several states after the countrywide lockdown was announced on March 24 to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. They have borne the brunt after the 21-day lockdown was subsequently extended up to May 3 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and were left without money to buy food or pay rent.The PIL was filed by lawyer Prashant Bhushan on behalf of Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), former professor and founder trustee Jagdeep S Chhokar and advocate Gaurav Jain.The petition said the migrant workers, who are amongst the worst affected due to the ongoing lockdown, must be allowed to go back to their homes after being tested for Covid-19.Also read| Mapping Covid-19: Most of India’s economic hotspots under grip of coronavirus“Those who test negative for COVID-19 must not be forcefully kept in shelters or away from their homes and families against their wishes.

18-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown 2.0: Centre gears up for biggest surge in demand for jobs under MGNREGS||As tens and thousands of daily wage workers have flocked back to their home states amid the Covid-19 lockdown, the Centre is gearing up for a surge in demand for jobs in the employment scheme MGNREGS.During fiscal 2020-21, the government made an initial provision for 280.76 crore persondays of work – the highest ever – to cater to jobless workers after the closure of many business establishments due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Last year, the MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) generated 276.76 crore persondays, which was attributed largely due to drought in vast stretches in India. This year, despite the predictions of a normal monsoon, the Union rural development ministry has arranged for more MGNREGS work.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageBetween fiscal 2016-17 and fiscal 2018-19, the world’s largest job guarantee scheme generated 256.56 crore, 231.31 core and 220.93 crore persondays of work, respectively.The higher persondays – or people demanding more jobs – may also push the government to inject more money into the scheme as it has to pay higher per capita wages due to an upward revision of wages from April 1.The Centre has made an upward hike of between Rs 13 and Rs 34, the highest in the past six years. Last year, 10 states saw a zero hike and in one case, the wage rate was lowered. The new wages will help 12.8 crore MGNREGS workers.“It is clear that the government will require to pump in more funds as a huge section of the Indian workforce will see MGNREGS as their lifeline in this situation,” said Himangshu, an economist at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.Rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar reviewed all flagship schemes of his ministry on Thursday, and also took into account the release of Rs 7300 crore under MGNREGS to clear pending dues of fiscal 2019-20 and to meet the wage dues for the first fortnight of 2020-21.Tomar advised his ministry to assist 40 lakh beneficiaries of the rural housing scheme (PMAYG), who have received up to the third instalment of funds, to help them quickly complete their houses. The Centre has released Rs 800.63 crore to the states out of the budget of Rs.19,500 crore.But as the focus remains sharply on MGNREGS, which provides employment in distress, the Centre has allowed rural jobs to resume from April 20 outside the Covid-19 hot spots.Officials in the rural ministry indicated big construction projects that involve a large number of workers might be avoided for some time to adhere to social distancing rules, and smaller projects, such as building farm ponds, cattle shed or houses under PMAYG, will be pushed.But as many workers may not be willing to come to work while ignoring health risks, economist Reetika Khera said the government should consider giving some wages even if they sit at home. “We also have to bear in mind that like us, MGNREGS workers will be nervous about joining works that involve gatherings. This will be an impediment to claiming their legal right. In this situation, the government should give 10 days of wages to every MGNREGS workers for three months. Further, the government must fix the issue of failed and diverted payments arising due to the Aadhaar-payment bridge system.”Meanwhile, the Centre has identified a host of best rural Indian practices and the Union panchayeti raj ministry is trying to see if other states replicate some of these models. These models include a postman taking micro-ATM to villages to provide cash at the doorstep amid the lockdown in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharth Nagar or villagers in a Kerala stitching and distributing about 18 lakh cotton masks through 300 tailoring units, while 21 micro firms prepared 2,700 litres of sanitiser.In Meerut, more than 2,800 sanitation workers were provided masks, sanitisers, soaps and gloves to help them in their daily duty of keeping villages clean. In Dadra and Nagar Haveli, daily meals are provided to the needy and stray cattle and animals, according to an official communication.The Union Territory has distributed more than 130,000 hand sanitisers and 17,000 masks free of cost in rural areas. Its gram panchayats are distributing handbills and pamphlets to create awareness among the public. The communique further said all high-rise building lifts are being sanitised and younger people are advised to let only senior citizens, pregnant women and disabled people use elevators.The rural panchayat network in Andhra Pradesh has focused on door-to-door survey and distribution of masks. The state has set a target of distributing about 16 crore masks while it undertakes the third round of door-to-door survey, according to the government communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gears-up-for-biggest-surge-in-demand-for-jobs-under-mgnregs/story-kKmaq6D5vL8wvl2lMFPTiP.html
18-04-2020||India||Over 2,000 Jagannath temple servitors to receive Rs 5,000 each amid Covid-19 lockdown||With the 11th century Jagannath temple in Puri shutting down for over a month amid the coronavirus crisis, the temple administration on Friday decided to give Rs 5,000 to each of its 2100 servitors working in the temple.Odisha had shut its most famous temple for pilgrims from March 20 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease. With no devotees visiting the temple, cash donations from devotees, the major source of earning for the priests there has stopped.Jitendra Sahu, who is the administrator of rituals in the temple, said Rs 1.06 crore would be given to the 2,130 sevayat (priests or servitors) of the temple. The Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) will credit Rs 5,000 to the bank accounts of each servitor, Sahu said.“This is a welcome step. I, on behalf of the servitors and the Temple Managing Committee, thank the chief administrator and the deputy chief administrator of the temple administration for this decision,” said Ramachandra Dasmohapatra, a servitor and member of the Temple Managing Committee.Priests at other temples demand financial assistancePriests of other temples in Odisha have also demanded assistance from the government. At Sakshigopal temple, a shrine of Lord Vishnu located 40 kilometres away from Jagannath temple, over 200 priests are having a tough time amid the lockdown. Every day thousands of people who came to Puri used to visit the 400-year-old temple until the lockdown was enforced amid the coronavirus pandemic last month.“We are entirely dependent on the generosity of the pilgrims. We are somehow keeping up the rituals of the Lord. As Jagannath temple is cash-rich, they could give money to the priests. Who will look after us,” said Shaymsundar Mohapatra, a senior priest at the temple.Similarly, hundreds of priests in Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar have also demanded financial assistance from the government. “We thought we would earn something from the Rukuna Rathyatra last month. But we were disappointed after it was cancelled. How long will we go on like this,” asked Kamalakanta Badu, a priest of the temple. Uncertainty over Rath Yatra loomsThe financial assistance to the families of the temple priests has come at a time when there is a lot of uncertainty over the conduct of the annual Rath Yatra on June 23. The annual Chandan Jatra of Lord Jagannath scheduled on April 26 at Narendra Pokhari (pond) in Puri would be held without the participation of devotees in view of the lockdown. The slicing of the wooden logs for the car festival has already started and the construction of the three chariots is scheduled to start on April 26.Though Puri is not in the list of Covid-19 hotspots of the country, there is still a lot of doubt if the annual car festival can be held this year. “Whether Rath Yatra will be organised or not this year is under discussion. No decision has been taken so far in this regard. We will take a final call on it soon,” said state law minister Pratap Jena.The lockdown had led to the cancellation of another famous car festival in Bhubaneswar, the Rukuna Rathayatra, on April 1.  For the first time in its history, the annual car festival of Lord Lingaraj in Bhubaneswar on the occasion of Ashokastami could not be held this year due to the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown.During the occasion, the idols of Lord Lingaraj along with Gopalini (Parvati), Kumara and Nandikesvara and an image of Govinda are taken out in a chariot from Lingaraj temple to Rameswaram temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2000-jagannath-temple-servitors-to-receive-rs-5000-each-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-g4sZwzxDze37DMwncJ7lfO.html
18-04-2020||India||In Cong’s team on Covid-19, Rahul Gandhi a member. Manmohan Singh heads it||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday constituted a consultative group, headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to deliberate on current matters related to the coronavirus outbreak and formulate the party’s views on various issues.The 11-member group also comprises former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, who will also be its convenor, general secretary in-charge organisation KC Venugopal and former union ministers P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Jairam Ramesh.This is for the first time after he stepped down as the Congress president on May 25 last year following the party’s drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections that Rahul Gandhi has become a member of a newly formed organisational panel.Even after his resignation from the top post, he continued to be a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, the central election committee (CEC), a panel that selects candidates for any state or Lok Sabha polls, the election coordination committee and the group to look into future challenges.Rahul Gandhi also held strategy meetings during the budget session of Parliament that concluded last month.In a press release, the party said the consultative group will meet virtually, normally every day, to deliberate on matters of current concern and formulate views of the party on various issues.The other members of the group are Praveen Chakravarty, Gaurav Vallabh, Supriya Shrinate and Rohan Gupta.Explaining the functioning of the group, a member said on the condition of anonymity that the panel will give suggestions to the government on both health and economic challenges.“Economic pandemic is even bigger than the health pandemic. As Rahul Gandhi had said that the Congress as the principal opposition and the country’s oldest political party will continue to give its suggestions; irrespective, if the government accepts those or not,” he said.“We are duty bound to place in public domain the challenges and the solutions thereof in terms of way ahead. It is deeply felt by many many people in the country that the government is doing very little in terms of laying down a roadmap for kick-starting the economy and its strategy for economic recovery,” the member added.He said the group will have wider consultations with chief ministers, former chief ministers, former union ministers, party leaders, non-Congress leaders and experts.“Apart from suggestions and solutions, the group will keep coming out with warnings to the government about the forthcoming challenges,” the member said.He said Rahul Gandhi’s press conference on Thursday laid down a blueprint for constructive suggestions and positive criticism.“He happens to be the leader who is a rallying point for the party even though he may not hold any post. That is why with Dr Manmohan Singh, him and Chidambaram there, this committee will be able to lay down a futuristic roadmap for the country,” the member said.Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been interacting with party leaders from across the country through video-conferencing, urging them to play an active role in the fight against the deadly Covid-19 by reaching out to maximum number of people in distress due to the nationwide lockdown apart from assessing the work of the Centre and state governments in containing the pandemic in their respective states.The Congress has repeatedly demanded scaling up the testing and providing personal protection equipment (PPE) to doctors, nurses and health workers.It has also urged the government to spell out steps it planned to take to mitigate the woes of migrant labourers stranded on the borders of different states and those of the farmers waiting to harvest crops.The Congress has further demanded state-specific special economic packages and urged the Centre to clear all pending dues, including the GST, to states to enable them to fight the pandemic.It said the government must ensure phased lifting of the lockdown and coordinate with states to mitigate the sufferings of the poor.For her part, the Congress chief has written six letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi since March 23, seeking relief for different sections and suggesting measures to the government in dealing with the coronavirus.Addressing a news conference on Thursday through video-conferencing, Rahul Gandhi had said lockdown is not a solution to defeat Covid-19 but a pause button and stressed the need for having a comprehensive exit strategy in place to ensure that the coronavirus does not come back once the restrictions are lifted.While seeking immediate release of money and resources to states to enable them to deal with the pandemic in a nuanced manner, Rahul Gandhi urged the government to manage its funding to enable the country to tide over the massive financial backlash due to coronavirus.“One must keep in mind that do not use all our ammunition right now, because if you use all your ammunition right now, and we end up 2-3 months from now with a serious financial blowback. We have a real serious problem. So, it has to be thought through strategically. My advice is give out as much money to the poorest, weakest people as you can, but, keep in mind that there is going to be a financial backlash,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-sets-up-new-team-on-covid-19-manmohan-singh-plays-lead-role/story-Wa77wI4HGnKV5nIUTD6TbP.html

18-04-2020||India||States can use rapid testing for containment zones and hot spots: ICMR||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued a new rapid testing protocol that allow states to use rapid testing kits wherever they want, including in Covid-19 containment zones and hot spots.The new protocol was issued following requests from states, some of which wanted quicker results from tests in affected areas to speedily put in place aggressive containment measures.ICMR director general Balram Bhargava has also written to state chief secretaries and principal health secretaries, asking them to use the rapid testing kits at places they deem fit, provided the protocols are followed.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“I am writing to you with reference to the rapid antibody test kits for Covid-19 testing. It is understood that many states intend to use these kits in affected areas…The National Task Force at ICMR has carefully reviewed the data evolving from various countries on use of such kits,” he said in his letter.Also read | Covid-19 virus accidentally leaked by intern at Wuhan lab: Report“Based on available evidence, the testing strategy for Covid-19 has been revised further…”The rapid antibody test is a supplementary tool to assess the prevalence of diseases within a specific area or perimeter. This test will only be of use after a minimum of seven days of the onset of symptoms.Experts in the ICMR also said data about these rapid tests is emerging, and the understanding of their utility for diagnosis is still evolving. As of now, rapid tests are mainly useful for epidemiological studies (to know the distribution, patterns and determinants of disease conditions), and for surveillance to get real-time data.Since the gold standard frontline test for Covid-19 diagnosis is the real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based molecular test, which is aimed at early virus detection, the rapid antibody test cannot replace the frontline test, the ICMR recommended in its revised protocol.An ICMR official, on condition of anonymity, said: “Many states want to go in for aggressive testing in containment zones and want to make use of rapid testing in these areas as they have to test almost everyone with influenza-like illness in those areas. We have drafted the new protocol keeping in mind the requests of the states. However, rapid diagnostic test is ideally a surveillance tool to capture trends. It cannot be used for early diagnosis.”According to the new ICMR protocol, only those showing symptoms of influenza-like illness such as fever, cough and cold for seven or more days in hot spot areas should be made to undergo a rapid test.Those who are found positive in the rapid test must be quarantined for at least the next seven days. Those who test negative should also remain under home quarantine for at least seven days as they are in a hot spot area.“If clinical suspicion is high for Covid-19, then perform an RT-PCR test to reach a confirm diagnosis,” the ICMR protocol stated.However, the rapid test is best suited to ascertain disease prevalence in an outbreak situation, and the ICMR has made special recommendations in the revised protocol that testing should also be done as a surveillance tool for epidemiological purposes in such areas where cases have not emerged so far, or areas with few cases that may emerge as potential hot spots in future.Also read: Most of 25 navy men who tested positive for Covid-19 traced to single sailorThe testing, however, has to be done under strict medical supervision.“The IgM antibody that is the first antibody to develop after one gets an infection can help in detecting a recent infection.

Haleem is exported to the Persian Gulf countries after it was granted the geographical indication tag in 2010, ” said Mohd Abdul Majeed, president, Hyderabad Haleem Makers’ Association.Each plate of mutton haleem is priced between Rs 150 and Rs 200 depending on the outlet. The haleem business during Ramzan is estimated to be around Rs 800 crore every year.Unfortunately, haleem will not tickle Hyderabadi gourmet’s palate this Ramzan.The breaking of the day’s fast or, roza, takes place after sundown and haleem would not available at that time because the Telangana government has enforced a strict lockdown restrictions between 6pm and 6am. “There is no possibility of haleem being served, as iftar parties have been banned this Ramzan,” Majeed said.All restaurants and hotels are closed, including the outlets making haleem, because of the ongoing lockdown.“It requires elaborate preparations for making haleem. We have to set up bhattis (ovens) made of mud to cook the mutton, along with ghee, wheat, and spices on a low flame for several hours. We start the preparations as early as 4 am and complete cooking by afternoon, followed by arrangements for distribution. Alas! Nothing can be done this year because of the lockdown,” said Majeed, whose Pista House near Charminar is one of the most sought-after restaurants that serve haleem in the city.Mutton, the key ingredient for haleem, is scarce due to the lockdown even though spices and other cooking materials are still readily available.“We used to get quality meat from Chengicherla slaughterhouse on the outskirts of Hyderabad. But that’s closed because of the lockdown. Even if we manage to get the meat from local suppliers, there’s no demand, as the supply mechanism is disrupted,” he said.Besides, chefs and their assistants have mostly taken off for their respective native places after the restaurants downed their shutters while complying with the government’s lockdown restrictions.“Initially, our association thought of engaging Swiggy and Zomato for home deliveries, but that too is not feasible because of the restriction in movements after 6 pm,” he added.The haleem makers are waiting for the outcome of the Telangana cabinet meeting slated to be held on Sunday on the easing of lockdown curbs in some select sectors on the lines proposed by the Centre from April 20 onwards. “We are planning to meet Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to allow home delivery after 6 pm,” Majeed said.However, the haleem makers are apprehensive that even after May 3 -- when the lockdown is likely to be lifted -- there might be restrictions on hotels and restaurants to avoid mass gatherings, as the government would still strictly enforce social distancing norms.“If the government allows takeaway facilities to function, it may not be a feasible idea to do business, as large crowds would gather near haleem outlets. It doesn’t augur well for us,” he added.Besides the unavailability of haleem, this Ramzan promises to set a different benchmark for the spiritually inclined.Ulemas and Muftis from all schools of Islamic thought have appealed to the members of their community to offer Taraweeh prayers, a special form of Islamic meditation, that involves reading long portions of the Holy Quran, at their respective homes. Taraweeh -- derived from the Arabic word meaning “to rest and relax” – prayers are conducted after Isha, every evening’s last daily prayer.“All Muslims have been urged to partake iftar at home, as sehri, or pre-dawn meal during Ramzan, is done indoors. They have also been requested not to host or attend iftar parties. While staying at home, they shall observe fasting and refrain from holding ijtemas (gatherings) for Taraweeh and recitation of the Holy Quran,” said Mufti Anwar Ahmed of Jamia Nizamia, Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-hyderabadis-to-miss-haleem-this-ramzan-due-to-ban-on-iftar-parties/story-wiVrr3HWnVdu2FwzAeN0hK.html

18-04-2020||India||NHAI to resume toll collection on national highways from April 20||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will resume toll collection on national highways from April 20, as per a government communication, a move which is being opposed by the transport fraternity. The government had on March 25 announced temporarily suspending toll collection on national highways to ease emergency services in view of the coronavirus outbreak. “In view of the relaxations provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs for the inter state and intra state movement of all trucks and other goods / carrier vehicles ...NHAI should take actions necessary for compliance of the orders of Ministry of Home Affairs ... and tolling operations be resumed w.e.f. 20th of April 2020,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a letter to NHAI. Replying to communication from NHAI, the ministry said the authority in letters dated April 11 and April 14 had highlighted reasons for resuming the collection of user fee on national highways, saying that the Ministry of Home Affairs has allowed a lot of activities with effect from April 20, including commercial and private establishments and construction work. “It has been further highlighted that user fee collection contributes to the government exchequer and also provides financial strength to NHAI in terms of budgetary support,” the letter mentioned. However, transporters’ apex body All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has opposed the move.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “This is appallingly preposterous. On one hand the Government want the continuity of essential supplies and which our fraternity is doing against all odds and at even loss, in service of the nation,” it said.

Its President Kultaran Singh Atwal said: “The entire transport fratenity is financially broke and does not have finance for operations and bringing back drivers either, which is another big challenge. Yet the government instead of extending this sector a helping hand by giving a bare minimum rescue package, submitted by AIMTC, it is burdening it with toll charges that account for 20 per cent of the operating costs.”  Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT) Coordinator SP Singh in the past 21 days the benefit of toll fee not being levied was hardly being passed on in form of any reduction in truck rentals across the country.Click here for Covid-19 updates “In view of COVID-19, it has been ordered to temporarily suspend the collection of toll at all toll plazas across India,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari has announced on March 25. This will not only reduce inconvenience to emergency services but also save critical time, he has said. The minister has said maintenance of roads and availability of emergency resources at toll plazas will continue as usual. Earlier, the road transport and highways ministry had advised the NHAI to follow the home ministry’s guidelines about toll plaza operations following the lockdown. The prevailing condition may be treated as “Force Majeure” of concession or contract agreement in terms of the finance ministry, it had said. The NHAI had rolled out the electronic toll collection programme across India in December on its over 500 toll plazas while doubling toll charges from the vehicles entering FASTag lanes without the tag.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhai-to-resume-toll-collection-on-national-highways-from-april-20/story-Nd6Dq0j4Mx3f7GXXZgOcjL.html

Among those present were Smriti Irani, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Prakash Javadekar, Ram Vilas Paswan, among others. “Interacted with the GoM on the COVID-19 situation. We discussed ways to mitigate the hardships faced by the people and the role ministries can play in providing relief to people,” tweeted the minister. Singh said the guidelines to allow limited activities post April 20 and the measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India on Friday were also appreciated at the meeting.Yesterday, the RBI cut the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points — from 4% to 3.75% — encouraging banks to “deploy surplus funds” and lend more, a move that will in turn result in cash in the hands of the borrower.According to the Union government’s guidelines, starting April 20, key parts of the economy, including agriculture, logistics, infrastructure, e-commerce and factories located outside urban limits, will resume operations in areas with no infections -- what the health ministry calls green zones.Evidence available with scientists suggests there has been no mutation in the three known strains of the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 outbreak in India, government officials said on Friday, even as they claimed that the steps taken by authorities have helped the country slow the doubling rate of the infection to 6.2 days from three days before the announcement of a nationwide lockdown last month.According to the ministry, there have been 13,387 Covid-19 cases in India till April 17 with 1,749 recoveries and 452 fatalities.Separately on Friday, a group of ministers, headed by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, discussed how the implementation of lockdown measures can be improved, especially in areas reporting more Covid-19 cases.

18-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Calcutta HC to monitor Bengal’s steps in tackling Covid-19 outbreak||Calcutta High Court said on Friday it will monitor the West Bengal government’s preparedness in fighting the Covid-19 outbreak on a regular basis and asked the state to submit reports without waiting for its order.The division bench of chief justice TBN Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee, while passing a long order after hearing arguments on a writ petition, asked the government to inform what action was being taken to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.The government, it said, will inform the court how it was determining the cause of deaths, stopping the spreading of the disease and protecting medical staff and doctors following guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organization (WHO).The writ petition was filed by Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Fuad Halim, who is also a practising doctor. Also read: Mamata Banerjee govt plans ramping up Covid-19 testingThe bench dismissed advocate general Kishore Dutta’s argument that the petition could not be treated as public interest litigation (PIL) since Halim is a politician.“We are of the view that this is not an occasion or time for us to consider the maintainability of this writ petition and this is not a matter which should be thrown out at the threshold, since the question raised and which may arise on the basis of the material on record prompts our conscience to have a deeper look into the materials that are being produced on behalf of the State Government in form of affidavits..., the bench said in its order.“…We proceed keeping open all issues for consideration as and when it becomes relevant to be dealt with in the form of adjudication,” the judges added.Halim’s lawyer and former Kolkata mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya argued that the government is not following the guidelines of WHO and ICMR. He also criticised the manner of certification and auditing of the reason for death before issuing death certificates.Also read: ‘Community transmission threat looms, no crowding in markets’, says Bengal CM“We would not venture to say anything on that aspect now. We are aware of various possibilities relatable to the cause of death and the necessity to identify the reason behind a particular death. However, we expect the government to place their response in this regard with the views of the health personnel concerned,” the order said.The advocate general placed before the court some reports filed by state health secretary Dr Soumitra Mohan.“Further reports and materials as may be necessary and relevant shall be placed on record by the state by way of an affidavit from time to time without awaiting further orders of this Court,” the bench said in its order. In its report, the government said, “The state government has issued an advisory on April 13, 2020, in which testing of samples, as per the ICMR’s latest testing protocol, has been advised to the health authorities. In the said advisory, all symptomatic contacts, whether primary or secondary and all asymptomatic primary contacts of COVID-19 positive patient, have been advised to be tested.”Bhattacharya told the court that there was lack of adequate quarantine facility for doctors, nurses, para-medical staff and other people coming in contact with patients and suspected patients and there was a deficit in their protection and safety norms.“This is a concern which obviously has to be addressed by the concerned authorities. We expect the state government to place a report in this regard as well,” the bench said. “We are of the view that WHO and ICMR being expert authorities in the field, their guidelines and advisories are required to be followed by all stakeholders, including the state administration, and we are sure the same shall be done,” said the order.Also read: On April 20, about 45% of economy will resume operations“A further direction on the respondent authorities is sought for taking an immediate step to convert Calcutta Medical College for use only to house Covid-19 patients and also for improving health infrastructure by arranging sufficient test kit and/or protection measures for doctors to make it compatible to combat the present pandemic situation,” it said.The hearing was held through video conferencing in keeping with safety norms during the lockdown. The Bharatiya Janata Party’s state secretary Ritesh Tiwari and a lawyer who wrote separate letters to the chief justice, demanding the court’s intervention and seeking the same data, were also made parties in the hearing.“In my petition, I raised several issues, including the unclear status of Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata which the state government earlier said would be turned into the country’s biggest hospital for Covid-19 cases with more than 3000 beds,” Halim said while speaking to HT.The Bengal government has come under criticism in recent weeks as, unlike other states in India, it is against outright linking deaths of people with conditions such as diabetes, heart ailments, kidney disease etc to Covid-19 even if they have the infection. According to experts, such conditions make the disease deadlier. Such deaths are being treated as results of co-morbidity in which a person suffers from one or more conditions in addition to a condition.“We have formed a committee of five doctors who will decide the actual cause of death. They are the experts, I am not. We do not want to create panic among people. Please trust the doctors,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said last week.“We list all deaths and these are sent to the audit committee of doctors. We are not aware how many deaths the audit committee has reviewed so far and how many it has marked as not Covid related,” chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said at a media conference at the state secretariat on Thursday in presence of the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-calcutta-hc-to-monitor-bengal-s-steps-in-tackling-covid-19-outbreak/story-HamnZwMzo2kCfSaptcOZJM.html

I’m happy to return home,” Pal said.Amool Pandey (18), a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) – Advanced aspirant from UP, was also happy to get back home.“Many buses departed for UP on Friday night, and the rest left on Saturday morning,” Gupta said.“The social distancing norms were strictly followed, as each bus ferried up to 30 students even though it has a capacity of 68,” he added.The district authorities had organised triple-layered masks, hand sanitisers, water bottles, and food packets, which were distributed among students, before they boarded the buses. The buses would reach Agra and Jhansi in UP, and from there the students are expected to find a way for their respective destinations.“Each student was screened before he boarded a bus,” the ADM said.However, students from other states are still stranded in Kota. Many states like Bihar have taken exception to the district administration’s bid to ensure outstation students return home after Kota emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot with 97 active cases and two deaths to date.Around 30,000 students are still stuck in Kota, and anther 10,000 aspirants have returned to their respective states, the district authorities said.Naveen Maheshwari, director, Allen Career Institute, said around 6,500 students from Bihar, 4,000 from Madhya Pradesh, 3,000 from Jharkhand, 2,000 each from Haryana and Maharashtra, and 1,000 each from the north-east and West Bengal are still stranded in Kota.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted on Friday, urging other states to take a leaf out of UP’s book and arrange taking back students so that “these young boys and girls do not panic or feel depressed”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-sends-250-buses-to-kota-to-bring-back-students/story-wWf9UX8zXQYtn7uH4v9CYN.html
18-04-2020||India||Mapping Covid-19: Most of India’s economic hotspots under grip of coronavirus||Coronavirus has infected nearly 15,000 people in the country. As per the latest figures updated by the Ministry of Health, 14,378 people have been infected by Covid-19 across the country which includes 11,906 active cases, 1,991 people who have been cured or discharged and 480 fatalities. A look at district-wise analysis of coronavirus infections suggests that urban areas are more affected by the virus. With economically significant regions, such as the financial capital (Mumbai) and the national capital, under lockdown for more than a month due to coronavirus, the country could witness a severe economic impact.HT’s business publication Mint analysed district-wise case data compiled by howindialives.com for 717 coronavirus affected districts in the country. The districts were divided into four zones - red, orange, yellow and green - on the basis of the number of coronavirus cases by mid-April. While districts with more than 100 coronavirus cases were marked in ‘red’, those with no Covid-19 cases were clubbed in the ‘green’ zone. Districts with 20-100 Coid-19 cases were categorised in ‘orange’ zone while those that reported less than 20 Covid-19 cases were put in the ‘yellow’ category. It was found that almost all districts - as many as 20 - in the ‘red’ zone were urbanised, centres of high economic activity. More than 50% of all confirmed coronavirus cases in the country and 67% of deaths came from districts marked in the ‘red’ zone. The data showed that around 87 districts were in the ‘orange’ zone, 292 districts in the ‘yellow’ zone while the remaining 318 were marked in the ‘green’ zone.Those districts marked in the ‘green’ zone were invariably poorer as compared to their counterparts in the ‘red’ zone, the analysis stated.The 20 ‘red’ zone districts included most from Delhi, many state capitals, metropolitans and economic hotspots such as Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune, Jaipur, Bhopal, Indore, Coimbatore among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mapping-covid-19-most-of-india-s-economic-hotspots-under-grip-of-coronavirus/story-aDLlmKA8EYyiIREa3l3xvJ.html

18-04-2020||India||Dollar Industries among several companies eager to start production in Bengal||Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal, several companies in West Bengal are trying to start industrial production in a phased manner from April 21 amid the ongoing lockdown. A small section of migrant labourers works for these organised industries. West Bengal is home to many leading hosiery companies, including Dollar Industries, a leading brand with three units in Tamil Nadu and one in Bengal.Vinod Kumar Gupta, managing director of Kolkata-based Dollar Industries Ltd, said, “As the Prime Minister said, life and livelihood are integrally related to each other. We plan to start production from April 21 with a 25% workforce, following all safety guidelines.”“In Tamil Nadu, we have a spinning mill as well as a stitching unit and a processing unit. All these are located in panchayat areas. We applied for permission to operate these. On Thursday, we received permission to open the spinning mill. We are waiting for the rest of the permissions,” said Gupta.“We have around 1600 people on payroll and approximately 300 of them are in West Bengal where we have a stitching unit at Barasat in North 24 Parganas district. On Thursday, we sent an application to the local authorities. We will arrange for vehicles to ferry workers,” Gupta said.Owner of a small surgical instrument manufacturing unit in the MSME cluster at Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district, Pradosh Roychaudhury said, “I have three permanent workers and three more who work for daily wages. I plan to start production. I have finished products lying in stock but could not deliver these to my clients because of the lockdown.”Achyut Chandra, vice president of Eastern India Corrugated Box Manufacturers Association, said, “The West Bengal government should come up with an easier process for giving permission. We were told that the chief secretary will give clearance to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). How can people travel to the state secretariat to meet the chief secretary in the middle of a lockdown? Moreover, does a busy person like him have the time to go through every application?” said Chandra.“Two of my clients are part of the essential services. One of them supplies surgical masks while the other ships medicines. Both need the boxes that I make at my unit at Tangra in east Kolkata,” said Chandra.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee directed the state administration on Friday to find work for migrant labourers stranded in around 700 camps across Bengal. “We will utilise whatever resources we have. There are also people who returned from other states,” Banerjee said. On Wednesday, Banerjee said all jute industries can start production with 15% workforce and supply bags to states such as Punjab and Telangana where Rabi crop harvesting has started. Brick kilns, she said, can start with 15% workforce. Many jute industry owners are however reluctant to start production. They argue that working with 15% of people will lead to more losses than what they suffer now. They also apprehend unrest among workers who do get jobs as trade unions are very active in the jute sector. Farmers and tea garden workers were earlier permitted to join work as long as they maintain social distancing. Tea gardens and farm landowners hire resident labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dollar-industries-among-several-companies-eager-to-start-production-in-bengal/story-2bYdWzZxlakQubuzyBYBJN.html
18-04-2020||India||India stings Pakistan over its minority record at IMF meet for $1.4 bn aid||At the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting on April 16 that gave a green signal to $1.4 billion aid to Islamabad to enable the country to face the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Indian representative had red-flagged concerns that Pakistan’s Covid-19 spending might discriminate against its minorities and could be diverted to enhanced security spending.Surjit S Bhalla, who is the executive director for India on the board of the IMF, had stressed that Pakistan’s health and social safety net spending should be comprehensive, targeted and non-discriminatory. He also pointed out that budgetary resources should be made available to all regions of Pakistan as the Covid-19 situation was much worse in Balochistan and Sindh province.Bhalla pointed to reports to show that minorities such as the Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Ahmadiyya communities - the most vulnerable in Pakistan’s society - are treated with disadvantage in mitigation response by the federal and provincial government authorities, people familiar with the proceedings of the IMF meeting told Hindustan Times.Also read: Imran Khan hits mute on Saarc Covid-19 pledge, India sends $1.7 mn reliefThe Indian economist also asked Pakistan to carry out effective and targeted disbursement of social sector spending that focuses on the most vulnerable category and not undeserving beneficiaries.The jab at Pakistan for its treatment of its minorities is seen to be linked to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the move to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act was an effort to target Muslims.It is a point that Imran Khan had made in his speech to the 2019 UN General Assembly also, provoking a sharp comeback by a young Indian diplomat who reminded PM Khan that it was his country that had shrunk the size of its minority community from community from 23% in 1947 to 3% today, that had subjected its minorities to “draconian blasphemy laws, systematic persecution, blatant abuse and forced conversions”.Bhalla said the Imran Khan government’s Covid-19 response did not appear to be equitable either and was accused to have held back funds from Balochistan and Sindh provinces though the situation in these areas was severe.Also read| Covid-19 virus accidently leaked by intern at Wuhan lab: ReportThe IMF, which has projected that the Pakistani economy will contract by 1.5 per cent over the next year due to Covid-19, had cleared disbursement of $1.386 billion under the Rapid Financing Instrument at its Thursday meeting.Pakistan is a longtime recipient of help from the IMF and is already under a three-year, $6 billion programme that was approved last year. Indian officials say Pakistan has, since 1958 availed IMF funds and bailouts on 22 occasions and appeared to be facing increasing risks of debt sustainability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-stings-pakistan-over-its-minority-record-at-imf-meet-for-1-5-bn-aid/story-2MyEltUlhtAaCTzSwf2XCL.html

The state had its first case on March 31. Apart from a Guwahati businessman and a person from Nagaland’s Dimapur, who got tested in Assam and is under treatment in Guwahati, all other cases in Assam have links with the Tablighi Jamaat gathering at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi last month.

18-04-2020||India||Air pollution in Maharashtra sees significant drop during Covid-19 lockdown||Latest satellite data on air quality two weeks before and two weeks during coronavirus lockdown show a big improvement in the air quality, mainly for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, in major Maharashtrian cities such as Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune.The fall in NO2 levels is largely due to the sharp drop in fossil fuel combustion in transport, industrial and energy sectors after the lockdown.The details were released on Friday in a study assessing satellite images (TROPOMI/S5P satellite data), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) real-time data, electricity generation and petroleum product consumption across India by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). An overall 18% reduction was recorded in petroleum products use during March 2020 as compared to March 2019.On April 2, HT had reported that an 81% decline in NO2 levels was recorded over six weeks (February 17 to March 29) across 10 real-time stations in Mumbai. The same was also visible through satellite images (also the first study for the Mumbai region using satellite images post-lockdown).The present study compared NO2 concentration between March 11 - 24 (before the lockdown) and March 24-April 7 (during the lockdown) and identified hotspots over major cities in India and industrial zones with high coal combustion. In the latest study, CREA observed a 71% drop in NO2 levels for Mumbai between March 24 to April 7 as compared to the previous two weeks (March 11-24) while Navi Mumbai saw a 62% drop as per the CPCB data. A similar significant reduction was recorded for Nagpur and Pune during this time, the study said.“Drastic reduction in NO2 over these cities post lockdown show that we can achieve breathable air and clear skies with emission reduction, and not necessarily by taking drastic measures such as shutting down all sources,” said Sunil Dahiya, Analyst, CREA, adding, “By adopting emission load reduction or efficient emission control across sources such as vehicles, industries, petrochemical refineries and power plants, we achieve clean breathable air.”Formed from the burning of coal, oil, and emissions from vehicles and diesel generators, toxic gases like NO2 worsen respiratory conditions and have detrimental effects on the central nervous system, especially the brain due to short term impacts, said Dr Arun Kumar Sharma from the University College of Medical Sciences in Delhi.In Mumbai, the Chembur-Trombay area — which has a power plant, several petroleum refineries and a fertiliser factory - is a hotspot for high NO2 levels. In the Mumbai Metropolitan Area (MMR), industries are located across Uran, Panvel, Kalyan and Bhayander covering Mumbai’s peripheral areas.“Even as Mumbai’s air had very little NO2 concentration, emissions across Navi Mumbai and peripheral areas of Raigad district were visible even during the lockdown period in our satellite study analysis,” said Dahiya.Considering that air pollution reduction is temporary (until the lockdown is called off) there are fears of a spike in private transport utilisation leading to higher air pollution. CREA recommended a shift from highly fossil fuel-dependent economy to clean energy-based systems, enhanced public transportation conducive for walking and cycling, and strengthening emission standards with time-bound targets under city or regional clean air action plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-in-maharashtra-sees-significant-drop-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-6Jw2CLVrLJJA7wA8xUiiJO.html

He has also shared with ED sleuths a forensic audit conducted by a Belgium-based independent auditing firm, Van Den Keybus Van Der Jeught, which certifies that all transactions of Firestar Diamond BVBA were authentic, genuine and with legitimate documentary evidence such as invoices and shipping papers. Firestar Diamond has been named by ED as a company used by Nirav to launder money. ED has also said in its charge sheet filed in May 2018 that Neeshal was involved in the appointment of dummy partners and was a signatory or a beneficiary in some Dubai-based dummy companies between 2011 and 2013. He was also the director of Firestar Diamond based in Belgium and that huge sums were transferred into this company from six Hong Kong-based companies.Also read: 40 assets of Nirav Modi auctioned for Rs 51 croreIn his letter, reviewed by HT, Neeshal said: “I am willing to fully cooperate with any investigation that your department is undertaking and help you in accordance with law. I am sincerely hoping that in order to achieve fruitful results in this case, your office will positively respond to my offer of full cooperation with an open mind and meet me in Antwerp so that I can clarify any doubts that you may have about this matter.”Disassociating himself from Nirav, he added: “I have nothing to do with any of the alleged criminal activities of my brother, Nirav Modi. I had no knowledge whatsoever of any dealings that Nirav Modi may have had with any of the bank (s) for his business purposes including transactions in relation to the alleged LOUs (letters of undertaking).”“There is nothing on record to even suggest that I was ever a party or privy to any meeting or transactions of Nirav Modi with the bank (s) or its officer (s). I had never visited any bank (s) nor had I ever met or communicated with any banking officials in relation to the business activities of Nirav Modi or for the issuance of the alleged LOUs or for any of his business activities.”When contacted, Nirav’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal refused to comment on the matter.

18-04-2020||India||PM Modi praises RBI; Oppn says more needed||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday the second round of monetary measures by the RBI will enhance liquidity and improve credit supply. “These steps would help our small businesses, MSMEs, farmers and the poor. It will also help all states by increasing WMA limits,” he tweeted.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the RBI took a host of steps to maintain adequate liquidity in the system, incentivise bank credit flows, ease financial stress and enable normal functioning of markets.Experts said the move will infuse more liquidity in the banking system and bring relief to borrowers, but the central bank’s ability to shield the economy from the adverse impact of covid-19 is limited and the government needs to come up with a major stimulus package.“He is doing a tightrope walk by keeping the customers alive and banks not slipping into the red. Despite limitations, RBI governor has done what was within his capacity, but the government has not yet really stepped in with policy and fiscal measures required in this unprecedented situation,” economist Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India, said.  A Nomura Global Market Research said the RBI governor had outlined measures to divert liquidity to the “have-nots” in the financial system by disincentivising banks from parking excess liquidity with the RBI and through regulatory easing measures for banks and shadow banks. “Monetary policy will be in sync with fiscal policy, where we expect a second round of fiscal stimulus to be announced shortly following the first tranche of ~0.8% of GDP [gross domestic product],” the report said. Industry, which has been concerned about an acute liquidity crunch and slump in demand even as business activities resume partially next week, is expecting a booster dose of up to ₹16 lakh crore from the government. At least three government officials said requesting anonymity that the finance ministry is in discussion with the Prime Minister’s Office to finalise a comprehensive stimulus package soon.According to DK Srivastava, economist and chief policy advisor at EY India, the reverse repo rate cut and increase in the WMA limits would “facilitate increase in economic activities as the lockdown is progressively eased.” The ways and means advance (WMA) is an instrument the RBI uses to provide enhanced temporary loan facilities to cash-strapped states. As per Assocham, companies want government to clear the ₹2.20 lakh crore owed to them by government departments and agencies.Opposition parties urged the government to take more steps to mitigate the problems of the poor. Congress leader Anand Sharma also said the measures were “far too little” to meet the needs of industry”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-praises-rbi-oppn-says-more-needed/story-jCvNj55rtcm9Hz7BFIB9dM.html
18-04-2020||India||Four terrorists killed in Kashmir gunfights||Security forces on Friday eliminated four terrorists in two separate incidents in J&K. Two of them, belonging to Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, were responsible for killing a special police officer (SPO) and injuring another in Kishtwar district on April 13.The other two terrorists were killed in south Kashmir’s Dairoo village after an encounter. A senior police officer said, “With the killing of two terrorists in Kishtwar and as many in Shopian in South Kashmir, the ongoing operations concluded today and a total of four terrorists have been eliminated. Weapons have also been recovered.” Speaking about the Kishtwar encounter, inspector general of police, Jammu zone, Mukesh Singh said, “After meticulous search and painstaking efforts for three days, security forces zeroed in on a spot behind village Saunder...Terrorists, who were in hiding, fired at the search party and were killed in retaliatory action. An AK- 74 Rifle and an INSAS rifle were recovered.”One of them, Ashiq Hussain, was a rape accused released 20 days ago in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Both Hussain and his associate Basharat Hussain were residents of Tander village in Dachhan and were reportedly responsible for hacking to death SPO Basit Iqbal and injuring SPO Vishal Singh.Meanwhile, late on Thursday evening, in a joint operation by the army, police and the CRPF in Dairoo village in Shopian, two terrorists, believed to be locals, were killed. This was the fifth encounter in Kashmir since the 21-day lockdown was clamped across the country to break the chain of Covid-19 infections. Twelve militants and five security personnel have been killed in encounters in different parts of the region in the past few weeks. Earlier this week, two people in the security establishment had told HT that the Army’s artillery assault on terror launch pads at Dudhnial facing the Keran sector across the Line of Control (LoC) on April 10 had killed eight terrorists and 15 Pakistan Army soldiers.It was from this mountain town that the five terrorists neutralised by the Army special forces in the Keran sector on April 5 had been launched.Three of them belonged to the Union Territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-terrorists-killed-in-kashmir-gunfights/story-PKKiP4hkOZZbykWSn9q3BM.html

The move comes 25 days after he was sworn in as CM and five days after he said the cabinet wasn’t being formed because senior leaders were busy dealing with Covid-19. Chouhan has come under fire from the opposition and also social media users for Madhya Pradesh’s handling of the pandemic.On April 10, Congress leader and former leader of Opposition Ajay Singh said, “To become a one-man army, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan put in peril lives of 7.50 crore people of Madhya Pradesh. He is busy in his branding and publicity instead of protecting people of the state from Corona. In Madhya Pradesh, situation is going from bad to worse.”Since Chouhan took oath as the chief minister for the fourth time on March 23, half of the 52 districts in the state have been affected, it has 1,164 cases and 55 people have died. What has hit the government the hardest is 94 people of health department testing positive for Covid-19, including four IAS officials, compelling the government to institute a probe. On Thursday, senior lawyer of Supreme Court and Congress’ Rajya Sabha member, Vivek Tankha, tweeted: “Congratulations Shivraj ji. Amidst so much gloom in MP u managed an Indian record-as the longest serving CM without a council of minister. Previous best record of 24 days of was of Mr Yediyurappa CM Karnataka - both became CMs 4th term & formed Govts with the aid of defection.”State Congress chief Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “The chief minister didn’t form his cabinet as he wanted to present his larger than life image as a hero while thinking that he would be able to control coronavirus single-handedly. But the fact remains that CM failed again miserably....”BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “Formation of a cabinet is a CM’s prerogative. It is wrong to say he is alone in his fight. The entire government machinery is fighting the disease under him.The Congress’ failure to make preparations when it was in power aggravated the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-bjp-leadership-discuss-mp-cabinet-formation/story-5ru1Z80sumWe1gWaoktF3N.html
18-04-2020||India||‘Pak terror continues in pandemic’: Army chief gen MM Naravane||On the second day of his trip to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) to review the security situation in the newly created Union Territory, army chief General MM Naravane on Friday accused Pakistan of backing terrorism in the region at a time when the world has united to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, and said India would not let its guard down.Naravane’s remarks came days after a ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC) in J&K , the death of five Indian para-commandos and five militants in a hand-to-hand battle and the killing of three civilians.“While the whole world is focused towards fighting Covid-19, Pakistan-instigated terrorists have been targeting innocent civilians in the hinterland; just three days back they targeted a retired Kashmiri soldier. Therefore, we cannot let our guard down,” Naravane said. Before ending his trip on Friday, the army chief visited forward posts in north Kashmir’s Kupwara sector and interacted with soldiers guarding the LoC. Naravane, in an interview with a news agency, said the five terrorists killed in the battle with para-commandos had attempted infiltration taking advantage of bad weather in Keran. Infiltration attempts in areas where the snow levels are high indicate the Pakistan Army’s complicity, he said. Naravane said in the hinterland, Pakistan-backed terrorists were targeting civilians with the aim of coercing them to follow their Azadi narrative.He said India will respond proportionately to ceasefire violations. “Unless Pakistan gives up its policy of state sponsored terrorism, we will continue to respond with ...precision,’’ he said.Pakistan on Friday rejected what it called the “irresponsible, spurious and totally false allegations” against Pakistan by the Indian army chief.It also charged India with ceasefire violations. “This year alone, Indian forces...have committed over 765 ceasefire violations, resulting in shahadat of 3 civilians and serious injuries to 54,” its foreign office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-terror-continues-in-pandemic-army-chief-gen-mm-naravane/story-fYhOAQF9Q9WO1xNUFQopJM.html
18-04-2020||India||Terrorist caught in Afghanistan earlier this month was IS recruiter in Jammu and Kashmir||Aijaz Ahmad Ahangar from downtown Srinagar’s Nawa Kadal had been a wanted man in Jammu and Kashmir for more than two decades. He was arrested once for terror links and released. This was sometime in the mid-1990s.Nearly 25 years later, he was arrested early this month by Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS) in Kandahar. No one really paid much attention. The NDS had been far too focussed on its prize catch, Aslam Farooqui, the chief of the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) who had claimed responsibility for the 25 March Kabul Gurdwara attack that killed 27 worshippers.In the early rounds of his questioning, Aijaz Ahangar identified himself as Ali Mohammed from Islamabad. The sequence of events that blew away his carefully crafted cover is still not clear. Counterterror operatives in Delhi and Kabul told HT that it was much later they discovered that the April 4 raid had also netted Aijaz Ahangar, the 55-year-old chief recruiter of the Islamic State Jammu & Kashmir. “It was a surprise,” said an Afghan watcher.Aijaz Ahangar, born in Bugam on the outskirts of Srinagar, wasn’t the only one in his extended family to pick up the gun. According to security agencies, his father-in-law Abdullah Ghazali aka Abdul Ghani Dar was a Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and had played a role in the formation in 1990 of the Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen. Aijaz Ahangar married Ghazali’s daughter Rukshsana much later.After a brief association with the al Qaeda, Aijaz Ahangar joined ISIS. Later, he joined the Islamic State Khorasan Province.His son Abdullah Umais joined the fighting in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and got killed. His son-in-law, Huzafa-al-Bakistani, a top online recruiter of ISKP, was killed in a US drone attack in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorist-caught-in-afghanistan-earlier-this-month-was-is-recruiter-in-jammu-and-kashmir/story-hHW79RlVW6x8QXlL6xnf8L.html
18-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In an admission that must have surely prompted millions of I-told-you-so moments across the world, China on Friday, through its state media, raised the death toll in Wuhan, the city where the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 first emerged, by around 50%.It is unlikely that the revision, up by 1,290 to a total of 3,869 deaths in Wuhan, will stop questions about the accuracy of China’s numbers. In fact, it will likely raise even more questions.Another set of China numbers also caused a flutter on Friday. Economic data released showed that China’s economy shrank by 6.8% in the first three months of the year as compared to a year ago, highlighting just how badly the pandemic and the lockdowns declared by countries around the world to contain it — the only option in the absence of a vaccine or a proven cure — hurt economies. This is the first time in decades that the Chinese economy has shrunk.For years, the Chinese economy was the driver of global growth. This year, according to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy will shrink by 3% (IMF has also said the Indian economy will expand by 1.9%). Admitting the death toll in Wuhan was higher than previously reported, and reporting a decline in the economy are both uncharacteristic of the Chinese. Indeed, to find the last time the Chinese admitted their economy shrank, one would have to travel all the way back to the mid-1970s.The 1.9% number came up during Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das’s comments on Friday as he unveiled the second tranche of monetary and credit measures to help businesses cope with the economic impact of Covid-19. The measures involved targeted liquidity at small businesses (and small finance companies), and agriculture, and enough respite for banks from having to declare accounts as non performing assets on the basis of norms that no longer make sense during this time (see pages 1 and 9). While RBI’s actions on the liquidity, credit, and financial stability fronts are welcome, the Indian economy desperately needs the government to announce a broader relief and stimulus package.If the pandemic subsides in the second half of this year, global economic growth next year will be 5.8%, IMF said in its outlook named The Great Lockdown.The chances of that happening seem unlikely. The pandemic could well subside, but in the absence of a vaccine, the world is unlikely to open up. On Friday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that at least some restrictions in his country could continue for a year.He also spoke of a smartphone app similar to India’s Aarogya Setu, which the government will use to detect whether people may have come in contact with an infected person. Aarogya Setu isn’t mandatory, nor is the Australian app, which is expected to be launched in a few weeks, but the success of such apps, defined by their ability to contact-trace, is a direct function of the number of people who download it. Singapore also has a similar app called TraceTogether.Apps such as this could become important as governments seek to find a way for life and work to go on — even as the threat from the virus remains.On Monday, India will begin one such experiment, with a planned opening up of certain parts of the country for some business activities. Some states in the US hope to do this by the first week of May. India’s 40-day lockdown will come to an end on May 3. If the curve of infections has flattened by then, and if the infection rate is down to manageable levels, India can then return to a new normal existence — with social distancing, masks, and an app to keep it safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-rcOhWwX1q9pxbcOfelV9JL.html
18-04-2020||India||IAS officers’ training focuses largely on fight against Covid-19||From watching Virus, a Malayalam film on the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak, to understanding the Epidemic Diseases Act, the next batch of IAS officers graduating from the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration is gearing up to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The 182 officers currently at the academy are expected to join as trainee assistant collectors in districts across the country next month, provided the government lifts the lockdown, said an official at the academy.The Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers will complete their course on May 8. The Centre for Disaster Management recalibrated its course to instruct these officers about ways to tackle the outbreak.“The online course in the academy is focusing on the legal ecosystem around Covid-19, such as extant rules [for] national disasters with a special focus on procedure,” said academy director Sanjeev Chopra. A two-hour introductory session for this was held on the academy’s e-learning platform, GYAAN, on Thursday.“The session was mostly about the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA),” a trainee officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre said. “It was conducted by our faculty members, some of whom have experience on the ground of having handled disasters in Tamil Nadu and other states.”The trainee officer said Covid-19 is a nascent case study, though mitigation of the disease can be similar to other natural disasters. “We are still discovering things about Covid-19 but many steps taken for mitigation of disasters like floods can help here as well,” the trainee officer added. A second trainee officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre said information about laws will help with their work in the districts. “The DM [Disaster Management] Act, for instance, tells us about the exact responsibilities of a district magistrate and sub-divisional magistrate, ” he said. “We learnt we could requisition helicopters for delivering rations and ask private companies to provide equipment and human resources, if needed.”The second trainee officer added that Covid-19 has no precedent and officers will have to “improvise” when they start work. “The provisions apply in general to disasters, we will have to see how to use them to fight Covid-19,” he said.“We learnt how to set up relief camps, ensure sanitation and ensure no discrimination happens. We can extend these to tackle the present migrant worker crisis.” A second academy official said: “There are certain disasters that need an immediate response, such as floods. Others, like the pandemic, require a standardised response. These are the best practices needed to help reduce infections.”As a run-up to Thursday’s introductory session, the batch was asked to watch documentaries and films such as Virus and 93 Days, a Nigerian movie on Ebola. “The idea is to make them familiar with how countries across the world have dealt with epidemics,” the second academy official said. “Sub-divisional magistrates and sub-divisional officers are generally involved in disaster management in normal times as well. The district magistrate is the disaster management authority at the district level.”The batch was provided access to documents and modules on how districts and state governments and the Central government are tackling the pandemic.“Whether it’s understanding the concept of an incident response team or making sure different departments coordinate seamlessly, they will be in a better position to administer [after] this module,” said the second academy official. Inter-departmental coordination is being stressed. “Coronavirus has been declared a disaster by the government, so it automatically falls under the ambit of the course,” the official added. “We are also explaining coordination, such as working with police, the railway department, or others to ensure vulnerable groups and migrants don’t suffer.”A third official said disaster management was always an integral part of the course, but extra attention is being paid to it this year. “We have increased our focus on the National Disaster Management Act, State Disaster Management Act, epidemic Act and State Disaster Response Fund to help prepare the officers for their forthcoming assignment,” a third official said. “We are trying to help them understand and solve supply chain problems and ease the migrant crisis.”This official added that along with three classes a day, the trainees were asked to do book reviews on various subjects to help broaden their horizons. “Those who haven’t studied Hindi as a first language have to review a book in Hindi, others who are literature graduates have to review books on economy. The academy wants to help them expand their oeuvre.”The third official added an online concurrent assessment is being conducted on the material provided on Covid-19.The second trainee officer said while constant online assessment is being conducted, the trainees are also likely be tested on Covid-19 once the module is completed this week||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-officers-training-focuses-largely-on-fight-against-covid-19/story-dDdR0AP2B34BAfYwLKNd8I.html
18-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: 25 Indian Navy personnel test positive for Covid-19||A total of 25 Indian Navy personnel have tested positive for Covid-19, ringing the alarm bells for the military at a time when the US Navy is grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases on some of its frontline warships.The navy men have been admitted in naval hospital INHS Asvini in Mumbai’s Colaba after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, informed two navy officials on the condition of anonymity. Most of these cases are asymptomatic and have been traced to a single sailor who was tested positive on April 7, 2020. They all reside in the same accommodation block at INS Angre. All primary contacts (though asymptomatic) were tested for Covid-19. The entire in-living block was immediately put under quarantine - containment zone - and INS Angre too is under lockdown.All actions as per established Covid-19 protocol are being taken. There are no cases of infection onboard ships and submarines.While this is the first reported case of Covid-19 in the Indian Navy, the Army has so far reported eight positive virus cases. “We have only eight positive cases in the entire Indian Army. Of the eight, two are doctors and one nursing assistant. Four are responding well to the treatment,” Army Chief General M.M Naravane said on Friday.The Army personnel who have not come in contact with any Covid-19 positive person are being moved back to units.“Our personnel who have not come in contact with any infected person are being moved back to units. We have already catered for two special trains -- from Bengaluru to Jammu and the other from Bengaluru to Guwahati,” he added.As the US Navy is struggling with increasing Covid-19 cases, Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh had stressed that it is vital to ensure that operational assets such as warships and submarines remain free of the virus and the navy is combat ready at all times.In a 15-minute-long video message to naval personnel on April 9, the Indian Navy chief had told his men that while they should hope for the best, the navy should plan for the worst.“We need to be ready for the worst-case scenario and to my mind, it will be a long battle,” the navy chief had said. The armed forces have taken a raft of preventive measures to stop the spread of coronavirus within their ranks. These include cancellation of all non-essential training, conferences and travel; a freeze on postings and foreign assignments; avoiding any assembly that involves more than 50 personnel; postponing of all courses for officers; and encouraging personnel to work from home wherever possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-at-least-20-indian-navy-personnel-test-positive-for-coronavirus/story-9zFtU4xynEj3Yf2NqVyCRI.html
18-04-2020||India||Cases dip in Maharashtra and Mumbai; but curve not sliding yet, say experts||Although the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Maharashtra has witnessed a dip in the past few days, medical experts and Maharashtra government officials, whom HT spoke with on Friday, said the downward curve of cases in the state is likely to begin only on April 21 or 22.The state recorded 119 Covid-19 cases on Friday after it had reported 232 and 286 cases on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. There were 352 and 350 cases in the state on Monday and Tuesday.State health department officials said there are 60% chances of the curve of positive Covid-19 cases dipping after the two 14-day incubation cycles, which began from March 22 when international air traffic was stopped, are completed. “The two cycles of incubation period of infection end on April 20… We expect the beginning of the downward trend from that point. But if the curve moves upwards, it could be alarming and difficult to contain,” said Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education & Research, adding that the state has not witnessed the community transmission stage yet. “If the number of cases moves upwards after April 21, then it could be called as the commencement of community transmission.”A health department official, on condition of anonymity, said the trend mostly depends on cases in densely populated areas such as Dharavi, Worli and the slums in Pune. The official said although the containment zones in these areas have been “carefully screened”, certain factors like “the density of population are not in their control”. The official said if the tracing of contacts failed in these areas, it could prove problematic.In Mumbai, too, there has been a massive drop in the number of cases, with the city reporting 12 cases on Friday as against 177, 140, 216 and 242 on the previous four days.Medical experts said the sudden dip could be because of the change in the testing policy of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). As per a new circular issued by BMC, following the instructions of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), only symptomatic patients along with high-risk patients will be tested. For those who were in close contact of asymptomatic patients, testing will be done only after five days of them being in contact with an infected person. Before April 14, the BMC was testing all close contacts of a patient for Covid-19.“Earlier, all the close contacts of a patient were tested, but now, they are being home quarantined. They will be tested between five and 14 days of their quarantine period. So, as the number of tests has decreased, the number of cases will automatically go down,” said Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert. However, the civic body has noticed that due to narrowing down of testing, the cases of false reporting have decreased. “Before implementation of the new rule, around 5% of the total people tested for Covid-19 were found positive. Whereas, now, the positivity rate has gone up by 11%,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC. “In several cases, we have seen that even though a person has tested negative, he/she has turned positive days later. So, we need to give time to the virus to grow.”Health officials said the mortality rate in the state, too, is expected to drop further and the doubling of positive cases is expected to take longer. “The mortality rate has come down to 6.05% on Friday from 6.41% on Thursday and 6.84% on Tuesday. We expect a continuous drop as the response time to the infection has improved owing to aggressive testing. The deaths reported earlier were because of delay in admission and treatment and underlying ailments,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-dip-in-maharashtra-and-mumbai-but-curve-not-sliding-yet-say-experts/story-MBV9yt3cA9aOWNOHdVV1WL.html
18-04-2020||India||Delhi gears up to test 60,000 by month-end||Delhi is getting ready for a rush of testing once it receives the Rapid Testing Kits (RTKs) being distributed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) — as many as 20,000 tests within five days and 60,000 before the end of the month — provided it gets enough kits. The numbers will significantly improve Delhi’s record on testing ; the city-state currently tests 930 per million population compared to a national average of 220. In terms of tests per million, it is ranked at the top in the country, with the only regions doing better are those with roughly a tenth of the capital’s population.The Delhi government has said it will focus its testing efforts on the containment zones, of which there are 68 in the city. Delhi officials said the government is awaiting a response from ICMR on the number of RTKs it will get. “The centre has committed to providing 50,000 RTKs for Delhi,” said an official in the chief minister’s office (CMO), asking not to be named. On Thursday, India received a batch of 550,000 RTKs from China, after two missed deadlines. “We are working on the details pertaining to allotment and logistics. The kits will be sent to our regional depots first and then it will be distributed to states taking into consideration several factors such as the scale of the outbreak, demand for kits stated by the states and current availability of RT-PCR kits in their inventory among others,” a senior ICMR official said on condition of anonymity. RT-PCR is short for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a laboratory testing technique.Even though health ministry experts have reiterated that RTKs are not meant for diagnosis but should ideally be used for surveillance purposes to establish trends, and suggested they be used in areas where there are less or no cases, many states, including Delhi, are looking at using rapid kits for conducting aggressive testing along with RT-PCR around hot spots. “States can take a call on how and where they want to deploy these kits since health is a state subject, as long as the ICMR testing guidelines are followed,” said a senior health ministry official. As of Friday, Delhi accounted for 12% of the 14,350 cases in India. Delhi, meanwhile, has also placed an order for 50,000 more RTKs through ICMR-approved vendors, but those are yet to arrive (they too are being imported from China). Several other state governments have also placed orders with Chinese suppliers even as Beijing has tightened export norms to ensure quality. Unlike the RT-PCR test that detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in throat swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid tests detect antibodies in the blood and indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus. It can show results within 30 minutes, experts said. Experts recommend their use to assess the extent to which a population has been exposed to the virus. According to a senior official in the state health department, on March 28, a five-member committee of doctors formed by the Delhi government conveyed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal the importance of scaling up tests and adopting random testing models in hot spots. Delhi was yet to notify any containment zones at the time. The chief minister asked the committee to come back with numbers, taking into consideration the shortage of kits.“After a few review meetings, the committee suggested that around 60,000 tests should be done by the end of April. It was a flexible estimation based on the projected rate of the outbreak and other inter-related factors. The chief minister agreed,” added the senior official who asked not to be named. “But to scale up the testing drive, the government will need rapid antibody test kits.” As per the plan, 20,000 tests are supposed to be done within five days of receiving the kits, the official said.“Testing will be scaled up and the focus will be on containment areas as per guidelines of the Union health ministry,” Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said.Delhi’s containment zones range from single buildings to entire neighbourhoods. “Once the testing is scaled up, the government can go beyond contacts of Covid-19 patients to cover within the containment areas all individuals with serious acute respiratory illnesses and cold, cough and flu-like symptoms for a proper assessment of the burden of the disease,” said Jugal Kishore, the head of community medicine department in Safdarjung Hospital – one of the medical institutes that has been asked by the Delhi government to lead the testing exercise.Until now, the tests have largely been restricted to healthcare workers exposed to patients and contacts of those infected. The government is yet to take a call on whether it will experiment with random tests, which will also take into account asymptomatic individuals.On Thursday, Kejriwal clarified that all individuals residing inside a containment zone will not be tested. For now, the tests are required only for the contacts of the patients and symptomatic individuals who reside in the containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-gears-up-to-test-60-000-by-month-end/story-YSbBmQxDP6mOymVDQQxu4O.html
18-04-2020||India||Rapid testing begins as kits from China get clearance||Rajasthan began conducting rapid testing for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday with the arrival of 10,000 testing kits from Delhi. All the 52 persons tested at the urban PHC Topkhana Desh on Friday evening tested negative.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said another 50,000 kits are expected to arrive tonight and over next three days, the state will get 2 lakh rapid testing kits to push up testing. “We have received 10,000 kits and have started conducted rapid testing. In addition to rapid testing, PCR based testing will continue,” said Gehlot. Rajasthan plans to use rapid test for community surveillance and scale up testing capacity to 10,000 tests per day over the next ten days.Rapid tests have began India on Friday following 5 lakh rapid-testing imported from China being dispatched from the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) main depot at its National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) on Friday, for six regional depots that will further distribute it to local laboratories doing testing.“The lot testing of the batch was completed today, and all kits were found to be of satisfactory quality. The consignment has been dispatched from NIMR,” said an ICMR official, requesting anonymity.There are six institutes that ICMR has identified across India for storing the kits as it requires to maintain a cold chain conditions. Ten more institutes are being added as the number of kits being ordered is rising.“The rapid testing kits are being dispatched and being distributed among states that have high disease burden. The kits are being directly given to states and will be deployed or used by them as per their requirement, as long as ICMR guidelines for testing are adequately followed,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.The health ministry, however, did not give information on the number of kits being sent to each of their institutes or to which states and how many.The consignment that arrived on Thursday morning has 500,000 antibody testing kits and 100,000 RNA extraction kits. Of the 500,000, 300,000 are from Guangzhou Wondfo and another 200,000 from Zhuhai Livzon.There are 170 hotspot districts and 207 other districts with clusters, according to the health ministry.“The Rapid testing kits, as I have been saying again and again, are not to be used for diagnostic purposes, rather surveillance purposes to know the disease prevalence within the community. That’s how these kits should be used,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology and communicable disease, ICMR.Rapid testing kits are meant for mass testing to detect undiagnosed infection. “Rapid testing works when you have to test a large number of people in a short span of time, as it is quicker and cheaper,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Apart from the central pool, the states have also been given a free hand to procure kits locally as per their needs.Andhra Pradesh received a consignment of one lakh rapid test kits manufactured by SD Biosensors from South Korea, which arrived on chartered flight Air India flight on Friday. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, who was the first to get tested at his camp office in Tadepalli, tested negative.The flight reached New Delhi on Thursday and was brought to Hyderabad in the same evening. “From there, the kits were brought to Vijayawada by road on Friday morning,” the spokesman||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-testing-begins-as-kits-from-china-get-clearance/story-OlfBmTOIqqPu9srMDpZWVL.html
18-04-2020||India||250 buses to bring back UP students from Kota||The Uttar Pradesh government dispatched 250 buses to Kota on Friday to bring back over 7,000 students from the state who are enrolled in the Rajasthan city’s many coaching centres and have been stranded because of the lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).A #sendusbackhome campaign launched on social media by the students, who are preparing for competitive examinations to qualify for admission to engineering and other courses, spurred the decision by the Yogi Adityanath government.“Uttar Pradesh state government has sent around 250 buses from UP which will reach Kota tonight (17 April),” Kota’s divisional Commissioner LN Soni told HT, adding that the buses will depart from Kota for Uttar Pradesh on Saturday morning.He said the students will be screened for Covid-19 before they set off for their home state to prevent the spread of the infection..The students cheered their imminent return. Eighteen-year-old Ritik Babu, who is preparing for the joint entrance examination to qualify for a seat in the Indian Institutes of Technology, said: “Finally now I will be able to meet my family”Suman Sahni, 19, said: “My course got completed a month ago but I decided to stay in Kota for further preparation. Suddenly, the lockdown occurred and I could not return home”.“I was missing my family as I was alone here in Kota so it is a delightful feeling that we are now going back to our homes”, he said.Around 10,000 students have already returned to their states from Kota, which is famous for the coaching centres that prepare students for admission to professional colleges.Other than Uttar Pradesh, no state has made an attempt to bring students stuck in Kota. Naveen Maheshwari, director of the Allen Career Institute, said that apart from the 7,000 students of UP, around 6,500 students from Bihar, 4,000 students from Madhya Pradesh, 3,000 from Jharkhand, 2,000 students each from Haryana and Maharashtra , and 1,000 each from the Northeast and West Bengal were enrolled in Kota coaching centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/250-buses-to-bring-back-up-students-from-kota/story-kqGQ1a4IXdo2vHP9fl2qpI.html
18-04-2020||India||Sense of duty drives AIIMS biomedical waste collector||Three days after Odisha’s second Covid-19 positive patient — a 19-year-old youth studying in the United Kingdom — was admitted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar, Sanjay Dehury got a call from his boss.The 21-year-old used to drive vehicles in marriage processions till he joined a company that outsourced workers for cleaning assignments. In October 2019, he began to work at AIIMS Bhubaneshwar as part of the hospital’s 250-member housekeeping staff. On March 23, shortly after Odisha had gone into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Manoj Sahoo, facility manager of Golden Hospitality Limited — the company hired to clean the hospital — gave him a new task to do. He requested Dehury to collect biomedical waste (blood, cotton swabs, beddings contaminated with blood or body fluid, needles and syringes kept in bags from the wards) and drive it to the disposal centre inside the hospital complex. Sahoo made a similar request to 18 other employees; 10 said yes initially, but in the end, only two agreed to do the work.“The other housekeeping staff got scared and said there was a possibility of getting infected. The first day I reported for duty, I became very nervous as a few friends among the housekeeping staff asked me not to come. I did not report for duty for the next two days. But on the third day I thought if I do not go then someone else would do it. So I joined duty,” said Dehury, who lives with his father and brother in a village on the outskirts of the city.Like other hospital staff, Dehury requires a lockdown pass to travel to AIIMS. Every day he travels by his two-wheeler to AIIMS.In a non-pandemic world, transportation of biomedical waste requires a great deal of care. It must never be transported directly by hand due to risk of accidental injury from incorrectly disposed sharp items, or of transmission of blood-borne diseases. Hospital wards usually possess three colour-coded bins for different categories of waste, lined by corresponding colour-coded bags that are bio-degradable, leak proof and have a monogram of biohazard symbol. In the case of coronavirus-specific waste, the precautions are stricter given what we know about the virus: that it can stay on some surfaces for long, and still remain infectious. Guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board for handling biomedical waste of Covid-19 patients state that two bags are to be used for the collection of waste to ensure adequate strength and no leaks.Each morning, Dehury dons his Personal Protective Equipment comprising a coverall, hat, gloves, goggles, N95 mask, footwears and boot cover, before he goes up to the ward. A dedicated bin, labelled ‘Covid-19’, is kept in the storage room that can only be handled by authorised staff like Dehury. Dehury then enters the highly-infectious isolation ward to pick up the soiled linen.“After loading the colour coded bags onto a battery-operated vehicle, I drive it off to the biomedical waste facility where the vehicle is first washed with sodium hypochlorite solution.” At the site, Dehury also discards his own PPE, but keeps the N-95 mask on. “While the rest of the PPE are disposed of everyday, the mask is reused after disinfection,” he said.Until recently, there were two patients in the Covid ward, including a 72-year-old man who died last week. Another 60-year-old patient from Bhubaneswar who was critical, is now stable and likely to be discharged soon as his test results have now returned negative.Additional medical superintendent of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, Pravas Tripathy said Dehury makes him proud. “Many of the housekeeping staff were scared of catching the infection and we had a hard time in making them understand that there is little risk (if they follow the precautions),” he said.Dehury earns Rs 12,000 a month and while a hospital official said that there were plans to “give a financial incentive to people like Dehury to keep them motivated,” nothing has materialised as yet. The hospital has converted one multi-storied hostel inside the campus to house all staff engaged in the Covid ward where 6-7 staff nurses and other attendants are staying. Dehury was given an offer to stay, but he chose to stay with his family.After returning home at the end of his duty hours, he dips his clothes in dettol liquid and hot water. He then takes bath in soap and warm water. After having his meal, he heads to the verandah. “We have just one room. So if I sleep in the room, my father and brother sleep outside. So at times I sleep in the verandah while they sleep inside to maintain maximum distance,” he said.In the tight quarters of his house in Suanga Nuasahi village, home to at least 300-odd people, it is difficult to maintain social distancing — one of the foremost requirements to prevent the spread of infection. Even the other residents of his village are trying to keep their distance from him and his family.Soon after he began working as a biomedical waste collector, a photo in which he wore the coverall and mask began to circulate on WhatsApp. “After some friends in the village saw the photograph, villagers pressured me to not report for duty. I simply asked them if any of them were infected by Covid-19 virus, who would look after them? The villagers agreed but asked me to not mingle with other youth in the village. My house is at one end of the village and so it does not affect me. Earlier I used to play cricket with my friends. Now I no longer do that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sense-of-duty-drives-aiims-biomedical-waste-collector/story-AGfpxa0lyBxqwBXMQv77dO.html
18-04-2020||India||MHA releases new list of activities exempted from lockdown curbs||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Friday released a new list of activities exempted from the extended national lockdown, including services offered by non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs) and cooperative credit societies with minimum staff and construction in rural areas.Harvesting, processing, packaging, sale and marketing of bamboo, coconut, arecanut, cocoa, spice plantation and collection, harvesting and processing of minor forest produce (MFP) and non-timber forest produce by scheduled tribes and other forest dwellers have also been exempted from the lockdown, extended from April 14 to May 3.Exempted construction activities in rural areas will include water supply and sanitation works, laying of power transmission lines and telecom optical fiber and cables, the MHA said.To help reive the economy, the government had on Wednesday released revised consolidated guidelines, allowing the transport of goods, without any distinction between essential and non-essential goods,farming operations, and marine and inland fisheries. Industries operating in rural areas including food processing, manufacturing and establishment in special economic zones (SEZs), export-oriented units and industrial townships were allowed as were coal, mineral and oil productionA senior government official said that after April 20, when the Centre will take stock of the lockdown , a few more economic activities may be allowed, depending on the ground situation and provided the restrictions that are in place are followed strictly.The states have already been asked to take action against the violators of lockdown measures under the Disaster Management Act.The MHA has stated that it was closely monitoring the lockdown and in touch with state governments on a regular basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-releases-new-list-of-activities-exempted-from-lockdown-curbs/story-G9HM55EuRgTq4mnwrthzrO.html
18-04-2020||India||As cases rise to 430 over three days, Madhya Pradesh’s Indore sees fresh spike||Indore has witnessed a further spike in Covid-19 cases with at least 430 cases reported in the past three days taking the tally in the district to 842 as on Friday evening. With the spike in the number of positive cases in Indore, Madhya Pradesh looks set to overtake Tamil Nadu to No.3 on the list of the worst affected states. The district administration in Indore attributed the spike to two factors-- a delay in getting reports of tests on samples sent in hundreds to a Delhi laboratory and the presence of a number of suspected Covid-19 patients in certain localities in Indore going unnoticed in February and March.District collector Manish Singh said, “A number of people came from outside via flights. I don’t know what was the facility for screening of such people at the airport at that time but there is a possibility of people here contracting virus from those who came from outside. The result was that the disease continued to spread in certain localities in February and March and this was perhaps the reason in spurt in deaths in these localities.”He expects the trend to flatten, though. “The samples which were sent to Delhi for testing were of such people who are already quarantined traced on the basis of contact history of Covid-19 patients already hospitalised. This is why we know the number of Covid-19 positive cases will continue to decrease now in the coming days.”Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has already gone on record saying that nothing was done by the then Kamal Nath government to identify Covid-19 patients. Even as the infection continued to spread in the third week of March, Madhya Pradesh was in the midst of a power shift. Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “Even if the Congress government did nothing, the question is, what has this government done to check the growth of Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-rise-to-430-over-three-days-mp-s-indore-sees-fresh-spike/story-axuRX9AQAcRahsgWVF3VdM.html
18-04-2020||India||PMO holds meeting on easing lockdown after April 20||The Prime Minister’s Office on Friday held a preparatory meeting with officials of seven key ministries to go through the fine details of partially relaxing on Monday, the ongoing sweeping, federal lock-down -- a move aimed at restarting activity in select sectors of the Indian economy. Chaired by PM Narendra Modi’s Principal Secretary P K Mishra, the meeting primarily focused on getting workers to factories and back, and on the systems and processes states need to put in place for effective implementation of the guidelines for a partial exit from the lockdown as laid out in a home ministry order of April 15. That order allowed the restart of industries in rural areas and special economic zones, and also permitted services such as e-commerce -- all outside so-called containment zones declared by the respective state or union territory administrations. The idea behind the relaxation of restrictions is to allow economic activities to restart and also provide employment, especially to daily wage earners. Labour secretary Heera Lal Samariya, MSME secretary Arun Panda, urban development secretary Durga Shanker Mishra, rural development secretary Rajesh Bhushan, shipping secretary Gopal Krishna and mines secretary Sushil Kumar were present in the meeting that was attended by all senior officials of PMO.According to two officials present in the meeting who asked not to be identified, the main concern is to ensure fool proof ways for transportation of the workforce that will return to industries. In the absence of a public transport network, workers will have to be ferried in dedicated vehicles from their residence to the factory.The senior bureaucrats also discussed how construction sites or factories should be monitored, with health workers, Asha workers or volunteers regularly checking on the workers. “The home ministry has issued the revised guidelines and now a lot of ground has to be covered by the states with the help of the Centre. After all, the states have to implement the guidelines and put everything in place,” said one of the two officials. Another issue which came up during discussions was the maintenance of law and order when lockdown norms are relaxed. As law and order is a state subject , the secretaries have been told by the PMO to keep in regular touch with the states, assess the situation, and issue directives whenever needed.Food processing industries, road construction and industrial projects in rural areas will restart from April 20, with the government keen to create opportunities for daily wage earners. The measures are also aimed at boosting the rural economy . The government has allowed work related to MGNREGS, irrigation projects, construction and other industrial projects in rural areas. All farm-related activities will also remain operational as the harvest season has already started in parts of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmo-holds-meeting-on-easing-lockdown-after-april-20/story-utHBjTW7ceID6qk3JodhtL.html
18-04-2020||India||Kerala case raises fears over incubation period||A man who returned from Dubai on March 18 tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, 29 days after what health officials say was his likely exposure to an infection source, raising concerns that the disease could take longer to manifest and quarantine periods as short as 14 days may not be enough.The brother of this person – both are currently in Kozhikode – tested positive on March 28, prompting authorities to put him under special observation. “Chances of him being infected during observation period are nil. Since his brother was positive, he was under special observation. We have noticed a couple of such instances from other districts also. It could be that the onset was delayed because of his immunity. We can’t say virus works in a uniform pattern in all bodies,” said Kozhikode district medical officer Dr V Jayashree.Kerala has a 28-day mandatory isolation period for those with close contact with a confirmed patient or with a history of travel to hot spot countries. This period is double the 14-day isolation that people in other states are mandated to follow.Self-isolation is advised to keep someone who may have been infected from infecting others. This is particularly complicated in the case of Covid-19, which has an average incubation period (the time it takes for the disease to manifest itself) of around 5 days but has been established to last longer (up to 14 days). An incubation period of 29 days, as was in the case of the Kozhikode man, is rare.The virus also spreads when people are asymptomatic, making containment tougher.“True, Kozhikkode man’s case is a peculiar one. We have asked medical experts and scientists to study his case separately. Experts say since it is a new virus its behaviour is unknown and quite erratic,” said state health minister K K Shailaja, adding there was no need to worry. A student in Pathanamthitta, who shared a train compartment with some Tabligi Jamaat members who later were confirmed as patients, tested positive 22 days after her trip. She was asymptomatic throughout but tested positive when her observation period was about to end and remained asymptomatic even after the test result, said district medical officer Dr N Sheeja.A scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said such a behaviour by the disease cannot be ruled out. “It is possible as there are studies to suggest that. We are also conducting studies to check the incubation period,” said a microbiologist at one of the viral research and diagnostic labs of ICMR, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-case-raises-fears-over-incubation-period/story-JlRQ4e9eoZqMnKDAySQBqJ.html
18-04-2020||India||IISc start-up working on faster RT-PCR testing||A start-up from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is in the process of validating a new two-step method for RT-PCR testing that can help India scale up molecular testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The RT-PCR test amplifies the virus’ genetic material (RNA) from throat swabs of the patients, converts it to DNA, amplifies it and checks it for designated markers to see whether it is the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.The method devised by the IISc team uses two machines, which are cheaper and readily available in India, instead of one, to complete the test. A thermal-cycler is used to amplify the genetic material machine, while a fluorescence reader is used to detect the presence of Sars-Cov-2 virus.Currently, India does about 25,000 RT-PCR tests a day. The testing is likely to go up with the much awaited consignment of 5 lakh rapid blood-based antibody tests arriving from China on Thursday. India has also started manufacturing its own antibody kits.“RT-PCR is the gold standard of tests, it can detect the presence of the virus in the body from day one, but there are very few RT-PCR machines across the country. They are also expensive. The method we have developed uses a thermal cycler, which is more readily available in biology labs,” said Arun B, director, Shanmukha Innovations, the IISc start-up.At IISc, there are about 30 RT-PCR machines in comparison to 200 thermal cyclers. There are about 186 government laboratories with the RT-PCR machines that have now been approved for Covid-19 tests.The fluorescence reader – the second machine needed for the testing -- is also available in several academic labs or can be manufactured at a low cost.“The fluorescence readers are used to measure the DNA in samples and is available at several academic laboratories. Otherwise, it can be manufactured at a cost of Rs 1 lakh as opposed to about Rs 15 or 20 lakh that the RT-PCR machine costs. We have been working with this method for other diseases such as malaria and kala azar, now we need to just validate the workflow for Covid-19,” said Arun.Their team has collaborated with the Bangalore Medical College to test round 100 samples using the traditional RT-PCR test and their two-step method to assess whether it is as accurate. The team already has two prototypes.“Once validated, the manufacturing and scaling up can happen as quickly as four to six weeks,” he said.The start-up is also working on a mobile laboratory – with bio-safety level II – requirements that can cut down on the testing time. “We already have a few vans donated to us under CSR and we are working on fitting them with equipment and restructuring them as a BSL II labs. Right now, there is a lag of at least three days between the sample collected and patients receiving the report because all the samples have to go to the designated laboratories. Instead, we can now take the vans to the hotspots and do the test directly there. Around 12 samples can be processed in three hours,” said Arun.Each van is likely to cost around Rs 45 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iisc-start-up-working-on-faster-rt-pcr-testing/story-mPUOVQ847uOudyBXUC6TiN.html
18-04-2020||India||MHA asks states to trace Rohingya Muslims who attended Tablighi Jamaat event||With close to 26,000  members of the Tablighi Jamaat and their contacts already under Covid-19 quarantine, the ministry of home affairs has found that Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar spread across regions of India, too, attended activities of the Islamic group in March and several of them were missing.The ministry has asked all the state governments and police chiefs to trace the Rohingyas and their contacts on a “priority” basis.In a letter sent to all state chief secretaries, directors generals of police and the Delhi police commissioner, a copy which was reviewed by HT, the MHA wrote:“It has been reported that Rohingya Muslis have attended ‘ijtemas’ (largest annual Islamic congregation organized by Tablighi Jamaat – March 13 to 15) and other religious congregations of Tablighi Jamaat and there is a possibility of their contracting Covid-19.”“Rohingyas residing in camps in Hyderabad, Telangana had attended Tablighi Jamaat ijtema at Mewat, Haryana and had visited Nizamuddin Markaz at New Delhi. Similarly, Rohingyas living in Shram Vihar, Shaheen Bagh, Delhi who had gone for TJ activities, have not returned to their camps”.Following the Tablighi Jamaat’s mid-March congregation at its Markaz headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti, the area emerged as the country’s biggest hotspot of the coronavirus disease. The MHA’s letter said the presence of Rohingya Muslims who attended the Tabligh Jamaat events has been reported from Derabassi, Punjab and the Jammu area. “Rohingya Muslims and their contacts need to be screened for Covid-19. Accordingly, necessary measures may be taken in this regard on priority,” the MHA letter said.According to an estimate by the government, there are around 40,000 Rohingyas living in camps across several states in India; 17,500 of them are registered as refugees with the United Nations.A senior official who didn’t wish to be named noted the spurt in Covid-19 cases following the event in the Markaz,, and said: “... if Rohingyas ,who attended it ,living in camps across states ,are also affected, then it will be a bigger problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-states-to-trace-rohingya-muslims-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-event/story-wYGuZEHdCSKewiYtGCTD7I.html
18-04-2020||India||Study links obesity to severity of disease, death in young patients||Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)among people aged below 60 and is likely to lead to more severe forms of the disease and death among the overweight, a new study suggests.Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 34 were twice more likely to be hospitalised and 1.8 times more likely to need critical care and those with a BMI of >35 were 2.2 times more likely to get hospitalised and 3.6 times more likely to need critical care compared to those with a BMI of <30.BMI is a measure of wether a person is overweight or underweight, calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in metres.The findings on the impact of obesity on people identified as Coiv-d19-positive were based on a study 3,615 patients who visited a large hospital in New York. Of them, 21% had a BMI of 30 to 34 (obese) and 16% had BMI of >35 (bordering extreme obesity). Of the total, 37% had to be hospitalised and 12% needed critical care. The study has been accepted for publication in the Oxford journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases on April 9.“Though patients under 60 years are generally considered a lower risk group for Covid 19 disease severity, based on data from our institution, obesity appears to be a previously unrecognised risk factor for hospital admission and critical care,” the study said.The study also briefly refers to the fact that obesity could be an important factor explaining high mortality in the US compared to, for instance, China and South Korea.South Korea, China, US and Italy have a fatality rate of 2.2%, China 4%, US 4.9% and Italy 13.1% presently as per Johns Hopkins University data analysis. New York is presently the epicentre of the pandemic, with over 10,913 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Another study by NYU Langone Health, an academic hospital ,published in Medrxiv, a website for pre-print studies on April 11, found that among 4,103 Covid-19 patients studied, the most at risk were those older than 75 years and those with a BMI over 40 (severe obesity). People with a heart condition and those with oxygen saturation of less than 88%, and high markers of inflammation, were others at high risk.Around 28.1% hospitalised patients, according to the NYU Langone study, needed invasive ventilation and 18.5% died, compared to 2.3% patients needing invasive ventilation and 1.4% dying in the largest study of 1,099 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in China.“It is notable that the chronic condition with the strongest association with critical illness was obesity, with a substantially higher odds ratio than any cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. Obesity is well-recognized to be a pro-inflammatory condition,” the study said.Obesity was high among patients admitted in intensive care units and the disease’s severity increased with BMI, found a tudy by researchers at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille in France of 124 Covid-19 patients .“Obesity is linked to pre-diabetes, diabetes, hypertension, low immunity, sleep apnoea, heart disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome which all increase susceptibility and adverse outcomes in diseases like Covid-19,” said G C Khilnani, chairman of the PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care in New Delhi, and former head of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)Obesity predisposes people to many diseases and infections, . said Dr Romel Tickoo, consultant of internal medicine at Max Hospital.“If obese persons are on ventilator support, its difficult to wean them off because they have some sort of obstructive sleep apnoea. They tend to retain carbon dioxide. They also have pre-diabetes or diabetes and hypertension,” he said, adding that inflammatory markers predisposes them to morbidity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-links-obesity-to-severity-of-disease-death-in-young-patients/story-yfrjhl7bdzJcb8Qyu7WxOJ.html
18-04-2020||India||BIS retracts new guidelines for coveralls in PPE kits||The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) on Friday withdrew the specifications for coveralls – one of the components of the personal protective equipment (PPE) – just three days after they were released because they were found to be too stringent. The new specifications said that in addition to being fluid-resistant, the coveralls or body suits also had to be viral resistant. They were part of a set of specifications put together by the national standards body for PPE including gloves, masks, and eye protectors to be used by health care workers while treating Covid-19 patients. The specifications were first put up on the BIS website three days ago and were removed on Thursday. On Friday, the organisation tweeted: “As per some media reports, confusion has arisen about standards of coveralls in the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). As of now standards specified by the ministry of health and family (welfare) are applicable. It is clarified that BIS has not notified any standard for coveralls.”A senior official from BIS said on condition of anonymity hat while the specifications were released, “there were administrative and inter-ministerial issues. For the time being, manufacturers have to keep following the specifications as released by the health ministry.”The reason for the withdrawal is that none of the manufacturers in India are currently geared up to make coveralls as per these specifications, not even the ones that have been approved by the textile ministry, according to an industry expert who asked not to be named. The industry expert, who was part of the discussions regarding the specifications, said, “The specifications must have been withdrawn after requests from the textile ministry. Although companies are working towards developing breathable viral-barrier materials and technology that can be used for sealing the seams, it is not available for now. The textile ministry knows this and they cannot afford to stop the production of the much-needed PPEs.”Indian manufacturers could not meet the new standards that required the coverall be made from viral-barrier materials that are not available in India, which is also short on machines needed for sealing the seams to prevent leakage.While the specifications have been withdrawn, most manufacturers agree that some standard ones are necessary. “What the ministry of health had released were buyer specifications, but not national standards that were to be followed by all manufacturers. These BIS standards are a very important first step towards creating uniformity in products that are being manufactured across the country. So far, the procurer for central government, HLL, institutes such as AIIMS, and different state governments all have different specifications for procurement,” said Rajiv Nath, founder and forum coordinator of the Association of Indian Medical Devices Industry (AiMeD).BIS organised a meeting on April 3 with manufacturers and industry bodies to seek feedback on the draft of the specifications that were uploaded to its website earlier this week after the organisation decided to fast-track the adoption of the specifications.“The committee decided that due to novel coronavirus pandemic and for uniform product requirements and test methods to be followed by stakeholders, the wide circulation of the draft standard be waived off and draft standard be held to have been finalised for publication,” read the minutes of the meeting, a copy of which has been seen by HT. “We were initially about to start our production with fluid-resistant material, but we stopped even before we began because there were talks of viral-barrier suits. Now the challenge is availability of the raw material and the taping machines. These are dampeners when it comes to scaling up production in the country. Now, we have finally managed to source some material for the viral-barrier suits, but our product is yet to be certified. . Our PPE kits should reach the market next week,” said Dr GSK Velu, Chairman and Managing Director, Trivitron Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bis-retracts-new-guidelines-for-coveralls-in-ppe-kits/story-Qm71T603HSmVYHk6r637FN.html
18-04-2020||India||No mutation found in three virus strains in India: ICMR||Evidence available with scientists suggests there has been no mutation in the three known strains of the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 outbreak in India, government officials said on Friday, even as they claimed that the steps taken by authorities have helped the country slow the doubling rate of the infection to 6.2 days from three days before the announcement of a nationwide lockdown last month.Genome sequencing of the Sars-CoV-2 virus in Indian laboratories, including in Pune’s premier National Institute of Virology, has so far found three strains of the pathogen, Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of the epidemiology and communicable disease division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said.Also read: PMO holds meeting on easing lockdown after April 20“The initial samples had a virus sequence similar to what was found in Wuhan, China (where the outbreak began in December); the second sequence was what was circulating in Iran and has similarities to the Wuhan virus; and the third strain is what has been found in people infected in the United States or the United Kingdom,” he said at a press conference.“...this virus does not mutate fast. Now the question is which of the strains is going to be the dominant quasispecies (dominant strain) in India...it is a bit difficult to predict at this time,” he added.Scientists isolate strains of viruses from patients to check for variations or possible mutations in a geographic area. The isolation of virus strains is the first step towards creating drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in a country.Several research projects are underway in India in the field of drugs and vaccine development. ICMR will soon start studying the effect of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine in Indian population. BCG, which scientists believe could boost immunity, is a tuberculosis vaccine that has shown promise against Covid-19, according to US researchers.Also read: Coronavirus cases in India rise to 14,378, death toll at 480At the same event, a top official of the Union health ministry said the sweeping restrictions announced to contain the infectious disease seemed to be working in India, stressing that it took it took 6.2 days for Covid-19 cases to double in the past week as against three days before the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25.“There are 19 states where the doubling rate is less than the national average, which means it is taking more than 6.2 days for the cases to double. It is a product of our efforts...,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said.These 19 states and Union Territories are Kerala, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Puducherry, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, Telangana, Karnataka and Tripura.On April 5, at the regular afternoon briefing to the press, Agarwal mentioned that the number of infections was doubling in India every 4.1 days.The doubling rate in the UK (104,145 cases and 13,759 deaths) stands at about 10 days at present. The corresponding number for the US (667,801 cases and 32,916 deaths) is about 11 days. To be sure, these two countries have managed to slow the doubling rate. When there were around 14,000 positive cases in these countries, the number of infections was doubling in the UK (around March 27) in about three days and in the US (around March 19) in about two days.According to the ministry, there have been 13,387 Covid-19 cases in India till April 17 with 1,749 recoveries and 452 fatalities.“As of today, 170,000 dedicated Covid-19 beds and 21,800 ICU beds are operational in 1,919 hospitals across the country. All these efforts are being made to ensure country is well equipped to deal with any eventuality,” Agarwal said.Separately on Friday, a group of ministers, headed by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, discussed how the implementation of lockdown measures can be improved, especially in areas reporting more Covid-19 cases. The group also discussed how areas such as diagnostics, vaccine development, drugs and hospital facilities can be strengthened for Covid-19 prevention and management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-mutation-found-in-three-virus-strains-in-india-icmr/story-wSzC7YUgFwMytqKTMhnHDN.html
18-04-2020||India||MCI seeks registered doctors’ list from states||The Medical Council of India, country’s apex medical education regulator, has written to its state councils asking them to prepare a list of all doctors registered with them -- part of an exercise aimed at taking stock of the number of doctors that be mustered to treat Covid-19 patients should the number of infections increase sharply.In a latter sent out last week, the board of governors of Medical Council of India (BoG-MCI) asked for an updated list of registered medical practitioners and their contact details.“The Medical Council of India has been entrusted for ensuring availability of registered medical practitioners (registered under the Indian Medical Council Act 1956/State Medical Council Acts) for tackling Covid-19 pandemic. It is requested to share the updated list of registered medical practitioners available in your medical council…” said the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.Apart from the names and registration numbers, the information asked for also requires mobile number, email, and contact address.“This information should be sent to the MCI as early as possible, in view of the prevalent situation. This information will be further shared with the government authorities for their use, when required,” the letter added.State councils have already started work on compiling the data.“We are working on compiling the list. Once a medical practitioner registers (with us) the name stays at least for years years in the state register ; some of them are also PG students coming from other states who return to their respective state after their education is over. We need to weed out those names from the list, and with skeletal staff at our disposal right now it might take a little longer,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, member, Delhi Medical Council.India has 1.1 million registered allopathic doctors as of December 2019. “Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 9.26 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service,” said minister of state for health Ashwini Kumar Choubey in the Lok Sabha last year. For a population of 1.36 billion, this makes the doctor-population ratio 1:1,457, which is lower than the WHO recommended norm of 1:1,000.For people living in rural areas that are completely dependent on government hospitals and clinics, the ratio is actually far worse, 1:10,926, according to the National Health Profile 2019 data.Similar plans are afoot in parts of the government. The health ministry sent out a directive to the chief secretaries of states last week, on the utilization of the services of the ear nose throat (ENT) specialists or post-graduate trainees for collection of Covid-19 samples for testing.“You are aware that the country is in the midst of an unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19. One of the key components of our strategy to combat this outbreak is contact tracing and collection of nose and throat swab samples of potentially infected persons. There is an urgent need of trained and qualified personnel to collect these samples and the number of such persons needs to be augmented significantly,” said that directive, a copy of which has been seen by HT.“All States/UTs are, therefore, requested to organize collection of Covid-19 case samples by using the services of ENT specialists and residents. The services of these professionals working in all government and private medical colleges of the states may be drafted for this purpose,” the directive added.A health ministry official said on condition of anonymity: “While the labs were enough, there was felt a shortage of trained people to collect samples. The experts discussed the matter and thought of making use of ENT specialists for the purpose as they already are trained in handling diseases of nose and throat. The states have passed on the instructions to all medical institutions in this regard, and the process of involving specialists has begun.”“It is definitely a good idea as ENTs will definitely more skilled to do the job. The problem is bigger in remote areas where involving them should surely help,” said Dr NN Mathur, ENT professor and former principal, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (Safdarjung Hospital).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mci-seeks-registered-doctors-list-from-states/story-ypKCu7PDrgObUgX0UdOiEM.html
18-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Woes mount, migrants stare at long road to normalcy||After the government announced an extension of the national lockdown till May 3, distress among stranded workers and the unemployed is rising. State governments have been asked to provide relief to stranded workers but not allow them to move back across state borders to their villages.Here are some snapshots from the marginsYearning for home“My wife suddenly gets up from sleep around midnight and starts crying. She is missing our daughter and two sons who are with my parents in my village,” said Vishal Misare, 28, a migrant worker from Balaghat town in Madhya Pradesh.Misare is one of 48 construction workers from Madhya Pradesh now living at a wedding venue at Miyapur Cross Roads on the outskirts of Hyderabad. They tried to leave the camp on Monday night but were brought back by the police.Misare has exhausted the money he had earned from February through the middle of March. “I am penniless,” he said, claiming that the Rs 500 promised by authorities (Central government) has not been given. “We were given 5 kg of rice and a kg of dal last month.” Ludhiana district officials said they were providing best possible facilities in these “tough” conditions.Like Misare, a landless labourer, there are hundreds in labour camps across India, who are yearning to go back to their villages, as they can get work in agriculture fields or under the MGNREGA, both allowed from April 15.Sunil Kumar, 24, from Patna, wants to leave the camp at Jeedimetla in Hyderabad. “I will get married on May 20. I want to go back, but I am not being allowed to step out,” said Kumar, who worked in a gas welding unit in Jeedimetla industrial estate, which is shut due to lockdown.Last week, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao asked migrant workers to not worry as the state government would not allow anybody to suffer from hunger. “It is for their benefit that we are asking them to stay back wherever they are. If they have any issues, they can bring it to the notice of the authorities and they will solve them,” he said.Pending wagesFor one week, Rajkumar, 28, a steel factory worker in Punjab’s Ludhiana has been entreating his employer to pay his wages. His brother is suffering from tuberculosis and he needs money to support his family.“After a week of struggle, harassment and making repeated rounds, my employer paid me one month’s wages while two month’s pay was pending. He did not even pay me for overtime,” he said.Possible to ask employer?For the past three days, labourers in Sahnewal, Machhiwara and Sherpur Kalan in Ludhiana have hit the streets, demanding to go back to their villages, and protesting against the administration.Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said thousands of ration kits were distributed and meetings held with factory owners to push them to not slash wages. “The helpline numbers are ringing 24 hours, food and ration are being provided to the needy and all efforts are being made to see the migrants do not suffer,” he said.Rental DemandGhaneswar Behera, 29, an assembly line operator working with a Gurugram auto major, paid whatever money he had as pending rent for single room in the national capital region on Friday and is now wondering how he will feed his family if the auto company does not start operations from April 20.Behera left his home in Amartya in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district with his wife and 20-month-old son about six months ago. A village acquaintance helped him to get a job with an auto company in Gurugram. Having no work for 21 days, he, with four other families, booked railway tickets to return to Odisha, thinking that the lockdown will be lifted on April 15.As the lockdown was extended, the landlord came knocking.“The house-owner asked me to pay or leave,” said Behera, leaving with no option but to give Rs 5,000 of the Rs 7,000 he had to the landlord. When Behera told his landlord about the government moratorium on such payments, he did not listen. Behera paid up.Behera is left with just Rs 2,000 to run his household of five people, and little certainty of employment. The employers have asked workers to submit their body temperatures daily to the contractor. “We don’t have enough money to buy vegetables, how will we buy a thermometer?” Behera asked.Walking Back“We walked for over 12 hours before we got a lift from a truck driver who dropped us here. I hope for another lift, otherwise we will cover the journey on foot,” said Naushad Sheikh, a daily wage worker in Ghaziabad, who has walked from Delhi to Lucknow. His destination is Bhadohi in eastern Uttar Pradesh, still 280km away.The 19 year old, having just Rs 1,500 with him, had decided to stay put in Ghaziabad but changed his mind when the lockdown was extended.On April 14, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the lockdown till May 3, Sheikh packed his belongings -- three pairs of trousers, two shirts, some toiletries, a shoe, a sandal, a speaker and documents -- in a backpack, covered his face with a handkerchief and left Ghaziabad.The decision to extend the lockdown has led to another exodus of migrant workers, though fewer than in the first wave some weeks ago. At least three groups were stopped in Hyderabad, one in Tamil Nadu, two in Kerala and several others in the Hindi heartland by police since April 15.On his way, Sheikh met seven other daily wagers and the group reached Lucknow together after 24 hours on foot on Wednesday evening. Tired and without a proper meal, the group stretched themselves out on the grass alongside the state highway leading to Varanasi, before starting to walk again.“We saw many labourers returning home,” said Shyam Gautam, 24, a mason, returning to Sultanpur with Sheikh. “Around 50 labourers, who lived in my locality, also left on April 15. Many more will do the same. We can’t survive in cities anymore.”Finally Home“Walking 250 km on an empty stomach was arduous,” said Ram Achal, 25, sitting outside his home in his village in Bahraich district, recalling his travel from a construction site in Kanpur soon after the lockdown was announced.He completed the 14 day quarantine period before he was allowed to enter the village, a protocol implemented by states to isolate migrant labourers. Thousands of others were quarantined at government run institutions, including schools. Despite the trauma and pain, Achal, a landless labourer, said the village was like “heaven” as he can play with his children and mingle with other people in the village.Manna Lal, 48, who had led them on the walk, was not nearby. “He is now obsessed with swimming in the river. He eats, swims, stays home and does nothing. All of us are just idling around.“We became migrant labours because we get Rs 450 per day against Rs 250 per day as farm labours,” he said. But, if the fear of Covid-19 continues, he and other villagers will have to take up farm work. “Surviving here is also not easy.”(With inputs from Srinivasa Rao Apparasu, Aneesha Sareen Kumar, Debabrata Mohanty, Pankaj Jaiswal, Chandan Kumar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woes-mount-migrants-stare-at-long-road-to-normalcy/story-ydYufzx4j0a8Y3qYcAqyrN.html
18-04-2020||India||Mamata Banerjee govt plans ramping up Covid-19 testing||Amid allegations that not enough tests are being conducted to detect Covid-19 patients in West Bengal and the number of infections increasing steadily everyday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s government has finally decided to expand testing to include even asymptomatic people, or those showing no symptoms of the virus“Swab samples {to} be taken for all symptomatic contacts, and all asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case as per Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines and in clusters and quarantine centres, as deemed fit by the local administration,” said a directive issued by the state government.The step is a part of the state government’s 11-point containment and treatment strategy for high-risk spots announced on Monday. Only symptomatic patients were to be tested under the strategy, which was amended on Thursday to include even asymptomatic people who may be carrying the virus.“This is a huge step taken by the state government. We doctors have been banging our head against the wall for this for the last 10 days. It is because a lockdown and policing alone cannot bring desired results. We need to ramp up our tests. We need to go for random sampling. Tests, tests and more tests ae the need of the hour because we need to identify asymptomatic carriers and confine them,” said Kunal Sarkar, a cardiologist. Around 12,200 people are now under observation in 582 institutional quarantine centres run by the state. They are likely to be tested, said a top official at the state health department.“Earlier the ICMR had suggested that only symptomatic patients need to be tested. Now with ICMR coming up with new guidelines, we have also issued fresh guidelines. The state has also placed requisition for 50,000 rapid antibody testing kits. We will start the rapid test as soon as the kits arrive,” the official added.West Bengal’s Trinamool Congress government has been drawing flak for allegedly not conducting enough tests.Only 3,811 tests have been conducted in Bengal, with a population of around 100 million, compared to 56,673 tests in Maharashtra, 21,384 in Uttar Pradesh and 17,650 in Madhya Pradesh.Till date, at least 205 persons have tested positive for the virus in Bengal out of whom 10 have died. Allegations have surfaced that a few other patients who died Covid-19 hadn’t been included in the toll; the state government says that they had comorbid conditions that may have been responsible for their deaths. The state has set up a panel of doctors to look into such deaths before declaring whether they died of Covid-19 or other ailments. The latest directive, expanding testing to asymptomatic people, didn’t silence critics. the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that t was another attempt to suppress numbers.“Health minister Mamata Banerjee continues assault on Doctor’s rights, proscribes them from prescribing Covid tests! How is it that a doctor treating a Covid patient can neither decide on the test nor write reasons for death but local admin or some random committee can?” tweeted Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s information technology cell.The health department offered no immediate clarification. Repeated calls and messages to top officials in the department elicited no response .The Union government has identified Kolkata and Howrah as red zones – where the number of cases could easily double within four days. The state administration has started a house-to-house survey in high-risk containment areas to trace Covid-19 suspects who need to be quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-govt-plans-ramping-up-testing/story-MovgwQULEkD9qlaFK6ajxL.html
18-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: On April 20, about 45% of economy will resume operations||The Union government’s guidelines, envisioning a slow return to work starting April 20, will see up to 45% of the economy becoming operational again, up from just 25% during the initial lockdown from March 24 to April 14, economists said.A patchwork of sectors, focused on the rural economy, essentials as well as services, are set to resume but losses from the lockdown could still be staggering and not everything can start at once on April 20. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe transport, farm operations and rural construction sectors will need the least turnaround time, analysts said.The relaxations, set to kick in on April 20, are primarily aimed at the agricultural and rural economy to restore the earnings of daily wage earners. “Our estimates suggest that the partial relaxation will open up a larger share of the economy. Compared with the original lockdown, in which only 25% of the economy was operational, these relaxations can result in roughly 45% of the economy resuming business after 20 April,” Sonal Varma, an economist with securities firm Nomura, said. “The priority is to save lives while looking to safely restart the economy,” a federal official told HT on April 15, when the Union home ministry issued revised consolidated guidelines on which economic activities will be allowed in non-containment zones. Another economist, Varshit Shah of Emkay Global, an equities firm, said he expected domestic demand to “bounce back” once the lockdown eases. The cautious optimism about the economy tiptoeing its way back excludes hot spot districts (there are around 170), which roughly account for over 37% of gross domestic product, or GDP. According to the Union government’s guidelines, starting April 20, key parts of the economy, including agriculture, logistics, infrastructure, e-commerce and factories located outside urban limits, will resume operations in areas with no infections -- what the health ministry calls green zones. Click here to follow Covid-19 updatesThe rebooting of these activities is still critically tied to the condition that the curve of coronavirus positive cases begins to flatten. “If any new area is included in the category of a containment zone, the activities allowed in that area till the time of its categorisation as a containment zone, will be suspended, except for those activities that are specifically permitted under the guidelines of Union ministry of health and family welfare,” the government said.“Agriculture and manufacture of essential goods will benefit the most from the revised guidelines. This has to be looked at in line with the opening up of the agricultural produce market committee markets, free movement of essential goods, ration shops and no restriction on opening up of establishments for manufacturing essential goods,” Care Ratings said in a report.Yet, economists have projected staggering losses from a 40-day lockdown of business. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday slashed its 2010-21 growth projection for India to 1.9% from 5.8% projected in January. Barclays said it saw 0% growth, while the World Bank cut India’s growth forecast to 1.5-2.8% from 6.1% projected earlier. “In total, the direct economic loss due to the lockdowns is likely to be around 7.5% of GDP,” Varma said. According to a Barclays report, each week of lockdown would cost India $20 billion. Varma said economic activity could be ruled out in at least in 123 districts where the health ministry has said there is an outbreak . “Assuming that activity commences in the remaining 60% of the districts, our back of the envelope calculation suggests that relaxed guidelines will lead to roughly 45% of the economy becoming operational after April 20,” she added.Experts also said the economy’s performance will depend on strict containment of new novel coronavirus infections because newer hots pots will pinch output further. “So much depends on how the infection curve pans out,” said DK Joshi of Crisil Ltd, a ratings firm. Given that new cases haven’t stopped, India could still be on the “exponential part” of the Covid-19 graph, according to Varma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-april-20-about-45-of-economy-will-resume-ops/story-ypELwD2A8WaygClRUhQ46I.html
18-04-2020||India||With fewer people, industries eye slow start after relaxations||Industries resuming production from Monday will work much below their capacities because of restrictions imposed by states and most the workforce having left for their home states, industry leaders in different states said on Friday.They said the possibility of employing stranded migrant labourers, except in the construction industry, is not high because of the specific skills needed in each industry. They also feared that the possibility of the stranded labourers returning home when the lockdown is lifted is high, an eventuality that will further hamper production.The Central government had issued guidelines for allowing all industries in rural areas and certain industries in non-hotspot regions of urban areas to begin operating from Monday.The state governments have issued specific protocols, which include boarding and lodging facility and transportation for workers, said government officials in several states.The Karnataka government hinted that IT-BT companies could be allowed to start limited operations from Monday. Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan met representatives of technology companies. Later, while speaking to the media, he said that while the lockdown would continue after April 20, technology companies could start operating with 50% employees coming in every other day. Karnataka exports about $40 billion in technology services and the sector is the biggest employer in the organised sector in the state.The minister also said that technology employees would not need the special pass required by others. “I doubt whether there would be the pass culture after April 20. Anyway, there is no public transport, no metro, no buses. In two wheelers only one person can travel and there are limits on how many can travel in a car. If the technology companies want, we can provide sanitised public transport buses.”Narayan said the representatives of IT companies had assured him that hygiene, masks, use of sanitisers, social distancing and all other government directives will be strictly implemented. “They have said they will undertake screening and testing as well as other responsibilities,” Narayan said.Badish Jindal, president of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association, said strict conditions, such as accommodating labour within the factory premises and holding the owner responsible if any worker contracts the infection, made many owners of industrial units reluctant to resume production.“Not more than 2% of the small and medium units have the space to accommodate the workers on their premises,” he said.Industries dealing with food, sanitisers and personal protective equipments (PPEs) were allowed to function during the lockdown period, which meant that about 1% of industries were operating during the national lockdown. Revival of all industrial activity is being seen as a measure to provide employment to workers unemployed since March 24, when the first 21-day lockdown was announced.Industry leaders in different states said that only about 5-10% of the industries will be operational and many small and medium industries will not function as they do not have places for workers to stay, a condition imposed by most states.They were anticipating that the production will increase to half of the capacity even after lockdown is lifted as workers are keen to return home.In Punjab, which has about 2,50,000 industrials units, not many will operate, said additional chief secretary, home, Satish Chandra. He said detailed guidelines for industries to function in special economic zones, industrial areas and clusters will be issued by Friday evening.PHDCCI (Punjab) ex-chairman, RS Sachdeva, whose own unit is operating at half its capacity, said resumption of manufacturing in a substantive manner will be very difficult till the entire supply chain (availability of raw material and delivery of manufactured products) is fully established.“Some small units can start working to create inventory for mother units, but I don’t think large units will get into production,” he said. He, too, feared labourers will return to their villages, leading to a scarcity of workers. Maharashtra government will allow the industrial operations in about 20 districts which have none or a few Covid -19 patients from April 20 and aims to facilitate resumption of operations of at least 60% of the 4.5 lakh MSMEs by the end of April.“We are preparing a proposal to begin industrial operations in about 20 (of 36 total) districts from next week,” said industries minister Subhash Desai. “Industrial units in services, agriculture, pharmaceutical sectors are ready to resume the operations from next week. But, having limited skilled workforce is an impediment,” said Milind Kable, president, Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid-19 cases (3202) and has reported 194 deaths till Thursday.Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry, state president, Suresh Agarwal, said the industries will be operational by April 21-22 with around 30% labour. “I believe the garment factories will come into operations swiftly, looking to pending orders and local labour,” he said, adding that the industries will have adequate labour as half of the workers are from Rajasthan.Some industrialists, such as Akhil Agarwal, owner of Jaipur based Auto Corp Private Limited, said 30% workers were staying in factory premises and they will start operations by April 21. “If required, the rest of the labourers, who stay within a 10km radius of the factory ,will be called,” he said, ruling out the possibility of hiring stranded labourers.Rajasthan Industry Commissioner, Muktanand Agarwal said the industries will have to comply with the standard protocols issued by the state on basis of Central guidelines. “Passes will be required for transportation of workers who are not staying in factory premise and are coming by transport arranged by the employer,” he said. Gautam Kothari, president of Peethampur Audyogik Sangthan in Madhya Pradesh, said, “About 70% of the workforce of industries have returned home. Industries cannot resume work until adequate workforce is present 10 to 15 days prior to the resumption of operations.” He said that there was hardly any chance of resumption of operation of automobile industries in Peethampur, which has several such industries.Chairman of Indian Industry (CII), Bhopal zone, Siddharth Chaturvedi, expected the apparel and construction industries to have more operating capacity than other industries.Ex-chairman of PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Bhopal RG Dwivedi, said there is no data on skills of the stranded labourers. “Industries are looking for the labourers but they are facing problems at present in getting suitable data on skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labourers,” he said.Federation of Telangana Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) managing committee member, Avinash Gupta, said 75% of the workforce in the jewellery making units in the state were from other states, particularly West Bengal. About 80% of workers in real estate are from UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and they will go back home once the lockdown is lifted, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Telangana chapter general secretary, V Rajasekhar Reddy, said.In Bihar, the state’s industries association has decided not to start production till the government waives payment of fixed energy charge for the lockdown period. “We are not going to open our units from Monday, unless government comes out with a clear-cut directive on the two main energy related demands, which affects more than 500 energy intensive factories,” said Ram Lall Khetan, president of Bihar Industries Association. The government, however, is ready to permit companies that are willing to resume production. “We have allowed four cement companies, 193 food processing units and one jute factory to restart manufacturing for the revival of economic activities in the state in the interest of workers,” said industries minister, Shyam Rajak. He said the government has cleared subsidy entitlements for 76 State Investment Promotion Board approved units on Thursday to make money available for entrepreneurs for tiding over the disruption in activities.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-fewer-people-industries-eye-slow-start-after-relaxations/story-qhQywRH5Ein3PtReRN6vfP.html

18-04-2020||India||From reverse repo rate to dividend move: Understanding RBI’s announcements||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a series of measures on Friday to infuse liquidity in the system and provide relief to borrowers amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.WHAT ARE THE SIGNIFICANT STEPS?To begin with, RBI has cut the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points — from 4% to 3.75% — encouraging banks to “deploy surplus funds” and lend more, a move that will in turn result in cash in the hands of the borrower. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.Also read: RBI’s steps will improve credit supply, help small businesses, says PM ModiThe reverse repo rate is the rate at which RBI borrows from commercial banks. Broadly speaking, a cut in the reverse repo rate means banks are discouraged to park their excess money with RBI since they will get more incentives by giving loans to other institutions/individuals at a higher rate.WHAT ELSE IS THERE FOR THE BANKS?In order to ease the liquidity position at the level of individual institutions, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for scheduled commercial banks is reduced from 100% to 80% with immediate effect. The LCR requirement will, however, be gradually restored in two phases – 90% by October 1, 2020 and 100% by April 1, 2021. LCR is the proportion of high liquid assets set aside to survive an acute stress scenario and meet its short-term obligations.Watch | RBI cuts reverse repo rate by 25 bps, expects 7.4% GDP growth in 2021-22RBI has asked scheduled commercial banks and cooperative banks not to make any further dividend payouts from profits pertaining to FY20 (April-March) in order to ensure that they preserve capital during the coronavirus crisis. The curbs will be reviewed in the quarter ending September 30.IS THERE A LOAN RELIEF?All loan accounts for which lending institutions decide to grant a three-month moratorium or deferment (as decided by the government in the wake of the crisis) and which were standard accounts as of March 1, the usual 90-day non-performing asset (NPA) norm shall exclude the moratorium period of March 1-May 31, 2020. In the normal course, borrowers are declared NPAs only after 90 days of overdue. Until then, they are called standard accounts.WHAT ELSE HAS RBI DONE?The central bank has made available an additional Rs 50,000 crore liquidity for National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) and National Housing Bank (NHB) at a time these institutions are facing difficulties.These bodies play an important role in meeting the long-term funding requirements for agriculture and the rural sector, small industries, housing finance companies and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).SO THERE IS NO CHANGE IN REPO RATE?The benchmark repo rate remains unchanged at 4.4%, for now. Changing the policy rate is the prerogative of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sharply reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points to 4.4% late last month.Repo rate is the rate at which RBI lends to commercial banks. A lower repo rate would mean availability of cheaper loans to industries and consumers.IS THERE ANYTHING FOR THE STATES?RBI has offered enhanced temporary loan facilities to cash-strapped states from its system through ways and means advances (WMA). It has doubled the WMA limit to provide greater comfort to states for undertaking Covid-19 containment and mitigation efforts. The increased limit will be available till September 30, 2020.IS THERE SOMETHING IN THE PIPELINE?The central bank has indicated that it might take more monetary measures to help the economy tide over the crisis. Late last month, RBI infused an additional Rs 3.74 lakh crore of liquidity into the system and said it would do “whatever it takes” to handle the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-reverse-repo-rate-to-dividend-move-understanding-rbi-s-announcements/story-SXblrpMRojT8C4uhKM81lN.html
18-04-2020||Today's||Covid-19 has exposed gaps, dealt a death blow to the world order | Opinion||Due to the unprecedented nature of the cataclysmic outbreak of Covid-19, global equations will change, even if it might be too early to assess its impact on regional and world affairs. The outbreak of the pandemic is anthropomorphic.The author’s own guess is that several Level-IV safety bio-labs in the world, the Wuhan lab included, have been doing prophylactic, defensive research against the coronavirus. Such activity is permitted under the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. Whether a leak happened in Wuhan – and was deliberate or accidental – might not easily be known. The Convention’s implementation will need a thoroughgoing review. The World Health Organisation might redeem its reputation if it enquired into the origins of this pandemic, which it was late to call.The United States, badly affected by the pandemic, has completely abandoned its traditional leadership role. Covid-19 has exposed its limitations. Its reputation lies in tatters. Though China gained from this, it has not done enough for the global community to repose faith in it to provide leadership in place of the United States. To suggest that China or Xi Jinping has ‘won’ the coronavirus crisis might be premature.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe reluctance to come to the aid of others, among segments of their peoples as much as among nations, will scar memories and prevent future fraternity. Within the EU especially, a sense of solidarity was absent when the crisis broke. The initial response of its member states towards one another was insular, individualistic, and insufficient. Friendships among them have frayed. This will tell on the EU’s future.Even before Covid-19 struck, wealth, growth, and trade were shifting from West to East, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from industrialised to emerging economies. This trend will be accelerated. The fall-out of the pandemic is not just medical and economic. It will have strategic consequences.The pandemic’s impact will not, however, buttress any one ideology. Some countries and regions have dealt better with the crisis. They will be the winners. State institutions, many of which have been devalued over the years, have under-performed in many cases. These will have to be strengthened. The eroding nation-state will make a come-back.World-wide, there would be a greater acknowledgement of the need to have stronger and more purposive governance. Has the pandemic engendered social capital? To the contrary, it has accentuated social cleavages. The poor and marginalised have been excessively penalised. The pandemic has exposed growing inequalities of wealth and entitlements across and within nations and regions.The existing models of international cooperation just have not worked. There has been no shared response. Neither is trans-national solidarity visible. The weaknesses of the EU’s supra-national model having been exposed, old-fashioned inter-governmental cooperative models might come into their own. If the older ones, devised in the post-World War II period, do not meet up to the new requirements, new international institutions will come up and some of the existing ones may be re-energised. It took the Security Council, which last year held an informal interactive dialogue on the outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, until April 9 to hold an informal, closed door, and unproductive meeting on Covid-19.The error of the early nation-centric responses has been acknowledged, and there is greater recognition that nations have to combat the pandemic together rather than separately. A new ethic of multilateralism needs to evolve to meet the demands of the situation. But its building blocks are just not visible. The old order has been dealt a death blow. A new order has not emerged to replace it. The world will not be the same again, for sure. What will change, however, remains highly uncertain. The flux in the world will increase.The world might be saddled with a moribund system for some time more, perhaps until a new crisis comes along. It will be imperative for the United States to cooperate with like-minded countries to meet future global challenges. The days when it could bear the disproportionately greater burden are over.So far, neither China nor the United States really believed in pluralism. The Covid-19 pandemic might change their outlook. Pluralism then will have greater acceptability. That might augur well for the world. The world needs regional public goods as much as global public goods. Polycentrism will help in this.Within nations, across regions, and globally, the pandemic has exposed unevenness, marking out the more institutionally capable from those who have under-performed. It has also underlined that the importance of non-military aspects of security cannot be underestimated. Public health spending will have to increase.For India there are important lessons to be drawn. For India to become a great power, fulfilling the following universal, basic needs will be a prerequisite: security of the nation and safety of its citizens; ending poverty; social cohesion.; transparent and effective governance; clean air and potable water; public sanitisation and universal health coverage; quality education; livelihood opportunities and financial inclusion; decent habitat; inclusion and cultural diversity; universal access to commercially available energy; and the adoption of environment friendly processes. The reach of India’s voice in the world will be directly proportional to the success of its internal accomplishments.(Jayant Prasad is former Director General of Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.
