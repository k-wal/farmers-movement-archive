16-04-2020||News||Health care professionals are heroes. Honour them| Analysis||Across the world, the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is on. And this fight, against an invisible, fast-moving enemy, has shaken up health systems. From world leaders to the common citizens, from dignitaries to the affected patients, there is a string of commonality in our response to this pandemic — that the well-being of all people depends on the timely advice and care of physicians. Health care professionals (HCPs) are indispensable in this battle. The pandemic has proved to be a great leveller. It has set HCPs apart in their selfless service to others. But despite this, 15,000 health workers in Spain are now ill or self-isolating, making up 14% of its confirmed cases, according to their health ministry. In Italy, the figure is just below 10%. At least 5,400 nurses, doctors, and other health care workers in the United States have been reported to have contracted the virus, and dozens have died, according to BuzzFeed, a news website. The numbers are likely to be much higher. Doctors have been sharing images of colleagues using disposable raincoats, garbage bags, and other improvised materials to protect themselves, as hospitals are ill-equipped to deal with a pandemic of this magnitude. The lack of personal protective equipment for HCPs is a huge chink in the armour. HCPs, working in close proximity to one another, as close as one-to-two feet from infected patients, expose themselves to great danger several times a day. The more competent and skilled they are, the greater the risks they have to take. They are at the frontlines every day, risking their lives to protect the lives of others.So, how has society rewarded HCPs during this time? In several places, they face an awful reality — they have been assaulted, locked out of their homes and their families shunned. People forget that the role of HCPs cannot be substituted. And despite taking every precaution to safeguard their patients at huge personal risk, people are turning their backs on them. They deserve praise and gratitude, not ostracisation. They deserve to be put on a pedestal by society.In conventional wars, those who lay down their lives or are gravely injured in battle are remembered and revered by their nation. They are decorated, called martyrs, and are considered national heroes. War memorials are erected in their honour, and gallantry awards are handed to them. These tributes don’t just recognise their brave service to the nation, but boost the morale of the forces, and heal the wounds of the families they have left behind. They are also given compensation in the form of land, small businesses and jobs for their next of kin. Doctors, nurses and paramedics are soldiers in a different uniform. Every day, they go into enemy territory to take care of those showing symptoms of the virus or those who have already been infected. They come in contact with them physically, to take throat swabs, administer medication intravenously, and insert catheters. They have to come in contact with the bodily fluids of infected patients, putting themselves at risk. They have to bear the trauma of seeing patients die, despite their best efforts, and suffer exhaustion from long hours of work.As the number of infected rises substantially every day, HCPs across the world have put aside their fears and worries, and boldly risen to the challenge. They have taken the virus head-on. They require much more than sops such as extending their health cover or a few words of praise. Some states have doubled the remuneration of the HCPs for a few months. Others have announced sizeable compensation for the loss of life. But HCPs deserve more — especially more recognition as the front-runners of this battle, standing between life and death, working towards the betterment of the infected. There are several ways to show them that we, as a society, care and acknowledge their efforts. Each state should list the HCPs who are working in the Covid-19 intensive care units and isolation wards. Recognise their acts of selfless service and devotion, and acknowledge their service publicly in the media by offering Devatulya Abhinandan (Godlike greetings). It would be a lasting tribute to HCPs that even after the pandemic ceases to threaten us, their contributions are etched in gold on the gates of a temple garden. Such Devatulya temple gardens should be set up in every state. They should be our new temples, our new prayer spots. Of course, Devatulya Puraskars, awards, given with discretion and without bias, should match the recognition and respect accorded to the Paramveer Chakra or Surya Chakra. Today, they fight a difficult, unprecedented crisis. We should reward them for their work while they continue to do it. While we practise social distancing, sit at home and do what we can in our capacities, they wake up every day to treat the infected. They are our only hope at this time, and we must never forget that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/health-care-professionals-are-heroes-honour-them-analysis/story-MF39o6EHHaVJ3WrYIBcVkM.html
16-04-2020||News||Covid-19: Modi’s global stature will help India| Analysis||India is at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, others are in the middle of it, and no one, not even China, has reached the end. The only certainty is the uncertainty of the impact of the virus. But there will be a time, after the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is finally over, that will be marked by upheavals and chaos, and the world over, it will be a time of new beginnings.  For instance, due to the lockdown, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has rightly extended till May 3, many people, whose work permits it, have been working from home. This can become the norm for at least a segment of the professional workforce, since it saves on office spaces and transportation.  This period will shape other aspects of society as well. It has been tough on those at the bottom of the pyramid — from household help to migrant workers. They may now get organised, ask for higher wages, and better treatment. The most severely affected have been the migrant workers, who will need to be protected. This is the responsibility of state governments. A new environment created from this pandemic will demand the introduction of several schemes to address such concerns across the country. But the crisis will also alter international politics. The global spread of the disease will test the leadership of world leaders. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi appears ready and willing to take on a global leadership role in dealing with this unprecedented crisis. In this difficult time, one has to recognise that he is a national asset, with a massive global currency. Even his critics grudgingly admit that he enjoys credibility on the world stage.  PM Modi has already had conversations, individually, with all top global leaders. He took the initiative in having the first G-20 summit on the issue, virtually. Closer home, even before many countries had recognised the severity of the crisis, he proposed a meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation nations to draw up a strategy to fight Covid-19 and committed financial resources to it. Modi’s credibility comes from his domestic strength, his statesman-like approach on this global issues, his wise counsel and calls for collaboration, and his actions, where he has gone out of his way to help countries in distress, without compromising India’s needs. In the last six years, Modi stepped up India’s global engagement in unprecedented ways. While his critics focused on counting his air miles, he made new friends and strengthened old relationships. He aimed to turn foes into friends. He pulled off what in geopolitical circles is considered a rare feat, of developing a close bond with United States President Donald Trump, while winning the respect of Chinese President Xi Jinping. All of this is now paying dividends. When the dust settles over the coronavirus crisis, and countries pick up the pieces of their battered economies, they will look at inspiring leadership. Modi will not be found wanting.However, India’s biggest challenge will be how to get the domestic economy back on track. And this international goodwill can be leveraged for that objective. Global players may come to realise that India’s bureaucratic bottlenecks are a lesser evil than the trust deficit that they have with China. They might think of shifting their production units from China to India, if India makes it attractive enough for them. India must focus on attracting foreign investment, through a set of innovative policy measures, once the rebuilding process starts. Domestically, there is likely to be a follow-up economic stimulus after the ~1.7 lakh crore package was rolled out to give immediate relief to the poor. The infrastructure and manufacturing sectors, coupled with the services industry, need the immediate attention of the government. Non-banking financial assets, and small and medium enterprises, need a helping hand too.India has a domestic market which, to a large extent, kept the country going during the 2008 recession. We must make efforts to generate demand and enhance production, alongside our efforts in giving a strong push to exports.The Covid-19 outbreak presents one of the biggest challenges for Modi. He has emphasised the importance of lives (jaan) and the world (jahan). His global stature will help preserving both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-modi-s-global-stature-will-help-india-analysis/story-ELUtwVswyBLFlqHf7HQ0sK.html

Harvesting has begun and villagers are quite co-operative. We will ensure that the hard work of the farmers does not go waste,” said Kuldeep Bawa, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Dera Bassi.However, kick starting the harvesting process was not easy as the combine operators as well as labourers had fled earlier fearing they would get infected, forcing the administration to arrange for volunteers after reassuring them of adequate safety measures.“The wheat harvested will be packed separately and kept in storage area that has been been sanitised. We have got three tractor trolleys and two combines and six migrant labourers,” added Bawa.The authorities aim to complete harvesting within this week. Supervising harvesting and procurementMeanwhile, a seven-member team has been set up by Bawa with Sukhchain Singh, block development and panchayat officer, Dera Bassi, as the nodal officer.It includes the station house officer, Dera Bassi, panchyat officials and representatives of the village.“We will ensure that while harvesting proper precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks is followed,” said the block development and panchayat officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/admn-takes-charge-of-harvesting-at-dera-bassi-covid-19-hotspot/story-OwErv5XC0mjhZoTzkt8kHP.html

In view of this, HCMSA has decided not to take the double basic salary on this patternThe statement further said that all HCMS doctors posted at different health centres across the state were doing their duties and involved directly or indirectly in various activities to control coronavirus pandemic like screening, treatment, sampling, testing, active field surveillance, treatment at quarantine centre and treatment of migrant labour, isolation ward, various OPDs, emergency services such as labour room, post mortem, casualty and mobile teams.The doctors posted at isolation wards, ICUs and sampling section were using PPE kits but the other doctors on duty were dealing with the patients without having N95 masks and PPE kits and hence, they were on the higher risk because they don’t know which patient was Covid positive or not,” the HCMS Association further wrote.Stating that they had never demanded double salary and that it was the proposal of the chief minister, the association urged the health minister for providing sufficient medicines, ventilators and safety gear in place of double salary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/don-t-want-double-salary-but-safety-gear-haryana-doctors-body/story-uAiUcfeHcAhfnHay4peppN.html
16-04-2020||City||Hail, rain and lockdown: Cane production, sugar industry power on||Barabanki/Bahriach/Gonda/Lucknow : The lockdown has brought most commercial, agriculture and industrial activity to a grinding halt. However, it is work as usual for sugarcane farmers and sugar mills are up and running.“Sugarcane harvesting, weighing, transportation to mills and cane-crushing has been going on. You can see that once we upload the truck with this harvested sugarcane, we will head for the sugar mill in Nanpara,” said Kesri Dayal, a farmer, in a Nepal-bordering Bahraich village.Another farmer, Shuktisj Verma, in Masauli, in Barabanki, said: “Yes, this time, it looks like only cane farmers are unaffected. This is the only crop that has survived both – several bouts of hail and rain, and Covid-19. I think by next week all my cane would be transported to a mill in the district.”A staff member at the procurement centre on the Lucknow-Bahraich highway at Tendwa Basantpur in Bahraich said, “We had instructions from the government to carry on till the end of the cane-crushing season with a rider that we have to ensure social distancing and sanitizing in all our activities.”The sugarcane industry is an essential industry of Uttar Pradesh and is the primary source of almost 35 lakh farming families of the province. The state has a total of 157 established sugar mills out of which 119 sugar mills are operational. According to the UP sugar industry & cane development department website the total sugarcane area of the province is over 27 lakh hectare.Department principal secretary Sanjay R Bhoosreddy said, “The sugar industry is the only large scale industry that is functioning in the state. And the sector has outperformed itself. Against last year’s crushing season, the sugar mills this season have already crushed nearly 300 lakh quintal cane more. Of this 100 lakh quintal was crushed during the Covid phase from March 20 onwards. Sugar mills in the state have crushed 9,320 lakh quintal this season and produced 1,054 lakh quintal sugar out of it.”Of the 119 operational sugar mills in the state, three are of the sugar corporation, 24 are of the cooperative sector, while the rest are in the private sector.UP Sugar Mills Association secretary-general Deepak Guptara said, “The government kept the sugar industry immune from the lockdown and we are committed to continue running till the end of the current crushing season, that is till the April-end.”The crushing season is from November to April.Guptara said that the industry continues to adhere to the social distancing and sanitization protocol that the state government had issued for the industry. He said that some private sugar mills have even housed their staff on the campus itself and have been providing them lodging and food to prevent any possibility of them contracting Covid-19.”The sugar mills and the distilleries have also produced 11 lakh litres of sanitizers since the lockdown began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hail-rain-and-lockdown-cane-production-sugar-industry-power-on/story-iE1LIPFprYeLAFoCidu3bP.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||Uniworld Gardens 2 residents watchout for their domestic helpers||With the announcement of the national lockdown aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, most societies in the city put restrictions on the movement of domestic helpers and support staff leaving many worried if they would be paid in full by their employees given the loss of active working days. However, for those employed at Uniworld Gardens 2 in Sector 47, the resident welfare association (RWA) has come forward to ensure all workers are paid their salaries in full.The RWA using all its communication channels routinely informed the residents about paying workers those employed for household jobs and chores like car cleaning. It even invited employees to lodge complaints with the RWA in case a resident refused to pay them or did not pay the salary in full.“We are trying to ensure that the salaries of all the domestic helpers and car cleaners are paid in full. We have also informed the workers that they can place a complaint with us in case any household refuses to pay. We are yet to receive a complaint as the residents have complied with our requests,” said Joginder Singh, president, RWA. He added that the domestic helpers have also been informed that in case any of them fell sick, they could always reach out to the society for assistance.Residents say that the society has been very particular about enforcing its rule of paying full salaries to the household workers.“Through the society app, we were told that all helpers should be paid in full to help them through the lockdown. Some of them don’t have e-wallet accounts or bank accounts and had to be paid in cash. Residents were given time slots to come down to the society gate and pay the workers. It was well organised,” said Anita Manoharan, a resident. Manoharan added that she had paid her help in advance anticipating a situation like this, but is not sure how she will pay her help the next month as the latter does not have any e-wallet account.“At the beginning of the month, we were called to the society gate and were paid our salaries. Some of the residents paid cash, and others sent it to our bank accounts. We are not allowed to go out so the day we had to collect the salary, I had to request the police on road to let me go out,” said Pompa Mondal, who works as a help at the society and lives in Sector 48. The society has advised its residents against taking leisure walks in the complex to reduce the possibility of contracting the virus. Twice a day, few residents volunteer to be at the gates of the society dissuading those taking walks.“For around one or two hours in the morning and evening, resident volunteers stand at the gate and dissuade other residents from taking walks unless they are going to the grocery store. At the same time, they also supervise the activities of the security team to ensure the screening protocol is followed,” Amit Chatterjee, another resident, said.At the two society gates, the security team has been trained to use infrared thermometers to scan the body temperatures of all those entering the society. All hose entering the society are also required to wash and sanitise their hands at the washbasins installed at the gates. The society is also maintaining records of all those who step out of the society.“Only residents such as doctors, police, journalists and others who provide essential services are allowed to step out. For others, we keep records of their reasons for going out,” said Chatterjee adding the society has also procured chemicals for daily sanitisation of the common areas.Looking after its senior citizens, the society has circulated details of all resident doctors to ensure speedy consultations if needed. For older residents living alone or in need of help, the society has roped in its housekeeping staff to assist them.The society has accommodated the staff inside its complex to minimise their exposure to the outside world. Around 20 staffers have been provided accommodation in vacant apartments with cooking facilities. Ration is also provided to them from time to time. They have also been provided masks, gloves and sanitisers to protect themselves while on duty.“We made it mandatory for our staff to wear masks and gloves. At the same time, we also trained the staff on discarding the gloves and masks properly,” said Singh.The society has one grocery shop that caters to all the residents. Residents can place their order in advance via WhatsApp and informed once their order is complete. They can then pick it up from the store after paying.“Only one person is allowed inside the store at a time. Residents have to wear masks and maintain social distancing norms. We have made markings on the floor to help maintain the distance,” said Chatterjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/uniworld-gardens-2-residents-watchout-for-their-domestic-helpers/story-moMqmZmfUqIHcn3AjkwU8H.html
16-04-2020||Lucknow||Covid-19 patient’s body laid to rest after midnight drama, 157 booked||The Lucknow police on Thursday lodged an FIR against 157 people after a midnight drama over opposition to burial of a Covid-19 patient’s body at the Aishbagh graveyard on Wednesday night, a senior police officer said.The drama unfolded when a crowd opposed the burial and said that laying the body to rest in the graveyard could lead to infection spreading in the area, the officer added.Additional deputy commissioner of police (Additional DCP), West, Vikas Chandra Tripathi said over 150 people gathered outside the Aishbagh graveyard on Wednesday evening and remained there till the early hours to oppose burial of the Covid-19 patient, who died in Lucknow on Wednesday afternoon.He said the crowd was led by a group of seven people and they locked the main gate of the graveyard.Tripathi said the body of the patient was later buried with the consent of the deceased’s family. The officer said the location could not be disclosed as it may lead to further protests.The additional DCP said the police had lodged an FIR at the Bazarkhala police station against seven identified people, including Babu and Naseem, who are associated with the management of the Aishbagh graveyard, and over 150 unidentified people who gathered from the adjoining localities. He said they were booked under IPC section 143 for unlawful assembly, 148 for rioting, 269 for a negligent act likely to spread infection dangerous to life, 271 for disobeying quarantine rules and 353 for using criminal force to deter police personnel from performing their duties.He said the police photographed and video recorded the entire incident.Those involved in provoking people and creating trouble will be identified through the footage and stern action will be initiated against them, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/covid-19-patient-s-body-laid-to-rest-after-midnight-drama-157-booked/story-0Xa1hjR7m4COk9myHr3ehN.html
16-04-2020||City||Gurugram: Garbage collection trucks to be fitted with speakers to disburse info on Coronavirus||Gurugram: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to use as many as 242 waste collection vehicles of its concessionaire as a medium to spread awareness and disburse information on precautionary measures to fight the Coronavirus pandemic, officials said Thursday.Each of the vehicles of Ecogreen, the MCG’s concessionaire for door-to-door waste collection, will be fitted with speakers that will be used to make pre-recorded announcements to the public, such as the relevance of Aarogya Setu app, basic precautionary measures to combat the infection, and for updates to residents living in containment zones.MCG officials said since the garbage collection vehicles cover all corners of the city, they were considered the best medium to deliver messages.“The rationale behind using garbage collection vehicles as a medium to spread Covid-19 awareness measures is simple. They are already collecting waste from all parts of the city and by simply fitting speakers in them to deliver important messages to the residents, we can refrain from incurring costs by creating fresh mechanisms. Our primary focus is to make as many residents aware as possible of ways to minimise and limit the threats posed by Covid-19,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Besides disbursing information on the Aarogya Setu app which is run by the government, the speakers will be emitting seven pre-recorded guidelines and rules to follow for combating and containing Covid-19 such as the importance of staying indoors, making no physical contact with any person, not touching your face when outdoors, wearing masks all times, not to touch items, washing hands for more than 20 seconds with soap, and if displaying Covid-19 symptoms then to contact helpline numbers immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-garbage-collection-trucks-to-be-fitted-with-speakers-to-disburse-info-on-coronavirus/story-YhYAo8U7hsNKvKdCOUlt9O.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||Administration plans to issue temporary ration cards to migrant families||In its effort to streamline the food distribution process in the wake of the nationwide lockdown being extended till May 3, the district administration is chalking out a plan to provide temporary ration cards to migrant families in need. The cards will be valid for three months. According to officials, distribution of dry ration to those in need would help better utilise resources and avoid wastage of cooked meals (as they must be consumed timely in the summer). The administration, however, is facing the challenge of preparing a plan to avoid the duplicity of beneficiaries under different schemes. “The proposal is to issue temporary ration cards to those who lack proper documents and are not covered under any scheme. Issuing temporary ration cards has started at the state level. We will accept applications and government employees will scrutinise them. Based on that we will issue the ration cards to avoid any duplicity of beneficiaries,” Mahabir Prasad, additional commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), who is also the nodal officer for food distribution, said. Earlier this week, in a meeting with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the administration was directed to prepare a plan for the distribution of dry ration to the larger affected population. A senior official in the district administration, privy to the matter, said, “We have seen across the state that cooked meals are going to waste. So, it is likely we will only provide cooked meals only in shelter homes where they can be consumed timely. People who live in slums and colonies will get dry ration.”According to Prasad, dry ration packets, including 5 kilograms of rice and 5 kilograms of wheat flour, are being distributed in different wards with the help of MCG councillors. “Councillors are distributing at least 100 packets of dry ration per week in their respective wards as they are aware of areas in need,” Prasad said, adding that dry ration packets can last for a week in a family of five persons.Officials say the challenge is to streamline the distribution of free ration. “It is difficult to distribute dry ration randomly as all the members in a family can claim ration packets. So, it is important to have a list of people who don’t have a BPL card or are not any other beneficiary list. We give the ration to only one person in the family. For this process to be streamlined, a house-to-house survey, started by the administration, will prove beneficial,” Prasad said.He added that the distribution of dry ration once or twice a week will reduce the burden on resources used to deliver cooked meals to six relief centres and 47 distribution centres across the city.The administration is providing cooked meals to over one lakh people and dry food to almost 12,000 people. Vivek Kalia, estate officer -II, Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran, who is also the nodal officer for food distribution, said, “When we started distributing ration and cooked meals, we immediately identified the slums where we started feeding people. We geotagged the areas where cooked meals and dry ration were being distributed. The challenge in distributing dry ration is to identify people who desperately need it. It should not reach those people who unnecessarily hoard ration.”According to him, in the initial days of the lockdown, they distributed 1,500 packets of ration a day while the overall demand was at least 20,000. “We were facing challenges in packaging. So, cooked meals were being distributed through gurudwaras and various philanthropic avenues. We started distributing 10,000 packets of cooked meals per day and today the number has reached over one lakh per day,” Kalia said. Currently, the Civil Defence NGO appointed by the administration for food is distributing dry ration packets comprising 2.5 kilograms of rice, 5 kilograms of wheat flour, 1 kilogram of pulses, 1 packet of salt, 1 kilogram of sugar, 350 grams of tea, 100 grams of red chilli, 100 grams of turmeric, 100 grams of cumin.Officials of the department of food supplies, who provide dry ration to Below Poverty Line (BPL) cardholders, Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families and Other Priority Households (OPH), said they are focusing only on authorised beneficiaries. “The temporary ration card is a recent announcement. Our focus is on the registered beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). In the wake of the lockdown, there is a nominal change in the ration we were providing to the beneficiaries. For example, if a family of four was getting 20 kilograms of wheat, they are now getting an additional 20 kilograms. Likewise, we will provide them with 1kilogram of pulses/lentils along with a packet of iodised salt,” Monika Malik, in-charge, district food and supplies department, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/administration-plans-to-issue-temporary-ration-cards-to-migrant-families/story-ov3CaOVVQPa5LRkbMYbdEP.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||South City-2 residents threaten protest if water scarcity persists||Residents of South City-2 have threatened to protest persistent water shortage, which they allege has been the case since the lockdown was imposed last month, if civic authorities fail to take immediate action. Residents of Block D of the society said they have written to civic agencies, but no one is paying heed to their complaints.Around 5,000 residents in the area have been dependent on water tankers since March 22 due to a water shortage. Blocks D and F of South City-2, among others located near the Arcadia Market, are the worst hit.“The water crisis is not new to us. There is no one to hold the builder and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) accountable. Although the MCG has taken over the area, services are still with the developer and they have been delaying it for long. They blame each other, but there is no relief for residents, who have to bear the brunt of the crisis,” Rakesh Yadav, the vice-president of South City 2 RWA, said. The area was taken over by the MCG last year but the services are still with the developer. Water is supplied by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to the developer, who routes it to the colony.“In South City-2, the developer had attached its properties to fund a ₹23.52 crore payment to the MCG to fix deficiencies. The handover is yet to be initiated in the colony, as the MCG found a ₹11.76-crore property to be stuck in litigation, and has been waiting for the developer to either pay the sum or attach another property of the same value,” said an MCG official, requesting anonymity.GMDA officials said they have cross-checked their supply and there is no interruption at their end. “We have checked the water pressure and supply, which is regular, but the problem lies with the developer and their pipelines. We are supplying to the developer, further responsibility is of their team,” said Ankit Sheoran, junior engineer, GMDA.Residents alleged that due to lockdown there is hardly any availability of staff at the developer’s office to resolve their issues. They have had to fall back on private tanker operators to meet their daily needs and are paying nearly ₹1,000 for a tanker, which is shared by two families every day.“Since March 24, water supply has been irregular and unreliable. Hence, I had no option but to rely on the services of a private tank operator to ensure enough supply to meet our day-to-day needs. The water is supplied by GMDA to the developer and it is routed through them,” Bhupinder Singh, a resident of Block D, South City-2, said. “Many residents are using boosting pumps and some have constructed underground tanks, due to which the water pressure is low and does not reach all houses. The builder’s ignorance about infrastructure is the major problem and they are still neglecting the issue. There are no back-up plans to deal with emergency situations,” Kuldeep Chillar, another resident said.The representative of the developer said that he is unaware of the water supply issue and refused further comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/south-city-2-residents-threaten-protest-if-water-scarcity-persists/story-qoTKGKAKdyWPmytnIJeQSO.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||Najafgarh drain’s biochemical oxygen demand reduces 40 points during lockdown: GMDA affidavit||The Najafgarh drain’s biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) has reduced by 40 points during the 21 days of the nationwide lockdown, stated the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) affidavit submitted to the national green tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country. It began on March 25, and the first phase ended on April 14.The BOD is an indicator of pollutants in water—the higher the level, the poorer the quality of water.The NGT said it would review the affidavit after the second phase of the lockdown is lifted in May. The NGT has been monitoring Gurugram’s sewage discharge for the past four years. It has stated its concerns from time to time about the rise of pollutants in the drain and questioned the GMDA’s treatment quality and capacity.Officials privy to the matter said that they measured the BOD level at 15 mg/litre on April 14, which is the lowest-ever measurement of the drain so far, according to Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA. The officials measured it at 55 mg/litre on March 21. This reduction is a great improvement, which the affidavit stated began taking place soon after the closure of factories and commercial establishments because of the lockdown.There are 10,000 small and medium-scale industries in Gurugram and Manesar, which engage 18 lakh employees. The effluent is supposed to discharge towards common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) and sewage treatment plants (STPs) before being released into the Najafgarh drain.The Haryana state pollution control board (HSPCB) has issued certificates to industries, making it mandatory for them to treat effluents at the industry-level and then discharge them towards the CETP or STPs—where the GMDA further treats and discharges them into the Najafgarh drain that flows into the Yamuna river.Pradeep Kumar, GMDA chief engineer, said, “We want the HSPCB to probe whether this improvement is linked with industries. All our STPs at Behrampur and Dhanwapur and the CETP at Manesar are still functioning well. Meanwhile, we have roped in Sri Ram Institute, New Delhi, to collect samples for testing. The treatment quality of our STPs has been questioned repeatedly after the measurement of every sample from the Najafgarh drain so far, because of high BOD levels.”The NGT was to review the affidavit on April 15 but deferred it after the lockdown was extended till May 3 on Tuesday.“Domestic discharge from the city (around 355 MLD) continues, while factory discharge is nil. The CETP at Manesar gets effluent discharge measuring around 55 MLD from industries, while the Gurugram industries’ effluent goes to STPs at Behrampur and Dhanwapur for treatment. That the BOD level has gone down establishes the fact that several industries must flout rules and discharge effluent or waste directly into drains leading to the Najafgarh drain through private tankers. The HSPCB can confirm that,” Kumar said.The NGT is concerned about pollution in the Yamuna because of the continuous discharge of polluted sewage by Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, and is monitoring the same through a committee—the River Yamuna Pollution Monitoring Committee—constituted in June last year.Shakti Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said, “We have collected samples and will comment once we get the reports after the lockdown is relaxed. The pollution in Najafgarh drain has reduced, but we cannot link it to the closure of industries without getting a sample report. We are aware of the GMDA’s assessment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/najafgarh-drain-s-biochemical-oxygen-demand-reduces-40-points-during-lockdown-gmda-affidavit/story-6GSyjhwvrDQTu3y0b7YTsN.html

The decision to increase the salary of doctors was announced by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar last week. According to the association, they are ready to work without double salary but not without proper safety gears like N95 masks and PPE kits. Dr MP Singh, vice president, HCMSA, said, “Giving benefits to only a few demoralises other doctors of the state who are directly or indirectly handling Covid-19 cases in vulnerable situations. It includes those who are doing the screening, active field surveillance, attending people in quarantine centres, flu corners, emergency and post-mortem departments. The state government should treat us equal.”He said that doctors posted in isolation wards, ICUs and for taking samples from Covid-19 cases are using PPE kits as they know they are dealing with Covid-19 patients. But other doctors who are stationed in emergency rooms, OPDs, flu corners and surveillance are on the higher risk because they don’t know whether the patient they are attending to is Covid-19 positive or not. “In many districts, doctors have complained that they are attending patients without safety gears such as N95 masks and PPE kits,” said Singh. Resident doctors in ESIC hospital in Faridabad have been silently protesting against the lack of PPE by wearing black bands and continuing with their service. Talking to HT, one of the resident doctors said, “We have been demanding PPE kits for a long time after Covid-19 patients started coming in. Today, we are handling patients, symptomatic or asymptomatic without proper N95 mask. Still, we are doing our jobs.”Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, director-general of health services, said, “We all are providing safety gear to doctors. Besides, the double salary decision has been taken by the government.” He refused to comment on the issue.Till now, 214 cases have been reported in the state, of which 147 are undergoing treatment while 64 have been discharged. Maximum cases have been reported from Palwal, Nuh, Faridabad and Gurugram. On Thursday, the state government included 14 Italian tourists, who had undergone treatment in Gurugram, in the Covid-19 list from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/government-doctors-asks-for-safety-gears-instead-of-double-salary/story-aa0I6Bio3P0y5A5StzvvEJ.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||Unpaid for two months, KoD performers fail to strike the right pose||The ongoing lockdown has brought the lives of 100 performers at the Kingdom of Dreams (KoD) to a standstill. The performers, who enthralled audiences with their dances and musical soirees, say that non-payment of salary for two months and a lack of paid work has left them in the lurch.KoD, a popular cultural hot spot, is visited by many for its two regular shows, Zangoora and Jhumroo, for which the performers are employed. It was shut on March 16 due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The dancers said that their other sources of income — teaching dance at private schools, fitness sessions at gyms and private sessions — have also dried up.To overcome the financial crisis and help the dancers meet daily expenses, Karan Achhipilya, a choreographer who leads a group of 100 dancers, has launched an online campaign to raise funds. “We have launched a crowdsourcing campaign and set a target of ₹15 lakh for April. In the last 15 days, we have managed to collect ₹1 lakh. My friends in Bollywood have also promised help,” he said.A majority of the performers relied on the monthly salaries of ₹20,000-₹22,000 and due to a lack of options, many have started selling their valuables, while others have had to borrow money, said Achhipilya. “The salaries are stuck but we have been assured by the management that these will be given soon. A small amount has also been given to us (to deal with the current circumstances), but this is not enough,” he said, adding that many performers are migrants and rent houses.Ravi Arya, of Bahadurgarh, who has been performing at KoD for the last three years, said that he has had to sell his car for sustenance. “I have a brother who works in a shop and my father stays at home. My salary has not been paid and all savings have dried up. So, I had to sell the car as we have to pay the monthly rent and meet other expenses,” said 27-year-old Arya.Even those who have their own residences in Delhi are said it is a tough time for their families. “I live with my mother and the only source of income is my salary. It has become difficult to survive as there is no other source of income to buy ration, vegetable and meet other expenses,” said Arvind Bainsla, who lives in Chattarpur of Delhi.Another performer, who preferred anonymity, said that he had to borrow money from a relative. “I will be forced to sell my motorbike if things don’t improve soon,” he said. Achhipilya said that the management of the KoD was supportive and had given money in tranches. “We spoke with the management and they have promised to make payments, but KoD itself depends on daily earnings. So, they are also in a spot, but I hope they find a solution,” he said.Pardeep Bhardwaj, general manager, administration, KoD said that they have made payments to employees whose salaries are lower than ₹15,000. “We assure the employees that all payments would be made, but this lockdown has caused a crisis situation. All efforts are being made to pay salaries at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/unpaid-for-two-months-kod-performers-fail-to-strike-the-right-pose/story-cFbXng2qwXZE5jGrcQDdRM.html

One of the suspects is a distant relative of the victim. The woman works in a factory and lives with her husband in a rented accommodation in a Noida village. In her police complaint registered on Wednesday, she said that her husband had gone to their native village near Jewar a few days before the incident. On April 14, she got a call from her relative, a cab driver, who offered her a ride back home after she expressed her desire be with her family.“The relative and his accomplice reached my home in a cab at night. They drove me to Greater Noida. However, on the way, they stopped near Dadri container depot and took turns to rape me. They dropped me home (in Jewar) at night and fled from there,” the woman told police.On Wednesday morning, the woman filed a complaint in Surajpur police station.Pradeep Tripathi, the station house officer, said that a case was registered against the two persons under section 376 D (gang-rape) and Section 376 (2) (f) (being a relative, guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman) of the Indian Penal Code.“The police team arrested the two from their residences -- the cab driver from Noida sector 51 and his accomplice from Khatana village in Greater Noida.

16-04-2020||City||Farmers in Ghaziabad to be penalised if found burning stubble||The Ghaziabad district administration on Thursday issued an advisory to farmers engaged in harvesting crops in the district to not burn any stubble in order to keep air pollution in check. The Uttar Pradesh government recently allowed farmers to harvest crops amid the lockdown while maintaining social distancing norms.The advisory issued by the district officials recommends a penalty of ₹2,500 per acre of land for every instance of stubble burning if the area under cultivation is up to 2 acres. The penalty will be ₹5,000 per acre of land for land more than 2 acres and up to 5 acres. A penalty of ₹15,000 per instance per acre is recommended in case the land under cultivation is more than 5 acres. Officials of the district agricultural department said legal action may also be taken against violators for stubble burning. “We have issued an advisory to the farmers directing them not to indulge in any form of stubble burning which may pollute the environment and affect the air quality. The harvesting season is on and about 20-25% of harvesting is already complete in over 26,302 hectare of total land under cultivation in the district,” Virendra Kumar, deputy director, agriculture department.The advisory has recommended gram panchayats in the district to ensure that the stubble is processed through the combine harvestor (a machine designed to efficiently harvest a variety of crops), and in case a gram panchayat does not require the stubble, they should ensure that the stubble is taken to the cow shelters where it can be used as fodder for cattle.Ever since the lockdown came into effect, air pollution has come down in Ghaziabad. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI), however, remains in the ‘moderate’ category.“As a result of dusty winds coming from Rajasthan, the AQI in the NCR region is not in the ‘satisfactory’ category. The average wind speed is about 15-17kmph, and this situation will prevail for another three or four days. On April 17, there could be some light rain, but it is not likely to result in any significant improvement in the air quality,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi.“Since industrial units are shut, vehicles are not playing on the roads these days, and there has been no instance of stubble burning, the PM2.5 levels are still lower than before. However, the dusty winds and local dust have resulted in high PM10 levels,” he added.On April 16, the AQI of Ghaziabad was at 250 under the ‘poor’ category, while it was in the ‘moderate’ category on April 15 with the AQI at 194.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-in-ghaziabad-to-be-penalised-if-found-burning-stubble/story-U1XKC7tmpB8tlwBpw6NG2J.html
16-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: No fresh cases, highrises want review of hotspot list||Ghaziabad: The residents of two highrises counted among hotspot areas, in a list of 14 so far in Ghaziabad, have demanded a review from the district administration and urged that the area be placed under the normal lockdown as no fresh Covid-19 cases have emerged in at least a week. The district magistrate assured that a review will be taken up soon.The list of initial 13 hotspots in Ghaziabad include those at Nandgram near a mosque; KDP Grand Savanna, Raj Nagar Extension; Savoir Park society, Mohan Nagar; B-77/G-5, Shalimar Garden Extension 2; Pasonda; Oxy Home highrise, Bhopra; Vasundhara Sector 2B; Sector 6, Vaishali; Girnar Society, Kaushambi; Naipura, Loni; Masuri; Khatu Shyam Colony, Duhai and Covid-1 level hospital, Muradnagar.Later, a highrise of Skardi Greens near NH-9 was also declared a hotspot.From the KDP Grand Savanna, a 57-year-old man who had a travel history from Tehran had tested positive for Covid-19 on March 5 and was discharged from a hospital in Delhi on March 17 after his subsequent reports came negative. Later, his 27-year-old son tested positive and was admitted to the isolation ward at the MMG District Hospital on March 12. On March 20 he too was discharged after his test reports came negative.“As of now, the highrise is still a listed hotspot area and arrangements have been made for door-to-door supply of essential items. Our highrise was sealed on the night of April 8. We had only two cases, which were from one family. Both had been sent after treatment and their 14 days’ home isolation cycle is also over. We have spoken to the district administration officials and they have told us that a declaration of hotspot area is to remain for 14 days. Besides the two cases, there have been no other positive cases in our highrise till date,” said RK Tyagi, president of the highrise’ apartment owners’ association.There are about 900 families living in the society.“If the administration still has any doubts, it should take up sampling. There has been no sampling of residents since the highrise was sealed. It was only on Tuesday that teams from the health department came here for a door-to-door survey. Even the order which has been put up at the highrise says that a review was to be taken up on April 13. Since no new cases have emerged, the administration should review our highrise and consider placing it under normal lockdown,” he added.Ever since the first case emerged from the highrise, the health department has been engaged in rigorous sanitisation and has been monitoring and taking up surveillance activities in an area of about 5km radius around the highrise.On the other hand, in the neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar district, the authorities in a decision taken Wednesday removed four areas – two of which were under complete lockdown while two were under partial lockdown – from the list of hotspots.“These areas have been removed from the list of hotspots as no new cases were reported in the past 28 days from the date of sampling,” Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had said.While two localities in Gautam Budh Nagar -- Sector 41 and Lotus Espacia in Sector 100 -- were completely rid of hotspot tag, parts of sectors 30 and 78 were also removed.According to officials, a doctor from Girnar highrise in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad had arrived from France on March 13 and developed symptoms on March 18, after which his sample was taken the next day. He was admitted to hospital in Delhi on March 22 and was discharged on April 4, said the health department.The residents from Kaushambi said there has been no instance of any other case in Kaushambi Township and the administration must take a fresh review.“We had a single case in Girnar highrise and no other cases have surfaced, despite the health department taking up effective surveillance and intensive sanitization drives in and around the highrise. Still, the highrise was declared a hotspot but it should now be placed under normal lockdown. The administration should now take a review. There are about 400 people living here,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartment RWA.State surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agarwal said that declaring an area as a hotspot is under the purview of the administration.“Sampling in such areas will go on. Generally, an area can be removed from the hotspot or sealing list once it completes 28 days after the last positive sample. The days varied from 14 to 28 depending on the number of cases which emerge. But continuing it or removing it from the list is an administrative decision,” he added.Ghaziabad Chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that a review decision will be taken up on the basis of guidelines and the district magistrate will take a review.“In Kaushambi and KDP highrise in Raj Nagar Extension, there have been no reports of any new case. So we will review them and try to remove these from the hotspot area list. But the decision rests with the district administration. From our point of view, Masuri and Savior Park are problematic areas due to positive patients and their contacts,” he added.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, however, assured that a review will be taken up soon.“We are considering the matter and will review the hotspot areas as well as the list. However, we are also ensuring that regular supply of essential items is maintained and residents do not face problems,” he added.The Uttar Pradesh government had on April 8 announced an intensive lockdown of affected areas and identified 104 initial hotspots across the state, including 13 in Ghaziabad. Under the measure, the hotspot areas were to be subjected to extensive sanitisation, doorstep delivery and barricading of the entire area to restrict any movement outside houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-no-fresh-cases-highrises-want-review-of-hotspot-list/story-k3mhxxqhvs3AiU2u2qvPnL.html

It has also set up an animal clinic in Swarn Nagri, where it will sterilise strays and release them back to their respective habitat. The NGO was roped in after residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), apartment owners associations (AOAs) and other social groups came forward to complain on the issue.“The NGO has started catching stray dogs for sterilisation. These dogs will be realised back to their respective sectors. We have started to provide them two meals daily,” said Dr Prem Chand deputy general manager with the Greater Noida authority heading the health department.The authority has not fixed any budget for this project and not made any estimate as to how many dogs are in the city. It has planned to sterilize strays in all residential as well as industrial sectors.“We have not conducted any survey to figure out how many stray dogs are there in different areas of the city. But now when the NGO will carry out sterilisation and also task of providing food to dogs it will make a database how many stray dogs are living in the city,” said Chand. The authority has also released mobile numbers at which any individual, RWA, AOA or other social groups can inform about stray dogs needing help of food. These numbers are 9599332039, 9643232803, 9810000254 and 9999382880.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-lockdown-greater-noida-body-to-provide-two-meals-to-stray-dogs/story-gE4EWi6VgWofwb2FhBDPJL.html
16-04-2020||City||Haryana: Farmers accuse commission agents of duping them on pretext of high moisture content||The mustard growers of Haryana’s Dadri district have alleged that the commission agents have been duping them on the pretext of high moisture content by paying them rates below the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹4,425 per quintal.Jai Singh, a farmer of Imlota village, said, “I had brought 8.80 quintals of mustard to the mandi for procurement. The commission agent deducted 72kg on the pretext of high moisture content. He told me that I will be paid ₹ 4,425 for 8.08 quintals.”“The commission agents have been fleecing us on the pretext of our crop’s quality and moisture content,” he added.The procurement agencies have approved of 8% moisture content in mustard and deduction will be done as per the increase in moisture content.Dayanand Punia, a farmer leader who visited many mandis in Bhiwani, said, “The farmers were facing hardships during the current mustard procurement season.”“They told me that the commission agents are not giving them any relaxation in the moisture content. This situation has arisen as the farmers are in the process of harvesting their mustard crops. The government informs them a night before that they have to bring their crops to the mandi the next morning. Due to this, the farmers don’t get time to ensure the dryness of their crop,” he added.Complaining about not being informed in advance, Charan Singh of Bhiwani’s Kalod village said, “I had received a message on my phone on Wednesday night to bring 34.2 quintals of mustard to the mandi next morning.”“I had to borrow it from another farmer as I am yet to harvest my crop. I promised him to return the same quantity when his turn comes,” said Singh.About farmers being fleeced on the pretext of moisture content, Dadri deputy commissioner (DC) Shyam Lal Punia said that he will look into the matter and seek the details from the officials concerned.“We have directed the commission agents not to deduct the price of the crop on the pretext of moisture content. The arhitiyas have been directed to provide space to the farmer for his crop in the mandi so that the wet crop can get sunshine and reach moisture level of 8%”, the DC added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-farmers-accuse-commission-agents-of-duping-them-on-pretext-of-high-moisture-content/story-ABCYJLL9RpNUcjwD4XTHvK.html
16-04-2020||City||7 of Panchkula family test positive||Seven members of the family of Sector-15 couple also tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur confirmed the development and said teams were in process of tracing their contacts. A post office agent, the 44-year-old woman, who is said to be the primary source of infection, had tested positive on Tuesday, while the reports of her 48-year-old husband, an architect, arrived a day after. “The family members who were found infected are the woman’s 14-year-old daughter, two brothers, sister-in-law and her son, and sister and her daughter. The reports of other their contacts are awaited,” said Dr Kaur. Panchkula DC Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said till now, 55 contacts of the woman had been traced. The woman was shifted to a private hospital in Sector 21 after she complained of respiratory distress, said Dr Kaur. He husband is also in the same hospital while her other family members have been shifted to Maharishi Markandeshwar Hospital in Mullana.Woman’s travel history tells a different taleContrary to the previous claims that the woman neither had any travel history nor contact with any infected person, it has now come to the fore that she, along with her family members, had gone to Pathankot’s Dehriwal village on March 18 to attend a relative’s funeral. “The source of her infection is yet to be ascertained, but her visit to Pathankot suggests that she picked the virus from there. Teams are working to trace the primary and secondary contacts of the woman and her family,” the DC said. It has been, meanwhile, learnt that some persons in Pathankot, where the woman had visited, have also tested positive. However, the health department is trying to gather more details. PVT DOCTOR IN DOCKThe doctor of a private clinic in Sector 11 is in dock after Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Thursday ordered registration of an FIR against him for violating the Epidemic Act by not alerting the health department about the woman. Panchkula DC Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said it was a case of complete negligence on the part of the doctor as neither did he inform about the woman, nor refer her to the civil hospital despite detecting a spot in her X-ray report. The doctor had reportedly prescribed the woman an antibiotic course. The woman’s condition had started deteriorating on April 2, but she initially chose to self-medicate. On April 6, she visited the doctor’s clinic in Sector 11 and went to the civil hospital after being referred for a CT scan on April 11. The doctor, his family and other staff members have also been quarantined. Now, there are currently 12 active cases in Panchkula as the first two patients, both women, have recovered and been discharged. HARYANA TALLY REACHES 200 MARKWith 10 more positive cases, including seven from Panchkula, two from Nuh and one from Palwal, the total number of cases in Haryana climbed to 200 on Thursday. However, after adding the cases of 14 Italian tourists, the number stands at 214.Senior officials said while two positive cases having Tablighi link were reported from Nuh, one case, also having the same connection, was detected in Palwal.51 DISCHARGED SO FARThe health department bulletin said eight patients were discharged after their treatment on Thursday — three each from Faridabad and Palwal and one each from Bhiwani and Nuh — taking the tally of the cured people to 51.

16-04-2020||City||One lakh staffers not paid salaries in Punjab, private tech colleges get AICTE warning||Salaries of about one lakh faculty and non-teaching staff have been held back for March, and in some instances for February, by many private unaided technical colleges in Punjab following the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.There are 1,650 unaided colleges in Punjab with a lakh teaching and non-teaching staff.Taking cognisance of the matter, technical education regulator All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), has also issued a circular, a copy of which was seen by Hindustan Times, directing all colleges to pay salaries or face action, which means withdrawal of college approval.College authorities in the meantime say they have no other option as they are not allowed to charge fee from the students till the lockdown continues or the Union government releases pending funds.In response, the president of the Punjab Unaided Colleges Association, Anshu Kataria says: “Around one lakh staff members have not been paid the salaries for March, some even for February.”“AICTE had directed us to not force students to pay fees during the lockdown, but is asking us to pay salaries. The colleges do not have funds now and we have requested the state and Central governments to release the post matric scholarship funds of Rs 1,850 crore that’s pending for the last four years,” he adds.For teachers and other staff, these are hard times. “I have not been paid for the last two months and now the management refuses to pay us, saying they aren’t allowed to charge fees from students. I am paying installments for my house and feel stressed as I don’t know how to manage my finances,” says a private college teacher in Kharar.In its circular issued to the colleges on April 15, the AICTE chairman asked for salaries of February and March to be paid failing which it said action would be initiated, which meant withdrawal of college approval.College managements, however, said payments could not be made as fees had not been received from students. The government would do well to release the post matric scholarship funds of Rs 1,850 crore pending for around 36 to 48 months, they added. Another teacher from a Mohali college says finding a job in these times is tough. “We don’t know what to do as till now we dug into our savings to buy essentials and. I have to pay loan installments for the car too.”The senior vice president of the Punjab Unaided Technical Institutions Association (PUTIA), Manjit Singh, adds, “Some of colleges have not paid the salaries from the past five to six months and we have been expecting at least Rs 500 crore from the Union government pertaining to scholarship grants that’s pending since the past three years, but we have not got anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-lakh-staffers-not-paid-salaries-in-punjab-private-tech-colleges-get-aicte-warning/story-ucgcId4tnn9eRvvgDbLsWI.html

The victims have been identified as Reena, 35, her daughter Kajal, 15, and son Karthik, 5. The incident took place around 4.15 in the evening when Kajal was making tea and her mother and brother were sitting on a bed in their one-room tenement. Rohtak deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sajjan Singh, who rushed to the spot soon after getting information, said that they were suspecting that LPG leaked from the connecting pipe of the cylinder and diffused in the room before a fire triggered the blast. “The woman and her children died on the spot, while her husband received minor injuries as he was standing on the door of the room when the explosion took place,” he added. “Forensic teams were rushed to the spot and they have not ruled out any suspicious motive behind the tragic incident,” the DSP said. He said they have sent the victims’ bodies for postmortem examination to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak, which will be conducted on Friday. Soon after the blast, panic gripped the village and people started rushing to the spot to have a glimpse of the incident. However, police cordoned off the area and dispersed the gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-two-kids-die-in-rohtak-cylinder-blast/story-Y42bbFtA4jmA21v6tWZvFN.html

The first case in Dharavi was reported on April 1, following which there has been a rapid surge in the number of positive cases, which may soon pose a grim challenge for civic authorities. If the pattern continues, Dharavi could see around 100 cases in the next few days. Of the total 86 cases from the area, Muslim Nagar and Mukund Nagar areas have reported the highest number of cases with 18 residents having been tested positive from each of the areas. Social Nagar and Janata Nagar have reported eight cases each, while five cases were detected from Dr Baliga Nagar localities. The remaining cases were found from other areas of Dharavi.“While screening residents in Dharavi’s red zones, we have been detecting more and more infected patients. We have targeted the high and low-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients and the new cases have been reported from these localities only,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G North ward, which comprises of Dharavi. He further said that the high-risk symptomatic patients have been institutionally quarantined, while the low-risk asymptomatic patients were home quarantined.The civic body has prepared a quarantine centre in a municipal school with 600 beds and at Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex with 300 beds. It has also acquired Sai Hospital, which has a capacity of 51 beds, for quarantine and treatment. The hospital’s medical staff will also help the civic body with in treating patients.

16-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s civic body won’t lift lockdown restrictions from red zones||Out of the 24 administrative wards in the city, eight are likely to have red zones, where restrictions will not be lifted from April 20 onwards. Red zones will mark out areas containing a high number of Covid-19 cases. Restrictions will be lifted in orange zones, where fewer than 12 cases are reported daily. There are no green zones — areas that have not reported even one Covid-positive case — in Mumbai.According to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the eight wards with red zones are likely to include G/South ward (Worli, Prabhadevi; 390 cases), E ward (Byculla, Mazgaon; 162 cases), D ward (Malabar Hill; 135 cases); G/North Ward (Dharavi, Dadar; 123 cases); K/West Ward (Andheri, Oshiwara, Jogeshwari; 106 cases), H/East ward (Bandra east; 105 cases), and M/East ward (Deonar, Chembur; 103 cases). Red zones have over 12 cases of Covid-19 reported daily.Ramesh Pawar, deputy municipal commissioner, health department, said, “We are in the process of colour coding and this will be done as per the guidelines of the Central government. In red zones, we will mark particular areas where relaxations cannot be implemented. However, the entire ward will not be marked as red zone.”Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of D ward, also said that specific areas with a large number of cases would be isolated, rather than an entire ward. “We can mark a cluster of buildings, or mark a particular areas as red zone where the cases are high,” he said. While G/south, E and D wards have reported the most cases, 13 other wards have seen an increase of more than 100% in the number of Covid-positive cases reported between April 7 and April 14.The Central and the state governments had announced that some restrictions may be relaxed from April 20 to encourage economic activity. However, the implementation of the directives will depend on the discretion of local bodies. “We can have additional restrictions if we feel it is a requirement for a particular area. If we feel that buffer zones also have to be excluded from these relaxations, we can do that, but without diluting the directions of the state and Central government,” said a BMC official.Pawar said the BMC and Mumbai Police would coordinate to ensure the implementation of restrictions in red zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-civic-body-won-t-lift-lockdown-restrictions-from-red-zones/story-oivR0X8Y5x4xi07wOXJ77J.html

16-04-2020||Lucknow||UP: Ration seekers stage novel protest, climb water tank||At least 50 men and women, seeking ration, sent the administration into a tizzy when they climbed atop a water tank in Kakor Kala village of Baghpat district on Thursday.Officials said that many of villagers were those who had no ration cards and so were not eligible to seek free ration from the village ration shop during the lockdown.On the other hand, a few protesters, who had ration cards, accused the ration dealer of committing irregularities in the distribution of ration.Sub divisional magistrate (SDM) of Baraut area, Durgesh Mishra rushed to the spot along with cops and convinced protesters to climb down from the water tank. Mishra also asserted that many of the protesters had no ration card while they charged village ration dealer with committing irregularities in the ration distribution. He said village had over 600 ration cards and also claimed that only 25 to 30 villagers were involved in the protest. SDM further said that protesters had been assured of a fair investigation into the matter. “Those who have no ration cards cannot get ration from the dealer”, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-ration-seekers-stage-novel-protest-climb-water-tank/story-A8c27yjFUen2D93kE7tdPO.html
16-04-2020||Lucknow||Tipplers will have to wait, distilleries can make only sanitiser for now||An excise department order released on Thursday about distilleries and breweries beginning production led some to wrongly believe that liquor sales, which had been hit because of the extended lockdown, would resume anytime soon.However, principal secretary, excise, Sanjay Bhoosreddy made it clear that Thursday’s order was a repeat of the order of March 20 allowing distilleries to manufacture alcohol-based sanitisers in their distilleries where liquor is manufactured or brewed. The government had issued the order allowing distilleries to manufacture alcohol after the outbreak of the coronavirus led to sudden spurt in demand of hand sanitisers and major companies complaining of shortage of raw material. “We would like to make it clear that packaging, marketing and sale of liquor would stay banned until the governments at the centre and the state take a call on it after April 20,” Bhoosreddy said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his televised address on April 14, had said the government would consider providing graded relaxations in those areas after April 20 especially those where Covid-19 cases are controlled. He had, however, added that those relaxations would be withdrawn if fresh cases were reported. “Only sanitiser manufacturing and sale is permitted by these distilleries in light of Covid-19 pandemic and the latest order too should be read in that light,” Bhoosreddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/tipplers-will-have-to-wait-distilleries-can-make-only-sanitiser-for-now/story-W6Vq1CDQwXdDCMxEPo1khK.html

16-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC meeting on Covid-19 death rate: Patients are receiving treatment very late||At 5.6%, the city’s mortality rate is one of the highest in the country, and one of the reasons behind this is patients are reaching treatment centres in “deteriorated condition” after being referred by other hospitals. This was revealed in the minutes of a meeting between the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) health department and civic commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on April 14.According to data provided by the BMC, till Thursday, 2,043 patients were diagnosed with Covid-19, with 116 deaths in the city. The city’s date rate is higher than the national rate of 3.21%. One of the main reasons behind the high mortality rate is that by the time patients are referred to Covid-19 facilities, their health has already deteriorated, decreasing the chance of survival.In the meeting, Pardeshi raised concern over the high death rate. “He mentioned that many patients are reaching hospitals in deteriorated condition and deteriorating fast to death,” reads the report, adding that civic officials also discussed issues of comorbidities and mentioned it as one of the major factors contributing to the high death rate.While discussing Kasturba Gandhi Hospital, the main Covid-19 treatment centre, officials said that the death rate was high as many patients are turning up in very critical condition after being referred by other hospitals.Data provided by the BMC shows that almost 30% of the 116 deceased patients died within 24 hours of admission. A 30-year-old pregnant woman with Covid-19 from Nallasopara succumbed to the virus at BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central on April 4, a few hours after being admitted.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has now sought a report from the BMC to “verify whether symptomatic patient’s contacts are getting infected or not”. The officers have been instructed to provide all data for the study.Forensic doctors to work at fever clinicsMinutes of the meeting also stated that the assistant municipal commissioner will issue orders to post doctors from the forensic department at fever clinics, given the shortage of doctors in the city’s wards. However, a forensic expert from Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital said that they have not been informed about the update yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-meeting-on-covid-19-death-rate-patients-are-receiving-treatment-very-late/story-JPYXZj7btXDuZWIB3QkutL.html
16-04-2020||Lucknow||UP claims its strategy to ring-fence Covid-19 hotspots paying dividend||Even as the graph of coronavirus positive cases in Uttar Pradesh continues to maintain an upward trend, with overall tally of infected patients reaching 751 on Thursday, the state government claimed that its strategy to ring-fence hotspots is paying dividends.The claim is backed by the fact that maximum numbers of cases are churning out from the hotspots that have been sealed.The state government has not only sealed the hotspots but also carrying out house to house searches to trace the infected people as well as those who have come in contact with the Covid-19 positive persons, said a senior state government officer.Out of 751 Covid-19 positive cases reported in the state, 639 have been reported from the hotspots. The 80% of the cases are being reported from 173 hotspots in the 15 districts and 70 hotspots in remaining 30 districts, said additional chief secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi.In a week-long exercise, the health and police department teams have screened over 20 lakh people residing in around 3.50 lakh households in the hotspots. The health department team is collecting samples of all the suspected people for laboratory test.Once the report is positive the infected person is admitted to the isolation ward and those who have come in contact with the positive person are quarantined. “We have already quarantined 9,274 people and sent their sample for laboratory test as well,” said Awasthi.On Thursday, 18 fresh positive cases were reported from the hotspot in Agra taking the total tally to 167.In Lucknow too, 31 fresh cases were reported from the hotspots taking the total tally of the positive cases in the district to 75. The sample report of the suspected people from the hotspots has led to surge in the positive cases in UP whereas fewer positive cases have been reported from the non-hotspots area, he said.To check the spread of coronavirus, the state government has drafted a strategy to ring-fence the hotspots by sealing the area. The central government has acknowledged the UP model and directed other states to implement the model in respective areas to check the spread of the coronavirus, he said.Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said under the ring-fence strategy the health department had declared 3 km area from where the maximum Covid-19 positive cases have been reported as containment zone to carry out intensive screening of the people and sanitization. Another 2 km around has been declared as buffer zone where too the health department is maintaining close watch on the households and people residing in it, he said.The entry and exit of the people have been restricted. The health department has also called upon the people to alert the administration or health team if they find suspected people in the locality. Several people have used the helpline or called the control rooms to sound an alert about the suspected person or arrival of people from outside, he said.“We have decided to carry out 100% sampling in the hotspots. Once the sampling, isolating and quarantine exercise is completed we will be able to contain the spread of the coronavirus and control the cases too,” he said.Among the 751 positive cases, 60% are members of Tabligi Jamaat. Again, the Tabligi Jamaat members have been traced in the hotspots in 45 districts. The police teams have traced 2,717 Tabligi Jamaat members and 2,470 have been quarantined. The health department is also tracing the people who have come in contact with Jamaatis to collect samples and admit in the quarantine facilities for 14 days, he said.The 325 Jamaatis, who have come from foreign countries, have been also traced in the hotspots. They have been quarantined.“The FIR has been registered against 295 foreigners and passports of 259 persons have been confiscated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-claims-its-strategy-to-ring-fence-covid-19-hotspots-paying-dividend/story-TWb20Nc2huvE0RJ4vrlQ5I.html
16-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks permission for pool testing for Covid-19||As the total number of cases in the state reached 3202, the Maharashtra government has sought permission from the Centre to conduct pool testing for Covid-19. The process involves testing up to 30 samples in a single test. So far, one sample is being tested at a time, state health minister Rajesh Tope said on Thursday.“After rapid testing, we have now sought permission for conducting pool testing from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). We have also sought permission for clinical trials of plasma therapy and are yet to get the permissions,” Tope said.Pool testing algorithm involves Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) screening of a specimen pool, comprising multiple samples. In case a pool tests positive, then each sample will be individually tested.According to ICMR directives, the test is only prescribed to be used in areas with low prevalence of infection. It means it can be conducted in the areas where rate of infection is less than 2%. Tope said this will help the government to cover more people in less period of time. The state has already sought permission from the Centre for starting clinical trials of plasma therapy and BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine — given to newborns and children to prevent childhood tuberculosis — for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Once clinical trials are successful, the state can start using these to treat Covid-19 patients.The health minister also said they are getting less medical equipment supplies than required from the Centre. “We are getting supplies of medical essentials from the Centre but it is not enough. For instance, we made a demand for 3.5 lakh PPE (personal protective equipment) but received only 30,000. Similarly, we have received 1 lakh N95 masks from the Centre against the demand of 8 lakh masks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-seeks-permission-for-pool-testing-for-covid-19/story-6x00befyVFmxrFpYN6VBQM.html

16-04-2020||Mumbai||Hoteliers angry over move on licence fee||The state government’s move to not charge the 15% hiked licence fee for restaurants and bars, if the current fee is paid by April 30, has angered the hoteliers. The state had hiked the license fee to Rs 7.96 lakh from Rs 6.93 lakh in March but it notified on April 13 that it will not charge the hiked fee if hoteliers pay Rs 6.93 lakh by April 30. However, hoteliers said that they can’t pay even Rs 6.93 lakh in the present scenario and they will be forced to shut shop.The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) has called it an insensitive decision. “We are the worst hit sector and instead of giving us some stimulus, the state government hiked the licence fees. How can the State Government even ask for full amount from April 30 when we are closed from almost two months,” rued Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, President, HRAWI.The Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR) has warned that this move will have ramifications on both the unemployment and state revenue. “We will be forced to shut down our restaurants if such a hike is carried out. This will only make our labour jobless and even the state will lose its revenue,” said Shivanand Shetty, President, AHAR.He said that the hoteliers are facing hard times. “We are still paying salaries to the staff despite having zero revenue and the state expects us to pay such a huge amount as license fees,” he added.For years, the hoteliers have been complaining of exorbitant license fees saying it was only encouraging the illegal traders to thrive.Excise officials however defend their stance. “The state is in bad financial state and we are exploring all avenues to raise money. This is an annual hike and in fact seeing the market conditions, we offered them the option to pay in instalments,” said a senior state excise official, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hoteliers-angry-over-move-on-licence-fee/story-gjjQlSb7lQZbJdnllcr5CI.html

16-04-2020||Mumbai||HC directs state to protect medical staff, look into migrants’ concerns||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state to provide adequate security arrangements for doctors, medical and paramedical staff involved in the testing and treatment of coronavirus-infected persons. The court also directed the collectors of all the districts to undertake a survey of migrant workers and provide data of facilities extended to them within two weeks.The order was passed in a suo moto public interest litigation (PIL), wherein the court took a note of media reports of medical staffers being threatened and abused, and not being allowed to enter their homes by their neighbours, owing to the fear that the staff would be carrying the virus and would infect the other residents in the premises. Taking cognisance of the news reports of doctors, medical and paramedical staff facing opposition by their neighbours, the court accepted the submissions of the state which said that doctors, medical and paramedical staff involved in the battle against the Covid-19 outbreak would be adequately protected, and the local administration would be instructed to ensure sufficient security, not on a personal leave but in general, to ensure that such staff are not subjected to any such threats or demands for vacating their residential premises.A single bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge was hearing the suo moto PIL, which was initiated after the court took note of news reports which stated that migrant labourers kept in temporary camps set up by local authorities were suffering due to lack of proper facilities. In its earlier order of April 8, the court had directed the state and local authorities to ensure that proper food, water, sanitisation, medical aid and other requirements of the migrants were taken care of.On Wednesday, when the matter was heard on compliance, the court was informed that the principal seat of the HC at Mumbai was seized of a similar PIL and had issued directions to the local authorities to conduct a survey of migrants.Justice Ghuge, while directing the court administration to add all district collectors in Aurangabad as a party, asked the collectors to conduct a survey as well as submit a report on the counselling of the migrants who were getting agitated and creating problems as they were unable to go back to their native homes owing to their travel restrictions.The court posted the PIL for further hearing in the first week of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-state-to-protect-medical-staff-look-into-migrants-concerns/story-8e8BNUN4mk2xYZCStN8UPK.html
16-04-2020||Mumbai||Students point discrepancies in PG med course seat allotment||Even as the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) and respective state governments have delayed entrance exams and admissions process for higher education courses for the time being, the state common entrance test (CET) cell late on Wednesday published a seat matrix for post graduate (PG) medical courses. While admission dates are yet to be released, students and parents have pointed at discrepancies in the quota seats again. Despite an overall increase of 150 seats in PG courses this year, many have pointed that most popular courses have got fewer than three new seats across medical institutes. Parents also argued that even after a Supreme Court order clarified that quota for economically weaker section (EWS) should only be implemented after increasing seats by at least 10%, the order is being flouted.Students are now planning to approach the Supreme Court despite the ongoing lockdown.“Maximum seat increase in government-run medical institutes (GMCs) is in non-clinical branches and yet, EWS is applicable on all branches. Due to this, students from open category are left with fewer seats compared to last year despite increase in seats,” said Sudha Shenoy, activist and parent of a medical student.In January this year, the Medical Council of India (MCI) approved new seats in medical institutes across the country, including 150 new seats in institutes in Maharashtra. Experts, however, have pointed that distribution of news seats gives very little advantage to students as all seats in clinical courses (surgery, paediatrics, and medicine), which are more in demand, have been allotted to private medical institutes whereas government-run institutes got non-clinical seats (microbiology, physiology, social and preventive medicine) that attract very few takers.“Private institutes tend to charge more fees which students can’t afford and GMCs are giving no respite to students. With the lockdown in place, we are not even sure if the court will accept our petition now,” said a PG medical aspirant. Students had finished the online registration process in February but due to the lockdown, rest of the admissions process has been stuck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-point-discrepancies-in-pg-med-course-seat-allotment/story-cUDfRff4ko3smWkyADWOkI.html

16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab set to start pool testing from districts with less + cases||With the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) allowing states to carry out pool testing for coronavirus, the Punjab government is likely to start the process on Friday from districts with low number of positive cases.According to a senior official of health and family welfare department, pool testing will be done in the districts where the number of positive cases is less than 3% of the total tests done.“A comprehensive plan is being chalked out for pool testing, which is likely to start tomorrow. We have districts such as Rupnagar, Sangrur, Kapurthala, Moga, Muktsar and Fatehgarh Sahib where pool testing can be started to increase number of tests. In these districts, only 20 to 100 tests have been done till date,” the official said, seeking anonymity.WHAT IS POOL TESTING?Pool testing is the process in which multiple samples from a particular community are taken in a single PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in the laboratory.“If the result of the test comes negative, it means all samples in the group are negative. If the result comes positive, sampling of every person in the pool is done individually using PCR tests,” as per the ICMR guidelines sent to states recently.WHERE WILL BE POOL TESTING DONE IN PUNJAB?Principal secretary, medical education and research, DK Tiwari, said the trials of the pool testing have already been conducted at two laboratories in government medical colleges in Amritsar and Patiala.“We are in the process of conducting the trial in the laboratory of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences in Faridkot.”He added that pool testing has been effective in checking the community transmission in Italy and Germany.WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF POOL TESTING?The ICMR guidelines say the pool testing can increase the capacity of the testing multifold. “If there is apprehension of a community spread in a particular area, multiple pool sampling from that area can bring you the factual position about the situation,” a health official said. Testing is so far being done individually using PCR screening. HOW MANY SAMPLES CAN BE TESTED IN ONE POOL?As per ICMR guidelines, not more than five samples should be taken together in pool testing. In India, Andaman and Nicobar administration has so far conducted pool testing for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-set-to-start-pool-testing-from-districts-with-less-cases/story-pD0AbfNYruEtl2VyoZLeCJ.html
16-04-2020||City||Lockdown, labour blues ail vegetable farmers in Punjab||Vegetable farmers in Punjab, especially those growing cucumber, cabbage, bell peppers, mushrooms and strawberries, are grappling with lockdown blues. With marriage palaces, restaurants, dhabas and supermarkets closed, these farmers, flag-bearers of crop diversification in the state, are struggling to make ends meet.Besides, farmers say lack of government aid, stringent guidelines, shortage of labour, erratic power supply and delay in lifting of the produce from mandis have compounded the problem.According to polyhouse farmer Davinder Singh Mushkabad in Machhiwara town of Ludhiana, the lockdown has completely ruined the sector. “I have been farming for nearly 30 years, but have never witnessed such a massive loss. While the vegetable crop is ready, we do not have labourers to harvest it. If we manage to harvest with each other’s help, the supply chain also has problems. These products were meant for niche markets. With marriage palaces, hotels, restaurants and shopping malls closed, our produce is perishing,” said Davinder.Pointing out discrepancies in the new system of lifting the vegetables, Davinder said, “Only a select few people purchase the vegetables from the arhtiyas and these are further sold to the vendors, some of whom are auto drivers or daily wagers with no previous experience of the trade.”He added that the farmers were not getting the price of the seed let alone the labour and transportation cost of vegetables.“Moreover, the power supply is available between 10pm and 2pm. After returning from the market, we hardly get time to rest and run straight to the field to water our crop,” said Davinder.MOUNTING LOSSESMohd Gafoor, who cultivates vegetables is carrying out vegetable farming in 63 acres of land in Patiala district, said that he has suffered a loss of nearly ₹30 lakh as the mushrooms, cucumber, baby corns and pumpkins which used to sell like hot cakes were perishing in his field due labour shortage.“Like flowers, these vegetables used to remain in huge demand during the wedding season. However, due to the lockdown, weddings have been put off. There is a set time for the vegetables to ripen and market window is also limited. Further we do not have mechanisms for proper refrigeration and storage of the crops. We are helplessly watching our produce rot and are trying to sell them in villages nearby,” said Gafoor.Jaskaran Singh, a strawberry grower in Muktsar, who had grown the crops in four acres of land, said, “I sold strawberries in the mandis of Ludhiana, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Faridkot and Barnala till the second week of March. With the lockdown extended, the fruit could not be transported. I had to distribute nearly eight quintals of strawberries among the people living in villages nearby with the help of a local politician, store two quintals in refrigerator and watch the remaining rot in the field,” said Jaskaran.MATTER OF CONCERNShailender Kaur, director horticulture, Punjab, is concerned about these farmers. “While marriage places, hotels and dhabas, a huge market for vegetables, are closed, the domestic buyers are finding these items pricy. However, we are doing our best to balance the loss. We also hope that with the opening of restaurants and dhabas on the highway, the demand of cucumber will pick up again,” said Kaur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-labour-blues-ail-vegetable-farmers-in-punjab/story-G74ldZZYPr24DDPdv4zEKK.html
16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Relief for farmers as arhtiyas call off strike||Hundreds of farmers who sell their produce at the grain market nearby Jalandhar bypass heaved a sigh of relief after the arhtiyas (commission agents) called off their strike on Thursday.The wheat procurement at the grain market near Jalandhar bypass was hit for the last two days as a section of arhtiyas were on a strike demanding clearance of their pending payments of last paddy season.The state government on Wednesday started the wheat procurement process in Punjab.The market committees have issued passes to the arhtiyas, who further have to provide tokens to the farmers for transporting their produce in grain markets.“After the state government assured release of pending payments, the statewide strike of the arhtiyas has been called off on Thursday. Now, the passes have been issued to arhtiyas, who would further issue tokens to the farmers through which they can transport their crop to mandis,” said Manjit Singh Dhillon, president of Arhtiyas’ Association (near Jalandhar bypass).It is a relief for the farmers as harvesting has been started and they were facing shortage of space to store the harvested grains, president of Kisan Union (Kadiyan), Harmeet Singh said, adding that the farmers were struggling for the last two days due to the tussle between the state government and arhtiyas.Over 400 farmers from different villages, including Noorpur Bet, Laddowal, Kadiyan, Kasabad, Jamalpur and nearby villages, sell their produce in the grain market near Jalandhar bypass. “Now the produce is expected to reach at both the markets in the city — near Jalandhar bypass and Gill Road— on Friday,” Harmeet said.Chairman of the market committee, Darshan Lal Baweja, said that all the necessary arrangements have been made and marking has also been done to ensure social distancing at the market. It might take few more days to complete the procurement process due to the lockdown, but the committee would ensure that the farmers do not face any trouble in selling their produce. A farmer is allowed to bring 50 quintals of crop at a time. Farmer visits mandi without pass, sent backMeanwhile, a farmer, who reached the grain market on Gill road without pass and unloaded his crop in the market area, was sent back by the police and officials of market committee on Wednesday.

16-04-2020||City||Wheat procurement: No produce arrives in 3 Majha districts||Farmers did not bring their produce to the grain markets of three districts of the Majha region — Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot — on Thursday even as procurement started in Punjab a day before.Even mandis in Amritsar, the fourth district of the region, barely managed to open the account with just 32 tonnes. Amritsar district mandi officer Jaswinder Singh Dhaliwal said the Gehri grain market received the 32 tonnes of wheat, while others grain markets in the district wore a deserted look. The arrival of produce will pick up after April 20 as the moisture in the grain delayed the harvesting, he added. Negligible arrival in Doaba mandis A negligible amount of wheat arrived in the grain markets of the Doaba region on the second consecutive day on Thursday with a majority of farmers yet to start harvesting due to high moisture content in their crop.In Kapurthala district, of the 965 tonnes of produce that arrived at the mandis in the last two days, the government agencies lifted 725 tonnes. In Jalandhar, few farmers arrived at the Phillaur and Mehatpur mandis and agencies purchased 475 tonnes. Most farmers are likely to start harvesting from the next week. Also, due to the ongoing curfew in Punjab, farmers are facing problems in arranging labour to carry their produce to the mandis.In Hoshiarpur district, procurement will start on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wheat-procurement-no-produce-arrives-in-3-majha-districts/story-v4laydDk7dNyXWV5uv1NxO.html

16-04-2020||City||Procurement an uphill task in SBS Nagar containment zone||Banga (SBS Nagar): With wheat arrival expected to pick up in the state’s first containment zone for covid-19, comprising 15 villages, from April 22, it is going to be an uphill task for the administration to ensure procurement. The zone was created after preacher Baldev Singh, of Pathlawa village, tested positive after his death on March 18. To date, SBS Nagar has reported 19 cases and there has been no positive case in the district since March 26. The administration has designated three grain markets at Pathlawa, Ucha Ladhana and Maalgill villages for wheat procurement in this containment zone, where wheat is grown in over 3,800 hectare. Banga SDM Gautam Jain said, “Procurement is a greater challenge in containment zones. We will regulate it strictly. Labourers attached to commission agents will stay in the grain market itself for the entire procurement season and will not be allowed to go out. Ten trucks and combines will be allocated to the zone permanently.” Nawanshahr SDM Jagdish Singh Johal said no farmer from these 15 villages will be allowed to go to other grain markets in the district. Medical teams will also be stationed outside the grain markets with infrared thermometers. Sandeep Singh of Pathlawa village, who has sown wheat on 35 acre, said, “Farmers in this area prefer to use combines for harvesting. Procurement should be expedited for the benefit of farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/procurement-an-uphill-task-in-sbs-nagar-containment-zone/story-Gz60XbR6GpCnVeK5zkIIXM.html

Thus, consumers will earn 12% interest per annum, almost double the rate of interest on fixed deposits. A PSPCL spokesman said the corporation has received a “resonating response” from consumers as the corporation has received advance payment of Rs 35 crore.Among the major contributors are M/s Oasis Enterprises (Rs 10 crore), M/s Stelco Industries Pvt. Ltd. (Rs 7 crore), M/s Veekay Concast (Rs 5 crore), M/s Arishudan Industries Ltd (Rs 4 crore) M/s Vardhman Adarash Ispat Pvt. Ltd. (Rs 3 crore) and M/s Waryam Steels (Rs 2 crore).PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Baldev Singh Sran said the corporation is grateful to its consumers who have come forward to deposit advance payments. “This will provide much-needed liquidity to PSPCL in this crisis of scarce financial resources and also help consumers to earn handsome returns on their deposit.”Sran appealed to other consumers to help PSPCL sustain through these difficult times by availing this “golden opportunity to earn extra money by making advance payments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/power-billsconsumers-make-rs-35-crore-advancepayments-to-pspcl-to-earn-12-interest/story-vyiuQBQJyoVE02quBdIswM.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||Hindu Rao doctor’s services terminated for ‘bringing disrepute’||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Thursday terminated the services of a doctor at its Hindu Rao Hospital in Malka Ganj for “bringing disrepute to the institution.” Hindu Rao is a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) screening centre as designated by the Delhi government.The DNB (Diplomate of National Board) student concerned, Piyush Pushkar Singh, was serving in the hospital’s orthopaedics department. Amid concern over the lack of quality Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) for doctors here, Singh said that he had “recently procured face shields for his colleagues from an NGO and distributed them, but the authorities took offence.”“The hospital’s medical superintendent told me to return them. I even tried getting them back but the other doctors refused to return them, and now this has cost me my job,” Singh said.The north body commissioner, Varsha Joshi, however, said that “Singh diverted donated materials, which were to be entered into the stock of Hindu Rao Hospital, by directly entering into correspondence with the donor agency. This agency was already in communication with the hospital medical superintendent (MS).”“Singh then proceeded to distribute the materials himself to whomever he pleased. He jumped in out of nowhere…wanting a slice of the glory. All donated material is monitored by me personally. The stocks are maintained meticulously. As can be seen, we thank every donor individually on our official Twitter handle. I can’t allow misappropriation over and above defiance and misbehaviour,” Joshi said.“Thus, he not only misled the donor, defied the MS, and diverted the material, but also gave it away to people who didn’t need it to the loss of those who needed it more, taking decisions which were nowhere in his purview,” Joshi added in her Twitter posts on the controversy.Singh had also been served a “show cause notice” on March 16 by the hospital authorities for putting up a video of the hospital ceiling leaking water on the beds of patients, on his social media accounts. The notice had asked him “to explain in 24 hours why he bypassed official channels to air his grievances/complaints”.Commissioner Joshi, however, denied that there was any link between the earlier notice served to Singh, or the video he circulated, and his termination on Thursday. Singh said, “I had then written various apology letters and also explained myself before each authority that I did not post the video, but had just shared someone else’s post on my timeline. I was told that the matter had concluded and I continued to go to the office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hindu-rao-doctor-s-services-terminated-for-bringing-disrepute/story-GSxwtYUV1FiJ5jNRHuTCZN.html
16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Pandemic shadow on procurement: Punjab to cap daily lifting of wheat at 3 lakh tonne||The Punjab Mandi Board and the state food and civil supplies department have decided to cap daily lifting of wheat in grain markets and purchase centres at 3 lakh tonne, keeping in view the infrastructural constraints and limited availability of manpower and machinery with the procurement agencies in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The operations will be carried out in line with the medical protocol that mandates social distancing and avoiding crowding to contain the spread of the coronavirus.As planned by the two state government entities, weighing, packing and loading of the produce for storage will take place within 48 hours of the arrival in the mandis. With this, the authorities are aiming at winding up wheat procurement in 45 days by the first week of June, as maize arrival is expected to begin in the mandis by then.State agencies have pegged the total wheat arrival at 135 lakh tonne. “We have decided to limit the daily issuance of passes to farmers to 60,000- 65,000 to limit the arrival,” said HS Brar, additional secretary of the mandi board, a subsidiary of the state agriculture department.The state government on Tuesday started the wheat procurement, which was postponed by a fortnight owing to slow maturing of the crop due to rainfall and fall in temperatures at the ripening stage and the coronavirus outbreak.“We have done lots of groundwork in the last 15 days but still there are many problems. Earlier, the produce (wheat and paddy) was brought for procurement directly from the farms immediately after the harvest. But this time, we want the farmers to bring dried produce with moisture content within the permissible limit of 12%,” Brar added.Besides the 1,864 existing mandis, 1,927 temporary procurement stations have been created to stagger the operations.Also, no cleaning support will be given to farmers in the mandis to avoid crowding.“We will invite 15-18 farmers to each mandi so that there is no rush or glut. The procurement operation would take place gradually but the farmers and the mandi staff will be saved from any infection. In the past, there have been instances when 8-10 lakh tonne wheat was procured on a single day. Farmers are finding it difficult to adjust to the new system, but the operations will get streamlined by April 20,” said director (food and civil supplies) Anindita Mitra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pandemic-shadow-on-procurement-punjab-to-cap-daily-lifting-of-wheat-at-3-lakh-tonne/story-5l9sKv5InLraf4o11jKSkJ.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Three more containment zones in Delhi, total now 60||The Delhi government Thursday declared three new containment zones, taking the count of such movement-restricted areas in the national capital to 60. A lane in south-east Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, which was until a month ago the epicentre of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest, is one of the three new containment zones. The other two are a lane in south Delhi’s Hauz Rani and three lanes of Ram Nagar in Shahdara district. In Shaheen Bagh, Gali No. 6 has been declared a containment zone after three persons had tested positive for Covid-19 a few days ago. The government has previously declared E and H block of Abu Fazal Enclave a containment zone after two cases were reported from these places. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageDCP, south-east, RP Meena said parts of Abul Fazal Enclave were declared containment zones around four days ago. No new case was reported from there on Thursday.In Hauz Rani, an entire lane was cordoned off by the district administration after one person tested positive for Covid-19. According to a senior district official, one lane near Gandhi Park in Malviya Nagar is already a containment zone. “The person who tested positive in Hauz Rani was in contact with the person who had tested positive in Malviya Nagar. The two localities are nearby to each other,” the official said. In Shahdara’s Ram Nagar area, three lanes have been declared as containment zones on Thursday after the test reports of an elderly man, who had died on April 12, came positive for coronavirus.At least nine persons of his family have been asked to remain in home quarantine and the area surrounding their house in Ram Nagar was declared a containment zone. Senior police officers said the man was a heart patient and was suspected to have died of an heart ailment until his medical reports Thursday revealed that he was Covid-19 positive. Another man, who tested positive from this area has been admitted to a hospital in Haryana, police said. Deputy commissioner of police (Shahadra) Dinesh Gupta said the man worked at a general store. He had complained of illness a few days ago and was taken to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, from where he died.“The doctors had collected his samples for testing, but because he had a history of heart problems, they didn’t suspect any other reason for his death. The body was later cremated. On Thursday, when reports came, the RML hospital stated that he had been infected by the coronavirus. We immediately asked nine of his family members to quarantine themselves at home and lane numbers 3, 4 and 5 of Ramnagar were declared a containment zone,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-more-containment-zones-in-delhi-total-now-60/story-EPm5oCtA9LdjKyn28ILeNK.html
16-04-2020||Mumbai||Swine flu, malaria and HIV drugs: Mumbai doctors’ Covid-19 treatment formula||While there is no vaccine or specific treatment for Covid-19, doctors in Mumbai said they have successfully cured patients with a combination of drugs used for swine flu, malaria and HIV. However, doctors have cautioned against the use of drugs without medical supervision.HT had reported earlier that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in March approved the use of Tamiflu (oseltamivir or Fluvir), an antiviral used in treatment of swine flu; hydroxychloroquine, a medicine used to prevent and treat malaria and anti-HIV drug Lopinavir for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Doctors said the treatment protocol of a few cured patients shows the combination works.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageOne cured patient is a 45-year-old resident of Madanpura with a travel history from Delhi, who was admitted to Kasturba Hospital with complaints of fever, cold, dry cough and bodyache on March 21. The patient had hypertension. He was treated with hydroxychloroquine. Along with that, he was given multivitamin tablets and antibiotics like azithromycin and cetirizine. The patient responded to the medicines and tested negative for the virus in two consecutive swab test reports. He was discharged from the hospital on March 31. Another combination was tried for a 69-year-old Andheri resident, who along with her husband, was among the first patients in Mumbai to be diagnosed with Covid-19 on March 11. The woman was admitted with her 70-year-old husband in Kasturba Hospital on March 10. She had cough, fever, mild breathlessness and loss of appetite. The couple had a travel history to Dubai. She was a patient of diabetes and hypertension. She was given tablet omez for acidity for 10 days, antibiotic levoflox (500mg), along with medicines for her preexisting conditions. For her breathing problem, she was given Duolin neb as her airways were congested because of the infection. However, her husband who had developed fluid in his right lung due to pneumonia needed more time to recover. He was administered with the same three-drug combination his wife received, but for his pneumonia, he was given 4.45gm of Piptaz injections (antibiotics) with a diabetes diet. Eventually, he also recovered and the couple was discharged from the hospital on March 24. “They were the first patients to be treated with a drug combination of hydroxychloroquine, Tamiflu and Lopinavir. Although there is no specific evidence about the effectiveness of the drugs, we used the drugs as an experiment which actually worked,” said a doctor from the hospital who was involved in her treatment. Talking to HT, her husband said, “For the initial two days, she was very weak and her legs would shiver. But now, she is absolutely fine and is able to do house chores without any breathlessness.”However, according to doctors, he still needs time to overcome the weakness. “On the 10th day of my admission to the hospital, I kept vomiting. I thought, I won’t survive, but I did. Although sometimes I still feel dizzy if I stand for long,” he said. The HIV medicines were earlier used for treatment of patients during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002, also a fatal respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.However, doctors caution people with symptoms and Covid-19 positive patients from trying the drugs on their own. “Every patient has different health issues and depending on it we prescribe the medicines. Some patients may need Lopinavir, others may need hydroxychloroquine. So, it will be risky and can even prove fatal if consumed over the counter without the supervision of doctors,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/swine-flu-malaria-and-hiv-drugs-city-doctors-covid-19-treatment-formula/story-QcUGAW9PbtuEAHbzBO7bsK.html
16-04-2020||Chandigarh||‘Hunger killed more people than the diseases did’: Centenarians of Chandigarh recall epidemics that rocked the nation||“The total deaths in the country have not even crossed 500 as of now, whereas during the plague epidemic of the 1920s, in a single village more than 500 people died,” recalls, 104-year-old Surender Kumar Bhalla, who was born in 1916 in Lahore.“Even treatable diseases like malaria killed thousands in the region, so if we compare Covid-19 with other pandemics, it’s nothing,” he adds.Between the 1850s and 1940s, Punjab was the worst affected in India by outbreaks of several diseases like malaria, smallpox, cholera and plague, in which millions died while many were displaced. However, compared to the current health crisis in India, many centenarians in the region say they are more hopeful now.Born in 1921, Manoj Kumar, 99, says, “Hunger killed more people than the diseases did. My brother who was in his twenties during the malaria outbreak in Punjab told me that the fields were overripe with ‘fasal’, but there was no one to harvest them. At least now the government is taking care of the poor, giving them food and helping them out. During that time, the British government couldn’t be more neglectful.”Tara Devi, 101, born in 1919, says she was from a well-off family that is why she could survive, “otherwise cholera killed many people.”CURFEW VIOLATORS WERE THROWN IN JAIL BY BRITISHComparing the curfew of today with that of during British India, 98-year-old Ajeet Singh, born in 1922, says, “During a curfew in Patiala in the 1930s, my brother was struck there. Whoever was seen outside was thrown in the jail.”Bhalla recalls, “There was no relaxation in curfew, no food, no milk, no water was provided, one had to sit at home and stay with whatever they had at hand. I was in Lahore in the 1930s when the curfew was imposed.”“The most dangerous disease was the plague. I have seen it twice in my life in 1937 and 1939,” he adds.Comparing the precautionary measures mandated by the government now and then, Bhalla says, “It was not mandated by the government, but people used to take precautions during such outbreaks. At most, the British would provide one doctor per village.”“Our mothers at home were the only doctors we had,” he says, adding, “Many families stopped eating at each other’s places out of fear of contamination.”Ajeet Singh says, “There is a huge difference in outbreaks then and now.”‘WE WILL DEFEAT THE VIRUS’Born in 1923, Ramlata, 97, says, “I am hopeful that the kind of social cooperation we are showing, the way the government is helping everyone, we will defeat the virus.”Professor Rajiv Lochan at Panjab University, Chandigarh, said, “Trauma of the past and trauma of today are not the same. For example, walking back to villages on foot was considered normal till the 1960s, whereas now, it is considered a crisis.”He adds, “Plague and cholera epidemics hit the region severely during the 1930s and 1940s. People were removed from their villages, many ran away. Those times were comprehensively more traumatic, medical facilities were scarce and the political situation was such. But today we are better prepared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hunger-killed-more-people-than-the-diseases-did-centenarians-of-chandigarh-recall-epidemics-that-rocked-the-nation/story-SLZDr6kxCDujN2Fpc2UuxJ.html
16-04-2020||Mumbai||False report by journalist played a role in Bandra chaos: Cop||Rahul Kulkarni, a journalist from a Marathi news channel, who was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly spreading rumours that led to a large gathering of migrants outside Bandra railway station on Tuesday evening, was released on bail of ₹15,000 by a magistrate’s court in Bandra on Thursday. A senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer claimed that the arrest was not carried out under government pressure.“Their news on a train service may not be involved directly with spreading the rumour, but it certainly contributed to the environment,” the officer said. Several fake news reports and rumours were happening spread on social media about the resumption of railway services. The arrested journalist’s news was among those which added to the rumours, the officer said but denied the incident to be a planned conspiracy.“Migrants and labourers were frustrated, hungry, and wanted to go home at any cost. They were hoping that on the last day of the first lockdown (April 14), the government would announce some relaxation of rules to help stranded labourers,” said the officer.Kulkarni’s lawyer Subodh Desai informed the court, “Kulkarni’s arrest is illegal. Our story was based on a Railways document and it was not a false report. It would be wrong to say that because of our story, people gathered there.”Explaining the incident, the officer added that the crowd thought that the government would arrange some transportation to send them back home, so to ensure the same, they gathered in large numbers.Police initially tried to resolve the migrant workers’ issues with talks and offered them food. However, some of the frustrated migrants were adamant and demanded passage back to their home towns. As the crowd started protesting aggressively, police had to resort to a mild lathi-charge, said the officer.“We realised that the migrants were frustrated over not getting food or government aide, and they had no money as their employers (small scale contractors, construction labour contractors) too are facing financial problems due to the lockdown. We conveyed this to the government and are now ensuring that all stranded labourers and migrants get sufficient food,” said the IPS officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/false-report-by-journalist-played-a-role-in-bandra-chaos-cop/story-Le9Q40Y8oHPzlnXTN2JPvJ.html

Every day, for two to three hours, Chawla photo-documents the birds he can see from his fifth-floor apartment in Rail Mitra Cooperative Housing Society, Charkop. In the first three weeks, he’s spotted 18 different species. Chawla is among those in the city who have discovered an interest in birdwatching while staying at home.“The activity not only keeps me occupied, but also helps to document the behaviour of avian species. Most birds are nesting since it’s breeding season,” said Chawla. Apart from common birds like house crows, rock pigeons and house sparrows, Chawla has seen black-crowned night herons making nests and spotted the Asian koel as it waited to drop her eggs in crows’ nests. Coppersmith barbet. golden oriole, rose-ringed parakeets and fan-tails are regular visitors. As summer approaches and flower nectar is available, the purple sunbird, common tailorbird, red-ventured bulbul, and white-throated hingfisher have made an appearance.For Chetan Divekar, who works for a travel company, birdwatching is an activity that he can do with his children. Recently, he participated in a balcony-based birding workshop that had almost 180 participants from all over the world, and was conducted via a mobile app.“Now is the right time to introduce your children to these things, because otherwise they have school. Now that they are locked in, they can spare time to look around and understand the beauty of nature,” Divekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/living-in-lockdown-it-s-time-to-document-birds-from-your-balcony/story-NDZpYJkhH2XPqxF8EDMiyJ.html

Resident medical students at the hostel have raised concerns about it. “There is a need for doctors during the ongoing pandemic, so the authority cannot just lockdown 55 doctors,” said a doctor from the hostel. The doctors also alleged that there are inadequate disinfection facilities at the hostels and the hospital.In Mumbai, the number of cross-transmissions of the infection among hospital staffers has reached almost 150 cases. Talking to HT, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital said, “This is according to the rules of the state government and we have to follow the 14 days of home quarantine. We can’t risk other doctors and patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-2-doctors-test-positive-for-covid-19-kem-hostel-with-55-docs-inside-is-sealed/story-47JOyt5aO4K5rNtMP3fUEO.html

A total of 913 smuggled illicit liquor bottles were found from in the ambulance. The police said that the driver of the ambulance had hired the duo to smuggle the consignment of liquor, in order to make a quick buck. The police are on the lookout for the driver, identified as Jai Singh. The arrested were identified as Harish Lohia, 34, who was driving the vehicle, and Devender,40.The deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), Anto Alphonse, said that they were tipped off about the consignment of illicit liquor being transported in a private ambulance bearing Haryana registration number. “Our team laid a trap near the local crematorium. Around 9.30am, the ambulance, a Force jeep, was spotted and stopped. Its driver and another occupant tried to flee but were caught,” Alphonse said.The police found a cold storage unit in the ambulance filled with liquor bottles and retrieved more bottles from other parts of the vehicle. A total of 25 cartons, containing 913 bottles of illicit liquor, were recovered, he said. According to the police, the duo told them that the driver had hired them and paid them ₹2,000 for reach trip from Bahadurgarh to Delhi. “Singh had directed them to supply the liquor bottles to bootleggers in west Delhi. We questioned the ambulance owner, who said that Singh was hired two months ago,” said Alphonse. As liquor and wine shops across the country are shut because of the lockdown, bootleggers are using various tricks to procure and supply liquor bottles at higher prices. People associated with other professions have also entered this illegal business during the lockdown, a police officer said.Recently, a Delhi Police officer and a milkman, in separate incidents, were caught smuggling illicit liquor in their vehicle and milk containers, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/duo-held-for-smuggling-liquor-from-haryana-in-private-ambulance/story-uE6ZdtqspyzmtStiEg75pO.html

16-04-2020||Lucknow||Man booked for defying lockdown, hosting son’s birthday party in Gorakhpur||The Gorakhpur police on Thursday registered a case against a local man who defied Covid-19 lockdown norms and put dozens of lives at risk by hosting a birthday party for his 10-year-old son at his apartment in Betiahata locality of Gorakhpur on Wednesday night, a police officer said.An unnamed FIR against 50 others who joined the event was also lodged after a video of the birthday party was widely circulated on the social media, the police said.Circle officer (CO), Cantonment, Sumit Shukla said, “The video of the birthday party was examined and found true during investigation, following which an FIR was registered against the accused who had invited residents of his apartment (building) to attend the party, defying the lockdown.”Varun Aggarwal, a trader who resides in Sarrafa Residency apartment, was booked under the Epidemic Disease Act, Disaster Management Act, Indian Penal Code sections 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligence leading to spread of infectious diseases ), the police said.The police also filed an unnamed FIR against 50 others, who joined the event. The police also seized some chairs used in the event held in the posh Betiahata locality.Aggarwal said, “We realised that we committed a mistake and we are deeply regretful about it. Our intention was not to breach the lockdown. The party was planned suddenly on the idea of some apartment (building) residents who wanted a get-together for some time to overcome the boredom caused by staying indoors during the lockdown. But, unfortunately, the invitees did not adhere to social distancing.”“Here, I want to make it clear that all those who joined the party were apartment (building) residents with no one displaying symptoms and no outsider attended it. The residents of the apartment are already so alert that they keep information on the health of everyone living in the apartment (building). They do not allow entry to outsiders and have even placed a bottle of sanitiser at the gate so that everyone entering or exiting has to wash his hands. No formal invitation was given for the party,” he said.However, some others alleged that Aggarwal went ahead with his plan to host the party despite stiff resistance by some residents, who made a video of the event from their balcony and circulated it on the social media.The aerial view of the video shows around 50 invitees breaching social distancing norms, mingling together and eating food served to them from stalls set up outside the apartment building located in a posh area of the city .“Despite opposition from residents of the apartment, he went out to arrange a cook for the party and requested all to attend the event. But most of the alert residents stayed away. Of the 500 people in the apartment (building), just 50- 60 joined the event. Jewellers, big traders and other well-off families live in the multi-storeyed apartment building,” said a resident who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/man-booked-for-defying-lockdown-hosting-son-s-birthday-party-in-gorakhpur/story-23OFWyvbp1TOgS2lKgXGfK.html

16-04-2020||Mumbai||In a first, leucistic sloth bear spotted in Maharashtra: Forest department||The first record of a rare leucistic sloth bear has been documented from Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Maharashtra, the forest department said on Thursday. The observation comes while the country is under lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Leucism is a condition in which there is partial loss of pigmentation in animals causing white, pale or patchy colouration of skin, hair, feathers or scales, but pigment cells in eyes are not affected.“We have no previous record of luecistic sloth bears from the state. Hence, this is an important find which needs to be studied further,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). Over the past five years, a sloth bear with a rusty-brown coat was recorded from forests of Dahod, Gujarat in 2016, the forest department said.Sloth bears are protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and are considered ‘vulnerable’ by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are over a thousand sloth bears in the state, mainly across Chandrapur, Melghat, Gondia and Buldhana districts and in some isolated patches along the west coast.According to MTR field director MS Reddy, an adult female sloth bear was photographed in a camera trap last week with another of black coat (possibly a male) was sighted at Sipna Wildlife Division of MTR. “While going through our images over the past two days, we stumbled upon this rare find. In this case, the fur of the bear was beige while the colour of head was similar to that of other bears. The snout was also pale,” he said. Camera traps had been setup under the tiger monitoring study being carried out across Vidarbha landscape by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and Maharashtra Forest Department. “This is an interesting record showing the presence of animals of varied colours from the central Indian landscape,” said Bilal Habib, WII scientist.There are around 350 sloth bears recorded across the mountainous terrain and dense forests of MTR, said Reddy. “This is based on our last waterhole census,” he said adding, “There is no threat to the animal in Sipna zone as it is well-protected with regular foot patrolling of our officers and hardly any villagers.”While the forest department said such animals had low chances of survival as their colour makes them more susceptible to predation, Nishith Dharaiya, co-chair, IUCN sloth bear expert team said there was no threat to their health due to this condition. “This is a rare genetic condition but different from albinism seen in white tigers, snakes or squirrels in India, and white lions and giraffes in Africa. Leucism is partial loss of pigmentation of the fur. Nonetheless, a genetic examination and behavioural study is necessary to find out the changes in gene mutation,” said Dhairya.IUCN researchers estimate that there are 20,000 sloth bears across the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka. “Maharashtra has massive sloth bear population but they are being protected as secondary animal under the shadow of tiger conservation. Their protection needs to be amplified by the department,” said Dhairya. Reddy added, “Once the lockdown is called off, we will invite researchers to study and understand the behaviour of this female bear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-a-first-leucistic-sloth-bear-spotted-in-maharashtra-forest-department/story-EwfH9gvj5rxW4mG8n3PuhL.html

The lyrics of the poetry go like this: “Hai waqt’e inqelab, Corona se jung hai... Muh par rakho nakab, Corona se Jung hai... Denge use jawab, Corona se Jung hai... Lena hai use hisab, Ab corona se jung hai...” Farooqui, who is on duty during coronavirus lockdown, dedicates this to corona warriors in his Facebook post, and shares with us, “I have been reading and writing poems since childhood. I have read about almost all popular poets, and their works. And this is not the first time I have written something.

Nearly 22,000 international travellers came to the state between March 1 and 23, as per data from the Bureau of Immigration. “Bihar reported its oldest Covid-19 patient, when a 67-year-old from Buxar tested positive on Thursday. Another 35-year-old, also from Buxar, both having travel history of Asansol in West Bengal, also tested positive for the virus,” said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health.Patna, which did not have any active case, after five patients were discharged from hospitals on recovery, reported a positive case Wednesday when a 60 year old male came in contact with a positive patient from Dubai.A 37-year-old patient from Vaishali, found positive for the virus and undergoing treatment at AIIMS-Patna, was reported to be critical.“The patient was brought to us in an unconscious condition late on April 14 with typhoid fever and respiratory difficulty. He tested positive for the virus the next day. He is critical and has been put on ventilator support,” said Dr Neeraj Aggarwal, dean of AIIMS-Patna and nodal officer for Covid-19.“The contact tracing of the patient from Vaishali, with neurological condition, is yet to be established,,” said a health official. “He did not go anywhere during the last three months. We believe he may have contracted the infection from any of the two health facilities he visited before reaching AIIMS or the Max Life Diagnostics at Kankerbagh he went for tests or the collection agent of Sona Diagnostics at Mithapur who went to take his blood sample,” the official added.Meanwhile, the Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi had sealed the Central Hospital at Khusrupur, Popular Hospital on New Bypass Road where the Covid-19 patient from Vaishali had initially gone before being taken to the AIIMS.“We have directed the civil surgeon and the Patna Municipal Corporation to undertake door-to-door active screening and sanitisation of the 3 km area within the radius of the two facilities, while also putting an embargo on admission of new patients at the two hospitals,” said Ravi.Sixty-seven people at the health facilities who came in contact with the Covid-19 patient from Vaishali had been identified and efforts were on to collect their nasopharyngeal samples and put them into facility quarantine. Besides, samples of six other patients had also been taken for test.Of the 74 cases, Siwan accounted for 29, Munger (14), Begusari, (8), Patna, Nalanda (6 each), Gaya (5), Gopalganj, Nawada (3 each), Buxar (2), Saran, Lakhisarai, Bhagalpur and Vaishali (1 each).The state has 42 active cases after 37 patients had recovered and one death on March 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/4-more-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-bihar-total-rises-to-74/story-QNatoWm9aeC1bRevIZD6FL.html

It did not give any clarification over the pending payments of ₹150 crore. Moreover, the commission agents are not ready to open fresh bank accounts for the online payment of wheat,” said Vikas Singhal, secretary of Haryana State Anaj Mandi Arhtiya Association.A letter issued on April 13 by the deputy director (procurement) of director food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department to the general managers of seven private banks read that the state finance department has issued standing instructions to all the empanelled banks for opening new bank accounts of arhtiyas. “You are, therefore, requested to open new current accounts of all the arhtiyas, who are not having bank accounts in the above mentioned banks, so that the payments to the farmers may be routed through these accounts via the e-kharid portal,” read the letter.Singhal said that most of the arhtiyas in the state are unwilling to support the government as they already have bank accounts and there is no need to open new ones a week before the procurement.Talking to Hindustan Times, additional chief secretary (ACS) food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, PK Das, said, “Yes, they have been told to open new accounts for the easy transfer of payments to farmers without any delay.”“We don’t know why they were objecting to it as opening a new bank account takes only 20 minutes.The procurement will begin from April 20 and they have enough time to open it as we have already instructed the banks to open these accounts without any further delay”, he added.However, the government has already accepted the demand of the commission agents allowing them to make deductions from the payments of the farmers who had taken an advance from them.On the pending payments, Das said, “As of now, I cannot provide the exact figure, but the amount is not ₹150 crore. Also, efforts were made to clear it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/arhtiyas-unwilling-to-support-procurement-oppose-opening-of-new-bank-accounts/story-aucBJonUYhv5ZAh3mq0MAI.html

Residents also posted their queries during the session. Though the doctors from various private hospitals of the city answered the queries pertaining to Covid-19, but remained mum on closure of OPD services in private hospitals across the city.Ayush doctors stressed of immunity booster drinks and yoga to keep the virus at bay.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal and deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal moderated medical bulletin.Excerpt from Q&A session Dr Seema Singhal from SPS Hospital shared the details about coronavirus.“Actually the word coronavirus is not new. The only thing which sets this flu apart from the rest of the flues is that its severity is much higher. That is why it is called novel coronavirus. The symptoms of Covid-19 infected persons could be observed in 2 to 14 days,” she said. Dr Lydia from Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H) stated that it is a respiratory pathogen and spreads through droplets.“As per the latest findings, the virus could sustain on steel and plastic for three days,” said Dr Lydia.Dr Rajesh Mahajan from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H) stressed on testing, quarantine and social distancing measures and cautioned against venturing out without protective gears.“There is no literature available yet that could suggest that it spreads through excrement (urine or stool). However, its presence was available in the excrement,” said Dr Mahajan.He said asthma patient could be at higher risk if they come in contact of the virus.He recommended food and supplement that are rich in zinc and vitamin-C. He also said that there is no harm in eating non-vegetarian and poultry products if it is evenly cooked.Dr Vikas Sikri of SPS Hospital and Dr Mahajan advised people not to take medicines, such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, augmentin without advice of a physician.“It is because these are anti-bacterial drugs and what we are fighting against is a virus. In some cases, it has been also observed that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin could lead to increase in heart beat and cardiac issues. It is highly recommended that these drugs should be taken under medical supervision and following a check-up from a physician,” said Dr Sikri.Civil surgeon Dr Bagga busted the myth that a newspaper could be a carrier of Covid-19.“It is a myth. There is no problem in reading papers. If there is still some suspicion, one should read it outside the house and wash his/her hands afterwards,” said Dr Bagga.Dr Mohandeep Kaur from the department of Ayush suggested people to take cardamom, black pepper, tulsi, turmeric, cinnamon, mulathi and oregano (ajwain), giloy (tinospora cordifolia)-based hot drinks.She also stressed on having amala candy and tulsi extracts. Besides, she recommended pranayam and other yogasnas.Dr Bagga stressed on following a routine of waking up early, yoga social interactions though micro blogging applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Hangouts to remain mentally fit and active during the lockdown period.Dr Vivek Sikri of SPS Hospital said that the virus does not spread through mosquitoes. However, he stressed on maintaining cleanliness and hygiene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-ludhiana-gears-up-for-rapid-testing/story-2TgBXiAznmnd243jct2CEI.html

Balwinder Singh, head of Dera Khichri Sahib, Karhali village in Patiala, is the main accused and continues to be in police remand. “The individual role of all the accused persons was thoroughly verified and it was found that these four had very little active role in the incident at the Sabzi Mandi, Sanaur Road, Patiala. There is lack of evidence against these persons as well. We moved an application in court on these grounds on Thursday,” said Patiala SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu, adding that the court took a lenient and sympathetic view and allowed the release. The other accused still in police remand are Jagmeet Singh; Bant Singh, alias Kala; Gurdeep Singh; Jangir Singh; Maninder Singh. An accused, Nirbhai Singh, is in judicial custody. All of them have been booked for attempt to murder, grievous hurt, rioting, assaulting a public servant and under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. “Further investigation is on,” the SSP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nihang-attack-on-police-team-4-of-11-booked-released/story-s0FgkpMAi7puZpvjkN4nCL.html

The last date for submitting electricity bills must also be extended from March 20 to April 20 without any penalty,” the association members said. Honorary secretary of the association, Amarvir Singh, said the hotel industry is in deep financial crisis due to lockdown in the wake of coronavirus outbreak since March 22. “If the government fails to announce any relief, then the hotel industry will not be able to survive. We want the state government to consider the hotel industry at par with the manufacturing industry and the MSME sector. Relief must be announced as soon as possible”, said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/electricity-charges-hoteliers-seek-relief-at-par-with-manufacturing-industry/story-lLJENfu1o35xU0FI0K1hQP.html

16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Amid curfew in Chandigarh, veteran badminton coach turns to online training||In early March, badminton coach Surinder Mahajan was busy preparing schedule for his 250 odd trainees at the Sector 38 sports complex. But little did he know that the coronavirus threat will force him to abandon all his plans and become innovative in helping his wards stay in touch, fit and ready for the game once the lockdown got over.Social messaging apps are coming in handy as the coach, with 35 years of experience, is trying to keep his top and intermediate groups ready and as fit as possible within the confines of their homes. The beginners group were also given specific tasks and exercises to stay in touch with the game.“We went into lockdown on March 22. And that very day, I decided to make full use of the WhatsApp group we have to keep everyone updated about training schedule on routinely basis before lockdown,” Mahajan said. All the players, who are in tournament group consisting of top and intermediate players, were given specific schedules to follow and update their task completion on the WhatsApp group. “We have 50-60 players in this group and they have been told to do sets of squats, burpees and do jogging at one place. Additionally, they have been told to do wall practice hitting an old shuttle on the wall. Standing agility is something which is very important in this game and the players have been told to keep working on that too. Alternate days are devoted to strength training also,” the coach explained. Mahajan was named manager of the Indian junior team that participated in the Junior Asian Badminton Championship held in Suzhou, China, in July last year. The 65-year-old coach is also general secretary of the Chandigarh Badminton Association and has served in various capacities with Indian teams in Asian, Commonwealth, World Games and Championships.“They have been asked to give feedback and the winner or the player who does best will be awarded too at the end of his lockdown. The prize is just for the motivation. I receive 40-50 messages per day with players following schedule which they show by sending images and videos. Sunday is off day for them,” Mahajan added.Mahajan said the idea behind this is to not only keep the players engaged in the times of lockdown but also keep them fit enough so that when they are back on court they don’t have to start from scratch. “The idea is to keep them ready and fit so that the comeback is easy. See, if a player follows this routine then I am sure it’s possible that the adoption stage wherein they gain peak fitness level can be done in 10-15 days. Once that is done, the game can also improve. The game is bound to suffer and players may need 1-2 months to get back to their peak forms and it might take longer in some cases. At least with fitness they can improve faster,” Mahajan added.Additionally the trainees have also been told to do yoga and meditation. Mahajan’a biggest fear is that in case the lockdown extends to longer periods some of the players might be pushed back by a year.“It will be difficult to make a comeback then,” added the coach, who himself follows a strict regimen at home to stay fit.“Once the lockdown gets over, players will need at least 1 to 2 months before they can participate in tournaments. It’s not going to be easy to make a comeback and normal sport to resume. Players will need weeks of practice before they take part in an event. Let’s hope we are able to fight this off successfully and India gets back to normal after that,” Mahajan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-curfew-in-chandigarh-veteran-badminton-coach-turns-to-online-training/story-WNbGwuTdj1ZvWeng59xTGP.html
16-04-2020||Chandigarh||ASI Harjeet Singh promoted for showing exemplary courage||Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Harjeet Singh, whose hand was chopped off in an attack by a group of ‘Nihangs’ when he was enforcing curfew at Patiala Sabzi Mandi, has been promoted to the rank of sub inspector (SI) in recognition of his exemplary courage. Three other police personnel involved in the incident have been awarded the Director General’s commendation disc. DGP Dinkar Gupta took the decision after consulting chief minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday. Inspector Bikkar Singh, SHO of Patiala Sadar Police Station, ASI Raghbir Singh, and ASI Raj Singh are the three police officials awarded for display of exemplary courage and devotion to duty during the enforcement of curfew, access control and social distancing measures at Sabzi Mandi, Patiala, on April 12, a government release said. Making an exception from the laid-down norms, Gupta has also conferred the DGP’s commendation disc on Yadwinder Singh, a non-uniformed official of the mandi board, who is posted in Market Committee, Patiala, recognising that he was part of the joint party of the police and the mandi board.The DGP said the promotion/awards were in recognition of the display of outstanding devotion to duty, patience in the face of provocation, courage and presence of mind of all these men, and to motivate other police officers to continue performing their duties without any fear. “Besides promoting ASI Harjeet Singh to the local rank of SI, his name has also been approved for inclusion in List D-II, which is a fast track route for promotion to the substantive rank of ASI (his substantive rank is head constable), as laid down in the Punjab Police Rules for recognition of police officials of exceptional merit,” said Gupta.All four police officers and Yadwinder Singh were seriously injured in the incident. Harjeet, whose left hand was reattached by doctors after a seven-and-a-half hour long operation, is still admitted in PGI, Chandigarh, and is under close medical supervision, said a police spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asi-harjeet-singh-promoted-for-showing-exemplary-courage/story-ix03y4vQ9LEjmYMvohdrdM.html

16-04-2020||City||Ludhiana admn orders closure of restaurants delivering food through apps||Hours after a pizza delivery boy in Delhi tested positive for Covid-19, leaving 72 families under quarantine, the Ludhiana administration ordered the closure of restaurants delivering food through delivery apps—Swiggy, Zomato and others etc.Last week, the administration had allowed these restaurants to resume operations on experimental basis. “The administration has rolled back the orders wherein a few restaurants and sweet shops were allowed to operate and deliver food between 7.30pm and 10pm,” an order issued by deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal on Thursday read.The move has been welcomed by the residents and hotel and restaurants’ association, which had been mounting pressure on the administration to shut operations of these food units.Association president Amarvir Singh said, “It is a good decision amid the rapid increase in the number of cases. The recent case of Delhi where a delivery boy has been found positive for Covid-19 is a matter of great concern.”Ravi Arora, a resident of BRS Nagar area, said the administration should not have allowed the restaurants to operate in the first place as it increases the chances of spreading the disease. “Several delivery boys are seen on city roads throughout the day and often, they are seen flouting the social distancing norms at halt points. The administration should not allow restaurants to operate until the lockdown is lifted.”Opposing the decision of allowing a few restaurants to operate during curfew, Congress councillor Parvinder Lapran had asked, “Who would be held responsible if any delivery boy contracts the virus and spreads it further while delivering food. This does not even fall under essential services category.” On Wednesday, a resident of Sudhar had served a legal notice to the administration over the decision to allow a restaurant to deliver food and ice cream in the city. The Council of Engineers has also written to Punjab chief secretary and the district administration demanding that the permission given to over 400 industrial units to operate amid lockdown should also be cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-admn-orders-closure-of-restaurants-delivering-food-through-apps/story-yvDjlPyLF1JmTBWKSWb9hM.html

Referring to the Greek physician, Hippocrates, Makhija said, “Our food should be our medicine and our medicine should be our food.” She added that this practice will help students fight any disease.The expert also told the students to follow the five-finger rule of nutrition: Every child must eat food enriched with carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals.

Ashish Verma, 16, a Class 12 student of Nankana Sahib Public School, Gill Road, said, “Due to pressure of studies, I did not take a balanced diet during the exams. But after this session, I feel motivated to make a healthy change. I will have a proper breakfast daily and drink water after every 60 minutes.”“For the last two months, I have not worked on my fitness. But now, I will exercise daily and avoid consuming junk food,” he added.Srishti Verma, a Class 12 student of BCM Senior Secondary School, Basant Avenue, Dugri, said, “The session proved to be informative as the expert advised the students to consume food items that boost the immunity.

The news reports indicated that the leopard could not be tranquillised by darts and was physically captured by using nets.After the leopard was captured, there was no necessity to tranquillise him, though this was subsequently done. The leopard was then carried by employees of the forest department to Gautala forest area along the Aurangabad-Kannad road. However, the leopard died even before he was released in its natural surroundings and was, therefore, subjected to postmortem.The veterinary expert Dr Vijay Rahate, who conducted the postmortem, noticed that some of the employees of the forest department had stepped on the neck of the leopard in their attempt to immobilize the big cat and this caused asphyxiation (suffocation) leading to the death of the animal.“This incident cannot be taken lightly,” said justice Ravindra Ghuge while taking suo motu cognisance of the alleged callousness on part of the forest department staff.The court has appointed advocate Chaitanya Dharurkar as amicus curiae and requested him to draft a proper public interest litigation petition and file it on or before April 27. The suo motu PIL will come up for hearing on April 30.Apart from the forest department, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) will also be a party to the PIL and the civic chief has been asked to collect all original documents related to the capturing of the ill-fated leopard from the forest department. Besides, the court said, it will require the assistance of the veterinary doctors available at its Siddharth Udyan zoo run by the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-takes-suo-motu-note-of-leopard-s-death-due-to-negligence-of-forest-staff/story-AZeGuqYGlQI1IZwwPVL52M.html

Now, we are worried about the crop,” he said.He added that 10 more farmer families of nearby Pasian village were accompanying them on the pilgrimage.Rajwinder, a farmer from Ramdas village of Amritsar, said, “Harvesting has started in Punjab, but we are helpless and stranded here. We fear our crop would be ruined if we don’t return to our village in time. The government must make arrangements to ensure our timely return.” He has also grown up wheat on 10 acres.Meanwhile, Bhupinder Singh Minhas, president of Takht Sri Hazur Sahib Management Board, said, “We are making efforts on our end to send all pilgrims back to their homes, but getting no response from the governments. We sent some of the pilgrims by road on private vehicles, but the governments of Madhya Pardesh and Rajasthan did not allow them to pass through their states and they had to return to the gurdwara”.On March 25, Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh had written to Union home minister Amit Shah and Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray to help evacuate devotees who are stranded at the historic Gurdwara.Gurdaspur BJP MP Sunny Deol and Congress MP from Khadoor Sahib Jasbir Singh Dimpa had also written letters to Thackeray and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, respectively, seeking help for the pilgrims’ return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-farmers-stuck-in-nanded-worried-over-fate-of-wheat-crop/story-reffV2L9qOBdgFxVwoDtTP.html

16-04-2020||Pune||Congested houses, lack of hygiene and alcoholism in three wards adding to Pune’s Covid-19 positive cases tally||Sarika Gaikwad, a vegetable vendor, lives in two 10x12 sq ft room along with her husband, in-laws and two children at the Kashewadi slums in the Bhavani peth ward. For her social distancing is a privilege given the size of her house and the vicinity in which she lives is densely populated. So, when the Pune Municipal Corporation appeals to the residents to maintain distance to prevent the spread of Covid-19, she laughs and says, “It may be possible for them, not for us.” If Mumbai’s Dharavi or Worli Koliwada are major contributors to the Covid-19 positive cases in the state capital, three wards in Pune - Bhavani peth, Kasba-Vishrambaug wada and Dhole Patil road – have emerged as the city’s hotspots. These three wards, according to statistics provided by PMC till April 15, account for 50 per cent of city’s total covid-19 positive tally. Of the 388 cases till Wednesday evening, these three wards reported 189 cases with most coming from slums and densely populated areas, according to PMC assistant medical officer Vaishali Jadhav.According to PMC, Bhavani peth has 96 cases, Kasba-vishrambaug wada 45 cases and Dhole Patil road has 48 cases. The PMC records show more than 70 per cent of overall cases in each ward have come from pockets such as Kashewadi and Tadiwala road, which are slums from Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road respectively.“Lack of social distancing along with lack of hygiene are some of the reasons that these areas have seen maximum cases. Alcoholism, which brings down immunity, has also been a major contributing factor,” said Jadhav.High concentration of population in small geographical area has now prompted PMC to send family members and neighbours of every positive case to facilities set up by the PMC for institutional quarantine. “We have turned maximum focus on some of the hotspots in the city with our health teams conducting house surveys in every locality having positive cases. Since it is increasingly becoming difficult to ensure that social distancing norms are followed in these slums, we have asked people living in pockets to shift to the institutional quarantine as it is difficult for them to follow social distancing norms at home,” said PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad. The spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus in these areas can also be witnessed from another PMC report which shows that of the 37 deaths in city till April 14, 11 deaths have come from Bhavani peth ward alone. The city has till Thursday witnessed 43 deaths of Covid-29 positive patients, most of whom also had pre-existing ailments such as diabetes, hypertension along with alcohol driven liver failure, said Jadhav. Aggressive screening has also been initiated with a special test centre started in Bhavani peth area by PMC.“PMC took the first step to seal these areas and made it mandatory for residents to use masks when stepping out of their homes to purchase essential commodities. Now, the police is ensuring that there are few people on the roads,” added Gaikwad.PMC issued a press statement on Thursday and said that they have started flu clinics in these areas which are mobile units. People with symptoms of flu can approach these mobile clinics for inspection.A health worker, Sushma Pawar, raises her concern. “Police has sealed the areas and there is control on vehicle movement, but people who are living in crowded areas and mainly in slums or chawls are coming out on the streets, which is a concern for us as it can lead to the spread of the virus.”Ramesh Bagwe of the city unit of the Congress who represents Bhavani peth area, on Thursday went to the slums to appeal to residents to stay at home.Steps taken by PMC and police- Quick response teams formed which are led by regional ward officer and medical officer.- Contact tracing sped up and more survey teams deputed in these localities.- Administration is ensuring that there is enough supply of essential commodities at the doorstep.- PMC staff is visiting homes which have reported positive cases and sending the family members to a quarantine facility after a test. They are also sanitising the zone immediately. -PMC is taking help of NGOs and political personalities to convince the citizens to stay home.- Thermal scanning of all the people residing in Bhavani peth area has started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/congested-houses-lack-of-hygiene-and-alcoholism-in-three-wards-adding-to-pune-s-covid-19-positive-cases-tally/story-gMOpWdDxkNa6v0XJ48vMAL.html

16-04-2020||Gurugram||MCG takes steps to ensure quick resumption of work after lockdown||To ensure that all on-ground civic work, including cleaning of stormwater and sewage drains, can start after the lockdown to contain Covid-19 ends, the Municipal Corporation of Gurguram (MCG) has decided to initiate allocation of e-tenders to contractors. A decision in this regard was taken during a two-hour video conference of senior MCG officials and 35 councillors on Tuesday evening. MCG officials said that they want to be in a position where on-ground civic and infrastructure work can be resumed on an expedited basis immediately after the lockdown is lifted. In the interim, all formalities for the allocation of tenders, a time-consuming process, can be finished, said officials. “We want to ensure there is no time wasted in restarting civic amenities. Hence, we are looking to allot the maximum amount of tenders in this lockdown phase so that work can immediately start whenever the lockdown is lifted,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG. An MCG official privy to the development said that if the Central government lifts the lockdown after May 3, they will have less than two months to clean stormwater and sewerage drains before the arrival of monsoon and hence, want to take up all related works on a priority. The MCG has a 501-kilometre network of sewerage and 350-km network of stormwater drains in the city. Cleaning of drains has been a major problem in the past.Last May, the MCG and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) took a last-minute decision to jointly clean stormwater drains across the city after realising that tenders for doing so in many areas had not been floated and there may not be enough time to de-silt them.Eventually, the two public bodies prioritised cleaning stormwater drains in areas where waterlogging was previously reported, as a result of which 109 kilometres of the stormwater drains could not be de-silted.On March 21, the MCG commissioner had directed all officials to solely focus on ensuring that essential municipal services, such as sanitation, water, sewage and streetlights continue to operate uninterrupted during the lockdown.During Tuesday’s meeting, the same directions were reiterated, and instructions were issued to ensure that food supply and medical services remain continuous for migrant workers, homeless and others living at the MCG’s relief centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-takes-steps-to-ensure-quick-resumption-of-work-after-lockdown/story-VJYWpyOGTthpJN1IOZKpGJ.html

Apples are also grown in the district.Around 760 people in Kullu have sought permission from the government for helicopter sorties. When roads leading to Lahaul and Spiti remain snowbound, the tribals mostly depend on chopper flights to move in and out of the tribal district.Some of the tribals stranded in Kullu say they are willing to walk through the snowbound Rohtang pass, which is still receiving intermittent snow spells. The Border Road Organisation has started clearing the Rohtang Pass. The district remains cut of from rest of the state for six month a year due to snowfall at the 13, 050 feet high Rohtang Pass which was officially closed for vehicular traffic on November 15.The pass will now open at the end of the month.“We have taken up the matter with administration in Kullu . However, we haven’t been granted permission so far due to the Covid-19 outbreak,” said Tribal Development and Agriculture Minister Ram Lal Marakanda, who is also a legislator from Lahaul and Spiti .“Those wanting to return will be medically examined before starting the journey and also upon reaching Keylong. While the Rohtang Pass remains blocked, those wanting to return will have to trek 10km from Raninullah to Rohtang, from where they will be ferried in buses. Around 1,000 monks from Spiti who had moved to different monasteries in Rwealsar, Mandi, Tashigong, Gyuoto and Buddhist monasteries in Battu, close to Joginder Nagar too want to return and tend to farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/5-000-tribal-farmers-desperate-to-return-to-lahaul-and-spiti/story-mi3HfIy5sYzreUrpYFvD7I.html

BSEB chairman Anand Kishor, said, “The board will announce the matric results soon after the lockdown is over. We may require three-four days to wind up the evaluation process, as almost 75% work is done.” “If the lockdown is not extended further, the board may declare results by May 10 or so,” added Kishor.Earlier, the board had planned to declare matriculation result on March 30 but could not meet the target due to coronavirus outbreak.Fate of the students hanged in a balance after the state board suspended evaluation of the answer-sheets third time on Wednesday and extended the status quo till May 3. “Marks feeding on software was done parallel with copy checking before announcement of nationwide lockdown,” said an official.However, the BSEB chairman refrained from stipulating any final date for results, stating that the board would notify once evaluation work was complete and physical verification of toppers’ copies and their interviews through video call by experts were accomplished.The BSEB examination controller on Wednesday issued a letter to all district education officers for suspension of the evaluation process with effect from April 15 till May 3 to ensure rigorous adherence to the lockdown regime.More than 20,000 teachers were deployed for assessment of matriculation answer-sheets across 100 evaluation centres in the state.The examination and result process suffered this year in comparison of last year as lakhs of contractual teachers went on indefinite strike boycotting invigilation and evaluation duty. Coronavirus triggered lockdown is yet another challenge before the board to complete evaluation work.More than 15 lakh students appeared in matriculation exam held across 1368 exam centres, which was conducted from February 17 to February 24. Last year, matric results were declared on April 6 with overall pass percentage 80.73%.BSEB declared result of intermediate examination on March 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-board-10th-results-likely-to-be-declared-early-next-month/story-MhPuGiAu3xT8E21zoo4pWO.html

Like others here, I was planning to start a homestay this year but have put plans on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic. It might take more than a year for things to normalise so I am now concentrating on my orchards, though the apple produce too is likely to suffer,” says Raman Thakur, an orchardist from Kumarsain.All bookings have been cancelled for the year, says Sumit Singha, a local homestay owner. “Business has suffered, but we believe in health and safety first. It might take 12 to 18 months to get business started as most of our tourists come in from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal and other states,” he adds.Pranav Vij, a Chandigarh resident who visited Kotgarh in 2019, said he preferred orchard tourism as it was a new experience for him and a perfect option for him and his friends as it was less crowded and peaceful.Himachal Pradesh has as many as 1,340 homestays with bedding capacity of 7,702.Apart from Shimla, spots such as Narkanda, Kotgarh, Tanijubbar, amongst others, attract a number of people from around the country.Stakeholders in the tourism industry hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic have demanded a special financial package from the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-tourists-stay-away-homestay-owners-renew-focus-on-orchards-in-himachal/story-0jy2fWci3WOUK4ARATXraK.html

According to information, the Pakistan high commissioner had requested for assistance in facilitating the return of these 41 people, who had been stuck at various parts of India, including Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, to Pakistan. Special vehicles were arranged for bringing the Pakistani nationals at the ICP. A team of health department was deployed at Attari border for the screening of these Pakistani nationals. After the screening, their customs and immigration clearances were done at the ICP. “No one was found to be symptomatic for Covid-19 and all were allowed to return,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, civil surgeon, Amritsar. “My relatives live in Mumbai and I, along with my wife, had come to take part in a function. We crossed over to India on March 8 and had a two-week Visa. Before the Visa expired, the lockdown was imposed and we got stuck. Now, we are thankful to the government of India and Pakistan for facilitating our return home,” said Muhammad Hussain, a resident of Karachi in Pakistan.“I, along with my younger sister, had crossed over to India on February 18 to meet our elder brother, who was in coma, in Gurdaspur. On March 13, my brother died. We were scheduled to return to Pakistan on March 21, but the border was closed,” said Amtul Basit, another Pakistani national. Meanwhile, Raja Singh, a Pakistani national, appealed to the government of his country to facilitate the return of around 200 Indian nationals, including Kashmiri students, who are stranded there. On March 14, India had suspended cross-border trade and movement of passengers through the Attari-Wagah border as a precautionary measure to check the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). But diplomats, officials of the United Nations (UN) and other international organisations, and employment and project visa-holders were excluded from the ban. Subsequently, on March 19, Pakistan too closed its borders. Since then, hundreds of Pakistani nationals have been stranded in India and Indians in Pakistan.Earlier on March 30, MEA had granted a special permission to five Pakistani nationals, who were on medical visas and had been stranded in India, for their return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stranded-in-india-for-a-month-41-pak-nationals-finally-return-home/story-EYl6SQZoGJ2mXMeiIUgWbK.html

I also visit various bus depots to ensure good condition of the buses and attend to things that may be needed for the emergency services during the lockdown.What precautions are you taking?We are observing social distancing, wearing face mask, using sanitiser and taking all the necessary precautions. All the drivers and conductors have been provided with masks. In-house sanitisation units have been made in all the depots. Daily buses are being disinfected with sodium hypochlorite solution in all depots and special safety kits have been provided to drivers of ambulances. The ambulances and Pushpak vehicles are being cleaned with jet machines. What is your view of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune?I find that in most parts of the city, people are following social distancing, but some are being careless and not following it strictly. Especially at the vegetable markets, I found that people are not cooperating with the police to the extent they need to. But I must say that the Pune and Pimri Chinchwad municipal corporations, along with the other government agencies, are working tirelessly to fight against this disease.What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?I feel that some people have not yet taken the lockdown seriously and are violating the rules. This can bring pressure on healthcare workers. The relief work is being done effectively by various organisations and citizens groups around the city. However, the supply of food for the poor and to those in labour camps needs to increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-supply-of-food-to-labour-camps-needs-to-increase-says-anant-waghmare-transport-manager-pmpml/story-690ZNXaFJlAetAry6JPiMK.html

16-04-2020||Kolkata||5 cr families who depend on roadside vending awaiting ‘financial epidemic’: NHF||The 40-day country-wide lockdown may prevent the spread of coronavirus, but the measure would bring a “financial epidemic” on five crore families of hawkers and those who supply them with products, an official of the national hawkers’ body said.The lockdown was imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 25 to break the chain of coronavirus transmission and it was scheduled to be lifted on April 15.The 21-day measure was on Tuesday extended for 19 more days - till May 3.“There are four crore hawkers across the country and at least one crore families run tiny and small industrial units that feed these vendors. They dont know how to make both ends meet as their businesses have come to a complete halt,” National Hawker Federation general secretary Shaktiman Ghosh told PTI on Thursday.The economy revolving around street vending is estimated at Rs 8,000 crore a day.“Financial epidemic is knocking at the door. Business capital is like a child to hawkers and they protect it at any cost. But they are now surviving on this capital, they live hand to mouth,” he said.“Unless they are supported, the situation could lead them to anti-social activities to feed their families or suicide,” Ghosh said.More people will die due to financial constraints than the coronavirus infection unless state governments and the Centre take some steps quickly to keep them afloat for the next few months, the National Hawker Federation official said.A total of 1,188 unions and 11 central trade unions in 28 states are affiliated to the National Hawker Federation.The Federation has demanded that the government recognise street vending as an essential service.The Centre must ensure Rs 50,000 under Mudra loan scheme to each hawker and Rs 5 lakh to the manufacturers, Ghosh said.Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched in 2015 for providing loans up to Rs 10 lakh to non- corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.“Even after the lockdown is lifted, I would not have any money left to restart the business. We are nothing more than daily wage earners. If the situation prevails, we will face starvation. Now, we are totally dependent on the state governments ration and aids given by hawkers’ unions,” a hawker in Kolkata said.Ghosh claimed that the West Bengal government is yet to provide its 16 lakh hawker community with any direct financial support, whereas Odisha has offered Rs 3,000, while Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have given to these people Rs 1,000 each.Identifying hawkers would not pose a challenge if the government decides to offer financial support to them, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/5-cr-families-who-depend-on-roadside-vending-awaiting-financial-epidemic-nhf/story-UU341RRvwEVi9u2hztIb7H.html

16-04-2020||Chandigarh||At 6.98%, Punjab’s Covid death rate double the national average||The Covid-19 mortality rate --- the probability of dying if infected by the virus ---in Punjab is double the national average. With 13 deaths out of 186 positive cases, the state’s fatality rate stands at 6.98%. The national average is 3.28% (392 deaths out of 11,933 cases). The figures are based on the analysis of the statewide data available on the Union ministry of health and family welfare website (updated till 5pm on Wednesday). Also, Punjab has the highest death rate among the states (15) with more than 100 positive cases. Maharashtra is second, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi (see graphic). Punjab’s mortality rate figured in the video-conference of experts, including adviser on health issues and former PGIMER director Dr KK Talwar, and vice-chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Dr Raj Bahadur, on Wednesday. Soon after the conference, a team of experts was constituted to study the reason behind more deaths, it is learnt. “It’s a matter of concern. The high death rate could be because of late testing of the patients. It means that the patient was confirmed positive when the severity of the disease had already increased,” says Dr Raj Bahadur said. “Out of 13 patients who succumbed to the virus, four were declared positive after their death,” he added. “Figures reveal that aged population has been hit more by the virus in Punjab as compared to other states. This could be one of the reasons behind high mortality rate,” said a senior health department official, pleading anonymity. “Many patients who died due to the virus were affected by comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes,” he added. Officials said civil surgeons have been told to discuss serious cases with the newly-formed panel of experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-6-98-punjab-s-covid-death-rate-double-the-national-average/story-ICNoaZc6y7Wge26YEZ2gFK.html

16-04-2020||Chandigarh||IMTECH to carry out genome sequencing of SARS-Cov-2||Chandigarh-based CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH) has initiated whole genome sequencing of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) in order to understand its evolution and mutation pattern.Whole genome sequencing is used to determine the complete DNA/RNA sequence of an organism’s genome. IMTECH with other sister CSIR laboratories, with specialisation in genomics, medicine and cell biology, will carry out large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-Cov-2 strains across the length and breadth of the country.The institute will perform sequencing of the SARS-Cov-2 RNA genome isolated from the clinical samples it will receive as a testing facility. The testing facility at the institute was launched on April 3.Director Dr Sanjeev Khosla said, “We have already started clinical testing of samples and now by sequencing viral strains, we will be better equipped to understand the nature of the virus.”Portable, real-time and direct genome sequencing will be used to study the chemical modification in SARS-Cov-2 strains in India.Viruses have higher mutation rate than other microbes and their genetic material keeps on changing quickly as they replicate rapidly. Genome sequencing will give researchers an insight into the origin of the virus, the different strains circulating in India and how it spread across the length and breadth of our country. The genomic resource obtained from the sequencing will also allow identification of new targets for diagnosis of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/imtech-to-carry-out-genome-sequencing-of-sars-cov-2/story-cl9ek5plhZfBLthO3SDZWP.html

Why should one hesitate to help when the god has bestowed such a rare blessing?,” the trooper from Bihar’s Arwal district said.“It is the motto of my force to help and serve the people and that was all I did,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crpf-man-with-rare-blood-group-saves-elderly-s-life-in-jammu/story-vIvzqBypQyuyXbk4vLFscJ.html

16-04-2020||City||Migrant labourers camping in Haryana not keen to return to work||Hundreds of migrant labourers staying at relief camps are not interested in the state government’s offer to work and earn during the lockdown period as they want to go back to their homes. As per the reports collected from different districts, the local administrations have allowed them to work, but most of them are unforthcoming. Yamunanagar district has 2,300 such workers camping in shelter homes, but none of them agreed to return to work. “We offered them opportunity to work and earn during the lockdown period, but as of now, we have not got any positive response from them,” said an official of Yamunanagar administration. The labourers can opt to work, but they have to provide the details of their employers to the local administration and have to return to their base by the evening. In Panipat, of 700 migrant labourers staying in the camps for past two weeks, not a single labourer came forward. “They are not showing any interest and just want to go back to their homes. Let see if they come forward to work as the lockdown has been extended,” said Panipat deputy commissioner Hema Sharma. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav said, “We have 786 such workers in our camps, who are being given all facilities like food and shelter. Now, we have also allowed them to work if they want to earn as there is a huge demand of labourers during this harvesting season and we are waiting for their response.”However, out of 566 labourers staying in Kurukshetra district, few of them have expressed their interest in working. “We had asked them if they wanted to work, but only few from Shahbad approached the officials. We are working on it,” said Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Dheerender Kadgat. As per the information, total 15,200 migrant labourers had been staying in the temporary shelters homes set up in the state since last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-labourers-camping-in-haryana-not-keen-to-return-to-work/story-uAumWZazZiau66rJXLAkvK.html
16-04-2020||Mumbai||Migrants crowd at Bandra: 11, including journalist, arrested||Eleven people, including a journalist of a Marathi television news channel, were on Wednesday arrested for allegedly spreading rumours that the state was running a special train for migrant workers, which led to around 1,000 of them gathering at the Bandra railway station on Tuesday, defying the nationwide lockdown.The large gathering eventually forced the Mumbai Police to resort to lathi-charge to disperse the migrants — most of them from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal — who were demanding the state help them return home. This was hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the coronavirus-enforced nationwide lockdown to May 3. An FIR was registered on Tuesday against 700 people at Bandra police station, under which nine people were arrested, and another two FIRs were filed on Wednesday. Vijayalaxmi Hiremath, senior police inspector at Bandra police station, confirmed the arrests.On Wednesday, an FIR was filed against Vinay Dubey, a resident of Navi Mumbai, who uploaded a video on social media, telling migrant workers from north India to gather at Kurla Terminus on April 18 to demand that they be sent back to their homes. Dubey, booked under sections 117, 153(a), 188, 269, 270, 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, was detained from Navi Mumbai late on Tuesday. Another FIR was against Rahul Kulkarni, a journalist with ABP Majha, for allegedly running a report stating that a special train will run for migrant workers, said Bandra police officers. Kulkarni was arrested in the afternoon. “He will be produced in court tomorrow,” said Hiremath.ABP Majha, however, defended its journalist, saying its news reports were “entirely misconceived” and they were on the “basis of valid documents” . The channel said there was no conceivable way the crowds that gathered at Bandra can be linked to their stories.The channel, in a statement, said, “There are several reports purporting to draw a connection between the gathering at Mumbai’s Bandra West station and a news story run on ABP Majha. The reports are entirely misconceived and are being circulated with the sole intention of baselessly maligning ABP Majha. Our news story was broadcast in public interest and on the basis of valid documents and information. Subsequent to the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s announcement at 10 am of the continuation of the lockdown and announcements thereafter from the Ministry of Railways with regard to cancellation of trains and refunds till May 3, 2020, we ran multiple stories, starting from shortly after the Railway Ministry’s announcement starting from12:30 pm to 1.30 pm, on our channel clearly announcing that no trains will be running. There is no conceivable way in which the crowds that gathered at the Bandra West Station from around 3:45 pm can be linked to our stories. To insinuate that our running of the story and the updates thereafter amount to a criminal act is outrageous. We are shocked and dismayed that our reporter Mr. Rahul Kulkarni has been arrested in connection with the story. We will be taking necessary and immediate steps in law. We can say with full confidence that we have not deviated from practices of responsible journalism. Journalism and media are essential services. There is no denial of the Railway Ministry’s letter of 13.4.2020 recommending running of trains to return migrant labourers to their hometowns. We are a responsible and respectable channel running an essential service in providing information and news to society and community at large. We make every possible good faith endeavor to ensure the accuracy of our information and news from credible sources before broadcasting the same. Consequently, despite the morning news before the PM’s speech, shortly after the Railway Ministry announcement that no trains will run till 3rd May, 2020, we immediately started running the story on our channels as a responsible media institution. We would like to say that before journalists are arrested there should be due verification of all facts and circumstances.”Later in the day, nine people —Mohammad Amruddin, 35; Saif Hussein Shaikh, 36; Alam Mohammad Salim Shaikh, 28; Shamsher Ali Amir Ali Malik, 36; Helal Hakimuddin Ali, 32; Mohammad Shahid Ibrahim Shaikh, 29; Mohammad Arshad Mohammad Anvar Shaikh, 26; Altabash Chhotu Shaikh,28 and Firoz Sailchul Shaikh, 20 — were arrested from Shastri Nagar in Bandra (West). All the accused were arrested as per the FIR lodged on Tuesday.Kulkarni has been booked under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) 505 (b) (with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against the public tranquillity), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) 117 (abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons) of the IPC, along with section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act.Bandra police officers also revealed that they have narrowed down a list of other suspects responsible for the gathering. The police are questioning at least seven people from Bandra (West).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/migrants-crowd-at-bandra-11-including-journalist-arrested/story-KkXZac8HUN2PfPHj4f5WoI.html

16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Patiala woman gets 3-month bail in drugs case after she pleads for child’s safety amid Covid-19 pandemic||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday granted bail to a Patiala woman accused in a drug seizure case after she pleaded for her newborn’s safety amid the Covid-19 outbreak.The woman was given bail even as the Patiala civil surgeon had suggested that she be kept in a crèche with her newborn and two other women inmates. However, the court observed that the women inmates were not health experts and could not guarantee the petitioner’s safety amid the pandemic outbreak. It was on April 9 that the HC had sought an opinion from the civil surgeon on a place that would be safer for the newborn — the jail or her village.The bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan granted the woman three-month bail, while directing Patiala central jail superintendent to release her forthwith after obtaining an undertaking from one of her blood relatives that she would appear before the trial court within a period of 14 days to furnish bail bonds.The petitioner, who has been in judicial custody for more than eight months, gave birth on April 1 in a Patiala hospital. She was pregnant when the police had booked her on July 10, 2019, in Rajpura. Charges were framed against her on December 20, 2019.It was alleged that a police party had spotted her carrying a polythene bag which she threw into a canal upon seeing them. Later, the police had allegedly found 80 injections of buprenorphine and 80 injections of avil phineramine maleate in the bag.In her plea, she had argued that she had no previous history of involvement in any drug-related operations and had accused the cops of shoddy probe in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patiala-woman-gets-3-month-bail-in-drugs-case/story-UnSptPMjAQ0nkQhic2d19M.html

16-04-2020||Chandigarh||How ‘thikri pehras’ worked wonders in Jhajjar||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19), thus far, has spared the people of Haryana’s Jhajjar district. Even as the district shares its boundaries with Delhi and Gurugram, where the infection has been rising steadily, Jhajjar has remained safe from the threat of the virus at least during the first spell of the lockdown. So what may have helped in stopping the virus spread. “One of the reasons behind Jhajjar evading the virus is the age-old practice of ‘thikri pehra’ that the administration started soon after the initial cases of outbreak emerged in its neighbourhood,” said a Haryana government spokesperson. The government also appreciates the ‘discipline’ of people during the lockdown, coupled with effective arrangements made by the district administration. Even before the ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22, the ‘thikri pehra’ was in place in the district. “Thikri pehra and the efforts of local administration acted as a shield which prevented the spread of the pandemic in Jhajjar,” the spokesperson said. All grocery stores, vegetable shops, hawkers and milk distributors were identified and registered well in time, he said. Grocery and vegetable vendors of the entire district were classified into 306 groups and collective passes issued to them for their work-related movement. A survey of about 75,000 labourers and 6,500 brick kiln workers was also conducted by the district administration, which facilitated it to keep tabs on them. As many as 1,200 migrant workers, including children and women, have taken shelter in 24 relief camps in Jhajjar, Beri, Bahadurgarh and Badli. “All boundaries of Jhajjar district were sealed to prevent the movement of people and 75 nakas were put in the urban and rural areas,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/how-thikri-pehras-worked-wonders-in-jhajjar/story-E7mEjqdueUOqvy99XonsUK.html
16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Early identification, isolation key to containing Covid-19 cases in Haryana||It is the early identification and isolation of suspected Covid-19 persons as well as increased sampling that seems to be working for Haryana.Till Wednesday, 190 positive cases including two deaths were reported, while 43 patients recovered and were discharged in the state.This figure is besides the positive cases of 14 Italian tourists brought by the central government to a private hospital in Gurugram, 13 of whom had been cured and discharged, while one of them died of the disease.The challenge, but, has been humongous. It was on March 16 when Haryana’s first Covid-19 positive case was reported from Gurugram. In the next fortnight, this number climbed to 29 and all of them had a travel history to Covid-19 affected countries. On March 31 when the state government launched a massive exercise to identify persons with Tablighi Jamaat links and have quarantined about 1,600 of them in their respective areas, mainly in Nuh, Palwal, Gurugram and Faridabad. By April 13, the number of positive cases in the state was 182.From a few hundreds of persons under surveillance in the first few weeks in March, the government agencies now have over 15,000 under surveillance.Impetus on testingThe pointed approach to give a boost to the sampling of the suspected persons also increased rapidly. While only 817 samples had been taken before April 1, more than 3,600 samples have been taken since. While containment zones plan has already been put in place in Nuh, Palwal, Sonepat, Karnal, Faridabad, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Gurugram, Jind, Fatehabad, Panipat, Kaithal, Jhajjar, Panchkula and Sirsa, 11 full or partial Covid-19 hospitals or medical colleges have also been set up. The state has also declared Nuh, Faridabad, Gurugram and Palwal as red zones.In what was seen as a respite for Haryana, the number of positive cases has since recently shown a downward trend. The state had seen a spate of cases in recent days, especially last Sunday when as many as 16 new cases were reported in a day, 24 cases on April 8, 33 on April 7 and 20 on April 6. Most of these infected persons were linked to Tablighi Jamaat. They had either attended the event at Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month or were in contact with the attendees. Monday’s case was reported from Sirsa wherein a 33-year-old woman, who worked as a cook at a Rori village mosque.Tablighi linkOf all the 1,648 Tablighis, including 107 foreign nationals, who have so far been traced and whose samples have been tested, 121 have been found to be positive, while the result of 200 is awaited and remaining have been found to be negative. About 20 of Tablighi workers have, however, also been booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC for allegedly hiding travel history from local administration till April 8, the deadline given by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/early-identification-isolation-key-to-containing-covid-19-cases-in-haryana/story-MvmgXgcXCmReLsWJCJAhQM.html

Most of them indulge in name-calling and threats, so we have no other option but to leave them be. Even in these times, they are keeping their selfish interests on top,” said a senior police official, on the condition of anonymity.The police top brass have taken up the matter with the adviser and the administrator. On Wednesday alone, six persons were arrested for stepping out of their house and 347 were rounded up. Station house officers (SHOs) at police stations have been directed to click pictures of such VIPs violating curfew orders. However, the police officials have expressed inhibitions in going against senior bureaucrats and judges, who they claim can go use it against them, later. In a separate tweet from his official account, Parida mocked the VIPs by elaborating on the abbreviation as “Very Idiotic Person.”Apart from morning walkers, the police have also turned their attention toward people loitering about gated societies. On Tuesday, 356 people were rounded up for roaming inside societies and coming out for chats with neighbours. Similarly, a total of 120 people have been arrested for not wearing masks in 95 cases across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/names-of-vips-stepping-out-for-walk-to-be-published-ut-adviser/story-p3w3C7auWbCkZKu6eUTUGK.html

The state government is keen to start industrial activity to tide over the financial crunch due to dwindling revenue receipts affecting day-to-day governance and forcing it to look for borrowing options. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday said due to a shortfall in tax collections, the state government will have to make arrangements to raise ₹4,600 crore in April to meet their committed expenditure of ₹6,200 crore — including salaries, pensions, social security pensions, power subsidy and debt servicing. Centre classifies Haryana’s safe zonesThe central government on Wednesday designated the safe and unsafe zones based on the number of Covid-19 cases. The Centre has classified areas reporting large outbreaks (about 80%) as hotspots (red zones), non-hotspots, where cases are reported in lesser number (orange zones), and districts which did not report positive cases (green zones). A red district can be moved to green category if there is no new case in 28 days. Also, a red district can be moved to the orange zone if no case is reported for 14 days, officials said.Nuh, Palwal, Gurugram and Faridabad districts, the four hotspot districts in the NCR, where 80% active coronavirus cases were detected, have been marked in the red zone. Ambala and Karnal have been classified as hotspot districts with clusters on the basis of number of cases being reported. Panchkula, Panipat, Sirsa, Sonepat, Bhiwani, Kaithal, Charkhi Dadri, Fatehabad, Hisar, Jind, Rohtak, Yamunanagar and Kurukshetra have been categorised as non-hotspot districts. Only Rewari, Mahendergarh and Jhajjar districts are in the green category, officials said. Officials said they were in the process of delineating areas declared safe for economic activity as per the Central government’s directive.State also did preliminary classificationBased on the number of confirmed cases and those under surveillance, the state government had done a preliminary exercise to categorise 69 towns and blocks as red zones, 50 as orange zones and 66 as green zones. “It was a preparatory exercise before the central government issued the criteria. However, we will go with what the Centre has prescribed,” said an official. “The state government is allowed to resume industries in rural areas outside the municipal limits, open manufacturing and industrial establishments with access control in special economic zones and export-oriented units, food processing industries in rural areas, production units, which require continuous process and their supply chain, industrial estates and industrial townships. These establishments will make arrangements for the stay of workers within their premises or adjacent buildings and implement standard operating protocol for safety, said an industry department official. The transportation of workers to workplace will also be arranged by the employers while ensuring social distancing, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-sets-the-ball-rolling-for-industrial-activity-in-safe-zones/story-i4LTlbVb4fcsREcQ3prdeK.html

16-04-2020||City||Conditional relaxations from April 20 hinge on micro data in Delhi||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said the relaxation of the certain restrictions in Delhi will depend on the “sources of the virus” and locality specific Covid-19 data, hours after the Union government issued detailed guidelines that allowed certain commercial activities to resume from April 20 in areas that are not disease hot spots.The 21-day national lockdown to contain the spread of the pathogen, imposed on March 25 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was on Tuesday extended till May 3.“We are keeping an eye on the sources of the virus in Delhi. It (the resumption of permitted commercial activities) will depend on the data of the next few days,” Sisodia told HT.Delhi had 17 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday and two deaths related to the virus. The state administration has designated 56 “containment zones” in the city where the curbs are stricter, and which are unlikely to get any relaxations as long as they retain that status.Taking the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) as a reference document, several senior officials in the Delhi government said on condition of anonymity that “conditional relaxations” could be provided “in a phased manner” from April 20 to IT companies, industrial estates such as the ones in Narela and Bawana, construction activities in projects which accommodate labour in the work sites, and self-employed service providers such as plumbers and electricians.“We will come out with detailed order for Delhi before April 20 in compliance with the MHA orders,” Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev said. On Wednesday, Dev held a review meeting in which he asked all the 11 district magistrates (DMs) to submit reports on their respective areas based on which a further decision could be taken. During the meeting, the chief secretary is learnt to have emphasised on point 21 of the Union home ministry’s guidelines, which said: “Additional activities permitted in these guidelines shall be implemented in a phased manner, after making all arrangements necessary for strict implementation of the guidelines. This will come into force with effect from 20th April 2020.”The “additional activities”, said one of the DMs who was part of the meeting, appear to be commercial activities in the industrial areas where the employer provides accommodation for the employees while maintaining social distancing and safety standards; manufacturing units of information technology hardware; packaging materials; and the production and supply of goods that demand continuous processing.“The period beyond April 20 can also witness relaxation of staggered timings in grocery shops and a stretch in the functional hours for shops dealing with essentials goods and services in the localities, provided social distancing norms are maintained and the transmission of the virus is under control in those localities,” said a government official who did not wish to be identified.What are the staggered timing rules?As per the Union government’s guidelines, hospitals, clinics, veterinary hospitals, and pharmacies will continue to functioning. On Wednesday, the Delhi government also tied up with a mobile application through which residents can consult doctors for free from their homes.“We are glad to collaborate with the CallDoc application to bring a 24x7 online medical consultation facility for free to the people of Delhi. This will save them the trouble of physical travel for regular OPD visits. More than 100 qualified medical professionals are part of the initiative,” said Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain.Schools, colleges and coaching centres will remain closed and institutes will depend exclusively on online teaching programmes. Agricultural markets will operate but from the new locations where several of them have been moved in the past week, and they have to follow staggered timings. “Relaxations with regard to staggering timings in the mandis can be difficult keeping in view the footfall they witness on a daily basis,” said a district official.There will be no public transport till May 3, including metro rail, taxis, auto-rickshaws, and e-rickshaws.But goods transport will remain operational and some highway eateries will be allowed to function after April 20 for the convenience of truckers .Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital said: “Phased relaxation is a good strategy to ensure that people get used to the norms of social distancing and normalcy that follow the lockdown. Wuhan (in China) had experimented with this model and, so far, it has apparently worked well. Also, it is crucial for people to remember what they have learnt in the first phase of the lockdown and implement such discipline after the lockdown is lifted. That would contribute in containing a possible outbreak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/conditional-relaxations-from-april-20-hinge-on-micro-data-in-delhi/story-LsC7GC72uimt6Us6kAgscL.html
16-04-2020||Noida||Covid-19 hotspots down to 27 from 29 in Gautam Buddh Nagar||The total number of Covid-19 hot spots in Gautam Budh Nagar came down to 27 from 29 on Wednesday after two complete and two partial areas were removed from the list by the district administration. While two localities, Sector 41 and Lotus Espacia in Sector 100, have been completely rid of hot spot tag, parts of sectors 30 and 78 have also been removed.A 26-year-old man, who had returned from Indonesia, was found positive for coronavirus in Sector 41 and a 22-year-old medical student from France, who is a native of Jharkhand, was found positive in Sector 100 of Noida. Both the patients have been discharged from the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, officials said.According to the officials, the removed sectors have completed 28 days as per the protocol and no new case has been reported there since then. “These areas have been removed from the list of hotspots because no new case has been reported in the past 28 days from the date of sampling,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.The DM also said that the clampdown in areas where there are no residents’ welfare associations will become stricter with only required essential services being allowed. These areas include JJ Colony in sectors 5 and 8, and villages Patwari, Ghodi Bichola, Chaura Sadatpur, Kulsera, Vishnoli and Wazidpur. The officials are surveying these areas to avoid community spread of the deadly disease. Around 586 people from various areas of the district are under quarantine at the government centres, the officials said.“In these areas, it is difficult to maintain social distancing due to high density of population. The clampdown is going to become much stricter as part of the cluster containment procedure. Only essential services will be allowed in these areas. Strict action will be taken against people do not follow the lockdown norms as per the orders of the government,” said the DM.There are 413 cluster containment teams in the district who have visited 310,540 houses, while 991,839 persons have been screened so far.By Wednesday night, the health department have put 1,369 people under surveillance. A total of 1,595 samples have been collected, including 157 taken and on Wednesday. The district has recorded a total of 80 Covid-19 cases, while 25 patients have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/hot-spots-down-to-27-from-29-in-gb-nagar/story-pVrXXtLezgCLB6MmGKefEJ.html
16-04-2020||Noida||UP-Rera gives more time to realtors to finish stuck projects||The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera)has decided to postpone hearings of complaints till the nationwide lockdown ends and also to extend validity of registration of housing and other projects till December 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the UP-Rera has not cancelled the coercive orders issued against builders in the past.Noida builders had urged UP-Rera to issue a notification postponing the implementation of old orders, including those related to compliance and registrations of housing projects.UP-Rera members took meetings via video conferencing on Monday and Tuesday to decide on builders’ demands for exemptions in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Developers welcomed the order extending registration of projects and postponing cases pending against developers till the end of the lockdown period.“We are happy that UP-Rera has allowed the extension of registration of projects and also given additional time for completion of projects. But it is yet to cancel the coercive orders issued in the past. We will communicate this matter again because due to a liquidity crisis, developers cannot honour refund orders during this time of crisis when everything is shut,” RK Arora, president, Uttar Pradesh chapter of National Real Estate Development council (NAREDCO), a builders’ group. Developers had sought relief after the government on March 22 shut construction to contain spread of Covid-19.“The authority has decided to extend by three months the date of completion of projects with earlier had a date of completion between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2020. The revised registration certificate of such projects will be issued separately and send to the promoters concerned. It also decided to defer the hearings of all complaints listed till May 3, 2020, to suitably date to be communicated to the parties later on. It will conduct hearings of complaints through video conferencing after May 3 or whenever the lockdown conditions are relaxed. We will keep addressing other issues via video conferencing ahead,” Abrar Ahmed, secretary, UP-Rera, said.Developers in Noida and Greater Noida Wednesday said they will not be able to resume construction at their respective housing projects because the government is yet to allow operations of manufacturing units, which fall in the municipal limits. The government of India has allowed construction work to resume if the daily wage earners are staying at the site itself and also maintaining social distancing.“The government is yet to order that manufacturing units, which make construction-related material such as plywood, dust, steel and cement, located in rural areas, become operational. Therefore, developers cannot get required material to resume construction. For example, a company that makes plywood in Noida is not allowed to operate as it is located in a municipal area. Also, the staff required to monitor construction, who do not stay at site, cannot visit the site. So construction cannot resume in the given conditions,” Arora said. Experts said resuming construction in non-hot spot zones with restrictions will not help much.“The move to start at least some of the construction activity on project sites, even with a limited workforce, is certainly welcome. That said, since many migrant workers had left for their villages after the lockdown announcement, we will have to wait and see how many are actually left to resume work. Migrant workers comprise at least 80% of the total 44 million workforce in the construction sector. As far as construction activity in non-hot spots is concerned, developers will need to focus on resuming construction on projects that are already nearing completion and have a completion deadline within 2020,” Anuj Puri, chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-rera-gives-more-time-to-realtors-to-finish-stuck-projects/story-epRVDbSyV1dBrGVuVtta7O.html
16-04-2020||Noida||Won’t be able to pay April’s salary to workers, apparel industries tell GB Nagar officials||The garment manufacturing and exporting companies in Gautam Budh Nagar district have informed the district administration and the state government that due to absolute paucity of funds, they will not be able pay salaries to their workers for the month of April. Their decision is likely to impact at least 10 lakh workers -- both skilled and semi-skilled.Lalit Thukral, the president of Noida Apparel Exports Cluster (NAEC), said the apparel and textile industry in the district, like in other places, is already plagued by the global crisis caused by Covid-19 outbreak. “The recent advisory of the government that wages must be paid by employers even during the lockdown period will push the apparel industry deeper into the crisis. The garment exporters somehow managed to pay full wages in March, but we can’t afford to pay the wages for the month of April. It is the high time that the government came up with a special relief package for this industry,” he said.About the arrangement of wages to workers, the NAEC president said instead of pressuring the exporters, the government should look to other ways of making their payments regularly. “The apparel industry of Noida alone deposits around ₹10 crore per month in the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI). Since it is a self-financing social security and health insurance scheme for Indian workers, and the fund there is managed by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation, according to rules and regulations stipulated in the ESI Act, 1948, the government must order this organisation, to make regular monthly payments to workers associated with the apparel and textile industry,” he said.Stating that in Noida region, around 10 lakh people are getting employment through the apparel sector --- the region exports garments worth over ₹18,000 crore annually -- Thukral further said this lockdown has affected around 3,000 export units in the district. “Under the export sector, there are only two peak seasons for manufacturing. The apparels made in October to December are exported in February and March for the summer season. Due to outbreak of the Covid-19, most of the export orders have either been cancelled or put on hold, besides the consignments already shipped have also been stuck. Even the apparel manufactured against the order are also lying in the factories because of the ban on movement/transport. The situation has become grave as we have yet not got any receipt of payment from the buyers,” he said.Alleging that the government has yet not announced any relief or scheme for the apparel sector, another apparel exporter Roshan Vaid said in other leading apparel exporting countries such as Bangladesh and Thailand, the government has undertaken unprecedented steps to rescue their industries. “But in India, nothing tangible has taken place so far. Banks are not ready to extend credit due to cancellation of orders, which has also put the apparel exporters in peril. The government must come up with some scheme to save this industry,” he said.District magistrate Suhas LY, who attended a meeting with industrialists from different sectors on Monday, to discuss problems faced during the lockdown, said around 90% of the industries have been closed in the district. “They have apprised me of their problems. A detailed report will soon be sent to government. I hope that very soon, we will have some concrete solutions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/won-t-be-able-to-pay-april-s-salary-to-workers-apparel-industries-tell-gb-nagar-officials/story-hZ7xPknUoyctpnCFeKz4WP.html
16-04-2020||Noida||Covid effect: Man coughs while playing ludo, shot at by neighbour||Amid growing fears over the spread of Covid-19, a 27-year-old man was allegedly shot at by a neighbour after he coughed while playing ludo with his friends at Daya Nagar village in Jarcha, Greater Noida, on Tuesday night. The victim, Prashant, received a bullet injury in his right thigh and was admitted to Kailash Hospital Greater Noida, the police said. The suspect, Jaiveer alias Gullu, who allegedly fired at the victim after an argument triggered by his coughing, managed to escape after the incident, which took place at 10pm, they said, adding that Prashant’s friends escaped narrowly during the firing.Prashant said that the incident took place when he was playing ludo with his three friends at a neighbouring temple.“We were playing ludo when my neighbour Gullu reached the spot. He was watching us . Suddenly I coughed and this irked Gullu. He said that I had coughed at him deliberately and that I was spreading coronavirus. I pleaded that the coughing was spontaneous, but he did not listen to me. He took out a countrymade gun and opened fire. I received a bullet injury in my thigh and collapsed on the ground,” the victim said. Prashant’s father Karan Singh filed a complaint against Gullu and his two brothers Manveer and Bhoora. However, the police said that the suspect’s brothers were not present at the spot at the time of firing, and they are investigating the matter from all angles.Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said a team from Jarcha police station reached the spot after receiving a call about the incident. “The victim was admitted to Kailash Hospital Greater Noida. The police have registered a case of attempt to murder under Section 307 of IPC against the suspect and launched a search operation for his arrest,” Singh said.

He is responding to the medical treatment and he is out of danger. We are stabilizing his blood pressure and then we will conduct the operation and remove the bullet from his body,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-effect-man-coughs-while-playing-ludo-shot-at/story-ncNsWPWSZyxQrcJUK6z5pJ.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||Man booked for tearing ‘do not visit’ tag pasted by MCG outside his house||A New Colony resident was booked on Tuesday for allegedly tearing the ‘do not visit home’ tag pasted by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) outside his house at Ram Nagar. The police said the man and his family were recently quarantined in the house after one of the family members was suspected to have the Sars-Cov-2. According to the police, the family was asked to remain quarantined inside their home from April 7 to April 21. The authorities took step after one of the family members had recently visited a private hospital in Gurugram where a Covid-19 patient was being treated. The man and his family members were quarantined as a precautionary measure. In the police complaint, Rajesh Kumar, head constable (HC), alleged that on Tuesday he received a tip-off that the man had allegedly torn the tag put up by the authorities outside his house. “When I reached the spot, I saw that the tag was torn and some pieces of it were still stuck to the wall. I clicked a picture of the tag and sent it to the officials and concerned authorities,” he added. The police said that when officials questioned the family members, they were informed that the man had gone somewhere after the incident and was not at home.A police officer privy to the investigation said, “The man is yet to be arrested. We are investigating the matter.”A case was registered under sections 188, 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act at New Colony police station on Tuesday.In another incident, a Gurugram-based businessman was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly spreading rumours on Coronavirus on social media at Om Nagar in Sector 11. The police said that he had allegedly recorded a video of a man, purportedly suffering from a mental illness, and posted it online, claiming that he was a Covid-19 patient.According to the police, the arrested man was identified as one Anup Singh, a resident of Om Nagar. He was arrested from his house.According to the police, on Tuesday, officials received information that a man, purportedly suffering from a mental illness, had reached the area from Jaipur. The residents then called for an ambulance and the man was taken to a shelter home in Gurugram. Meanwhile, Singh allegedly recorded the whole incident on his mobile phone and posted it online, claiming that a “Coronavirus patient in his area was taken to a hospital”.Balraj, assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Shivaji Nagar police station, said: “The man who was taken to the shelter home was not a Covid-19 patient. He was suffering from a mental illness. We arrested Singh immediately when we got to know about the rumour.”In a similar incident, an unidentified man was booked for spreading rumours by sending text messages on an instant messaging application in Aliyar village, IMT Manesar, on Tuesday. The police said the suspect allegedly wrote that he and his friends would get together and stage a protest in the village amid the lockdown as he was not being allowed to return to his hometown.

16-04-2020||Gurugram||Hero Honda Chowk flyover reopened||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) opened the Jaipur-Delhi carriageway of the Hero Honda Chowk Flyover on Wednesday evening, five months after it was closed for repair. A deck slab had fallen off the flyover in both 2018 and 2019. Rakesh Mathur, deputy manager of Valecha Engineering Limited, the contractor for the project, said, “We were told by the NHAI to open the flyover by April 15 and we have done so. The jersey barriers were removed.” On October 31 last year, the traffic police had closed the road from Subhash Chowk towards Sector 10, above the underpass, and from Sector 10 towards Subhash Chowk. Officer Azad Singh of Traffic Police Station-1, said, “With the opening of the flyover, all curbs below the flyover will be removed in the next few days. The right turn above the underpass which allows commuters to drive towards Delhi will also become operational soon.”The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) had put new traffic lights at the Hero Honda Chowk in February in a bid to ease vehicular flow at the junction. The traffic signals have not been used since they were installed. “Now the flyover has become operational, we will request GMDA to start operating the traffic lights below the Hero Honda Chowk flyover so that there is no traffic congestion,” Mathur added. Two U-turns that were closed for commuters when the repair works started in October will be made operational again, the Gurugram traffic police said. The two U-turns were constructed for commuters travelling from Gurugram to Manesar and from Manesar to Gurugram. They were built to ease traffic congestion at Hero Honda Chowk. “The two U-turns will be made operational so that trucks and other vehicles can easily take a U-turn below the flyover. These U-turns will ease vehicular movement near the Kherki-Daula toll plaza as many motorists have to go till the toll plaza to take a U-turn,” Singh added. Hero Honda Chowk is the only flyover which has four U-turns, of which only one was operational when the flyover was being repaired. The NHAI had asked its contractor to make two U-turns operational for trucks to move underneath the flyover last year. “The first U-turn (Delhi-Jaipur) is closed. When it was being made, the contractor realised that trucks might collide with the flyover’s ceiling as it was then 100m high. So, a new U-turn was made (which is functional at this junction) on the Delhi-Jaipur side,” an official of the Valecha Engineering Ltd (the NHAI’s contractor) said on condition of anonymity. The third U-turn was made for commuters to take a turn from the Jaipur-Delhi side. Few metres away is another U-turn meant only for cars, which has also been barricaded. “There are four U-turns and now, with the opening of the flyover two U-turns, the roads on both Jaipur-Delhi side and Delhi-Jaipur side will be operational,” Mathur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hero-honda-chowk-flyover-reopened/story-78MqK2bFko9m5Mb0n5NllN.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram likely to get relaxation in economic activities after April 20||Despite the possibility that Gurugram may be labelled a ‘red zone’, the administration on Wednesday said the district may get relaxations in resuming certain economic activities from April 20, after the Union ministry of home affairs issued guidelines concerning the same on Wednesday.“It is likely Gurugram will be notified under the red zone, being a Covid-19 hotspot. But considering the plateau in the number of cases and recovery rates of patients, it is likely that certain areas of Gurugram and industrial units will get relaxation. We are already running essential industries, and exemptions may be given to others. The clarity can be given only on April 19,” said VS Kundu, CEO of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), also the monitoring officer for Covid-19 in Gurugram. On Wednesday, the cabinet secretary held a high-level review meeting with all chief secretaries, deputy commissioners, municipal commissioners across the country. Kundu, who was a part of the meeting said, “Before April 20, districts will be placed under three zones — red, orange and green — based on which they will get exemptions in operating industries. These districts will be reviewed every week. It will be a dynamic process managing different zones. ”The districts, as per the revised guideline by the Union ministry of home affairs, can give exemption to industries and manufacturing units in Special Economic Zones and Export Oriented Units. However, they will have to make arrangements for workers to stay within their premises or an adjacent building. The transportation of workers to their workplaces will also be arranged by the employers, ensuring social distancing. Construction work can also start on project sites. Realtors in Gurugram said that given the low spread of the coronavirus in the city, they should also be given the opportunity to start construction work at their projects as the labour forces have been living on the sites and being given provisions, since the lockdown began.As per a survey conducted by the town and country planning department, there are at least 21,000 construction workers spread across 85 project sites. The department had mandated the developers to take care of these workers so that they don’t leave the city. A large number of construction workers are also staying outside the project sites, in nearby villages. STATE’S PLANEarlier this week, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had said that to restart industrial activities amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown, the government will divide the state into three zones, and that it was not possible for the country to continue under the present circumstances of the lockdown.“We are aware the micro, small and medium enterprises are the backbone of the economy, as they also hire the most daily wage and migrant workers. An exit strategy for such operations is in the works, but industry owners need to be prepared for the fact that social distancing is here to stay,” Kundu said in a session of HT Dialogues on Tuesday.He said shop floors will need to be reconfigured to ensure a social distance between workers, who will have to be tested and screened for symptoms on a daily basis. Industries will have to submit their own sanitisation plans for review before they are allowed to resume operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-likely-to-get-relaxation-in-economic-activities-after-april-20/story-tPJuIsdo6d7OJVjzRTRQKL.html
16-04-2020||Gurugram||Containment zones reduced to 6 in Ggm, more police deployment on district borders||A day after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to extend the lockdown till May 3, the Gurugram police on Wednesday increased the deployment of security personnel on borders with Nuh and Faridabad, as well as outside the six containment zones in the district to keep a check on the non-essential movement of people from areas with Covid-19 cases.On Wednesday, the number of containment zones in the Gurugram district was reduced from nine to six.The new strategy can help prevent the transmission of the coronavirus disease to the other parts of the city, said police commissioner Muhammad Akil.Areas that will now be under containment zones are Devi Lal Colony, Sun City (Sector 54), Sector 39, Fazilpur Jharsa village, Pataudi ward number 11, and Raipur village in Sohna, said an order issued by the deputy commissioner on Wednesday. Areas such as Nirvana Country, Sector 9, Palam Vihar, Emar Palm Gardens (Sector 83) and Laburnum Society have been rid of the containment tag, the order said, adding that the decision was taken “upon the recommendation” of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) Committee.The deputy commissioner, in his order, also said that the Containment Review Committee has been constituted for “combating the situation”.According to the previous order (issued on April 10) on containment zones, much wider areas were made Covid-19 hot spots, such as Sector 54 instead of Sun City, and Sector 9 in lieu of Devi Lal Colony. However, the Wednesday’s order has narrowed down these areas. The police said borders connecting to Nuh are most sensitive zones due to 45 positive cases reported from that district only. Besides, the security has been increased along intra-city borders with Pataudi and Sohna from where 15 Covid-19 cases have been reported, the police said. Gurugram has reported 32 positive cases so far and 16 of them have recovered. Around 400 more home guards and special police officers (SPOs) have been deployed in nine containment zones, the police said. Earlier, about 4,800 police personnel were deployed across the city, including 11 borders connecting to Delhi. An area spread over five kilometres is cordoned off in the identified containment zone and an additional area of three kilometres is earmarked as a buffer zone as a precautionary measure, said the police.Akil said strict action will be taken against people misusing passes and crossing police pickets without any valid reason.He said that the police have set up 15 more police pickets, adding to 64 which were set up outside containment zones where a total of 1,742 personnel are deployed. “We have increased deployment in residential areas also as many people are stepping out without wearing masks and are making excuses of buying essential items from nearby markets,” he said.The police said they have advised all the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to ask residents not to step out of their apartment or houses without masks and to maintain social distancing. “All morning and evening walks are prohibited as people had started moving out in groups,” Akil said.After the extension of lockdown, the police changed the locations of the police post and pickets across the city. “I had called a meeting of all 41 station house officers to discuss the new plan of action and to ensure no one enters the city from these areas unless for any medical emergency,” said Akil.The Gurugram police have a total of 6,500 police personnel and around 2,500 home guards and SPOs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/containment-zones-reduced-to-6-in-ggm-more-police-deployment-on-district-borders/story-30v1gJiLcvn4qgXN5qVIeP.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||700 migrant workers gather on Yamuna floodplains, Delhi govt to provide shelter||With no place else to go to, nearly 700 migrant workers and daily wager earners gathered on the Yamuna floodplains in search shelter on Wednesday afternoon. With the summer temperature slowly rising, migrants took refuge under a bridge on the banks of the river at Yamuna Pushta in Kashmere Gate. The large gathering were a repeat of scenes witnessed in Bandra, Mumbai, on Tuesday and gave rise to fears of the Covid-19 virus spreading. The government and police sprung into action after images of the gathering made it to the social media, and mobilised buses to move them to temporary shelters set up in different schools.According to officials of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), the nodal agency for arranging shelter for the homeless in the city, many of them live near the floodplains while many others had arrived there after the central government on Tuesday extended the nationwide lockdown till May 3. “Around 650 to 700 people had taken shelter under the bridge. At least 250 of them are those who live near the floodplain itself. They go to government facilities for food and then return to the floodplains. The others had reached there after the lockdown was extended. They were looking for shelter as the days have become hotter,” Bipin Rai, member, DUSIB, said. He said all of them were taken to different shelters in Rohini, Savda Ghevra and Ghazipur, among others. “The schools still have the capacity to house more people and there are arrangements there for food and medicines as well. On Tuesday, too, about 300 to 350 people had gathered on the Yamuna banks. We are working to shift these people to proper facilities so that they don’t leave the city,” Rai said. The agencies swung into action after a media person posted a tweet of the workers gathered on the Yamuna floodplains. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also tweeted, “Migrant workers have gathered at the Yamuna floodplains. We have made arrangements for their food and shelter. Also, instructions have been given to shift them immediately. …There is no shortage of food or shelter. If anyone comes across people who are homeless or hungry, please do inform us.” Meanwhile, a senior police officer, not wishing to be named, said the homeless people from Kashmere Gate and Chandni Chowk area were being shifted to night shelters across the city on Wednesday evening. “Police assisted the state administration in the process. There was no movement of any migrant labourers,” the officer claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nearly-700-migrant-workers-gather-on-yamuna-floodplains-looking-for-shelter-tweet-prompts-govt-to-act/story-Zr40ccngOxP4A7iGUslBeM.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||State, central govts come down on schools, colleges flouting fee norms during lockdown||The Delhi government has taken a strong view against private schools in the city hiking fees without permission and violating provisions of the Disaster Management Act presently enforced in the city in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. The Directorate of Education (DoE) last week issued an order to a south Delhi private school over the matter.The move came even as the higher education sector regulator the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) informed colleges under its purview not to pressure students into paying fees till the lockdown continues.In an order issued on Wednesday, AICTE Member Rajive Kumar said that it had come to the notice of the regulator that some institutions were insisting that students should pay the fees including admission fees.Significantly, the Union ministry of human resource development has received a series of requests and demands from different quarters to address the issue of institutions demanding fees both in school and higher education sector.Parents of students enrolled in private schools across the city have complained of fees being hiked and institutions also quarterly fees instead of monthly, pulling on their already tight purse strings amid the lockdown. Many parents have asked the DoE to intervene.In an order issued to the south Delhi school on April 11, the DoE said, “It has been brought to our notice that Apeejay School, Saket, a private unaided school has increased the fee illegally without taking cognisance of the prevailing situation in view of the announcement of lockdown by the central government and despite the enforcement of Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Delhi Epidemic Diseases, COVID-19 regulations, 2020, under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897, for prevention and containment of COVID-19 and also without compliance of the mandatory provisions of Delhi Education Act, 1973.”DoE director Binay Bhushan said the order was issued after the body received multiple complaints against the school. Parents of students in Apeejay School alleged that the school had hiked the fees by 15-20% in April this year. “The school is constantly calling us and pressuring us to submit the hiked fees. Many of us are not in a position to pay even the normal fee amid the lockdown,” said a parent who is member of Naya Samaj Parents Association of the School, the school’s official parents’ body. The DoE also ordered the school to not increase any fee or compel students to pay increased fees or arrears till further orders. “The school shall, in no case, deny access to online education to students who are unable to pay the fee due to financial crises out of the closure of business activities in the ongoing lockdown condition,” the order stated, adding, that the failure to comply with the instruction can also invite action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. School principal Smita Amit refused to comment on the matter. However, in a e-mail statement sent to Hindustan Times, school authorities said “It’s working in compliance of the order issued by the DoE.”Parents whose children are enrolled in Adarsh Public School in Vikaspuri and Guru Harkrishan Public School in Kailash Colony also alleged that the schools have increased the fee by 10% without taking prior approval from the DoE. The mother of a class 6 student at Adarsh School said, “The school has increased the fee by 10%. We have no idea why the fee was revised when the government has ordered against it.”Pooja Sehgal, principal of the school, said they had sent a letter to the DoE for approval for the fee hike “We have not revised the fee structure in the last four years, which is why the revision was needed,” she said. Officials in the DoE, however, said they have not yet granted permission to the school. The principal of Guru Harkrishan Public School, Gurpreet Singh, however, said that while the school management had decided to increase the fee by 10%, it is yet to implement the decision. “Immediately after the decision was taken, the lockdown was announced. The parents were informed about it but we are not yet charging the revised fee,” she said.Advocate Khagesh Jha of Social Jurist, an NGO, said the Delhi government should issue an order to all schools asking them not to hike fees, and avoid action against students unable to pay the prevailing fees in the current situation.“Instead of waiting for individual complaints, the DoE should immediately direct all schools against harassing the parents in the time of the pandemic. We have also sent multiple complaints of fee hike by schools to the DoE. They should also issue a helpline for such complaint in the time of the lockdown,” he said.The AICTE also said it had been made aware that some institutions had either terminated staff members or had not paid their faculty.“It is clarified that salary and other dues to the faculty/staff members will be released for the duration of lockdown and terminations, if any, made during the lockdown will be withdrawn,” the AICTE communiqué said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/state-central-govts-come-down-on-schools-colleges-flouting-fee-norms-during-lockdown/story-LCP4SLmLyKKaB1YkrXVbUN.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat chief charged with culpable homicide||The Delhi Police crime branch has added the Indian Penal Code’s (IPC) stringent Section 304 to the list of laws used against Maulana Saad, booking the head of the Tablighi Jamaat for “culpable homicide not amounting to murder” in connection with the coronavirus disease outbreak at the Muslim missionary group’s headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti, which has emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hot spot in India.The police filed a criminal case against Saad and six other top officials on March 31 for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings, issued to contain the spread of the disease in the capital. Of the 1,578 cases reported in the city till Wednesday, 1,080 were linked to gatherings at the Jamaat’s Markaz building in Nizamuddin in mid-March. Senior police officers said they will soon summon Saad because his 14-day period of self-quarantine (for being in contact with people who later tested positive) is over. The Tablighi Jamaat management said earlier this month that Saad was in isolation on his doctor’s advice. A senior police officer said that the first information report (FIR), filed on March 31, was first registered under sections of Disaster Management Act and the sections of the IPC including criminal conspiracy (120 B), a negligent act likely to spread disease (269), malignant act likely to spread infection (270), disobedience of quarantine rule (271) and defying prohibitory orders (188). The maximum punishment, if convicted, under those sections is a two-year prison term with a fine or both. “Section 304 has now been added against Saad,” the officer said. The maximum punishment under this law is a 10-year prison term. Last month, police officers and state government officials evacuated more than 2,300 people from inside the Markaz building, where they had gathered for a religious congregation of indeterminate length. The meetings continued despite orders by the Delhi government banning all religious events (March 13), restricting gatherings to 200 people (March 16), and then putting a five-person limit on March 21 on all gatherings.The gathering inside the Markaz — where people from several other countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Kyrgyzstan were also present — has been linked to at least 1,445 infections, spread across 17 states, including Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, Telangana, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.Explaining why the police added the stringent section, a mid-level officer said the Tablighi Jamaat management had defied the police’s order urging them not to gather inside the Markaz. “There is an audio clip, in which Saad is heard telling his followers that the Covid-19 scare is a conspiracy. This audio tape is also mentioned in the FIR. He knew about the consequences of the disease but ignored it deliberately. Police had informed him before the lockdown to disperse the gathering but despite that they continued to live in the building. We also have a video recording of the local police telling the management to disperse the gathering but despite that the thousands of persons continued to stay inside. They had to be evacuated by police and government.” “His 14-day quarantine period is over. He was not there during the evacuation process. His interrogation is important to get more details about the gathering. Our officers are in touch with the Tablighi Jamaat management. We are yet to get a nod from our seniors on summoning him to join the investigation,” said a second senior officer familiar with the investigation who asked not to be named. Advocate LN Rao, who worked with the Delhi Police for over three decades till he retired in 2014, said that the police are within their rights to add another section to an existing FIR. “Across the world, people were dying of Covid-19. The government had issued the directions to stop such deaths and the spread of the disease. Despite knowing this, if the head of the Tablighi Jamaat continued with the gathering knowing fully well that it could result in deaths, then using Section 304 is a sound thing to do for an investigator. Police will now have to find evidence suggesting that the Maulana knew his action was likely to kill someone. Police are legally allowed to add the section and prima facie, it may seem to be the right thing to do. But if they are unable to find evidence against Saad under 304 then the court will not allow trial to proceed under that section. In some cases, police also do not file a charge sheet under that section, if they know that it will not pass the court’s scrutiny.” A third officer aware of the matter said that the police know about Saad’s whereabouts and will ensure that he does not leave the city, which is in any case under a lockdown.“The crime branch has seized the computers and attendance registers from inside the Markaz, where the details of all the visitors and the gathering were noted. In reply to the questionnaire, they have also sent us some documents. The investigating officer will quiz Saad about the records,” the third officer said on condition of anonymity. On the police’s move to add the stringent section to the FIR against Saad, his counsel, Fuzail Ayyubi, said, “ We have only heard from the media about the case update and the summoning of 18 persons. We won’t comment until police inform us about it.”Earlier this month, police sent two questionnaires to Saad with 29 questions related to the Tablighi Jamaat and the gatherings between March 10 and 15. In the first notice, which had 26 questions, sent on April 1, the investigating officer sought details of CCTV cameras inside the building and asked Saad to preserve the footage. The police asked for details of all people, including foreigners, present in the building last month. There was also a question about the steps taken by the management to disperse the gathering after the government’s prohibitory orders were issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tablighi-jamaat-chief-charged-with-culpable-homicide/story-XIJHvzhoHkN5yBSwjBSLjJ.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||Govt agencies gear up to restart construction work in Delhi||Construction work on several major infrastructure projects in the capital may resume next week, after the Centre on Wednesday granted conditional approval for such activity in areas where there were no coronavirus disease (Covid-19) containment zones and if labourers were available on-site.The decision to allow “in-situ” construction (where the workers stay on the premises) has come as a relief to several Delhi government agencies because several infrastructure projects have been stuck since last November, when construction activity was banned due to high air pollution levels in the city. That ban was lifted on February 14, only to be reimposed when the national lockdown was imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended the lockdown till May 3, but some activities have been permitted to kick-start the economy and provide job opportunities to daily-wage labourers.Though the availability of workers may be a challenge because several thousand migrant workers left the city for their towns and villages after the lockdown was announced, and work may proceed at a slow pace, several big projects are set to resume, according to multiple officials aware of the developments.“The available labour is not enough to move the projects at the desired pace. So it is likely that initially the work will be slow. Plus, we will also have to see how to get material as the factories are also shut,” said a senior Public Works Department (PWD) official who asked not to be named.But, the official added, enough labour is available to kick-start some key projects -- the tunnel that is a part of the Pragati Maidan redevelopment plan, the Barapullah-3 elevated road near Sarai Kale Khan, the Yamuna basin near Mayur Vihar-1, the Shashtri Park and Seelampur flyovers in north-east Delhi, and the Benito Juarez Road underpass near South Campus of the Delhi University.Government agencies on Wednesday began assessing the inventory of construction material and labour availability, a second PWD official said. NBCC (India) Limited, which is carrying out construction work at Pragati Maidan and other central government projects, said it will start the work with whatever is available. Its chairman and managing director, PK Gupta said: “We have projects ongoing at several locations in Delhi. We are assessing the situation and will be able to start work from April 20 at a number of places, as we have labour force available on our construction sites. We shall start work with construction material available at site and should be able to get required construction material from other places also as per the guidelines issued by government.”Workers on the Pragati Maidan project are staying at a camp near the site. The project, which started in July 2017, is scheduled to be completed at the end of the year. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said the availability of workers was not an issue because it was taking care of more than 3,500 stranded labourers at various locations across Delhi-NCR.“DMRC can resume construction activities after April 20 if the [Delhi] government allow it. We have the workforce available. Limited construction material/machinery are available at the sites for immediate resumption of work. However, adequate availability of all these materials in the long run may depend on the relaxation of lockdown guidelines post May 3, 2020,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC.DMRC started the construction work on its Phase-IV network in Haiderpur Badli Mor on December 31. The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) said that it is assessing the situation and is likely to resume work at 10 of its housing sites. “We will start the work with whatever material is available on the site,” said Tarun Kapoor, DDA vice-chairperson.There were a total of 1,578 Covid-19 cases in the Capital on Wednesday, and 56 areas in the city have so far been declared “containment zones”, where the curbs are more stringent, all movement in banned, and essential supplies are home-delivered by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-agencies-gear-up-to-restart-construction-work-in-delhi/story-PYxc80TGasHZyYvKtgkiEM.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt looking to ramp up services at hospitals, clinics after April 20||The Delhi government is looking at ways to scale up services at hospitals and clinics across the city after April 20, when the Central government is likely to relax certain norms in areas that fall outside the containment zones and hotspots.A countrywide lockdown till April 14 was put in place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month to contain the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown was on Tuesday extended till May 3. Till Wednesday, Delhi had witnessed 1578 Covid-19 positive cases with 32 deaths.A set of guidelines released by the Union home ministry on Wednesday states that all hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics, even those providing AYUSH services, will keep running during the extended lockdown period.The health ministry on March 20 had advised all hospitals – both government and private – to postpone their non-emergency planned surgeries and to maintain social distancing norms in the out-patient clinics. The guidelines had also said that patients with flu-like symptoms should be treated in a separate section. Big hospitals like All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Lok Nayak, which are treating several suspected and positive Covid-19 cases, have completely shut down their out-patient clinics. Others, have maintained a curtailed service, like Safdarjung hospital that allows patient registration for only two hours instead of four. A number of private clinics and nursing homes in the city have shut their services completely.“Healthcare is an essential service and nobody was asked to shut OPDs, only elective surgeries were to be postponed. Healthcare services other than Covid-19 are also very important and we cannot keep the patients waiting for eternity,” said a senior official from Delhi government’s health department.Authorised private institutions providing home care services, diagnostics, or those involved in the supply chains of hospitals will be allowed to function even inside containment areas, the guidelines said. “The Delhi-specific guidelines will have to be framed by the government on what services to start when and in which areas. This is likely to come by April 20 after the government has assessed all the hotspots in the city,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, president elect of Delhi Medical Association.“Many hospitals in Delhi have had to shut their services because healthcare workers are not coming in. The government has directed that their salaries be paid anyway. Just like Rajasthan and Chattisgarh, the Delhi government should give out orders to mandatorily keep OPD services running and scale up other services at least outside the containment areas,” said Dr Girdhar Gyani, director-general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India) or AHPI.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, however, says it might not be able to open up OPDs immediately.“What would be the use of opening up OPDs if we are not able to provide any other services. And, we cannot start surgeries at the moment because we have moved patients from the AIIMS trauma centre, which has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility. We do not really have space to do much else,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital. For the time being, the Delhi government also launched an app for teleconsultation. The CallDoc app can be used for 24x7 online medical consultations with general physicians and specialists for free by residents. A user can connect to a doctor on Video /Audio/Chat and can even upload their test reports for review. The doctors can upload prescriptions after consultation. Around 100 doctors have been empanelled for the service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-looking-to-ramp-up-services-at-hospitals-clinics-after-april-20/story-jST1QxHUYYAsvl4R0gwDOO.html

While one seizure was made from a car in Pathare vasti, the other was made from a woman in Khulewadi, Logeaon, by officials of the Vimantal police station.The Pune police intercepted a Maruti 800 in Lohegaon on Tuesday with 13 blue plastic cans containing a total of 455 litres alcohol meant for sale.The cost of the seized alcohol was estimated to Rs 27,300.Two arrested were identified as Ganesh Namdev Rakhparse, a resident of Kumbhar vasti, and Santosh Dnyaneshwar Irale, a resident of Rakhparse vasti in Lohegaon, according to police officials.The car was loaded up in Wadgaon Shinde and heading towards Lohegaon, according to information received by police sub-inspector Hanumant Giri of Vimantal police station.A case under Sections 188 and 269 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 51(b) of National Disaster Management Act 2005, and Section 65(e) of Maharashtra COVID-19 Regulations, 2020, was registered at Vimantal police station.In the other seizure, a woman was booked for being in possession of two cans collectively carrying 35 litres of domestically made alcohol.The woman was identified as Shobha Satyavan Khule, according to police.A case under Section 65(e) of Maharashtra Prohibition Act was registered against the woman at the Vimantal police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/490-litres-of-hooch-seized-by-pune-police/story-kIjB2UaiK4QLRGiaoJsHGJ.html
16-04-2020||Pune||‘Told no need to eat twice a day to live’: Woman at Pune camp for migrant workers||Every evening, a voluntary group comes and distributes boxes of cooked rice to a camp of about 100 migrant labourers living in six tin sheds at Ambegaon Budruk, on the outskirts of Pune city.This is the only food that this camp of labourers gets in the day.On Wednesday evening, Fatima Begum, a woman in her 30s, walked down the hill to collect food provided by the officials of Pune police who had found her while trying to walk from Pune to Madhya Pradesh along with around 150 others in the morning hours of Wednesday. Grateful for the food that the camp was receiving once a day, Fatima said with despair,“If we ask for more food, we are told that we do not need to eat twice to live. Once a day is enough for you, they tell us.”Residing at a remote settlement near Sachhai Mata temple in the hill-area of Shaninagar area in Ambegaon Budrukh, the cluster of tin sheds which are home to these labourers from Madhya Pradesh, does not permit movement of two adults at once.On Tuesday, these labourers and their children had made a failed attempt at walking to Madhya Pradesh from Ambegaon in Katraj, Pune.Reason? The message of lockdown extension had not reached their remote settlement according to Sapna Vinod, a 20-something woman who was cradling a 2-year-old in her arms while her elder was leaning against her leg.The extension of the 21-day lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday morning through a live telecast.While on their way to Madhya Pradesh on foot, the labourers- some of who wore masks- were intercepted at a check post at Khadi Machine chowk in Kondhwa around 4am, said senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad of Kondhwa police station.“A few people came first. They were stopped and one by one around 50-60 families arrived at the check post. There were four policemen at the check post. Then the night patrol and beat marshalls joined them and took all of them to the shelter set up at Darekar School. But they chose to go back home,” said Gaikwad.Gyansingh Thakur, 34, who lives with his wife and two children, said they were unaware that the lockdown had been extended.“How will we know? The only communication we had last was from the contractor who told us on a Saturday that we cannot come the next day due to something called as Janta Curfew. We got to know about the first extension from the people around like in shops. Once the money ran out, we stopped going to the shop. Now we’re told that we must stay like this until May begins,” he said. Jamna Bai, who is among the few older women in the colony, said they were trying to go to their hometown in Madhya Pradesh. “We have families there. We thought now that the lockdown is over, we will find a way to reach our state. Even if there are no vehicles, we were ready to walk the distance,” she said.The labourers pay anywhere between Rs 1,300 to Rs 2,000 in rent for the tin shed and the cost of electricity usage is in addition to the cost of the water tanker that has to be paid for twice in every month.The police who had intercepted them made food available for them. Cooked rice was also provided around 6pm on Wednesday. Until it arrived, the labourers who walked 16-18km from their houses and back, were awaiting the arrival of their next meal.While some had been in Pune anywhere between 2-6 months, few others had arrived two days before the Janta Curfew was announced.A young man who spat angrily and then stormed off in a huff said some time should have been given to migrant labourers to go back home to their families, rather than forced to live without income. They would most likely die of starvation if not disease, he said angrily.While the police has now assured them supply of food it remains to be seen whether the Pune Municipal Corporation will make some temporary arrangements for these labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/you-don-t-need-to-eat-twice-to-live-migrant-labourers-told-at-a-pune-camp/story-HuekKDsaza1JWyaZyWqZyK.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||EDMC to partially replace sodium hypochlorite with hydrogen peroxide as disinfectant||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) is going to partially replace the use of sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant spray with hydrogen peroxide.Even though sodium hypochlorite, a liquid bleach agent, is being used worldwide for sanitisation of airports, railway stations, bus stands and other public places since the Covid-19 outbreak, some of its unsavoury side effects have come to the fore.Recommended only for use on “non-living surfaces,” after sodium hypochlorite began to be used in disinfection tunnels to “mist spray” on people passing through them, the World Health Organisation (WHO) brought out an advisory against it.The WHO statement read: “Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes and mucous membranes (i.e, eyes, mouth). Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill the virus that has already entered your body.”The spokesperson of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, Arun Kumar, said, “We were using only 1% sodium hypochlorite in water, but a few complaints were coming in about the bitter smell of the chemical and the stain it left on cars and other surfaces.”“This chemical would also not fully dissolve in water and choke our spray pipe nozzles. The problem was actually due to the presence of chlorine in it, so we started looking for a chlorine-free disinfectant agent,” he said.The corporation later learnt that a company in Kalyan, Maharashtra, National Peroxide Limited of the Wadia Group, had provided the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) with hydrogen peroxide for use as a disinfectant. Also, the EPA (Environment Protection Agency) and CDC (Centres for Disease Control) of the United States say that a 3% hydrogen peroxide mixture is an effective disinfectant against Covid-19, municipal officials said. “That’s when we approached the group and on Tuesday, received the first consignment of 20,000 litres from Kalyan. It is currently stored at our Nand Nagri Central Drugs Store and we will soon put it to use in containment zones,” EDMC commissioner Dilraj Kaur said. “We will use it in the backpack spray tanks used to disinfect houses of positive and suspected patients and in school complexes where food is being distributed to the needy. We will not replace sodium hypochlorite with hydrogen peroxide completely. For example, we will continue to use the bleach agent to spray roadsides,” she said . An EDMC public health official said, “Hydrogen peroxide is safer than sodium hypochlorite when used as per the recommendations.” “This chemical is used to treat wood pulp and turn it into newsprint, which is why it is said that newspapers cannot carry Covid-19 viruses; that shows it’s effective. Also, hydrogen peroxide is a part of antibacterial mouthwashes and antifungal ear drops, making it safer for humans. However, we are not going to mist spray it on people right now,” Dr Somashekhar, municipal health Officer, EDMC, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/edmc-to-partially-replace-sodium-hypochlorite-with-hydrogen-peroxide-as-disinfectant/story-1ZuN7sMGsOWsZHlyljAhSK.html
16-04-2020||Delhi||Patients in Lok Nayak’s Covid-19 ward abuse, threaten doctors||A group of patients admitted to a coronavirus (Covid-19) isolation ward at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) Narayan Hospital allegedly abused on-duty doctors on Tuesday evening, following an altercation between a patient and a doctor earlier in the day, according to the resident doctors’ association (RDA) of the hospital.Tensions flared after a male patient allegedly made sexist remarks to a female doctor, according to the RDA. When the doctor’s colleagues objected, the patient instigated others to join in and they threatened the doctors, the RDA members said.There are 780 suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 undergoing treatment at the hospital.An incident report filed by the on-duty doctors stated, “The patient threatened to jump off the roof along with some other restless patients.”He wanted to be discharged from the hospital at the earliest, according to the incident report. Although the patient tested Covid-19 negative initially, the doctors were awaiting another report, as per the government policy, before discharging him.The doctors hid in their rooms after the situation escalated and the patients tried to break in, according to a letter written by the members of the RDA to the hospital administration, citing several security lapses.Although doctors reportedly asked security guards for assistance, a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits meant they could not immediately enter the isolation ward. The guards got a handle on the situation after doctors arranged PPE kits for them.“This situation could have been avoided had there been PPE kits for the security staff, standard operating protocols regarding handling of violence and provision of psychologists or counsellors to periodically counsel the patients,” the RDA report stated.RDA members alleged that repeated calls to the hospital’s chief medical officer went unanswered, while the floor in-charge only communicated through a messaging service, advising them doctors to call the security in-charge or then call the police if they did not get a response.They have asked the hospital to file an institutional first information report (FIR). They have also asked the hospital for the deployment of security at the isolation ward and sought action against those who failed to respond during the crisis.On Wednesday, the hospital administration held talks with the RDA. After the meeting with the resident doctors, the medical director, Dr JC Passey, said, “An FIR against the culprits is being filed. The security guard on duty and the supervisor have been suspended. Police protection in the hospital is being strengthened. And, explanations are being sought from the senior doctors, who the RDA has alleged did not take timely action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/patients-in-lok-nayak-s-covid-19-ward-abuse-threaten-doctors/story-M2ikvMSfoHfMLR1A9pAcFO.html
16-04-2020||Pune||Pune’s Naidu hospital maids serve patients hope and cheer||The ayahs or maids at Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital, where many Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment, are serving beyond their job profile since the first case was reported in the city in March.Mallika Chikka, Sujata More, Farzana Shaikh, Roopa Dharmoj, Deena Dharmoj and Madhu Chavan have been working at the hospital since long and took care of patients when the city handled the swine flu spread in the past.Chikka is employed at the hospital since 1999. Recalling her experience with Covid patients, Chikka said, “Four positive persons were admitted in the hospital on March 9 and discharged on March 25 on the occasion of Gudi Padwa. We serve hot water, tea, breakfast and lunch to patients as per the advice of doctors. We serve tea twice in the morning and once in the evening. Underage patients are served milk. We try to meet the demands of patients. We are six who look after the daily needs of admitted patients. While serving food and interacting with them, we wear the special protective uniform.”The ayahs also share positive and uplifting messages with the patients. “We keep the patients in good cheer. Many of them are discharged after completing their quarantine treatment. Those with diabetes and blood pressure are at high risk,” she said. When quizzed about fears of contracting the disease, Chikka said, “We were on the job when the city was in the grip of swine flu. We want to serve the patients as they need us the most,” she said.Sujata, working at the hospital for the last twenty years, said, “We interact with patients on a daily basis and follow precautions. We have been provided with protective kit. As most patients complain of throat pain, we regularly provide them hot water. We feel happy when a positive patient gets cured and is discharged.”One of the discharged patients shared fond memories of ayah. “They take care of us and always remain positive. Their human connect is strong. I will always remember the smile on their faces when I got discharged. I am indebted to them for their commitment and selfless service,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ayahs-at-naidu-hospital-serve-patients-hope-and-cheer/story-QWLV75umb9udBw63E8VWUK.html
16-04-2020||Pune||Pune district administration acquires services of 18 hotels to accommodate hospital staff||The Pune district administration has acquired the use of 18 hotels in the city to accommodate medical and non-medical staff involved in the treatment for Covid-19 (coronavirus) positive patients in hospitals.Most of these 18 hotels are located on Bund Garden road, Narpatgiri chowk and Pune railway station, said officials of the district administration.According to sub-divisional officer Santoshkumar Deshmukh, many of the medical and non-medical staff involved in treating Covid-19 patients belong to neighbouring towns. “Arrangements for doctors and paramedical staff has been made at 18 hotels. This arrangement is mainly for the staff serving at the Sassoon hospital as some of the staff here come from outstation,” said Deshmukh.According to the administration, “Hotel owners have responded positively . Nothing had been decided about rent yet. We will request the state government to give a certain amount to these hotels owners as rent, but the final decision is yet to be taken.”“Even hotel owners have not demanded money and they had handed over the keys,” the officials of the district administration said.Arvind Shinde, owner, Samrat hotel, who has offered to accommodate some of the medical staff, said, “The district administration approached us and requested our hotel services for the medical staff who are tirelessly serving the Covid-19 patients. After the lockdown was announced out hotel was already shut. We have handed over 10 rooms to the district administration, but if they need more space we will hand them over more rooms.”According to the district administration, the medical and para-medical staff involved in the treatment of the Covid-19 patients who reside in the city have also requested for the arrangements as they do not wish to return home after service and risk the lives of their family members. The medical personnel use the hotel rooms to rest after their duty hours, and accommodate the rooms on a rotational basis as per their shifts during the day and night, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/administration-acquires-services-of-18-hotels-to-accommodate-hospital-staff/story-UEnolyYfj8tvTgpz7VOQzH.html

The orders for the same were issued by Deepak Mhaisekar, divisional commissioner on Tuesday.The task force will be formed along the lines of the task force in Mumbai, which includes specialist doctors, to minimize the death rate and suggest measures for clinical management of Covid-19 patients, according to the orders.Mhaisekar said, “The task force will focus on forming a standard protocol for the city along with the expert group who will provide advice. This task force is formed on the lines of the task force formed for Mumbai.” The task force will especially focus on hospitals treating critical Covid-19 patients like Sassoon General Hospital, Bharti Vidyapeeth Hospital, Symbiosis Hospital, Naidu Hospital and YCM hospital in Pimpri-Chincwad. The task force includes doctors who specialise in infection control, intensivist, chest specialist, cardiologist, nephrologist, paediatric and gastroenterologist. “In addition to designing management protocol for serious and critically ill Covid-19 patients, it will also recommend the requirement of specialist health staff including doctors, specific drug protocol to maintain uniformity in treating critically ill patients, recommend criteria and logistics requirement,” he said.Mahisekar also said, that special care needs to be taken for those who show initial flu-related symptoms like cough, fever, cold, runny nose and they must immediately visit the nearest civic body Covid-19 centre. He said, “We have noticed that often senior citizens or people with comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or any diseases which affect the kidney or liver, go for preliminary treatment and take medicines off the counter which may lead to suppressing the symptoms for a few days which then comes back again and worsen the situation.”“We have issued an advisory to all private doctors and through the food and drugs administration to all the nearby medical shops to direct such patients to Covid-19 centres. The civic doctors will then analyse the patient and suggest if they have to undergo test or no,” said Mahisekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-district-admin-forms-task-force-to-keep-track-of-critically-ill-covid-19-patients/story-29z8TxQOkyYVdgWvVNNTjK.html
16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Dialysis patients have a tough time amid Covid-19 curfew in Chandigarh||Dilkhush Yadav, 30, a kidney patient from Bihar is facing a trial by fire due to the lockdown. Suffering from end stage kidney disease, Yadav walks for over 2 hours to cover a 4-km stretch from Sarai in PGIMER to a private centre in Sector-38 A for dialysis. The distance can be covered in 8 minutes if he could pay rickshaw pullers ₹300 for the trip, to and fro.Yadav is undergoing treatment at the nephrology department of Chandigarh’s Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) from the last one year. He said, “I leave the shelter home at 6:30 am to reach the dialysis centre by 8.30 am. Rickshaw pullers who earlier charged up to ₹20 are now asking ₹600 for a round trip. How can a poor man pay so much?”Dialysis is a treatment that filters and purifies blood using a machine, which helps keep ones fluids and electrolytes in balance when kidneys can’t do their job. After the treatment at noon, he waited two hours, but when he could not find conveyance, he walked the way back home. He is advised dialysis thrice a week, but he is planning to reduce it to two times a week.“I walk a little, then sit to catch my breath. I have no energy to walk all the way, especially in the heat. I have no choice, ” Yadav said, adding, “I once requested cops for a lift, but they left saying it wasn’t their job.”In a similar case, Suresh Kumar, 28, from Bihar is undergoing treatment since 2014. He sold his land and spent about ₹25 lakh on his treatment. Six years on, he can barely afford his dialysis which costs ₹6,000 per week. So, when a rickshaw puller asked ₹200 for a 5 km stretch, he chose to walk, which took him three and a half hours to reach the centre.“At 2pm, I started walking back to my sarai, but when I reached Sector 17, my blood pressure shot up. A rickshaw puller asked for ₹200, so I chose to walk,” said Kumar, who could barely speak.Chandan Kumar, 29, shared a similar experience. Amid the curfew, he cant avail the ‘poor patient’ slip issued by PGIMER, because of which he has to spend double the money. His 5-year-old accompanies him to the centre, but now-a-days he walks alone as it takes 4 hours and is hot at noon. One day he had to plead with his brother to bring a vehicle or a wheelchair else he would have fainted on the road.The curfew is a cause of misery not only to the poor but also for senior citizens. The former information commisioner of Punjab (RTI), Surinder Awasthi, said that reaching the hospital for dialysis itself was an uphill task. “If I get a driver, he is questioned by police. If I call an ambulance it never arrives. If we are suffering, I wonder at the plight of the poor,” the 70-year-old Mohali resident said.Dr HS Kohli, head of nephrology department, PGIMER, said: “In Chandigarh, more than 230 kidney patients undergo dialysis everyday. The number is higher in Mohali.” He also said the Indian Society of Nephrology is compiling a report with regard to the discomfort causes to kidney patients because of the lockdown. The city has 107 dialysis machines—75 in the private sector and 32 at government hospitals. He said a patient must undergo dialysis as advised, or they land up in emergency. “Some centres in the periphery are closed, but since they are not regulated, they cannot be compelled to stay open. This is also why so many patients are left harassed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kidney-patients-seeking-dialysis-have-a-tough-time-amid-covid-19-curfew-in-chandigarh/story-7C55dh16UL1SadLg9s88YM.html

16-04-2020||Pune||Urban poor in Pune fight hunger and heat during lockdown||The lockdown has brought in many restrictions for residents of the city, including not stepping out of their houses. However, those living in tin sheds, which they call their home, are finding it difficult to stay indoors in the swealtering heat.With temperatures touching 38.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, slum dwellers living in 10x10 rooms made of tin sheets have to battle the heat apart from their hunger. Residents mainly from the lower economic category claim that the lockdown has been tough for them, with no earnings to purchase daily needs and dealing with problems which arise due to the rising mercury.Sachin Waghmare, a resident of Kashewadi in Bhavani peth, said, “I used to work as a delivery boy with a local shop. With the shop closed, I have no money now. I have eight family members to feed and took help from certain social and political organisations, but it isn’t enough. The soaring temperature makes it difficult for us to stay indoors during the daytime. When people step out to get some relief from the sun, police officials force us to go back indoors due to the lockdown.”Corporator from Kashewadi area Avinash Bagwe, said, “For the middle class and higher income groups, it is easy to stay at home, but those living in slums are facing a really tough time. It is very difficult to stay in a small tin room with no fans in this heat. On one hand, there is not enough food and on the other, people can’t go to work.”Radha Patole, a domestic help, said, “I got help from people where I used to work and got enough food, but now, the problem is the swealtering heat. Before the lockdown, I used to work in the afternoon and come home by evening, thus avoiding the summer heat inside our tin homes. Now, we just have one fan and six family members all cramped inside a 10x10 room.”Husain Shaikh who lives in the same area said, “I work as a car mechanic, but I have not had any income coming in since the past month. The queue at fair price shops are unending and only those with yellow cards get free foodgrains. Others do not get wheat and rice from the fair price shops. Our homes are small in size and there are six members in the family. In the heat, it is difficult to manage them in such a small space.”Raju Pardeshi, who is involved in paint jobs and a resident of Taljai slum, said, “I have no money to manage my domestic expenses for the next two weeks. I have a yellow card and so I get free food from the fair price shop. However, with summer approaching, children get irritable due to the heat and hunger adds to the problem.”Sonali Nangade, a resident of Padmavati, said, “The temperature is soaring, but we are used to living in such conditions now. Earlier, we moved to our villages for sometime in the summers to beat the heat, but now we cannot move also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-temperature-tempers-soar-too-as-urban-poor-in-pune-fight-hunger-and-heat-during-lockdown/story-etjdbZVnGVVILaaVDLbemM.html
16-04-2020||Pune||4 nurses at Pune’s Sassoon hospital Covid-19 ward test positive for virus||PUNE Four nurses working in wards dedicated to treatment of Covid-19 patients at the Sassoon General hospital have tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the Covid-19 infection, health department officials said on Wednesday. The test results came back positive on Tuesday nightDr Ajay Chandanwale, dean of Sassoon hospital, said, “Four nurses have tested positive for the virus infection and we are now contact tracing. Also, they do not have any other illnesses. They have been isolated in the Covid-19 ward and, we have also home isolated their family members.” The district administration has denied any lapse in providing safety equipment, or the hospital staff not maintaining social distancing, as a cause for the infections. District collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “Nurses are the ones who take care of the patients and they are directly exposed to the patients who are infected. Every staffer in the hospital, be it nurses, doctors and even the sanitation staff, is being provided with PPE kits, masks and the necessary safety kits. They are also maintaining distancing within themselves, so it cannot be said that there is any safety lapse. The hospital administration is now contact tracing all those people who came in close contact with those nurses and only those people will be isolated.”Ram said the administration cannot isolate the entire hospital staff, as they are crucial for the treatment of other patients at Sassoon.Sassoon hospital, along with Naidu hospital, houses the maximum number of Covid-19 patients in Pune.Sassoon hospital has admitted 68 patients of the 425 in the district, and has 51 positive cases of the 296 positive cases, as of April 14. The hospital is also treating six of the seven Covid-19 patients who are critical, and has reported 28 of the 38 Covid-19-related deaths in the district.Ram added that all doctors at the hospital will be isolated at hotels near the hospital to minimise exposure to their family members or people outside the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-nurses-at-sassoon-s-covid-19-ward-test-positive-for-virus/story-WjUPREEYg47cEN99irgtdO.html

It was also agreed to suspend debt payments from the world’s poorest countries - freeing up £12 billion to tackle the virus.“The Chancellor, who led development of the action plan with his Indian counterpart, also called on more G20 Finance Ministers to fund the development of vaccines, with the UK already contributing £250 million for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations – a global organisation that conducts research to develop vaccines against infectious diseases”, the Treasury added.The meeting also agreed an enhanced IMF support package, more joined-up efforts by international organisations fighting the pandemic, and to share best practice on containment measures, officials added.Sunak said: “The UK is at the forefront of international action in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak…It’s right that we have suspended debt payments for the world’s poorest countries and are supporting the most vulnerable health systems in the world, which in turn makes us all safer”.In total, the UK has so far contributed £744 million in aid to the fight against coronavirus to help slow down the spread of the disease around the world and help manage the global economic damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-nirmala-sitharaman-lead-g20-plan-to-tackle-covid-19-pandemic/story-FTTrljlUT8K3YkwrAwSljM.html

16-04-2020||World||Singapore reports record jump in coronavirus infections||Singapore late Thursday reported a record jump in coronavirus cases, most of them linked to packed dormitories housing foreign workers, as it battled a second wave of infections.The affluent city-state had initially been held as a gold standard in the global fight against the Covid-19 disease, but a surge in the number of cases has left the government scrambling to contain the spread.The Ministry of Health reported 728 new cases as of midday Thursday -- the biggest rise in a single day -- bringing the total number of infections to 4,427, including 10 deaths.“The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories has increased significantly, in line with our continued efforts to actively test and isolate the infected workers,” the ministry said in a statement.It said 654, or around 90 percent, of the new cases were linked to the dorms and another 26 were foreign workers living outside the facilities.Around 200,000 workers, mostly from South Asia, live in 43 dorms across the island, forming an essential part of the country’s work force.Many of them are construction workers typically toiling for long hours, earning in the region of $400 to $500 a month building the city-state’s glittering skyscrapers and shopping malls.Following criticism of poor living conditions in the dorms, the government swung into action, moving thousands of them to other accommodation -- including a floating complex -- in order to decongest the facilities and lessen the chances of infection.The government is also providing meals and ramped-up cleaning services at quarantined dorms, and is helping run the facilities, which are usually privately operated.Writing on Facebook this month, veteran Singapore diplomat Tommy Koh slammed “the disgraceful way” in which the foreign workers were being treated.He said it should be a “wake-up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a first world country should”.mba/st||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-reports-record-jump-in-coronavirus-infections/story-yhSkcz7Nkn9i8T1MUYn3HJ.html
16-04-2020||World||After over 13,500 deaths, 1 lakh cases, UK extends Covid-19 lockdown||As the death toll from coronavirus rose to 13,729 on Thursday, the Boris Johnson government extended the lockdown by at least three more weeks in the hope that social distancing and other restrictions will continue to have impact.Official figures show the number of people who tested positive for the virus rose to 103,093.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension amidst signs that the curbs are having some effect. Ministers and experts said lifting the lockdown or a return to normalcy would not be feasible until the mass availability of a vaccine for the virus.Several projects across the globe are at various stages of developing a vaccine for coronavirus, with one in the University of Oxford promising that it could be available by September. Usually a vaccine is available for mass inoculation in 12 to 18 months.Raab said: “Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance…We still don’t have infection rates down as much as we need to. Any change to social distancing measures now would risk significant increase in infections.”According to health minister Nadine Dorries, “There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy”.Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College advising the government said some level of social distancing would need to be retained, until a vaccine is available, calling for a single-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing.Ferguson called for more action at the official level, noting that more preparation had been done for Brexit, including a separate department, than to deal with the pandemic.Ferguson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s a lot of discussion. I would like to see action accelerated. I don’t have a deep insight about what’s going on in government, but decisions need to be accelerated. We need to put in place an infrastructure, a command and control structure, a novel organisation”.“I’m reminded we had a department for Brexit for government. That was a major national emergency and we are faced with something even larger than Brexit. And yet I don’t quite see the evidence for that level of organisation. I’d like to see measures accelerated.”He argued that a huge infrastructure of testing and contact tracing would need to be in place in order for the lockdown to be lifted without further peaks, pointing to the model of South Korea, which has been suppressing new outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-over-13-500-deaths-1-lakh-cases-uk-extends-covid-19-lockdown/story-pz4iD60JiudvNwnQ2KtPtM.html

16-04-2020||World||Putin postpones Victory Day military parade due to Covid-19||President Vladimir Putin, citing the deepening coronavirus crisis, said on Thursday Russia would postpone its May 9 celebrations including a huge military parade across Red Square to mark 75 years since the Soviet victory in World War Two.The Kremlin had hoped to mark the anniversary with particular pomp this year and that an array of world leaders would attend, but Putin said in televised comments there was now no choice but to push back the event.“The risks associated with an epidemic that has not passed its peak are extremely high. And this does not give me the right to begin preparations for the parade and other public events,” he said.The number of coronavirus cases in Russia began rising sharply this month, although it had reported far fewer infections than many western European countries in the outbreak’s early stages.Russia confirmed 3,448 new cases on Thursday, a record daily rise that brought its nationwide tally to 27,938. Officials say 232 people have died.Several war veteran organisations appealed to Putin this week to postpone the parade, saying they wanted it to be a memorable and spectacular event, something that looked unlikely with Moscow and many of Russia’s regions observing a lockdown.Speaking in comments broadcast on state television nationwide on Thursday, Putin did not say when the parade would take place, but said that it would definitely be this year.In power as president or prime minister for more than two decades, Putin oversees the May 9 military parade every year from a tribune packed with war veterans.The Soviet military campaign in World War Two has become a sensitive subject for Moscow ahead of the 75th anniversary. Putin has accused Russia’s detractors of diminishing the Soviet war effort and the country’s huge loss of life.Many western leaders shunned the May 9 event after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea pushed relations to post-Cold War lows, but this year the Kremlin had hoped many world leaders would attend again.The heads of 17 countries, including India, France, Cuba, and Venezuela, had said they would attend this year, the Kremlin said in August last year.The Kremlin had invited U.S. President Donald Trump, but Washington said it would send his national security adviser, Robert O’Brien. Trump had wanted to go, but was told by advisers not to, US officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-postpones-victory-day-military-parade-due-to-covid-19/story-eT8sJbCq2sZYdq0QQA9kSK.html
16-04-2020||World||Bangladesh coast guard rescues 396 Rohingya from drifting boat; 32 dead||At least 32 ethnic Rohingya died on a ship that drifted for weeks after it failed to reach Malaysia, Bangladesh coast guard officials said on Thursday, following the rescue of 396 starving survivors.A human rights group said it believed more boats carrying Rohingya - a Muslim minority - were adrift at sea, with coronavirus lockdowns in Malaysia and Thailand making it harder for them to find refuge.“They were at sea for about two months and were starving,” a Bangladesh coastguard official told Reuters in a message, adding that the ship was brought to shore late on Wednesday.The 396 survivors would be handed to the U.N refugee agency, said the official, who had initially said they would be sent to Myanmar. The official also revised the death toll to 32 from 24.Video images showed a crowd comprised mostly of women and children, some stick-thin and unable to stand, being helped to shore. One emaciated man lay on the sand.One refugee told a reporter the group had been turned back from Malaysia twice and a fight had broken out onboard between passengers and crew at one point.Malaysian officials did not respond to requests for comment on reports that it had turned away previous boats from its waters. ​ “We understand these men, women and children were at sea for nearly two months in harrowing conditions and that many of them are extremely malnourished and dehydrated,” the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said.The agency was offering to help the government move them to quarantine facilities and would provide medical care, it said in a statement.Media reports that the group was infected with the virus had not been substantiated, the UNHCR said.In a separate case, Malaysia’s navy on Thursday morning intercepted a boat carrying some 200 Rohingya refugees attempting to enter Malaysian waters.The boat, which was spotted by an air force surveillance plane, was escorted out of Malaysian waters by two navy ships after being provided with food supplies, the air force said in a statement.Buddhist-majority Myanmar does not recognise Rohingya as citizens and they face severe curbs on freedom of movement as well as access to healthcare and education.Myanmar denies persecuting Rohingya and says they are not an indigenous ethnic group but immigrants from South Asia, even though many Rohingya are able to trace their ancestry back centuries.More than a million live in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, the majority having been driven from homes in Myanmar after a 2017 military crackdown the army said was a response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.Rights groups fear virus curbs across Southeast Asia could trigger a repeat of a 2015 crisis, when a crackdown by Thailand prompted smugglers to abandon their human cargo at sea on crowded, rickety boats.Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, said she believed several more boats were stranded.“Rohingya may encounter closed borders supported by a xenophobic public narrative,” she said in a message.“COVID-19 cannot be used to deny access to territory to desperate refugees in distress. Another maritime crisis in the Andaman Sea, as in 2015, is unacceptable.”For years, Rohingya from Myanmar have boarded boats organised by smugglers in the hope of finding refuge in Southeast Asia, usually making voyages during the dry season from November to March, when the waters are calm. Several boats were trying to reach Malaysian shores and monitoring had been stepped up, a police official in the northwestern state of Kedah told Reuters.A police official in southern Thailand said five boats carrying Rohingya had been spotted off the coast of Satun province late on Monday.People were smuggled out by boat and over land, said Kyaw Hla, a Rohingya from Sittwe in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, where tens of thousands of Rohingya have been confined in camps since a bout of violence in 2012.“Within these eight years, there has been no progress, only degradation,” he said by telephone. “People can’t stand it. Since we are locked up and suffocated, people try to leave, of course.”He added, “If the coronavirus breaks out here, we’ll be as good as dead.”(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.)(Additional reporting by Panu Wongcha-Um and Poppy McPherson in Bangkok and Rozanna Latif and Joseph Sipalan in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Angus MacSwan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-coast-guard-rescues-396-rohingya-from-drifting-boat-32-dead/story-y9EovoLJdcavwsFrbDVulO.html

Experts have found the longest-ever siphonophore in Western Australia’s underwater canyons. This particular siphonophore is estimated to be close to 150 feet or 46 metres long, making it the longest creature in the world. The gigantic Blue Whale is usually estimated to be 91 feet or over 25 metres long.String-like, UFO-shaped siphonophore is a deep water predator. Experts believe they feed with the help of their tentacles that keep floating in the ocean water, just like jellyfish.Experts at Western Australia Museum (WAM) led the expedition and said they also discovered marine species which have never been documented before such as the first giant hydroids.  Get out the tape measure!📏@wamuseum researchers have found what they believe could be the longest animal ever recorded. It has been estimated that the giant Apolemia siphonophore is more than 120m long, but it's length is yet to be formally established.https://t.co/rFaNrZnHYn“Western Australia Museum researchers have found what they believe could be the longest animal ever recorded. It has been estimated that the giant Apolemia siphonophore is more than 120m long, but it’s length is yet to be formally established,” read a tweet posted by the WAM. Dr Nerida Wilson of WAM, however, clarified in a tweet that the team has not estimated the creature’s length but it could be the longest ever seen in the ocean.“Just a quick fact check though, we never estimated it’s length, and are working on measuring it accurately.

16-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Touching 13,000 deaths, 1 lakh cases, UK set to extend lockdown||The Boris Johnson government was poised to announce an extension to the three-week lockdown on Thursday, as the number of deaths and cases from coronavirus approached 13,000 and 1 lakh respectively – making the UK one of the worst infected in Europe.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson recovering from the virus, was due to announce the extension at the daily briefing in Downing Street on Thursday evening. Concerns grew for those infected and dying outside hospitals that are not reflected in daily figures.UK-wide figures released on Wednesday evening showed 12,868 deaths and 98,476 cases.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Labour would support a three-week extension but said the best way out of the lockdown is to move to a testing and contact-tracing strategy.Health secretary Matt Hancock stressed that the number of deaths is still “far too high” for any exit strategy to be set out, insisting that people must focus on staying at home. According to health minister Nadine Dorries, an exit strategy must await the mass availability of vaccine.Dorries tweeted that journalists should stop asking about an exit strategy: “There is only one way we can ‘exit’ full lockdown and that is when we have a vaccine. Until then, we need to find ways we can adapt society and strike a balance between the health of the nation and our economy”.Hancock told Sky News on Thursday: “I think what Nadine was saying is the idea that we’ll immediately ... we’ll just switch off all of the measures and return to some kind of ... to things exactly as they were - that is not likely in the short term…This will take time”.Meanwhile, epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, who is advising the government, called for more official action, and noted that more preparation had been done for Brexit, including a separate department, than to deal with the pandemic.Ferguson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There’s a lot of discussion. I would like to see action accelerated. I don’t have a deep insight about what’s going on in government, but decisions need to be accelerated. We need to put in place an infrastructure, a command and control structure, a novel organisation”.“I’m reminded we had a department for Brexit for government. That was a major national emergency and we are faced with something even larger than Brexit. And yet I don’t quite see the evidence for that level of organisation. I’d like to see measures accelerated.”He said some level of social distancing would need to be retained, a vaccine is available, calling for a single-minded emphasis on scaling up testing and contact tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-touching-13-000-deaths-1-lakh-cases-uk-set-to-extend-lockdown/story-kwBm45ON2OScRktmIvJWmO.html

Austria, Italy and Spain have also allowed some businesses to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-remains-in-the-eye-of-coronavirus-storm-who/story-QvtyaOGGoHpHk9FcML6OFN.html

16-04-2020||World||US says China may have conducted low-level nuclear test blasts||China may have secretly set off low-level underground nuclear test explosions despite claiming to observe an international pact banning such blasts, the US State Department said in a report on Wednesday that could fuel US-Chinese tensions.The finding, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, may worsen ties already strained by US charges that the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted from Beijing’s mishandling of a 2019 outbreak of the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan.US concerns about Beijing’s possible breaches of a “zero yield” standard for test blasts have been prompted by activities at China’s Lop Nur nuclear test site throughout 2019, the State Department report said.Zero yield refers to a nuclear test in which there is no explosive chain reaction of the type ignited by the detonation of a nuclear warhead.“China’s possible preparation to operate its Lop Nur test site year-round, its use of explosive containment chambers, extensive excavation activities at Lop Nur and a lack of transparency on its nuclear testing activities ... raise concerns regarding its adherence to the zero yield standard,” the report said, without providing evidence of a low-yield test.Beijing’s lack of transparency included blocking data transmissions from sensors linked to a monitoring center operated by the international agency that verifies compliance with a treaty banning nuclear test explosions. The 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) allows activities designed to ensure the safety of nuclear weapons.A spokeswoman for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which verifies compliance with the pact, told the Wall Street Journal there had been no interruptions in data transmissions from China’s five sensor stations since the end of August 2019 following an interruption that began in 2018.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing that China was committed to a moratorium on nuclear tests and said the United States was making false accusations.“China has always adopted a responsible attitude, earnestly fulfilling the international obligations and promises it has assumed,” he said. “The US criticism of China is entirely groundless, without foundation, and not worth refuting.”‘WORRYING’A senior US official said the concerns about China’s testing activities buttressed President Donald Trump’s case for getting China to join the United States and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace the 2010 New START treaty between Washington and Moscow that expires in February.New START restricted the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads, the lowest level in decades, and limited the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.“The pace and manner by which the Chinese government is modernizing its stockpile is worrying, destabilizing, and illustrates why China should be brought into the global arms control framework,” said the senior US official on condition of anonymity.China, estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons, has repeatedly rejected Trump’s proposal, arguing its nuclear force is defensive and poses no threat.Russia, France and Britain - three of the world’s five internationally recognized nuclear powers - signed and ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which still requires ratification by 44 countries to become international law.China and the United States are among eight signatories that have not ratified it. But China has declared its adherence to its terms, while the United States has observed a unilateral testing moratorium since 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-china-may-have-conducted-low-level-nuclear-test-blasts/story-OnuudVMWdZ0hDl5v2T6ExK.html
16-04-2020||World||Why are some South Koreans who recovered from Covid-19 testing positive again?||South Korean health officials are investigating several possible explanations for a small but growing number of recovered coronavirus patients who later test positive for the virus again.Among the main possibilities are re-infection, a relapse, or inconsistent tests, experts say.South Korea had reported 141 such cases as of Thursday, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).RE-INFECTION OR RELAPSE?Although re-infection would be the most concerning scenario because of its implications for developing immunity in a population, both the KCDC and many experts say this is unlikely.Instead, the KCDC says it is leaning toward some kind of relapse or “re-activation” in the virus.A relapse could mean that parts of the virus go into some kind of dormant state for a time, or that some patients may have certain conditions or weak immunity that makes them susceptible to the virus reviving in their system, experts said. A recent study by doctors in China and the United States suggested the new coronavirus can damage T lymphocytes, also known as T cells, which play a central role the body’s immune system and ability to battle infections.Kim Jeong-ki, a virologist at the Korea University College of Pharmacy, compared a relapse after treatment to a spring that snaps back after being pressed down.“When you press down a spring it becomes smaller, then when you take your hands off, the spring pops up,” he said.Even if the patients are found to have relapsed rather than to have been re-infected, it could signal new challenges for containing the spread of the virus.“South Korean health authorities still haven’t found cases where the ‘reactivated’ patients spread the virus to third parties, but if such infectiousness is proven, that would be a huge problem,” said Seol Dai-wu, an expert in vaccine development and a professor at Chung-Ang University.LIMITS OF TESTINGPatients in South Korea are considered clear of the virus when they have tested negative twice in a 48-hour period.While the RT-PCR tests used in South Korea are considered generally accurate, experts said that there are ways they could return false or inconsistent results for a small number of cases.“RT-PCR tests boast an accuracy of 95%. This means that there still can be 2-5% of those cases that are detected false negative or false positive cases,” Kim said.Remnants of the virus could remain at levels too low to be detected by a given test, Seol said.On the other hand, the tests may also be so sensitive that they are picking up small, potentially harmless levels of the virus, leading to new positive results even though the person has recovered, Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director of KCDC said at a briefing on Tuesday.The tests could also be compromised if the necessary samples are not collected properly, said Eom Joong-sik, professor of infectious diseases at Gachon University Gil Medical Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-some-south-koreans-who-recovered-from-covid-19-testing-positive-again/story-AU6T7DYDhpbgQtbgM8WReL.html

The foundation also called on world leaders to unite in a global response to Covid-19, that has infected over 2 million people worldwide, to ensure equitable access to diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.“It is increasingly clear that the world’s response to this pandemic will not be effective unless it is also equitable,” Gates Foundation co-chair Melinda Gates said in a statement on Wednesday. “We have a responsibility to meet this global crisis with global solidarity. In addition to contributing to the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, these funds will support efforts against Covid-19 in low-and-middle-income countries, where local leaders and healthcare workers are doing heroic work to protect vulnerable communities and slow the spread of the disease.” The foundation’s new USD 150 million commitment will fund the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, as well as new efforts to provide partners in Africa and South Asia with resources to scale their COVID-19 detection, treatment, and isolation efforts, it said.The additional funding brings foundation commitment to more than $250 million to help mitigate the social and economic impacts of the virus.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, over 2 million people are infected by the virus and more than 136,000 people have died of the disease globally.“Covid-19 does not obey border laws. Even if most countries succeed in slowing the disease over the next few months, the virus could return if the pandemic remains severe enough elsewhere,” foundation co-chair Bill Gates said in the statement. “The world community must understand that so long as Covid-19 is somewhere, we need to act as if it were everywhere. Beating this pandemic will require an unprecedented level of international funding and cooperation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-does-not-obey-border-laws-says-bill-gates-donates-150-million-more/story-85rU8PESnk3uf0sObpCAwJ.html

16-04-2020||World||China, Europe show restarting coronavirus-hit economies not easy||As countries consider how to restart economies that have been halted by the coronavirus, the early experiences in China and parts of Europe show it will be no easy task.Workers back on the job are wary of spending much or going out. Shoppers are staying away from the few stores reopening. Masks and social distancing measures are not fading. And pervasive is the fear the virus could return if lockdowns meant to stop its spread are eased too much, too quickly.Still, leaders are anxious to reopen factories, schools and shops and to repair the economic damage from the pandemic that has infected more than 2 million people and claimed more than 137,000 lives.Some Chinese cities tried reassuring consumers by showing officials eating in restaurants. In the U.S., people have begun getting relief checks to help them pay the bills.Rome’s streets were largely deserted despite some stores reopening. In Vienna, clothing store owner Marie Froehlich said her staff was happy to be back after weeks cooped up at home. But dependent largely on tourism, she expects the business will take months to return to normal.“Until then, we are in crisis mode,” she said.Truck salesman Zhang Hu in Zhengzhou, China, is back at work but his income plummeted because few people are buying 20-ton rigs. “I have no idea when the situation will turn better.”In the U.S., with many factories shut down, American industrial output shriveled in March, registering its biggest decline since the nation demobilized in 1946 at the end of World War II. Retail sales fell by an unprecedented 8.7%, with April expected to be far worse.President Donald Trump said he’s prepared new guidelines for easing social distancing, even as business leaders told him more testing and personal protective equipment were essential first.Troubling data indicate the worst may still be to come in many parts of the world.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging stepped-up efforts to prepare Africa, warning that the continent “could end up suffering the greatest impacts.”Singapore’s outbreak has jumped more than 1,100 cases since Monday. It had looked to be successful in containing a first wave of infections, but the new cases are occurring among workers from poorer Asian countries who live in crowded dormitories and work in the tiny city-state’s trade-dependent economy.In Brazil, a war of words has broken out over President Jair Bolsonaro’s lackadaisical approach to the virus.“We’re fighting against the coronavirus and against the ‘Bolsonaro-virus,’” Sao Paulo state Gov. João Doria told The Associated Press in an interview, adding that he believes the president has adopted “incorrect, irresponsible positions.”The U.S. began issuing one-time payments this week to tens of millions of people as part of its $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package. But another part of the relief package, a $350 billion paycheck protection program aimed at small businesses, is running dry after being open for only a matter of days. Negotiations were accelerating in Washington over a $250 billion emergency request to help.The U.S. has recorded more than 30,000 deaths — the most in the world — and over 600,000 confirmed infections, by a Johns Hopkins University count. Still, the nightmare scenarios projecting a far greater number of deaths and hospitalizations have not come to pass, raising hopes from coast to coast and prompting stronger calls for easing of restrictions.Foreign leaders, meanwhile, rushed to the defense of the World Health Organization after Trump vowed to halt U.S. payments to the U.N. agency for not sounding the alarm over the virus sooner.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the WHO is needed now more than ever: “Only by joining forces can we overcome this crisis that knows no borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-europe-show-restarting-coronavirus-hit-economies-not-easy/story-atGOtASq0nF3eTwmkmRstK.html

Dr Anthony Fauci was speaking to Vanity Fair magazine on the coronavirus pandemic.Dr Fauci said that he knows people are in home quarantine, and might swipe on a dating app like Tinder, but they have to decide if they want to take that risk. It’s upto that person, said Dr Fauci, to decide whether he/she wants to “sit in a roon and have a chat or wants to go a little bit intimate”.He warned of tremendous risk in terms of going for that sort of thing, because the Covid-19 infection has been spreading through asymptomatic people too.Dr Fauci has been under fire from President Donald Trump for saying in a TV interview that lives could have been saved “had the country started mitigation earlier”.Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor. But at Monday’s briefing, Trump insisted Fauci’s job was safe after Fauci took the podium to try to explain his comments.Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke to news agency Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss internal conversations.But Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that - at least for now - he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tinder-dates-during-covid-19-can-invite-them-to-homes-but-at-own-risk-says-us-expert/story-YcY7pwqFGTOr9MnKRedcCM.html

Average growth in Asia is still higher than other regions,” Ree told PTI in an interview.“We expect growth in Asia to stall at zero per cent in 2020. This is a remarkable downgrade since Asia has not experienced zero growth in the last 60 years!” he said.This is lower than the annual average growth rates throughout the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 per cent) or the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 per cent). The downward revisions are substantial and across the board, with the largest revisions for Australia and New Zealand (-9ppt), Japan (-5.9ppt) China(-4.8ppt), he said.But, since Asia was exposed to the virus before other countries, a recovery may begin earlier, and growth in 2021 is expected to rise to 7.6 percent, Rhee said.“But not all lost growth can be made up quickly and the impact of the global economic contraction on Asia means that the level of output can be expected to remain below the pre-pandemic level throughout 2021,” he said.Responding to a question, Rhee noted that the IMF’s forecasts are quite uncertain.“One of the difficulties in forecasting growth in Asia is the fact that Asian economies are at different stages of the pandemic. The final outcome will also depend on the effectiveness of the containment measures and whether or not there is a second wave of outbreaks. There is potential for surprises on both the upside and the downside,” he said.The balance of risks is tilted to the downside, given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-doing-better-than-other-regions-may-recover-faster-says-imf/story-MkZqMtgQNh79tHMH2BGqDO.html
16-04-2020||World||Did coronavirus originate from China? Trump says US investigating; Pompeo asks for full transparency||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday asked China for full transparency, as Washington stepped up its attack on Beijing on the coronavirus outbreak. China, on its part, insisted that it has been transparent and sharply criticised US officials who cast doubt on that. “The Secretary stressed the need for full transparency and information sharing to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and prevent future outbreaks,” a US State Department statement said on the call between Pompeo and China’s top diplmate Yang Jiechi.Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported that Yang told Pompeo it was crucial for Washington and Beijing to properly manage their relations during the outbreak and that he hoped the United States would meet China halfway, focus on cooperation and help to promote their relationship.ALSO WATCH | ‘If WHO knew the gravity of…’: US President Donald Trump doubles down on allegationsThis came hours after US President Donald Trump said that his government is trying to determine whether the coronavirus emanated from a lab in Wuhan in China.“We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened,” Trump said at a White House news conference.Asked if he had raised the subject in his conversations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said: “I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory, I just don’t want to discuss, it’s inappropriate right now.”Pompeo, in a Fox News Channel interview after Trump’s news conference, had said, “we know this virus originated in Wuhan, China,” and that the Institute of Virology is only a handful of miles away from the wet market.“We really need the Chinese government to open up and help explain exactly how this virus spread,” said Pompeo.The source of the virus remains a mystery. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had said on Tuesday that US intelligence indicates that the coronavirus likely occurred naturally, as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China, but there is no certainty either way.Fox News reported on Wednesday that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory not as a bioweapon, but as part of China’s effort to demonstrate that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of the United States.This report and others have suggested that the Wuhan lab where virology experiments take place and lax safety standards there led to someone getting infected and appearing at a nearby “wet” market, where the virus began to spread.The virus has no far infected more than two million people across the globe and killed thousands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-coronavirus-originate-from-china-trump-says-us-investigating-pompeo-asks-for-full-transparency/story-OtzH1j4Rh6aweXDKJvbGlJ.html
16-04-2020||World||Russia clashes with Europeans over Syria chemical weapons||Syria’s close ally Russia clashed with European nations in the UN Security Council on Wednesday over a report from the global chemical weapons watchdog blaming the Syrian air force for a series of attacks using sarin and chlorine on a rebel-held town in 2017.Moscow dismissed it as “baseless” and the Europeans demanded accountability for the government’s action.An investigative team of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said in a 82-page report issued April 8 that the Syrian air force dropped bombs containing either chlorine or sarin on a hospital and open farmland in the central town of Latamneh, injuring over 70 people and killing at least three — a surgeon and two others.The exchanges between Russia and the Europeans took place at the monthly meeting on Syria’s chemical weapons, which was closed. Russia, Germany, Britain and Estonia distributed the statements of their ambassadors.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said UN disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitusu briefed the council, including on the findings of the OPCW report, and stressed that they were “deeply distressing.”Dujarric said Nakamitsu reiterated Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ position “that the use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, is intolerable and impunity for their use is equally unacceptable. It is imperative to identify and hold accountable all those who have used chemical weapons.” But Syria was not named.The investigative team concluded that “there are reasonable grounds” to believe the perpetrators in Latamneh of the use of sarin on March 24 and 30, and chlorine on March 25, 2017, were part of the Syrian Arab Air Force, OPCW coordinator Santiago Oñate-Laborde said.When the report came out, a Syrian Foreign Ministry official, quoted on state media, said “Syria condemns in the strongest terms what was stated in the report,” and “categorically denies that it used toxic gases in the town of Latamneh or in any other Syrian city or village.”Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that all of Syria’s chemical weapons were destroyed and accused the OPCW experts of “echoing baseless accusations” by some unnamed countries, “biases,” and preparing a report “without even the slightest traces of due diligence.”Syrian authorities repeatedly refused to cooperate with the investigation, the report said.The investigation included interviews with witnesses, analyses of samples taken from the sites of the attacks, as well as review of symptoms reported by those affected and medical staff, along with examination of imagery, including satellite images.Germany’s deputy UN ambassador Jurgen Schulz told the council: “Accountability is essential and impunity for these heinous crimes is not an option.”Responding to Russia without naming it, he said, “Now is definitely not the time to repeat old and invent new, unsubstantiated claims to undermine the OPCW’s legitimacy,” or “the professionalism, objectivity, impartiality and independence” of its technical experts.Estonia’s UN Ambassador Sven Jürgenson supported the report’s findings, condemned “the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,” and said “those responsible must be held accountable.”“Without accountability, the atrocities will continue, if not by the Syrian regime, then by others emboldened by the ability to use these horrendous weapons to hold onto power,” Jurgenson said. “We, therefore, call on the states parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Security Council to act decisively and in a united manner to respond to the findings of this report.”Britain’s deputy UN ambassador Jonathan Allen said the OPCW’s investigation adds to the evidence of two previous UN -mandated investigations that found the Syrian government responsible for using chemical weapons against its own people on at least four occasions.Allen said he took note of the Russian ambassador’s statement “but the problem is, one cannot just assert what one wants to be true in the face of evidence, which may well be inconvenient evidence to the contrary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-clashes-with-europeans-over-syria-chemical-weapons/story-408BsEKLhfZGl5R3KB9yIL.html

Haunted by what the city endured during the past few months, people have an abiding fear of a second wave of contagion, although new cases have slowed to a trickle in recent weeks.But, the prolonged vigilance and control over movement has also raised questions over how long the watch over people’s lives could last and whether the city will truly return to normal.Click here for Covid-19 updates“We still don’t let residents go out, only those who have resumed work can go out if they have a green health code,” Feng, who runs a team of 14 community workers, told reporters last week during a government-arranged tour.At that time, Tanhualin had been free of infections for 45 days. In all, the neighbourhood had counted 26 cases of the virus during the epidemic, the first one was identified in January.Asked if her committee had relaxed its management since the lockdown ended, Feng was categoric in her response.“Not at all!”, she said. “Our residents are extremely united, extremely hardworking and are fighting side by side with us. They listen to all our arrangements.”KNOW EVERYTHINGThe committees’ work during the outbreak extended to keeping detailed records of residents’ health, carrying out daily body temperature checks and making sure any slight discomfort, such as a cough or headache, is reported.They also played a key role in keeping a 24-hour watch on people trying to enter or leave their compounds, and assigning someone to accompany family members of deceased coronavirus victims on visits to lay ashes at cemeteries.Reuters reporters in Wuhan found that some compounds were more rigorously managed than others.Many residents also said they were happy to comply with the prolonged oversight, given that it had proven effective in controlling the spread of the virus. Still, some indicated they were growing weary of the intrusion.“What I really want to say is, the lifting of the lockdown is not a true one, neighbourhoods are still imposing curbs, restricting people from going out,” one resident posted on Weibo on April 13.Rising worries about asymptomatic cases and the possibility of a second wave of infections mean that the residential committees may maintain their vigilance for a while longer.Peng Jing, who runs the residential committee in the Shuianxingcheng neighbourhood, said it had immediately sprung into action after discovering an asymptomatic case on April 11, which prompted them to send the patient’s mother quickly to a quarantine centre and notify the area’s 11,000 residents.“We believe our government will notify us first thing when we can end the sealing off of the neighbourhoods,” she said on Wednesday during a small government-organised group interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-lifted-wuhan-s-residence-committees-keep-watch/story-yn3hWLy4L5alEQOHdZyFdI.html

16-04-2020||World||Coronavirus testing in the United States: What you need to know||Before lifting lockdowns imposed across the United States in March, experts say we’ll need a massive screening system in place to monitor and respond to localized coronavirus surges.Are we on track? That depends on who you ask.President Donald Trump has boasted the US has “the best testing system in the world.”Chuck Schumer, the leader of the opposition Democrats in the Senate, disagrees. “It remains clear that the country’s testing capabilities are dangerously inadequate,” he said Wednesday.Here is a guide to tests in place in the US, which had as of Wednesday more than 600,000 confirmed cases and almost 28,000 deaths from Covid-19.How many The US has carried out some 3.2 million tests as of Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The number began to soar in late March, and is currently growing by about a million per week.In absolute terms, that is far more than any other country. Italy has tested about a million, and South Korea around 500,000, according to Our World in Data.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThis website compiles data from around the globe with the important caveat that the data is somewhat imprecise.Some countries declare the total number of tests performed and others on the number of people, and these differ because a person can be tested several times. In the US, the accounting differs from state to state.But the picture looks different when you account for population. The US is a huge nation with some 330 million people, meaning that the Italians and South Koreans have tested more people per capita: 18 and 10 people per 1000, respectively, compared to nine in a 1000 in the US.Iceland, with just 364,000 people, has tested about 10 percent of its population.Early problemsTests were only carried out at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta until the end of February, with no other public or private labs around the country authorized to do the same.That changed on February 29 -- but it took time for the biggest private companies, Labcorp and Quest, to obtain the chemicals needed to get their kits into the market.At the start of April, an official at a Virginia hospital told AFP it was taking five to seven days to receive their results.But these delays have now been eliminated, said the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which said there’s considerable excess capacity.Rapid tests have also arrived on the market, using machines that are already present in clinics that deliver results within 15 minutes.One problem remains: in a number of places, for example the capital Washington, you can’t get a test unless you have symptoms -- even though we know now many carriers are asymptomatic.CostTesting is supposed to be free, following a law passed by Congress on March 18.Antibody testsMuch hope is pinned on newly approved serological tests, which can tell whether a person was previously infected long after they recovered by looking for the presence of antibodies that fought the coronavirus.In theory, these could also help decide which people can return to society because they may now be immune.New York’s governor said Wednesday the state had developed its own antibody test, and first responders and essential workers would be prioritized.But they are not yet widely available and major questions surround their reliability. The FDA has approved several recently.And right now we don’t know whether prior infection confers immunity, and if so for how long.Medical giant Abbott announced Wednesday that it will ship one million of the tests, with a total of four million by the end of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-testing-in-the-united-states-what-you-need-to-know/story-y75394CeHwBkiV7qRYhFiK.html

He said that the time for “reflections on various institutions” will arrive once the current coronavirus crisis has been dealt with.While US President Donald Trump has halted funding to the UN health body, Washington has not put any pressure on Ottawa to follow the suit. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Trudeau said Canadian authorities will “always continue to work with experts both domestically and internationally.” However, he did not rule out an assessment of the role played by the WHO during the Covid-19 crisis in the future, as he said, “Of course in the coming months and years there will be many reflections on various institutions.” At this point, however, he said, the “focus needs to be on doing the best we can right now to protect Canadians.” Trudeau’s words came even as a chorus of criticism directed at WHO has erupted in Canada, which became sharper after a WHO expert absented himself at the last minute from a scheduled appearance before a House of Commons committee.Also read: Stranded Canadians returning home to face strict action on not following self-isolationHis statement comes at a time when Canada has recorded over 1,000 deaths from Covid-19, including a surge in numbers from long-term care homes. Given the circumstances, Trudeau warned it will be “weeks more” before any semblance of normalcy can return. “It would be terrible if we were to release restrictions too early and find out we’re suddenly back in another big wave of Covid-19,” he said.Trudeau himself has had to face criticism that he may have violated several Federal and provincial guidelines when he spent the Easter weekend holiday with his wife and children at a lakeside cottage in Quebec while he had cautioned Canadians against joining their families for the holiday and asked them to make the sacrifice and instead celebrate a family dinner remotely via Skype.

Results are still not in from a third of the tests.“Thirty one personnel are today in hospital,” it said in a statement. “More tests are being carried out.”The carrier, which had most recently been taking part in exercises with northern European navies in the Baltic Sea, arrived home in Toulon two weeks earlier than expected after about 40 crew members showed signs of Covid-19 symptoms.Sick crew members had been placed under strict medical observation on board the nuclear-powered carrier and a team equipped to carry out the first tests airlifted to the vessel.Crew from the Charles de Gaulle and the frigate Chevalier Paul were now in confinement within their naval base, while the pilots of the carrier’s warplanes and helicopters were also in quarantine. The navy chief had ordered an investigation, the ministry said.The Charles de Gaulle set sail for the eastern Mediterranean on Jan. 21 to support French military operations against Islamist militants in Iraq and Syria, before deploying to the Atlantic and then the Baltic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-spreads-on-french-aircraft-carrier-hundreds-infected/story-qZiXhJaHwdpVOOMRoWxYPL.html
16-04-2020||World||Evidence of virus’ effect on US economy grows more ominous||Evidence of the coronavirus’ devastating impact on the US economy has been steadily emerging, and the signs have grown ominous.Sales at stores and restaurants plunged in March by the largest amount on records dating back to 1992. The nation’s industrial output fell by the largest amount since the end of World War II. And the outbreak keeps ravaging the global oil market.That was just Wednesday’s news.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “You don’t want to look, but you know you have to.” The picture will likely worsen in the coming weeks and months. Retail sales — a primary driver of the U.S. economy — are almost surely suffering further during April because business shutdowns will have been in effect for the entire month, compared with just half of March.Sales of homes and cars will also keep declining. And economists have forecast that Thursday’s weekly report on applications for unemployment benefits will show that millions of Americans sought jobless aid last week, on top of the record-high of nearly 17 million who filed in the previous three weeks.Economists now project a record-shattering 40% annual decline in US economic output for the April-June quarter. While growth is expected to rebound in the second half of the year, economists at JPMorgan Chase have forecast that the U.S. economy will still shrink 7% for 2020 as a whole.The slowdown will be global. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday predicted that the world economy would shrink 3% this year, the worst outcome since the Great Depression.That is hammering oil prices, threatening the solvency of many oil drillers and putting many of their employees out of work. Global demand for oil will fall this year by the most ever due to economic lockdowns around the world, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday. Demand will drop an estimated 9.3 million barrels a day, which is equivalent to a decade’s worth of growth.In the U.S., consumer spending drives more than two-thirds of the economy and was one of the main pillars of support before the virus. Business investment in new plants and equipment had already pulled back in the face of the U.S.-China trade war and falling oil prices.On Wednesday, the government said U.S. retail sales plummeted 8.7% in March, an unprecedented decline, as the outbreak brought most commerce to a halt.The deterioration of sales far outpaced the previous record decline of 3.9% that took place during the depths of the Great Recession in November 2008. Auto sales dropped 25.6%, while clothing store sales collapsed, sliding 50.5%. Restaurants and bars reported a nearly 27% fall in revenue.Spending may be falling at an even faster pace than the retail sales figures suggest. Wednesday’s report did not include spending on services such as hotel stays, airline tickets or movie theaters.Also Wednesday, the U.S. reported that industrial production, which includes manufacturing, mines and utilities, posted the biggest drop in March since 1946.Manufacturing output dropped 6.3% last month, led by plunging production at auto factories that have shut down. Output dropped 3.9% at utilities and 2% at mines as oil and gas drilling plunged.And builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes has fallen off a cliff, according to an index released Wednesday by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. Their monthly housing market index plunged 42 points in April to a reading of 30, the largest single monthly change in the history of the index.Retail sales represent about one-third of consumer spending, with the rest consisting of services. But the damage to the sector has broader ramifications for the economy.The retail industry supports 1 out of 4 jobs in the U.S., according to some estimates. That includes millions of jobs like delivery workers, tailors, vendors who supply hangers to store fixtures, and construction workers charged with renovating or building new stores.“A lot of the economy is driven by the consumer,” said Neil Saunders, managing dierctor of GlobalData Retail, a research firm. “The consumer is the linchpin. If the consumer takes a tumble, the rest of the economy falls down.” Stockpiling of essentials is starting to wane, Saunders said, which will also lower retail sales in April, and more grocery stores are limiting the number of shoppers in their locations. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, is now allowing no more than five customers for each 1,000 square feet at a given time. That will reduce their stores’ capacity by about 80%.The pullback in spending intensifies the problems facing brick-and-mortar retailers, which were already struggling with online competition.With a nationwide shutdown of malls and most stores, the pandemic is putting many clothing retailers in peril, while increasing the dominance of big box stores that have remained open during the pandemic because they sell essentials like food and household goods.More than 250,000 stores, including Macy’s, Nordstrom and Nike, which sell nonessential merchandise, have been shuttered since mid-March. That’s 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, Saunders said.Major retailers including J.C. Penney, Macy’s and Nordstrom have furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers, while Walmart and Amazon are on hiring sprees to try to meet the surging demand of shoppers buying online or for curbside drop-off or delivery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evidence-of-virus-effect-on-us-economy-grows-more-ominous/story-MWkhV0vXqFrPwEkf8Cx1JK.html

16-04-2020||World||Elizabeth Warren becomes latest ex-presidential rival to back Joe Biden||Elizabeth Warren endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, the latest of the former vice president’s onetime White House rivals to back him as the Democratic Party moves to project unity against President Donald Trump going into the November election.“Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence, and heart will save lives and save livelihoods,” Warren said in a nearly four-minute video announcing her decision. “And we can’t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American.”The Massachusetts senator rose to brief front-runner status in the Democratic race last fall but suspended her campaign last month after a disappointing “Super Tuesday” that included a third-place finish her home state. Warren left the race without endorsing Biden or her fellow progressive Bernie Sanders — but the dynamics changed substantially in subsequent weeks, with campaigning forced into a hiatus amid the coronavirus outbreak.Sanders dropped out last week and endorsed Biden within days, hoping to persuade his fervent progressive supporters to warm to the more centrist Biden. Former President Barack Obama followed suit on Tuesday. Warren’s formal backing doesn’t carry the political heft it might have if she had endorsed Biden over Sanders weeks ago. Nonetheless, her announcement now could fuel speculation that Biden may choose her as a running mate.Indeed, Warren said Wednesday night on MSNBC that she would accept the vice president position if Biden offered it to her.Biden has said he soon will announce a committee to oversee his vice presidential search.Biden saluted Warren for the series of detailed policy proposals she released as a candidate and said he will count on her to help rebuild the economy once the threat of the coronavirus lifts.“She helped set a high-water mark for what our politics can be at their best — authentic and service-oriented, focused on how we can deliver the most help to the most people,” he said in a statement. “I am proud to have Senator Warren in my corner for the fight ahead — not just as we work to defeat Donald Trump in November, but in the years to come, as we push through a bold and progressive policy agenda for the American people.”Warren referred to the pandemic more directly in a tweet. “In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government — and I’ve seen Joe Biden help our nation rebuild. Today, I’m proud to endorse @JoeBiden as President of the United States,” she said.Some of Warren’s allies note that, in the days before her endorsement, Biden embraced some of the senator’s plans to combat the coronavirus, including calls to cancel student debt and expand Social Security benefits during the crisis. He also has adopted a plan she promoted as a candidate to overhaul the nation’s bankruptcy system.In her video, Warren also referenced the pair’s sometimes rocky relationship. They clashed in 2005, when Biden was a Delaware senator and Warren was a Harvard Law School professor and bankruptcy expert, during a congressional hearing over a bankruptcy bill. It was a scene that Biden, as vice president, recalled when he swore Warren into office eight years later.“Joe Biden was there at the very moment I became a Senator,” Warren said. “And when he did, he said ‘you gave me hell! And you’re gonna do a great job.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elizabeth-warren-becomes-latest-ex-presidential-rival-to-back-joe-biden/story-eNLL8xNkRB8cQDqbYBTfeI.html

The agency is prepared to commit its full $1 trillion in lending capacity to meet the demand, she said.“It is a crisis like no other,” Georgieva told reporters, reiterating her agency’s assessment that the global economy is in its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageGeorgieva spoke at a news conference as the Washington-based IMF and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, began its spring meetings, being held remotely this year.She and World Bank President David Malpass both praised a decision taken Wednesday by the finance ministers and central bank presidents of the Group of 20 major industrial countries to declare a suspension of debt payments for low income countries.Click here to follow Covid-19 updatesThe debt suspension from May 1 through the end of this year is aimed at allowing poor countries to keep an estimated $12 billion that they can use for meeting health care and other needs stemming from the coronavirus.In a new economic outlook prepared for this week’s discussions, the IMF forecast that the global economy will shrink by 3% this year, far greater than the 0.1% dip that occurred in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.Georgieva said that the IMF has already doubled its emergency assistance programs from $50 billion up to $100 billion. At the same time, the agency is preparing to assist to restart economic growth as countries emerge from the crisis.“We need to think of the challenges we will face on the other side of this crisis,” she said, noting the likelihood of elevated levels of debt and rising bankruptcies in many nations.It is important that the IMF and individual governments put measures in place to deal with those issues, she said.As part of the meetings, the IMF’s policy committee will meet Thursday, with the sessions closing on Friday with a news conference by Malpass following a meeting of the World Bank’s policy panel.

16-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Donald Trump looks to ease distancing in places; CEOs urge caution||President Donald Trump said Wednesday he’s prepared to announce new guidelines allowing some states to quickly ease up on social distancing even as business leaders told him they need more coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment before people can safely go back to work.The industry executives cautioned Trump that the return to normalcy will be anything but swift.The new guidelines, expected to be announced Thursday, are aimed at clearing the way for an easing of restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while keeping them in place in harder-hit places. The ultimate decisions will remain with governors.“We’ll be opening some states much sooner than others,” Trump said.But in a round of calls with business leaders Wednesday, Trump was warned that a dramatic increasing in testing and wider availability of protective equipment will be necessary for the safe restoration of their operations.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe new guidelines come as the federal government envisions a gradual recovery from the virus, in which disruptive mitigation measures may be needed in some places at least until a vaccine is available — a milestone unlikely to be reached until sometime next year.Trump said at his daily briefing that data indicates the U.S. is “past the peak” of the COVID-19 epidemic, clearing the way for his plans to roll out guidelines to begin to “reopen” the country.He called the latest data “encouraging,” saying the numbers have “put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country.” Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, added that data from across the country showed the nation “improving,” but that Americans had to recommit to social distancing to keep up the positive momentum.She said nine states have fewer than 1,000 cases and just a few dozen new cases per day. She said those would likely be the first to see a lifting in social distancing restrictions at the direction of their governors under the guidelines set to be released Thursday.Birx said the White House was particularly concerned about Rhode Island, noting it is now seeing a surge in cases from the Boston metro area after seeing a spike several weeks ago from cases from New York.Trump consulted dozens of high-profile CEOs, union officials and other executives via conference calls Wednesday.He received a mixed message from the industry leaders. They, too, said they want to get the economy going but had worries about how to safely do so.In a tweet midway through Trump’s round of conference calls with the executives, the president said the participants were “all-in on getting America back to work, and soon.” But participants in a morning call that included dozens of leading American companies raised concerns about the testing issue, according to one participant who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussion.Another person who participated in Wednesday’s calls said it was stressed to Trump that expansion of testing and contact tracing was crucial, as well as guidelines for best practices on reopening businesses in phases or in one fell swoop.The participant said those on the call noted to the administration that there was about to be a massive rush on personal protective equipment. Many businesses that are now shuttered will need the protective equipment to keep their employees and customers safe.Trump was told “the economy will look very different and operations will look very different,” one participant said.Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, was among several representatives from major sports leagues to speak with Trump. During a Fox News interview ahead of the calls, he credited the president with gathering some of the “best of the best” to help shape his approach on reopening the economy. Still, Cuban did not embrace Trump’s push to reopen parts of the economy May 1.“This is such a moving target that I think the biggest mistake we can make is rush to a decision,” said Cuban, who previously had been critical of Trump’s response to the pandemic. “But I’m going to help him in every way I can, whatever he needs me to do.” The panel, which Trump dubbed the new Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups, also could help give Trump a measure of cover. If cases surge once restrictions are lifted, as many experts have warned, Trump will be able to tell the public he didn’t act alone and the nation’s top minds — from manufacturing to defense to technology — helped shape the plan.Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, who participated in one of the calls with Trump, said there was also discussion about tax relief as well as “making sure that people are optimistic about the economy and they feel safe coming back to work.” “I think you’ll see steps to reopen the country at different rates in different states in the not too distant future,” Nolan said.The launch of the council was not without hiccups.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka didn’t know until he heard his name announced in the Rose Garden on Tuesday that he would be part of the advisory group, according to Carolyn Bobb, a spokeswoman for the union.“We were not asked,” Bobb said in an email. It was “just announced.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Trump has appointed some “smart people” to his task force who could offer state leaders helpful guidelines as they negotiate the way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-donald-trump-looks-to-ease-distancing-in-places-ceos-urge-caution/story-IYuHoxZukHYZ3jRqSL4SBK.html
16-04-2020||World||Covid-19: New York to require face coverings in busy public places||Even as politicians talk about “reopening” the country, New York is still intensifying restrictions intended to stop the coronavirus from spreading.Face coverings will be now be required in any place where people can’t stay at least six feet away from other people. While other isolation measures seem to have worked in keeping new infections down, New Yorkers continue to die by the hundreds every day. Meanwhile, New York City officials said they would create an emergency food reserve and take other steps to fight hunger in a city where huge numbers of people have been thrown out of work.Here are the latest coronavirus developments in New York:FACE COVERINGSNew York residents will be required to wear face coverings anytime they come into close contact with other people outside their homes, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.The mandate will require a mask or face covering, like a bandanna, on busy streets, public transit, or any situation where people cannot maintain 6 feet of social distancing, even if it is passing a person briefly on a wooded trail. The order takes effect Friday.“Stopping the spread is everything. How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?” Cuomo said at his daily briefing. “On what theory would you not do that?”The governor, who has himself eschewed masks during his daily news briefings, though he comes within six feet of his staff, said there will initially be no civil penalties for noncompliance, but he’s urging merchants to enforce it among customers.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThough hospitalizations from the outbreak have leveled off, New York officials are still trying to reduce the rising death toll. New York recorded 752 deaths Tuesday, for a total of nearly 11,600 since the outbreak began.Those figures don’t include roughly 4,000 more deaths in New York City that city officials say were probably caused by the virus, but haven’t been confirmed by a lab test.Cuomo’s announcement came hours after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called for stores to make customers wear face coverings in order to protect workers against exposure. De Blasio had previously recommended face coverings in public in the city.The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.FOOD PLANIn a city where 1.2 million residents — including one in five children — struggle at times to feed themselves, the number is expected to grow as an estimated half-million New Yorkers have lost or are likely to lose their jobs soon.“We will make sure everyone gets the food they need,” de Blasio said in unveiling a $170 million plan to help.The city already is handing out 250,000 free meals a day at schools and delivering 25,000 a day to senior citizens. Officials expect to provide 10 million free meals in April and expect the need to grow to as much as 15 million in May.Meanwhile, the city has contacted some 11,000 taxi and livery drivers — whose livelihoods have been shattered as people stay home — to hire them to deliver meals to those who can’t leave home.While officials said the city food supply is stable, they also plan to create a $50 million reserve of as many as 18 million shelf-stable meals.NURSING HOMESThe virus has been unmerciful on nursing homes, killing 2,500 patients in just a few weeks, but so far New York state has refused to disclose the names of facilities where people have died.State officials took one step toward transparency Wednesday, saying they will now require facilities to tell residents and their families within 24 hours if another patient at the home has contracted the virus or died. The upcoming executive order also will include adult homes, where more than 580 people have died.But the state will continue to withhold the names of nursing homes that have experienced severe outbreaks from others, saying patients deserve privacy.The change was intended to help people like Cindy Coughlin, who told The Associated Press she’s struggled to get information about whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak at the nursing home in Johnson City where her 83-year-old father in-law resides.Coughlin said she’s at a loss to understand how the public release of information would endanger anyone’s privacy.“I wish they would do that,” Coughlin said. “I don’t’ know if it would make you feel worse or better, but I think I’d feel a lot better knowing there was only 5 cases there instead of 25. I guess that’s one thing I can’t understand.”THE ECONOMIC EQUATIONCuomo said getting people back to work safely before a vaccine is developed will require not only large-scale testing, but tracing the personal contacts of people who test positive and isolating infected people.But testing and tracing people in a state of 19 million is not possible without federal help, he said.“That is a massive undertaking,” he said. “It’s intelligent but it’s massive.”In the meantime, New York will begin testing 2,000 people a day for virus antibodies this week via a newly developed finger-prick test. Priority will be given to nurses, New York City police and other first responders, so they can know if they’ve been infected.Both Cuomo and de Blasio said leaders need to be deliberative about trying to rev up the economy without creating an opportunity for the coronavirus to come roaring back.“I want to restart the economy desperately ... but the best way to do it is to be careful,” de Blasio said.Cuomo said the state could consider lifting restrictions first for businesses that pose a lesser risk of infection and are considered more “essential.”OUT OF PRISONFormer New York state Senate leader Dean Skelos was expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus.Skelos has been serving a four-year and three-month prison term after he was convicted of extortion, wire fraud and bribery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-to-require-face-coverings-in-busy-public-places/story-QgmY1CblCqHuQhOSMWjINM.html
16-04-2020||World||IMF backs India’s ‘proactive’ Covid-19 response||The International Monetary Fund Wednesday said that it supports India’s proactive decision of a imposing a nationwide lockdown in its fight against coronavirus.A day earlier, the IMF in its World Economic Outlook had forecast India’s growth rate to be 1.9 per cent in 2020.“India entered the pandemic turmoil in the midst of a credit crunch-induced slowdown and its recovery prospect becomes more uncertain,” Chang Yong Rhee, the Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department, told reporters during a news conference here.“Despite the economic slowdown, the government implemented a nationwide lockdown and we support India’s proactive decision,” Rhee said. On March 25, India entered a three-week lockdown, which was slated to end on April 14. The lockdown was extended till May 3.The impact of the coronavirus on the Asia-Pacific region will be severe, across the board, and unprecedented, he said, adding that Asia’s growth in 2020 will come to a standstill.This is worse than the annual average growth rates throughout the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 percent) or the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 percent). Actually, Asia has not experienced zero growth in the last 60 years, he said. “That said, Asia’s growth still fares better than other regions.” For 2021, he said, there is hope. If containment policies succeed there could be a rebound in growth, he said. However, it is highly uncertain how this year will progress, he added.Noting that this is not a time for business as usual, Rhee said that Asian countries need to use all policy instruments in their toolkits. In doing so, policy tradeoffs will be inevitable and will depend on policy space, he added.China is expected to grow by 1.2 percent in 2020. The revisions to growth reflect both losses of domestic activity due to the social distancing measures, as well as loss of external demand.“We expect a rebound in economic activity later this year. This is because China is emerging from the outbreak first. Nonetheless, there are clear risks: the virus could come back and normalization could take longer,” Rhee said.Japan’s economic outlook for 2020 has deteriorated significantly, he said. Real GDP in Japan is expected to decline by 5.2 percent, caused by the coronavirus impact, and a sharp deterioration of external demand, he said, adding South Korea’s growth in 2020 is anticipate to be at -1.2 percent, he said.Spelling out a set of recommendations for the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Rhee said the first priority is to support and protect the health sector to contain the virus and introduce measures that slow contagion.“If there is not enough fiscal space, countries will need to re-prioritize from other expenditures,” he said.Noting that containment measures are severely affecting economies, he said targeted support to hardest-hit households and firms is needed. This is a real economic shock unlike the Global Financial Crisis. Protect people, jobs and industries directly, not just through financial institutions, he said.Observing that the pandemic is also affecting the financial market functioning, he urged countries to use monetary and macroprudential regulations flexibly to provide ample liquidity, ease financial stress of industries and SMEs.“For emerging markets with limited fiscal space, they might need to consider how to use central bank balance sheets flexibly to help SMEs through risk sharing with the government,” he said.Asserting that external pressures need to be contained, he said that countries should seek and utilize bilateral and multilateral swap lines and financial support from the multilateral institutions.“There can be a role for capital flow measures to secure external sector stability as a prerequisite to use more aggressive domestic policies to prevent lasting social and economic distress,” he said. “Targeted support combined with domestic demand stimulus in a recovery will help to reduce scarring, but it needs to reach people and smaller firms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-backs-india-s-proactive-covid-19-response/story-4keOouBa2enFImE245aF0H.html

16-04-2020||World||Only a Covid-19 vaccine will allow return to ‘normalcy’, says UN chief||A Covid-19 vaccine may be the only thing that can bring back “normalcy,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday, hoping for just that before the end of the year. “A safe and effective vaccine may be the only tool that can return the world to a sense of ‘normalcy,’ saving millions of lives and countless trillions of dollars,” he added during a video conference with the 50 or so African countries that are members of the United Nations.He called for its accelerated development and accessibility to all, adding it must have a “universal global benefit” and “allow us to control the pandemic.” “We need an ambitious effort to ensure that international stakeholders operate through a harmonized, integrated and leveraged approach to maximize the speed and scale needed for the universal deployment of such a vaccine by the end of 2020,” he insisted. Guterres said his appeal on March 25 for $2 billion in donations for a comprehensive UN humanitarian response to the pandemic had so far raised about 20 percent of that amount. Through the World Health Organization, the United Nations has been able to equip 47 African countries with Covid-19 tests, he said. The UN chief also praised the efforts of several African governments to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.He cited Uganda, which has given businesses more time to file their tax returns; Namibia, which provides emergency income for workers who have lost their jobs; Cape Verde, which provides food aid; and Egypt, which has reduced taxation on industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-a-covid-19-vaccine-will-allow-return-to-normalcy-says-un-chief/story-evGk0EvKnJDYiwIF9p9ahI.html
16-04-2020||World||South Korea’s ruling party wins general elections amid Covid-19 pandemic||South Korea’s left-leaning ruling party won a landslide victory in Wednesday’s general election, partial results showed, after the coronavirus pandemic turned the political tide in President Moon Jae-in’s favour.The country uses a mix of first-past-the-post seats and proportional representation, but even before all the individual constituencies were decided, Moon’s Democratic party had taken 163 seats in the 300-member National Assembly, an absolute majority.Its sister party was expected to win another 17 proportional representation seats -- due to be declared later Thursday -- for a total of 180.The main conservative opposition United Future Party (UFP) and its satellite party were forecast to secure a total of 97 seats.Turnout was 66.2 percent, higher than any parliamentary elections held in the South since 1992.Just a few months ago scandals over power abuse and sluggish economic growth threatened the left-leaning president, with critics calling his dovish approach towards North Korea -- despite Pyongyang’s abandonment of its nuclear and ballistic missile test moratoriums -- unrealistic.But the South’s relatively quick and effective handling of the epidemic -- it has also exported test kits to at least 20 countries -- has been a boon for Moon ahead of the parliamentary elections, largely seen as a referendum on his performance.And his so-called “coronavirus diplomacy” -- such as recent publicity on his bilateral phone calls with at least 20 state leaders regarding epidemic response -- boosted Koreans’ confidence in his administration, said Minseon Ku, a politics scholar at Ohio State University in the United States.She added that the leader has been successfully framing the pandemic as an “opportunity for South Korea to restructure its economy -- capitalizing on industries like AI and biopharma” and this “coupled with South Korea’s global recognition” for its handling of the outbreak sat well with the voters.South Korea was among the first countries to hold a national election during the pandemic, with citizens still being asked to maintain social distancing after enduring one of the worst early outbreaks of the virus.All voters were required to wear protective masks, clean their hands with sanitiser and don plastic gloves, and undergo temperature checks on arrival at the polling station.Those found to have fevers cast their ballots in separate booths that were disinfected after each user.The absolute majority win means Moon is likely to be less of a lame duck than previous presidents toward the end of their single five-year term.“It should give his administration greater momentum,” said Andrew Yeo, a politics professor at the Catholic University of America.Meanwhile UFP heavyweights former prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn and ex-parliamentary floor leader Na Kyung-won failed to be re-elected.The conservative party had “failed to rebrand” itself after the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, which “limited the boundary of support to older generations and core support regions”, Ji Yeon Hong, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told AFP.But while the pandemic took public attention away from the opposition’s criticisms, it would be “dangerous” if Moon interprets the election as “vindicating foreign policies that aren’t working”, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.“Seoul’s engagement of Pyongyang has been met with diplomatic insults and missile tests. Placating China has yielded little benefit,” he told AFP.“Talking tough on Japan has not advanced South Korean interests. And progressives want to accelerate military command reforms and resist cost-sharing pressures in Seoul’s alliance with Washington.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-ruling-party-wins-general-elections-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-CDjw57eFJMQBrODVgrCucI.html
16-04-2020||World||War veteran, 99, raises £10 million in outbreak of altruism||A humble attempt by a 99-year-old war veteran to raise £1,000 as a tribute to doctors and nurses has blown into an outbreak of altruism as people in the UK and around the globe hunkered down in lockdowns showered £10 million by Wednesday evening that went beyond his ‘wildest dreams’.Yorkshire-based Captain Tom Moore, who saw action in India during World War II, promised to walk 10 laps of his garden with a walking aid, hoping to raise £1,000 as a way to reward doctors and nurses who helped him recover from skin cancer and him replacement.The target was passed within hours of Moore launching his effort on April 8, and on Wednesday morning it touched £5 million live on BBC television. By the evening, millions more poured in, reaching £10 million, donated by over 5 lakh people online.Moore is walking 10 laps of the garden a day and had hoped to hit 100 laps in time for his 100th birthday on April 30. Health secretary Matt Hancock paid him tributes: “Captain Tom, you’re an inspiration to us all, and we thank you.”Blown away by the millions, Moore said: “I think that’s absolutely enormous. At no time when we started off with this exercise did we anticipate we’d get anything near that sort of money…Our brave nurses and doctors are frontline in this case”.“This time our army are in doctors and nurses uniforms and they’re doing a marvellous job. It just shows that people have such high regard for matters of our NHS and it’s really amazing that people have paid so much money. It’s almost unbelievable isn’t it,” he said from his home in Keighley.The money raised will be donated to NHS Charities Together, a group representing various charity organisations linked to the NHS.Moore’s daughter, Hannah, said her father was overwhelmed when the figure reached the first £1 million, but he responded with a determination to walk more: “He’s a typical Yorkshireman, so he’s very stoic, very controlled and takes everything in his stride.”“We always knew that he was this incredible gem of a man, but we never had any idea that his story would capture the hearts of the nation. We thought we could give people a little bit of happy and we wanted to share a little bit about him, and it has just gone beyond even our wildest, wildest dreams.”As the death toll in the UK approached 13,000 and 1 lakh cases, there is an outpouring of gratitude and concern for NHS staff dealing with growing numbers of people stricken with coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/war-veteran-99-raises-10-million-in-outbreak-of-altruism/story-ogCNH0KKDOGu1kpz8WYllI.html
16-04-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak: Deadliest day for America||Coronavirus deaths in the US rose by at least 2,228 on Tuesday, a single-day record, to top 27,000 as officials debated how to reopen the economy without reigniting the outbreak. The previous single-day record was 2,069, set last Friday.The US, with the world’s third-largest population, passed a second milestone on Tuesday with over 600,000 reported cases, three times more than any other country. New York City’s health department, meanwhile, said the death toll is now over 10,000, including the 3,700 deaths added on Tuesday. Health officials have cautioned that deaths are a “lagging indicator” and do not mean that the sweeping stay-at-home restrictions are a failure. New York state and some other hard-hit areas continue to report sharp decreases in hospitalisations and patients on ventilators. Health experts had forecast deaths would peak this week but there had been hopes the worst was behind the US when new deaths reported on Sunday and Monday were about 1,500 per day, far below last week’s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours, according to a Reuters tally. With schools and many businesses shuttered, the measures to slow the spread of the illness have taken a painful toll on the economy. The shutdown is costing the US economy perhaps $25 billion a day in lost output, St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said.In NYC, the 60% spike in reported deaths underscored the enormous losses endured in the nation’s most populous city, where the sounds of wailing sirens have echoed almost non-stop through largely empty streets for weeks.The city’s revised count, 10,367 in all, took the number of coronavirus deaths nationwide towards 30,000 - New York accounting for the biggest share of deaths.New York City’s health department said it will now also count any fatality deemed a “probable” coronavirus death, defined as a victim whose “death certificate lists as a cause of death ‘Covid-19’ or an equivalent.”March 11 was used as the starting point because that was the date of the first confirmed coronavirus death, the city said.“Behind every death is a friend, a family member, a loved on,” said health commissioner Oxiris Barbot. “We are focused on ensuring that every New Yorker who died because of Covid-19 gets counted.”The new approach in NYC could pave the way for similar policies across the country, possibly leading to a surge in reported US coronavirus fatalities.Louisiana, another hot spot, and California also reported record daily spikes in deaths on Tuesday, despite signs across the country in recent days the outbreak was beginning to ebb.New York governor Mario Cuomo, whose state’s health care network was strained to breaking point by a wave of Covid-19 hospitalisations, had said on Monday it appeared “the worst is over”. New York state and some other hard-hit areas continue to report sharp decreases in hospitalisations and numbers of patients on ventilators, although front-line healthcare workers and resources remained under extraordinary stress.Meanwhile, the US government has been pushing for reopening the country and the economy and President Donald Trump unveiled on Tuesday bipartisan groups of advisers he will be consulting to determine the way forward. The decision to end or continue social-distancing and other mitigation efforts would rest ultimately with state governors. Trump acknowledged as much on Tuesday, dialling down a feud with governors, some of whom have pushed back against his claims of “total” authority in deciding when to end the curbs, and threatened to defy him if he persisted.In another development, The Washington Post reported that Trump’s name will be printed on checks the US treasury will send out to American families as part of a $2.2tn stimulus package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-deadliest-day-for-america/story-Od7puTnAsvelgfI3OgaWTO.html
16-04-2020||India||Rapid kits finally arrive to test Covid immunity||New Delhi: The much-awaited Rapid Testing Kits, or RTKs, which use antibody-based blood tests for Covid-19, arrived in New Delhi at 11.30am on Thursday after missing their third deadline by a day, and will likely be used to test for coronavirus disease in areas with no or few cases -- the health ministry’s green zones -- according to an official at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The kits will be used to test people with fever, cough, and shortness of breath in 325 districts that are currently unaffected, starting with those that are in states with a high number of Covid-19 cases, explained the official, who asked not to be named. This will be the first mass testing exercise in these districts.“Many states have started dedicated fever clinics; and the samples for rapid testing could either be lifted of people visiting those clinics or cases our front-line workers identify after screening,” added this person.The move will significantly widen testing for Covid-19 in the country, which currently tests around 203 people per million, with most tests restricted to health care workers treating Covid-19 patients, travellers who may have visited countries with a significant number of infections, and people who may have come in contact, directly or indirectly, with an infected person. Much of the testing is also happening in so-called containment areas which are themselves within hot spot districts with either outbreaks or clusters (called red zones by the health ministry) or districts that are not hot spots but with clusters. There are 170 hot spot districts and 207 other districts with clusters According to the health ministry, all other districts are in the green zone. There are around 730 districts in India.ICMR guidelines say antibody test should be run after seven days of illness, as it takes at least five to seven days for antibodies to develop after contracting an infection.“An antibody test is not suited for diagnostic purposes but it is a useful surveillance tool for epidemiological studies,” said the ICMR official. Put otherwise, it is a quick and easy way to understand the extent to which the disease has spread.“These kits are not for early diagnosis as their sensitivity and specificity is lower than RT-PCR tests; it can be used for surveillance purposes, to periodically spot disease trends; to collect data on whether there is an old infection in a section of population or if it is a recent infection; whether the spread is increasing or being successfully contained in places that are termed as hot spots etc,” Dr RR Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, said at a news briefing on Thursday.And since it is cheaper than RT-PCR, it can easily be deployed for mass testing, if required.The consignment has 500,000 antibody testing kits and 100,000 RNA extraction kits. Of the 500,000, 300,000 are from Guangzhou Wondfo and another 200,000 from Zhuhai Livzon. The RNA extraction kits are supplied by MGI Shenzhen.The flight carrying the supplies finally landed in Delhi at around 11.30am on Thursday.After clearing customs, the kits have been moved to ICMR’s main depot at the National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) in Dwarka, which is one of the two main ICMR depots where the orders placed with different suppliers are being received and stored in the cold container unit.“We have created 16 depots across the country for the storage of these kits, from where the supply is distributed regionally. We have just received the kits and the logistics are being worked out at the moment. We can make use of flights and also transport them by road to nearby places,” said the ICMR official.The stock is being initially distributed to 6 regional depots in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Dibrugarh, Bhopal, and Hyderabad, and later to other 10 depots. The supplies are likely to depart Delhi by Friday.According to people familiar with the mater who asked not to be named, India pulled diplomatic strings after the Chinese suppliers missed three deadlines. Demand for the RTKs, which some countries hope to be able to use to decide who is immune and can therefore return to work, has soared. And the Chinese government has tightened its export policies after a large number of kits failing quality tests in other countries, causing some amount of embarrassment to Beijing.“We have been emphasising on having the National Medical Product Administration, China, approval for all items being imported from China. It’s a sort of quality assurance certificate from the Chinese government, and we are rejecting anything that is not certified ,” a second ICMR official said on condition of anonymity.The Indian embassy in Beijing tweeted that “it is important to ensure product quality as well as reasonable and stable prices”. It called on China’s National Medical Products Administration to expedite registration of Chinese firms, especially those with export orders and already licenced by Indian regulatory bodies.The external affairs ministry is also working to obtain testing kits from other countries. “Firm quotations have been obtained from companies in Canada, France, Malaysia, the UK and the US. We have also obtained leads from companies in Germany and Japan,” an official familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.Experts say that India’s decision to introduce antibody testing kits could be a game-changer in its fight against Covid-19.“Rapid testing needs to be ramped up for the country to be able to get back to normalcy. If we want to cover maximum people who have symptoms to know the disease burden, then rapid testing is the solution as it is quicker and cheaper, and helps in achieving the ultimate goal of public health care testing,” said Dr T Jacob John, head of virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.“However, the quality of kits plays a crucial role. It is also a good way of picking infections when we know most of those infected will not show symptoms or depict mild symptoms,” he added.(With inputs from Rezaul H Laskar and Sutirtho Patranobis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-kits-finally-arrive-to-test-covid-immunity/story-173LwyWr8W6PoRxsZV7LII.html

He said 27 patents were discharged and the rise in number of people getting cured was really a positive sign. Out of 394 patients, 247 were discharged and 147 are undergoing treatment in hospitals.He also said the state will approach the Centre to make changes in the classification of virus-hit zones.“There were some discrepancies in the classification of zones and the state will approach the Centre to get them rectified,” he said.The Union Health Ministry had put seven districts in red zone category, six in orange and one in green zone. Kerala recorded the lowest mortality and highest recovery rates and minimum number of cases in the last two weeks, and the new classification had surprised many.“We want the most affected four districts in one category- Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikkode and Malappuram - and less affected in another and least affected and Covid-free districts in third and fourth categories,” he said. Interestingly, Wayanad in north Kerala which has only a single case and Thiruvananthapuram and Pathnamthitta which did not report new cases in the last few days are in the red list. Covid-free Idukki and Kottayam districts are in the orange zone while Kozhikkode that has nine active cases are in the green list.The CM said after April 20 rules will be eased in areas other than hotspots to alleviate the pressure on people. Government and private construction activities will begin under strict guidelines and small industrial activities and traditional sectors will be allowed. Similarly farming and farm-related activities and food processing will start, he said. Hair-cutting saloons will be allowed to open twice a week. He said proprietors of these units will be held responsible for any lapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-new-covid-19-cases-in-kerala-state-to-approach-centre-on-classifications/story-wn1S1MjLaVU1hvVfWfEpiI.html
16-04-2020||India||Telangana reports 50 new Covid-19 cases, minister appeals to Markaz contacts to get tested||With Telangana reporting 50 more Covid-19 cases, including 25 from Hyderabad alone on Thursday, the Telangana government has appealed to the people who had come in contact with returnees from last month’s Tablighi Jamaat conference to get themselves tested for the disease.On Thursday, the number of Covid-19 positive cases touched 700 with 50 new cases and no deaths. State health minister Eatala Rajender said 68 patients who had been undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital were discharged.He said nearly 80 per cent of the 700 cases were linked to the people who had attended the Markaz event organized by the Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin in New Delhi last month. “Though the police and health department authorities had managed to trace a majority of them and got them quarantined, we are of the view that there could still be some Jamaat returnees and their contacts, who are avoiding treatment despite repeated requests,” the state health minister said.“During our door-to-door survey, one person who contracted the virus in Talab Katta area in the old city of Hyderabad transmitted the infection to 20 people. Similarly, six Jamaat returnees had infected 81 people. I request people who have contacted Markaz returnees to come forward. We appeal to you to come to us before the health and police officials come to you,” the health minister said at a news conference.According to a bulletin from the state government on Thursday, 496 people are still undergoing treatment, while a total of 186 people have so far recovered and been discharged, while 18 others have died.Rajender said that the state government is also ensuring all Covid-19 patients who are admitted at the state-run Gandhi hospital, are getting required nutrition and that they are being provided with all the required amenities. “We also have separate wards for children. For women also, we will have separate wards,” he added.The health minister also pointed out that among all of the patients, the 10 Indonesian nationals who were found in Karimnagar district (and who attended the Markaz Nizamuddin congregation), had also travelled to different places, insinuating that they had possibly spread the infection to others. “The district authorities took immediate action there and the situation there has been contained. We are doing that in Hyderabad as well,” Rajender added.Meanwhile, 16 new Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Suryapet district on Thursday, taking the total number of cases in the district to 39, according to district collector T Vinay Krishna Reddy.The development created a flutter in the district since it comes within 24 hours of the Centre’s announcement that the district was an orange zone. The spurt in Covid-19 cases is likely to bring the district under the red zone.Of the 16 positive cases reported on Thursday, 14 were primary contacts of a Covid-19 positive person, a resident of Kothedudem Bazar in the town. All of them are linked to a Markaz returnee. The other two are also contacts of earlier cases – one from Tirumalgiri and another from Aipur village in the district.The health minister said the new state-of-the art hospital for Covid-19 patients at Gachibowli is almost ready and will be inaugurated on April 20. He said the state was ready to handle any number of positive cases. “We are procuring 10 lakh PPEs and 10 lakh N-95 masks. We have given permission to two more private labs for testing of patients and now, we can test 5,000 samples every day,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-reports-50-new-covid-19-cases-minister-appeals-to-markaz-contacts-to-get-tested/story-4XXWOjyNhUct5FakkfaM8I.html

16-04-2020||India||Railways mark its 167th anniversary with no passenger trains on its tracks||At 3.35pm on April 16, 1853 amid a 21-gun salute, three locomotives - Sahib, Sindh and Sultan - chugged off on their maiden trip pulling 14 carriages and ferrying 400 guests from Bori Bunder (now Mumbai) to Thane becoming the first passenger train run by the Central Railways, then known as the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The three locomotives covered 34 km scripting history on the day that the Indian Railways celebrates its anniversary. One hundred sixty seven years later, the national carrier has come to a standstill with no passenger trains plying on its network since 25 days for the first time in its history, thanks to the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus. “Today, 167 years ago with the zeal of ‘never to stop’, the wheels of the first passenger train from Mumbai to Thane started rolling. For the first time, passenger services are stopped for your safety stay indoor and make the nation victorious,” the ministry of railways tweeted. The mammoth rail network of India that runs nearly 14, 000 passenger trains ferrying 23 million passengers daily is not celebrating its ‘rail day’ as it would, perhaps, the first time in its history. “Back in 2002, to celebrate its 150th year we had run a steam engine along the same track from Victoria Terminus station to Thane with all the political stalwarts including the then railway minister Nitish Kumar and chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh. We had recreated that journey, I was the Division Railway Manager then. It has been a great journey,” former railway board chairman Vivek Sahai recalled. Presently the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) heritage building stands in place of the old Bori Bunder railway station and was completed in 1888. There remains no documented photograph of the day, according to the railways. Sahib, Sindh and Sultan were not preserved and their fate remains unknown. Many believe they were scrapped by the British, as was common practice then. The life of a steam locomotive would be 35 years after which they were usually scrapped.“We too tried looking for them but found no record, we believe they may have been scrapped sometime in the early 1900s perhaps during the First World War,” Sahai said.India’s oldest preserved steam locomotive is the 165-year-old Fairy Queen that is kept at the Rewari Locomotive Shed. To commemorate India’s 73rd Independence Day, a heritage special service was hauled by the oldest locomotive in the world from Chennai Egmore to Kodambakkam last year. Since the lockdown, the railways have operated only freight and parcel trains for supplying essential cargo. “It is an important and a momentous day for us. Indian railways has been synonymous with the growth and development and the emergence of modern India. Railways evolved from chugging its first train covering a distance of just 34 km to becoming the fourth largest network in the world. The day the railways doesn’t operate it seems like the world has come to a standstill. Even so, while these are extraordinary times railwaymen have shown exemplary strength in ensuring more than 8 lakh wagons have been deployed across the country since the lockdown operating on just one third of our staff strength,” railway ministry spokesperson said. “Railways’ resolution must be to increase its daily cargo capacity after the pandemic, Sahai said. “Railways are ferrying nearly 1.1 billion tonnes of cargo along with 23 million passengers per day. After this pandemic is over the resolution should be to reach 1.5 billion tonnes load per day. Looking at the journey, railways has played such a major role in Indian history and even after independence. This is the same rail network that is there in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. See where they are now and where we are. We can certainly do better though. With high speed rail coming India will be the third Asian country joining Japan and China,” Sahai added. For now, the national carrier has suspended all train operations till May 3, nor is it taking advance bookings anymore. Passengers will have to wait a while to board a train again and transport, when it resumes, might not be the same anymore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-mark-its-167th-anniversary-with-no-passenger-trains-on-its-tracks/story-aa63uCf66ablcUj6ZabQ1N.html

Chief secretary Rajiv Sinha said Kolkata and Howrah figured in the ‘red zone’ earmarked by the Union health ministry. “Red zones indicate that the number of cases (in the area) is doubling in four days. Many districts are in the orange zone,” he added.Sinha said there are 144 active Covid-19 cases in Bengal on Thursday while 3,811 people had been tested for the infection till date. “On Wednesday, the figure stood at 3,470,” he said.“I cannot understand why the media is biased towards the Centre and is comparing data on different parameters. Rest assured there are no lapses on the part of the state government. The state and the Centre work together,” Sinha said at a press conference at Nabanna, the state secretariat, when he was asked whether door-to-door survey was being done following guidelines of the Union health ministry. He was speaking in the presence of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Agitated by repeated complaints on unavailability of rice and other items at fair price shops, which triggered agitations and road blocks in several districts, Banerjee on Thursday pulled up the civil supplies department and transferred Manoj Agarwal, its secretary. She announced this at the press conference.“There was disruption in supply in around 10 per cent places in the state. We will appoint a new secretary. The ration shop owners were not ready for this crisis. Also, many of them do not have enough space to stock up a month’s quota of ration for enlisted beneficiaries in that area. I have asked the administration to use the premises of local community clubs to disburse ration. As announced, we will give five kg rice to all those who are needy along with pulses. People will get ration for six months free of cost,” said Banerjee.“Let me make it clear that this is government-supplied ration and not anyone’s personal property,” the CM said in a veiled threat to Trinamool Congress workers in some districts who have been accused of using food distribution to gain mileage for local party units. Banerjee also announced that acting on requests from sweet shop owners the government was extending their time of operation from 8 am to 4 pm. Earlier, the shops were allowed to open at 12 pm.On Thursday, the government also allowed online registration of property so that people don’t have to visit registration offices. The chief secretary said people would get a 20 per cent discount on registration fee with the maximum ceiling on the discount fixed at Rs 20,000.Asked how the government was determining death figures, Sinha said, “We list all deaths and these are sent to the audit committee of doctors. We are not aware how many deaths the audit committee has reviewed so far and how many it has marked as non Covid-19 related.”Dr Sukumar Mukherjee, a member of the global advisory committee set up by the state government, told the media in Banerjee’s presence that the audit committee of doctors reviewing the deaths is following guidelines of ICMR and WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kolkata-howrah-figure-in-red-zone-bengal-s-death-toll-touches-10/story-OWhEXkdGKGEtM4dY8npnQK.html

16-04-2020||India||Covid-19: With May 3 in sight, Tamil Nadu moves to devise exit strategy post lockdown 2.0||A committee under Finance Secretary S Krishnan has been formed to devise the exit strategy post May 3 when the extended lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to end, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami told reporters on Thursday.The state reported a fresh Covid-19 death taking the virus toll to 15, while 25 more people tested positive for the disease on Thursday, prompting the CM to describe the virus as a “disease of the rich” and a “big challenge”. In all, there are 1,267 coronavirus cases in the state.After chairing a meeting of district collectors to take stock of the preventive measures being implemented across the state, the CM said that the exit strategy could be a phased one. The new committee will discuss finalising which industries may be allowed to function after April 20, as permitted by the Centre.Palaniswami said the lower number of fresh cases showed the government was containing the spread of the contagion. “It is a disease of the rich. People who had travelled abroad or to other states have imported it (to Tamil Nadu). It did not originate here,” he said.Explaining the state’s fight against COVID-19, the chief minister said that the state took an early lead by launching screening of air passengers and placing orders for personal protective equipment as early as January.There were adequate stocks of ventilators, PPE and masks while enough strength of health workers has been ensured, including new appointments.Further orders have also been placed. The rapid test kits ordered by the state with China have been “diverted to another nation,” and even Centre was awaiting the consignment, he said. The state was in the second stage of the spread and today’s new number of cases of 25 against 38 yesterday showed the state has managed to contain it, he said.The first batch of 5.5 lakh antibody-based rapid test kits arrived in Delhi from China on Thursday. The stock is expected to be dispatched to six regional depots, including one in Chennai, on Friday morning. Fresh cases in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday stood at 38, a little more than Tuesday’s tally of 31, unlike higher numbers seen earlier in the week. The state had reported 98 fresh cases on Monday and 106 on Sunday. As many as 87 lakh people had been screened in 558 containment zones in the state.Palaniswami expressed hope the number will soon touch zero as the rate of people getting cured was also increasing. As many as 180 people have been discharged so far, as against the 118 on Wednesday, he said.He said that the government will extend government support to journalists who have contracted the virus and would provide an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh in the event of their “unfortunate death.” These will apply to accredited journalists, he added.To a question, Palaniswami said people’s essential needs, including of those in the containment zones, were being taken care of by the government.This included cash assistance and provisions of free rice and pulses to rice ration card holders and financial help to those in the unorganised sector.About 13,000 migrant labourers were lodged in 311 facilites and their needs were being taken care of, he added.The police were also strictly enforcing the lockdown, with the authorities having clamped section 144 of the CrPC, which bars assembly of more than five people, for this purpose.Police have filed 1.94 lakh cases and arrested over two lakh people for lockdown violations, besides seizing 1.79 lakh vehicles, he said. A sum of Rs 89 lakh has been collected as fine. Meanwhile, the police announced returning the seized vehicles and said this will be done after verifying the documents. The process will be carried out at the local police station limits and the vehicles will be returned to owners after informing them, police said.

The test result came Monday night.“When the test report came in, we were told by medical officials in Moradabad that the man had tested positive,” he said adding that immediately six ambulances were rushed to quarantine eight of his family members and track down others who had come into his contact.“We screened all eight family members but found them negative,” the PHC in-charge said.Meanwhile, a confirmation was sought from the Chief Medical Officer’s office in Moradabad which said the man’s name had been wrongly added to the list of positive cases, said Dr Farooq.“The earlier report had, by mistake, mentioned that the patient was coronavirus positive,” said CMO Moradabad Dr M C Garg adding that it was because of a misprint by the lab in Aligarh where the blood sample of the man was sent.The senior citizen was finally released from hospital on Wednesday. CMO, Amroha, Megh Singh said: “The man was confirmed negative for coronavirus and he along with all his family members have been discharged now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-citizen-in-up-tests-for-common-cold-lab-typo-makes-him-covid-19/story-yUVjxNHn2pWEkRnuHMVPdO.html
16-04-2020||India||‘Lathis on lockdown violators not to be normalised’: Former UP top cop to SC||Illegal police action and police brutality through frequent lathi-charge during lockdown should not be normalised, a former Director General of Police (DGP) in Uttar Pradesh told the Supreme Court on Thursday.The petitioner, Dr Vikram Singh, who is currently chairperson of think tank, Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change, sought quashing of FIRs registered under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against persons for violation of the Coronavirus lockdown.“The registration of FIRs under section 188 IPC is grossly illegal and antithesis to Rule of Law, and violates Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution”, the petitioner submitted.Section 188 of the IPC states that any person who disobeys an order given by a public servant can be punished with imprisonment up to 6 months.Singh, in his petition, pointed out that between March 23 and April 13, 848 FIRs were registered under section 188 of IPC in 50 Police Stations of Delhi alone.Similarly, he also claimed that as per Uttar Pradesh Government’s own admission through its Twitter handle, 15,378 FIRs under section 188 were registered in the state against 48,503 persons.“If this is the situation in the national capital and adjoining state, then the situation in other parts of the country can very well be imagined”, the petition said.Singh also referred to the order issued by the Supreme Court on March 23 in a suo motu case directing release of prisoners from jails to reduce overcrowding in prisons and minimise the risk of spread of Covid-19.However, the police on the other hand, is continuing to burden the criminal justice system through FIRs in petty offences in unlawful manner, which at the most mandate the jail term of six months, Singh alleged.“The Petitioner, who himself was the DGP of Uttar Pradesh understands the police functioning as well as the pain and suffering of those who are caught in the wheels of the criminal justice system. The Petitioner is also concerned with the undue burden on police officers, who will have to do voluminous documentation in all such matters”, the petition stated.Singh maintained that he was not supporting violation of lockdown and that strict action should be taken against violators; however, action under criminal law should be minimal. He contended that alternative methods like directions to plant trees and cleaning of drains should be adopted to deal with those who violate lockdown. “Coronavirus has caused a global pandemic, in which every person is suffering. The situation needs to be handled humanely, and it will be best to avoid adding aspects of criminality, wherever possible”, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lathis-on-lockdown-violators-not-to-be-normalised-former-up-top-cop-to-sc/story-LUEI7hSWmvO6NlMyTUR1oK.html
16-04-2020||India||Kolkata slum emerges as a Covid-19 hotspot with six new coronavirus cases||After Dharavi in Mumbai, a densely populated slum at Belgachhia in north Kolkata is rapidly turning into a Covid-19 hotspot, with at least six people reportedly testing positive for the coronavirus infection.The administration ‘sealed’ the slum on Tuesday – putting up barricades at all entry points – besides launching a door-to-door survey on Thursday.Local Trinamool Congress (TMC) corporator and Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen, who himself is a doctor and leading the administration’s operations from the front, said, “I cannot give numbers of people testing positive but there have been a few cases and the administration is taking all precautionary measures.”The slum has a population of about 50,000 and there are over 5,000 households, Sen said.“Since there have been a few cases, all our focus is on this slum now, as it is very densely populated and houses have no gaps between them. Even sleeping space is shared rotationally depending on one’s work hours. Now, with the lockdown, the entire population is staying in the slum, causing further space crunch. We are reaching out to every single household,” Tarun Saha, chairman of KMC’s borough no 1 said. Dharavi in Mumbai is home to nearly 15 lakh people who live in shanties. As many as 71 cases of Covid-19 positive have been reported from Dharavi till Thursday morning. At Belgachhia slum, according to a senior health department official of the state government, “Six persons, including two from a family, have tested positive for Covid-19. Other members of these families have been sent to government quarantine centres at Rajarhat and to the Haj House.”On Thursday, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) workers and staff from the health department launched a door-to-door survey to inquire about symptoms of influenza and severe acute respiratory infection. They were all wearing personal protective equipment or PPE.“A meeting was held exclusively to handle the Belgachhia situation on Wednesday and it has been decided that all lanes and by-lanes will be sanitized on a daily basis. Fifteen teams have been formed, with each team comprising of two health workers and representatives of the corporator. They were given a briefing today, following which door-to-door survey started,” Sen said.A school teacher living in the area, who did not want to be named, said that panic and rumours are spreading in the slum faster than the virus. “It is difficult to maintain social distancing here. Think of 10 people living in an 8 ft x 8 ft room. Usually, many people sleep on the streets at night due to shortage of space at home. Besides, there is illiteracy that is helping rumours to spread in the area and panic as well,” the schoolteacher said. Several non-government organizations have already launched the work of providing relief to local residents. They include the local Jamaa Masjid, the Islamic Library, local clubs and Paschim Banga Vigyan Mancha, the science wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).“We are not allowed to move into the slum. So, we are gathering at its entrance with hand sanitizers and so that our workers can prepare some food. People from the slum are coming to the entry point and collecting those,” Anindya Chowdhury of Paschim Banga Vigyan Mancha said.Kolkata’s deputy Mayor Atin Ghosh said that a similar door-to-door survey would be carried out in all slum areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-slum-emerges-as-a-covid-19-hotspot-with-six-new-coronavirus-cases/story-SeIiL5Cbn0vxgdYU9T6HEP.html

The man who hailed from Munger had returned from Dubai and had kidney ailment. His sample had tested positive after his death.None of the other cases developed serious complications and 37 of them recovered without requiring any emergency support like oxygen or ventilator. Follow coronavirus latest updates here.“The recovery rate in Bihar is quite good, which is an encouraging sign. We hope the morbidity remains low and there is no need for critical care. We keep the asymptomatic patients in the facilities developed in districts only and send symptomatic patients to dedicated hospitals,” said principal secretary, department of health, Sanjay Kumar.Though the number of Covid-19 cases has increased gradually, the smooth recovery is a comforting sign for the authorities, who say in most cases, the government had to reach out to the suspects because very few had reported voluntarily.So far, 24 Covid-19 patients have been admitted at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NNMCH), first dedicated facility for the disease in Bihar, and over 90% of them (22) have recovered and put under home quarantine after testing negative twice.“None of them required any oxygen or ventilator support at any stage. All the patients responded well to treatment. They did not have serious complications, while some of them did not even have apparent symptoms. There was no need for any additional support to any of them,” said Superintendent, NMCH, Dr Nirmal Kumar Sinha.At Gaya’s Anugrah Narayan Medical College and Hospital (Gaya), where five Covid-19 cases have so far been reported, three have recovered, but none of the patients required any ventilator or oxygen support.“We also have some suspected cases under observation, but none has developed any serious complications. All the positive cases have responded well to treatment,” said Gaya civil surgeon Brajesh Kumr ISngh.Many others who tested positive for Covid-19 and were admitted for treatment to various hospitals, remained asymptomatic and recovered.“There were no serious complications and no requirement of any outside support to any of the seven patients admitted here. Six of them have been discharged after testing negative twice,” said Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (Bhagalpur) superintendent RC Mandal.At Siwan also, where one person who returned from Oman and infected 22 others of his family, the district magistrate Amit Kumar Pandey said there has been no serious complication with any of the patients. “There has been no requirement of any additional life-saving support. Half of the patients from Siwan were sent to NMCH), while rest asymptomatic ones have been kept here at our facility,” he added.The only death of a Covid-19 patient so far was reported at AIIMS, Patna. “He died of renal failure as he developed serious complications soon after admission. He had kidney problem. The second case was discharged without requirement of any outside support, as the patient responded well,” said AIIMS director PK Singh.Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital superintendent Raj Ranjan Prasad said there is no Covid-19 patient in the facility. “There is one person kept under quarantine on suspicion, and his test report is awaited, but he is asymptomatic,” he added.At Sri Krishna Memorial College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, the superintendent SK Shahi said that there was neither any positive case nor any suspected case admitted there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-most-patients-in-bihar-recover-without-critical-care-govt-keeps-fingers-crossed/story-MhTgEX9eC8qeLBtBfmCOeM.html

A separate case for culpable homicide was also registered by the Delhi Police against Saad. He has been named accused by the ED as well under the PMLA.According to the government, Tablighi Jamaat members were the reason for almost 35% Covid-19 positive cases in India till April 7 and close to 26,000 contacts of Tablighis were in quarantine across the country. Around 1800 foreign Tablighi workers have also been blacklisted by the ministry of home affairs for violating their visa conditions.One of the officials cited above said that ED will focus on whether donations received by Markaz were part of money laundering and if it was moved through hawala or non-banking channels.“For this, we will examine all their financial transactions, travel details, usage of money in different events and identify the handlers of money. Saad and his associates will also be summoned soon,” said the officer.Saad has claimed so far that he is in self-quarantine and hasn’t joined Delhi Police investigation.Earlier this month, Jamaat had issued a statement in which it denied allegations against the organisation.A senior government official said that Income Tax department may also soon start looking into possible non-declaration of income, tax evasion by the trustees of Tablighi Jamaat and channeling of funds for personal gains.The Delhi government and Delhi Police have maintained that Tablighi Jamaat members were asked much in advance to vacate the Markaz at Nizamuddin, but they violated the directions risking many lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enforcement-directorate-files-money-laundering-case-against-tablighi-jamaat-chief/story-tB8LW79rSDTqcTcqpjPnoN.html

Following this directive, the home ministry had asked all states to put in place welfare measures for migrant workers while issuing detailed guidelines.A senior government official, who didn’t wish to be named, said once certain manufacturing and other business activities in rural areas resume from April 20, some migrant workers, who were heading home, might stay back and join their work.The home ministry, meanwhile, said it is monitoring on a daily basis all violations of lockdown measures, including congregation of people and opening of shops and establishments.It said incidents of violence against health workers engaged in surveillance and quarantine measures are also being ascertained.State police forces have already been asked several times to act against the violators under the Disaster Management Act. The home ministry has also warned action will be taken under the act against officers found responsible for violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-adequate-arrangements-for-migrant-labourers-stranded-people-centre-to-states/story-SQbp4x0PIv9By35ASp1OgP.html

A 66-year-old Covid-19 positive patient has died in Bangalore taking the total number of deaths due to the virus in the state to 13.While the border district of Belgavi saw the biggest jump with 17 new cases being registered, minister for primary and secondary education Suresh Kumar briefing the media said that this was primarily because two families had attended the funeral of a Covid-19 patient in neighbouring Maharashtra. Admitting that in spite of the best efforts of the administration a 100 per cent lockdown had not succeeded, Kumar pointed out how Vijayapura which did not have a single case till four days back now had 17 cases. The state government therefore has decided to try and enforce the lockdown more stringently to minimize the rise in positive cases in Karnataka.Meanwhile, CM B S Yediyurappa launched five mobile rapid testing labs which will travel across Bangalore to hotspots. Later on, similar rapid testing mobile labs are likely to be sent to Belgavi, Vijayapura and Dakshin Kannada, his cabinet colleague Kumar stated. He also said that the 462 fever clinics across the state had screened 46,751 people till date.Yediyurappa also launched the ‘Makala Vani’ an exclusive You Tube channel to keep the children of the state engaged during the lockdown. The channel will have stories, music, drawing, painting, drama, crafts and other educational infotainment to engage children who are at home due to the extended lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-registers-sharp-spike-with-36-new-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours/story-g10op1AbzTsZZCJD1fcIdO.html
16-04-2020||India||Govt has no current plans to bring back Indians stranded around world||The Indian government currently has no plans to repatriate thousands of citizens stranded around the world because of Covid-19-related restrictions, and people familiar with developments reiterated the administration’s advice that they should “stay put” where they are.The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a total of 3,336 Indians had tested positive for Covid-19 in 53 countries, while 25 Indians had died of the disease. No further details were immediately available.There are no official figures for Indian citizens stranded in different countries but several estimates have put the number in the thousands. There have been reports of scores of Indians stranded in airports in countries such as Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageEven before the government imposed a lockdown in March, the external affairs ministry had advised Indians around the world, including thousands of students, to stay put till travel restrictions are withdrawn. The nationwide lockdown has been extended till May 3.“Our advice has always been that you stay put, times are difficult. It’s a matter of having patience. They should contact the Indian missions wherever they are, and seek their help, support and guidance,” one of the people cited above said.“To the extent possible, our missions have reached out to a large number of people and are trying to solve their problems. These are difficult times, we need the understanding of our people that this too will pass,” the person added.In several countries, the people said, the Indian missions have taken the support of non-resident Indians (NRIs) and OCI card-holders to provide support to the stranded Indians. This support has included providing meals and rations to the Indians.The people also ruled out the possibility of bringing back the Indians who had tested positive for Covid-19, saying their movement increased the risk of spreading the coronavirus.“We have to very careful dealing with such cases as the nature of the virus is such that it spreads very fast. For that reason, we’ve been advising those who tested positive should stay put, get all the support they can get locally, including medical support,” said one of the people cited above.“If they start moving to another country or coming back to India, there are chances of spreading the virus. Fortunately, the recovery rate has been good in countries where the Indians tested positive,” the person added.More than 250 Indians, a majority of them pilgrims from Kashmir, had tested positive in the holy city of Qom in Iran last month. They are currently being treated in special facilities created in Qom.Indian envoys have reached out to the sick Indians and worked with local governments to ensure they get the best possible care, the people said.“We hope once they recover, they will hopefully be able to come back and join their loved ones,” a second person said.Indian authorities have also facilitated the evacuation of some 35,000 nationals of 48 countries who were stranded in India, the people said. This included the citizens of Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Russia, the US, and the UK.The repatriation of 186 Pakistanis is also being facilitated following a request from the Pakistani mission in New Delhi. Forty-one Pakistanis, who came to India as pilgrims or for medical care and were stranded in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, returned via the Wagah-Attari border crossing on Thursday.The external affairs ministry’s 24x7 Covid-19 control room has also fielded 18,000 emails and 5,000 phone calls and addressed 2,000 public grievances, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-has-no-current-plans-to-bring-back-indians-stranded-around-world/story-gHT7NRuDfbjXglDa1iltGL.html

The 170 hotspots were further categorised into hotspot districts with large outbreak (for 15 cases or more) and those with clusters (for fewer than 15 cases).Follow coronavirus latest update here.According to a letter sent by Union health secretary Preeti Sudan to chief secretaries, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, there are 12 hotspot districts, including Bhilwara, in Rajasthan. The textile town is among the hotspots with large outbreaks because it has reported 28 cases so far.The first case in Bhilwara was reported on March 19. In the next 14 days, the district emerged as one of the biggest Covid-19 hotpots in the country with 26 cases. Among those infected were three doctors and 14 nursing staff and other health workers of Brijesh Banger Memorial Hospital, a private institution, in Bhilwara.“We will complete the second 14-day cycle on Friday. If we can stay without a new case until May 15, we will become Covid-19 free district,” said Rajendra Bhatt, Bhilwara district collector, who has been in the forefront of implementing what has come to be known as the Bhilwara model of ‘ruthless containment’.The letter from Sudan said a district could move from the Red to the Green Zone if it does not report any case for 28 days, and vice-versa. If there’s no new confirmed case in a Red Zone district for 14 days, it will transition into the White Zone, a middle zone between the red and the green zones.Districts that together contribute 80% of the cases in a state or those that have a doubling rate of less than four days have been marked as Red Zones. Rajasthan’s capital, Jaipur, also figures in the list with more than 480 cases until 9am Thursday. The state’s tally is 1,101.Rajasthan with 12 hotspot districts is among the top 5 states; the other states are Tamil Nadu (22), Andhra Pradesh (16), Maharashtra (14) and Uttar Pradesh (13).The Bhilwara collector said the administration has extended the second phase of curfew in the city until April 20. Curfew was first imposed on April 3 and was in force until April 13. In the first phase, there were no exemptions to anyone and all essentials were home-delivered by the administration.After Jaipur, Bhilwara is testing most samples in the state. So far, about 5,000 samples have been tested from Bhilwara which is about 8,000 less from the number of samples tested from Jaipur.Out of the 28 cases in Bhilwara, only one is in hospital; two have died and the rest have been discharged after recovery, said Bhatt. “We have put 55 people in government quarantine facilities and 9,819 are in home quarantine,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-with-no-new-case-for-a-week-bhilwara-may-become-first-hotspot-to-transition-to-green-zone/story-0SOYxxq1iFjAfxqJ8rbVyN.html

More than 50 batches of these items have already been tested at the laboratory,” the ministry said.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe DRDE specialises in developing detection and protection technologies against biological and chemical agents. The statement said the Gwalior laboratory will now test only masks received by HLL Healthcare Limited from foreign countries before they are distributed to various agencies.PPE kits are sent to DRDO for testing by HLL Lifecare Limited, which is the government’s nodal agency for medical procurement. The kits are distributed to various agencies only after they pass stringent quality tests. A PPE kit contains a full-body suit, masks, goggles, gloves, and shoe covers.Conducting tests on PPE kits is a challenging task and there can be no room for error as it’s about the safety of healthcare workers, said a senior official familiar with the DRDO’s testing procedures.“Our procedure is quite elaborate and includes synthetic blood penetration test and pressure testing at various levels to ensure that the suits can provide protection to the wearers. In testing, we look for the weakest link which is usually the seams. The safety of healthcare workers is crucial in the fight against coronavirus,” he said. Pressure testing of PPE suits is done at six different levels.Another official said that the DRDO does not certify samples received from HLL Lifecare Limited for testing as ‘passed or failed’. “We only list out the technical parameters of the PPE kits and send it back to HLL Lifecare Limited. After that, it is for them to decide,” he said. The DRDO is among the several government agencies that have been at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It has developed several products to combat the pandemic including ventilators, PPE kits, large area sanitisation solutions and Covid sample collection kiosks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-moves-ppe-testing-facility-from-gwalior-to-delhi-to-cut-delays/story-sl9MUKd2lVYQ50j8rwGPGL.html

The people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity, said steps are being taken to source goods only from companies that fulfil the requirements for exports from China.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe Indian embassy in Beijing tweeted that “it is important to ensure product quality as well as reasonable and stable prices”. It called on China’s National Medical Products Administration to expedite registration of Chinese firms, especially those with export orders and already licenced by Indian regulatory bodies.Thursday’s consignment was part of 1.5 million testing kits to be procured from Chinese firms over the next two weeks.The external affairs ministry has been coordinating the government’s efforts to acquire vital supplies from other countries, including identifying suppliers, obtaining quotations, and coordinating with clearing agents, airlines and local authorities to ensure timely deliveries, the people said.Also read | Covid-19: No immediate plans to evacuate stranded Indians abroad“As part of these efforts, the first lot of 300,000 rapid antibody testing kits from Guangzhou Wondfo and another 250,000 from Zhuhai Livzon, and 100,000 RNA extraction kits from MGI Shenzhen were cleared by customs late on Wednesday night,” said one of the people cited above.“Our missions are closely coordinating with concerned agencies for the supply of PPE kits. A large consignment is expected shortly,” a second person said.The external affairs ministry is also working to obtain testing kits from South Korea. “Firm quotations have been obtained from companies in Canada, France, Malaysia, the UK and the US. We have also obtained leads from companies in Germany and Japan,” the second person added. The people said the Indian missions are facing several challenges in acquiring medical supplies, including a general shortage in other countries and local regulations. For instance, they said, the embassy in Beijing and the consulate in Guongzhou had to make special efforts with Chinese authorities for customs clearance and clearances for non-scheduled flights that transported the 650,000 testing kits.Also read: India ramps up PPE production, but quality remains a challenge“But now supplies of vital items required for our Covid-19 response are well underway,” the second person said.On Tuesday, India’s ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, told reporters that facilitating India’s imports of Covid-19-related critical medical equipment and keeping the drug production supply chain open would be the “best” signal from China for bilateral ties.Chinese companies have been contracted for nearly 15 million PPE kits and 1.5 million rapid testing kits by the Indian government and private firms.However, several countries have criticised the quality of critical equipment made in China in recent weeks. In late March, the Netherlands, Spain, the Czech Republic and Turkey reported medical supplies from China had failed quality tests.China then hurriedly moved to ensure the quality of medical exports. China’s commerce ministry, the customs authority, and the National Medical Products Administration issued new regulations on March 31, directing manufacturers to provide a declaration that their goods meet the quality-control standards of export destinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-gets-650-000-testing-kits-from-china-looks-to-south-korea-france-us-for-more-supplies/story-iRgzlgQXa7zMZMruKhLsuL.html

Plasma enrichment technique entails taking blood plasma from a person who has recovered from Covid-19 as it contains antibodies which, when transfused to a sick patient, can boost immunity and help in recovery.More than 1,500 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Delhi so far and 33 have died.The condition of several Covid-19 patients is improving and in the next 3-4 days, many of them will be discharged from hospitals. … With collective efforts, we all will be able to contain coronavirus in Delhi,” the chief minister said.He also claimed that 15 lakh people have applied for ration cards after the government announced online applications.“We have made special arrangements. Yesterday also we served lunch and dinner to nine lakh people. We can also make arrangements to feed 15 to 20 lakh people. We have also given ration cards. I request the media and common people to inform the poor who are not aware of the government’s arrangements who are still unaware. We will act the same way we did to provide food and shelter after the public informed us about the Yamuna river incident (in which two shelters for the homeless were burnt down),” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-trial-for-covid-19-patients-in-delhi-soon-arvind-kejriwal/story-IefGCqOcefiavH486JRnAO.html
16-04-2020||India||India ramps up PPE production, but quality remains a challenge||Thousands of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits among the 1.7 lakh donated for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) protection by the world’s main supplier China, failed the safety tests at the government-approved laboratories. These included coveralls, headgear, foot cover, mask, goggles or face shields, and gloves for healthcare and lab workers who are higher risk of infection from closely handling sick people and infected samples.“Yes, some of the samples of PPE kits from the imported lot did fail the safety tests,” said an official from the Defence Research and Development Establishment in Gwalior, where the kits had been sent for testing after arriving in India on April 5.Since then, the Bureau of Indian Standards has set stringent standards for PPE, which were issued on April 14.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe government also used the learning to work with 39 domestic manufacturers to scale up the production of PPE kits to 50,000 a day. But the capacity needs to be doubled to meet India’s daily requirement for PPEs.“We were initially about to start our production with fluid-resistant materials, but we stopped even before we began because there were talks of viral-barrier suits. Now the challenge is availability of the raw material and the taping machines. These are dampners when it comes to scaling up production in the country. We have now managed to source material for viral-barrier suits and have started manufacturing, but our product is yet to be certified. The Chennai Lab is not yet ready to test the products. Our PPE kits should reach the market next week,” said Dr GSK Velu, chairman and managing director, Trivitron Group.“The government should enforce the uniform standards for all kits, including the imported kits. Right now, several manufacturers are selling products that do not comply with any of the specifications,” he said.Some suggest purchasing the critical missing materials, rather than entire PPE kits.“What is the guarantee that the manufacturers who claim CE and US FDA approval are okay. We have seen Chinese manufacturers exporting poor quality kits to India and other countries where the regulations are not as stringent. It is better to import critical missing raw material fabric for PPE that’s breathable and yet is fluid and viral resistant, rather than importing plane loads of PPE Kits,” said Rajiv Nath, founder and forum coordinator of the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD).The new specifications released by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the bio-protective coveralls has manufacturers in a tizzy. The problem? The requirement that the suits be impermeable to viruses.“These guidelines are impractical. India does not have materials to make viral barrier suits. Instead, most companies are now laminating the coverall material and looking at sealing the seams to make the suits fluid and viral resistant. However, this is like wearing a raincoat in a non-AC ward, you can imagine the discomfort,” said Dr Ghanshyam Das Agarwal, chief managing director, G Surgiwear one of the manufacturers of PPE kits.“Breathability should be a bigger concern. Government should instead allow suits made of GSM 50 non-woven material, which will not pass the current test but is breathable and can provide 95 to 98% protection,” he said.Even for the makeshift suits, there are very few sealing machines in India. “The government is currently accepting the suits made in India, which might not be viral-resistant. However, to improve quality the government is developing newer materials and is also looking at importing these machines as well,” according to an industry expert, who knows about the matter.The earlier ministry of health specifications released on March 24 just required the suits to be fluid-resistant.“The higher standard specifications have been released by the BIS, but this is in a developing stage. Our feedback has already been sent through the official channels, so I cannot comment. But, it is likely that the specifications will be changed,” said Vijaya Shankara from Shree Hari Healthcare, one of the 39 manufacturers approved by the government.The newly released guidelines for bio-protective coveralls were removed from the BIS website on Thursday.The implementation of quality control, when it comes to the PPE kits, is patchy across the country owing to the extreme shortage.“However, the implementation is patchy. The manufacturers are required to get certified from these agencies to sell their product to HLL, which is the agency procuring for the central government. However, different state government follow different specifications and they do not necessarily ask for the certification,” said Malini Aisola, Co-convenor of All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN).This is the case in Delhi, which had floated a tender for 1.2 lakh PPE kits through the Central Procurement Agency in March.“This tender is being given to us as aa piece-meal of about three to four thousand kits a day. When we had floated the tender there were very few manufacturers who had come forward, and many did not necessarily have the certification.

16-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Postal department to step up delivery of food and essentials||To reach out to migrant workers and others in need, during the ongoing lockdown that has been extended till May 3; the postal department will step up its services in reaching out with food and essentials said people aware of the developments.Union minister for Communications, Electronics and Information Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad has instructed chief post master generals and chief general managers of all states to keep their postal network geared and active to help those in need.The ministry’s action comes in the wake of a raft of complaints from migrant workers across states about the unavailability of food and essentials.“The minister said special focus should on providing food to those in need. In last 14 days, around 1 lakh food and dry ration packets have been distributed. In Uttar Pradesh alone, more than 50,000 food and dry ration packets have been distributed amongst migrant labourers, construction workers; while in Bihar, around 16,000 food packets and 11500 packets of soaps, masks, sanitizers and gloves have been distributed,” said a functionary aware of the details.From trekking to Gauchar in a remote part of Uttarakhand to deliver lifesaving drugs to transporting ventilators from Puducherry in the South to Gujarat in the East, the postal department has emerged as a frontline delivery agent at a time when the Corona pandemic is raging globally.In the absence of mass transport systems, during the nationwide lockdown that will end on May 3,the postal department has had to not just transport tones of medicines and equipment, but has also had to step in to ensure government benefits are reaching the beneficiaries.Given the postal department’s experience at running primary savings services, the department was given the task of opening new accounts so that direct benefits could be transferred to those in need. It has also been tasked with the responsibility of doorstep delivery of pension in remote parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Leh, Gujarat, Telengana, Karnataka, tribal areas of Jharkhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.According to the functionary quoted above when the lockdown was first announced on March 24, a group of migrant workers in Meghalaya, found themselves stranded with little money and food. Shifted to various relief camps in Shillong, these workers had no bank accounts, which made it difficult for the government to each out with aid.“In order to provide timely relief, the department of posts in coordination with India Post Payments Bank organised an account opening camp in the relief camp at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Shillong,” said the functionary quoted above,After the lockdown began on March 25, all businesses and production came to a grinding halt, except essential services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/postal-department-to-step-up-delivery-of-food-and-essentials/story-c3Ur1gdGTGJWvNWDBb1WdJ.html
16-04-2020||India||Mercury rises in northwest and central India, several parts record 40 degree C||Several parts of the country are recording maximum temperatures above 40 degree C according to India Meteorological Department’s heat bulletin on Thursday.These include Vidarbha, Marathwada, West Madhya Pradesh, East Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Chandigarh and West Uttar Pradesh.Some states are recording maximum temperatures as high as 5 degrees above normal in Meghalaya, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, parts of Saurashtra and Kutch, at few places over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi. Maximum temperature is about 3 degrees C above normal over northeastern states, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, Tamil Nadu among others.The highest maximum temperature on Wednesday was recorded at Akola in the Vidarbha region at 43.4 degree C. “These regions in central and west India are climatologically prone to heat during this period. There are also clear skies and no weather systems affecting these places,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.Meanwhile, a fresh western disturbance (WD) is likely to impact the western Himalayan region and the north-western plains on April 17 and 18. This WD is likely to cause scattered to widespread thundershowers over the western Himalayan region and scattered thundershowers over the northern plains including Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, north Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh on April 17 and 18.Due to convergence of strong moist winds from Bay of Bengal parts of the northeast and sub Himalayan west Bengal will get widespread rains in the next 7 days, IMD said in its bulletin. Maximum temperatures may fall by a couple of degrees for a couple of days in northwest India owing to the WD but maximum temperatures will remain in the range to 40 to 42 degree C in Telangana, Rayalseema and north interior Karnataka, IMD’s bulletin said.Air quality in several parts of northwest India deteriorated marginally from “satisfactory” and “moderate” to “moderate” and “poor” categories due to dust raising winds which increased the PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.On Thursday, for example, Delhi was in “moderate” ; Faridabad in “poor”; Bulandshahr in “very poor”; Ghaziabad, Kanpur in “poor” among others. “This is mainly because of dust raising winds blowing over Delhi NCR and surrounding regions from Rajasthan. Its not a contribution from other emission sources,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Meanwhile, an analysis by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) released on Thursday, on the impact of the lockdown found visible reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels based on Satellite data from Sentinel 5P-TROPOMI. The main source of NO2 emissions is fuel combustion by vehicles and industries. On March 22 when Janata curfew was imposed, air pollution levels were found to be lowest since 2017.The comparative satellite data of the period March 11 to 24 and March 25 to 7 showed NO2 hotspots over cities and industrial areas have reduced significantly. CREA researchers said NO2 pollution was responsible for thousands of child asthma cases and formation of PM 2.5 particles due to secondary particle formation from NO2 emissions.The main reason behind reduction of NO2 levels is the dip in consumption of diesel or petroleum products, consumption of diesel had decreased by 25% in March 2020 compared to March 2019 and petrol consumption reduced by 18% during the same period.“The current crisis has shown us that clear skies and breathable air can be achieved very fast if concrete actions towards reducing burning of fossil fuels… We have to ensure that we invest heavily in renewable energy and other clean energy solutions,” CREA researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-rises-in-northwest-and-central-india-several-parts-record-40-degree-c/story-sz23zz2IzyDAxm5wCtm8VN.html

Nikhil, son of former Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy, will tie the nuptial knot with Revathi, the grandniece of former state housing minister M Krishnappa, at the farmhouse in Bidadi town.Both families had earlier decided to have a grand wedding ceremony in Ramanagara, the political turf of Kumaraswamy.With congregation of any type not allowed during the lockdown to check coronavirus spread, Kumaraswamy explained in a video message that the event will be a low-key affair of two families with minimum number of people.He also appealed to his party workers, relatives and well-wishers not to visit the venue. According to him, after the lockdown was announced, the marriage was planned at their home here itself but since social distancing will be a challenge, it was decided to organise it at Ramanagara.He cited Bengaluru being in the ‘Red Zone’ with maximum COVID-19 cases in the state as also a reason for shift in the venue.“It is difficult to maintain social distancing if the event is organised at home. That’s the reason we are organising the event at our farmhouse in Bidadi. I request my workers and well-wishers to avoid attending the event,” Kumaraswamy said.The decision to organise the marriage was taken after consulting doctors, including those in his family, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-2-0-deve-gowda-s-grandson-marriage-to-be-low-key/story-4IwkV5EK3Q7dAPyf5QOwWM.html

At the end of the clash that cost the Afghan security forces four lives on April 13-14 night, the security personnel discovered that only 5 of the 15 men they had killed were from the Afghan Taliban. The other 10 were Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists being trained to fight in Jammu and Kashmir.One Jaish terrorist survived the gunfight and was captured.Counter-terror operatives in Delhi and Kabul told HT that the Masood Azhar-founded Jaish-e-Mohammed, which shares the same Deobandi umbilical cord with Taliban, appeared to be running three camps (called Mustaquil) along with four Taliban camps in Nangarhar province. The camps have been identified as Khogyani I, Khogyani II and Dargah camp in Nangarhar province and were lent by the Taliban in lieu of Haqqani network’s cadre being trained in JeM’s camps in Pakistan.Hindustan Times has accessed photographs and video footage of the clash. One of these photographs shows some of the weapons seized by the Afghan security forces from the camp: 2 mortar launchers, one rocket-propelled grenade and 2 AK series rifles.Maulana Masood Azhar, who has been on India’s most wanted list for years, is incapacitated due to health issues and lives in the terror group’s headquarters, Markaz-e-Usman-o-Ali in Pakistan’s Bahawalpur.His younger brother Mufti Rauf Asghar is the man running the Jaish ‘s terror show.Intelligence reports indicate that the Jaish’s de facto chief Mufti Rauf Asghar’s son Wali Azhar is also being trained in these camps that are headed by former Afghan war and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen veteran Mufti Asghar Kashmiri. His second-in-command at these camps is the Jaish’s Kashmir infiltration specialist Abdullah aka Asadullah.“We have photographic evidence that places Kashmiri and Abdullah at the terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir,” one official told HT.Also Read: The Taliban has trumped the US in Afghanistan | AnalysisAccording to information shared with India’s security planners, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir residents Yasin, Umar, Said and Mansoor along with Bahawalpur-based chief trainer Chacha Wagah, Junaid and Qari Sahab were present in the camp along with Kashmiri and Abdullah as late as March 29.The total strength of Khogyani I camp is 23 cadres and seven instructors, while the number of cadres in Khogyani II and Dargah camps number 66 excluding trainers and logistics staff.The radicalised cadre are being given a 15-day normal training after which they have to clear the six-month “Jundullah (commando)” training course before being launched into J&K. These cadres are also being given jungle survival training in Kunar reserve near Nuristan border.Also Read: Pakistan proxies in fight to the finish in Afghanistan, but India too needs to prep | AnalysisMiniature replicas of the areas around their launch pads at Neelum, Sharda, Kel, Athmuqam, Leepa, Kotli and Forward Kahuta across the Line of Control (LOC) have been created for briefing them about infiltration into J&K.Already, intelligence agencies have reported that the Pakistan terror groups had prepped to send about 230 terrorists across the Line of Control.Indian national security planners are also watching with some anxiety the emerging big picture in Afghanistan with the US on the verge of withdrawal and Taliban all set to fight it out with the Ashraf Ghani regime for the seat in Kabul.It is quite evident that once the Taliban gain control of Kabul, Pakistan would acquire strategic depth through Afghanistan and use the soil to launch terror strikes against India, a counter-terror operative in Delhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-border-clash-with-taliban-exposes-jaish-terror-camps-for-kashmir/story-GyRErS9kvUzbYcq544s6bO.html

To be clear, the order categorically states the advisory is only for those passengers who have booked flights during the first lockdown period from March 25 till April 15 for flights up till May 3, since the extension of the lockdown period.Senior civil aviation ministry officials have clarified the order does not apply to passengers who had booked flights prior to the lockdown for the same period. “There were several distress cases that we got of passengers who had booked flights from April 15 onward thinking the lockdown would be lifted and our priority was to address those cases. The second issue was of passengers who had booked in the first lockdown period during the same period. For example, there were several cases where airlines were still taking bookings despite India’s lockdown orders. Which we said will not be allowed and they will have to pay the passengers back in full,” a senior ministry official said requesting anonymity. As per the advisory issued by the ministry of civil aviation, airlines have to refund the full amount collected without levy of cancellation charge.“Substantial number of travelers eager to move from the places where they were have booked tickets for the travel after the end of the lockdown period i.e. from April 15 onward. Currently, the Government has further extended the lockdown period up to May 3, 2020, with the ban continuing on operation of all domestic and international flights,” the advisory says. “MOCA acknowledges the unusual situation that has arisen due to the lockdown being imposed to contain the further spread of COVID-19 and its consequential effect on the air passengers and airlines,” it added. Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation has been instructed to monitor the compliance. “A circular has been issued by the ministry of civil aviation for guidance and strict compliance of domestic and foreign airline operators engaged in domestic and international air travel in India,” the DGCA said. If a passenger has booked a ticket during the first lockdown period and the airline has received the payment for booking of air ticket during the first lockdown period (from March 25 to April 14) for travel during the second lockdown period (from April 15 to May 3, 2020) for both domestic and international air travel and the passenger seeks refund on cancellation of the ticket, the airline shall refund the full amount collected without levy of cancellation charge. The refund shall be made within a period of three weeks from the date of request of cancellation,” the advisory says. The advisory came after a meeting was chaired by the civil aviation minister with CEOs of private airlines Wednesday to discuss the issue of refunds for flights cancelled during the lockdown period. “Airlines have reiterated that advance bookings for flights will not be stopped,” another senior official said. Airlines, say, IndiGo had on April 14 announced it will resume flight operations from May 4 in a phased manner. The airline plans to start with curtailed capacity Initially and will increase the operating capacity over subsequent months. It also said it will re-open selected international flights, depending on the existing international travel guidelines.“We will begin operations for domestic only and then gradually ramp it up further, to commence operations on some international routes as well. Our singular focus will be on ensuring the health of our customers and our employees,” Ronojoy Dutta, Chief Executive Officer, IndiGo said. At present, most airlines are providing credit shell in lieu of refunds for flights cancelled due to the lockdown. Aviation regulator in the United States too has come down heavily on airlines who are not providing refunds on flights cancelled due to Covid-19. It had, earlier this month directed its airlines to issue refunds to passengers.Meanwhile the Indian Railways has cancelled advance booking for all trains. The Railways which was taking bookings till April 14, said no advance reservation of train tickets, including e-tickets, will be allowed till further orders, though the facility of online cancellation will remain functional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-to-refund-full-ticket-money-for-domestic-international-tickets-cancelled-during-lockdown/story-AoW4BtnNlFdxuvzteRVWwO.html

India is also in the process of supplying the drug to countries around the world, including the US.The petition was filed by Kunal Saha in the Supreme Court in the name of his Kolkata-based NGO People for Better Treatment, and he is expected to argue the matter in person. It could not immediately be ascertained if the petition has been admitted by the apex court or will be taken up for hearing.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIndian authorities have so far clear the use of hydroxychloroquine in the case of asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in caring for suspected or confirmed Covid-19 case and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases.The petition argues that the use of hydroxychloroquine along with the broad spectrum antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) for Covid-19 patients is potentially known for life-threatening effects on the cardiovascular system.The petition also refers to a health bulletin issued by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and US-based Heart Rhythm Society on April 8 that warned doctors about this drug combination having the potential to trigger “arrhythmia” or abnormal heartbea), heart failure and death.Saha also wrote to India’s health ministry on April 8, sharing this information. He said the ministry ought to have specified precautionary measures to be adopted by doctors in line with those prescribed by the American organisations.The petition also cites the extreme precautions in administering this drug suggested by the Canadian Medical Association and by an international study group of doctors based on the analysis of data from more than 300,000 patients. The finding showed no risk in short-term use of hydroxychloroquine but increased risks of 30-day cardiovascular mortality, chest pain or angina and heart failure were observed in the use of hydroxychloroquine and AZM.Hydroxychloroquine’s global demand is on the rise and India is exporting the drug to the US, the UK, Brazil, Israel and South Asian neighbours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-recommended-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-potentially-life-threatening-plea-in-sc/story-SOarr0N01EtXPynXqNDmLL.html

I disagree with PM Modi on a lot of issues but we have to unite and not fight. We have to defeat the virus together,” he added.He suggested that the Prime Minister should listen more to the chief ministers. “Our strength to fight Covid-19 is at state and district level. Success in Wayanad has been due to district level machinery. So, I suggest that the approach to fight against Covid should not be top-down but bottom-up. Prime Minister should empower states,” Rahul added.Gandhi also said that lockdown is not a solution to defeat Covid-19 but a pause button and stressed the need for having a comprehensive exit strategy in place to ensure that the coronavirus does not come back once the restrictions are lifted.Extending his support to PM Modi, the Centre and all state governments in the fight against Covid-19, he demanded immediate scaling up of the testing facilities to contain the pandemic.Rahul Gandhi said that the government should think of the exit strategy and economic burden which is going to come in months. “Decide what your exit strategy would be after the lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disagree-with-pm-but-we-have-to-be-united-in-fight-against-covid-19-rahul-gandhi/story-3A5dNWU5xCLwOQKDDsHAnK.html

The CyCord portal was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2018 for sharing all cyber-related matters among law enforcement agencies, government organisations and other stakeholders.The home ministry asked private individuals using Zoom to follow certain guidelines – including preventing unauthorised entry in a conference room, preventing an unauthorised participant from carrying out malicious activity on the terminals of others, and avoiding DOS attack by restricting users through passwords and access grant.A DOS (denial-of-service) attack is done by hackers to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users.Earlier, CERT-in had said that unguarded use of Zoom can make it vulnerable to cyber-attacks, including leaks of sensitive office information to criminals.“Many organisations have allowed their staff to work from home to stop the spread of coronavirus disease. Online communication platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Teams for Education, Slack, Cisco WebEx etc are being used for remote meetings and webinars,” the CERT-in advisories dated March 30 and April 6 said.“Insecure usage of the platform may allow cybercriminals to access sensitive information such as meeting details and conversations,” the advisories said.In an interview with CNN last week, Zoom’s CEO Eric S Yuan said his firm had “moved too fast…and we had some missteps”, adding the company has learnt its lessons and “taken a step back to focus on privacy and security”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zoom-app-is-not-safe-for-private-persons-entities-mha/story-eAM93lrayy2N7sK90JgBAK.html
16-04-2020||India||‘Lockdown no solution to beat coronavirus’: Rahul Gandhi messages Centre||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said lockdown is not a solution to defeat Covid-19 but a pause button, and stressed the need for having a comprehensive exit strategy in place to ensure that the coronavirus does not come back once the restrictions are lifted.Extending his support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre and all state governments in the fight against Covid-19, he demanded immediate scaling up of the testing facilities to contain the pandemic.“The biggest weapon to fight this virus is testing. Our rate currently is very slow and we are not using the testing strategically. We are at present chasing the virus. We should immediately and aggressively push for rapid testing, maximise it and use it strategically. If we don’t ramp up testing, we will be forced to again go into lockdown,” Gandhi said, addressing a news conference through video-conferencing.The Congress has been demanding adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) for doctors, nurses and other health workers apart from aggressive testing to fight the coronavirus.“Whatever has happened has happened. We are at an emergency level today and need to look to the future and fight the coronavirus together as one, irrespective of religion, caste and age and unitedly defeat it. We will lose the fight if we remain divided,” Gandhi said when asked that he had warned the government of the looming crisis on February 12.Watch l ‘Lockdown a pause button, need to maximise testing’: Rahul Gandhi on COVID-19 The Congress leader called for empowering the government machinery at district and at state levels. “We can’t have a top down approach to fight the virus. It should be bottoms up. The Prime Minister and the chief ministers should empower districts and the Centre should immediately release the money and resources to states to enable them to deal with it in a nuanced manner,” he added.However, Gandhi urged the government to manage its funding to enable the country to tide over the massive financial backlash due to the coronavirus, saying it cannot be controlled but has to be dynamically managed to defeat it.“We will see the first wave of unemployment immediately after the lockdown and then it will spiral. We have to ensure that we don’t destroy our economy. I get worried seeing blunt instruments being used to deal with the pandemic. We need to decentralise and start conversation and particularly knowing Modiji’s style one can work around it,” he said.On the suspension of MPLADs, Gandhi, who represents Kerala’s Wayanad constituency in the Lok Sabha , dismissed it as “not a major issue” in the present situation. “We need to utilise all our assets and also effectively use the administration and resources. We don’t need to use blunt instruments and instead focus on a strategic approach, besides open up communication with districts and try to fulfil their demands.”Gandhi said the government should strategically open key areas and use the testing to identify hotspot and non-hotspot zones across the country whenever the lockdown is lifted. “Lockdown is in no way a solution to Covid-19. It is like a pause button. When you lock up the people, the disease gets locked up and when you open up the disease rushes out. So, it is important to create two zones – hotspots and non-hotspots and once you identify the hotspots you clamp down on those,” he said.The Congress-ruled states and the party had supported the lockdown announcement with many leaders saying that it was the only way out to contain the pandemic.On the issue of stranded migrant labourers, Gandhi said some mistakes were initially made as a result of which a lot of migrants are stuck in different states. “It is important to have a strategy to deal with this crisis. The government needs to act on it quickly otherwise there will be social unrest in the country. You have to respond quickly and be compassionate while addressing the issue. I have told Congress chief ministers that they need to handle this situation with extreme care and gentleness.”The former Congress chief demanded a food safety net for the poor and the needy, claiming that the biggest cause of worry is that there will be massive food shortage in the future.“We have enough food supply in godowns and it should be distributed immediately even to those who don’t have ration cards. I suggest that 10 kg of wheat and rice, one kg of sugar and one kg of pulses should be given to the poor every week,” he said.Asked if he agreed with the Prime Minister that India took early steps to contain Covid-19, Gandhi said it was not the time to criticise the government and insisted that he wanted to give constructive suggestions. “I disagree with the Prime Minister on several issues and will continue to do so but this is no time to fight. It’s a long battle and all of us need to fight it together. It’s also a test for our country and we need not be scared of it but embrace it. We must not look at it through a prism of fear. I don’t want any credit and whoever wants to take it can take it but we would give constructive suggestions even if the government takes it or not,” he added.Asked if the Indian democracy could witness a change post Covid-19, Gandhi said, “That is a real possibility but we have to first take care of the virus. We know how to make sure that India remains democratic and we will do that. Also, I would like to say that premature declaration of victory over the virus will prove fatal.”The Congress leader also said the government should be careful and ensure that the people don’t take advantage of the situation by picking up stakes in strategic interests important to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-no-solution-to-beat-coronavirus-rahul-gandhi-messages-centre/story-YSvPqVFKA4UtNAkVYa4VaO.html

The district police authorities allegedly stopped his auto-rickshaw over 100 metres away from a hospital on the pretext that he was not carrying the self-declaration form during the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus.The incident occurred on Wednesday when Roy Matthew visited the Punalur taluk hospital in Kollam district to bring back his father home, who was discharged from the medical facility.Roy alleged that the policemen stopped the auto-rickshaw over 100 metres away from the hospital and made him carry his father to the waiting vehicle, as he was not carrying the self-declaration form.A self-declaration form, stating the reasons for an individual to venture out is mandatory during the lockdown, which was initially enforced on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and has since been extended till May 3.Kollam Police authorities said that they would look into the incident after the viral video fuelled into a controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-2-0-kerala-man-forced-to-carry-aged-father-on-shoulders-from-hospital-to-autorickshaw/story-wydbRsI9q7eFXc3Iov72CM.html

16-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown dealt blow to Punjab drug smuggling: Official||The Covid-19 lockdown has dealt a major blow to drug smuggling in Punjab and more than 26,000 people have registered at de-addiction centres since curfew was imposed in the state to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, officials have said.Additional director general of police Harpreet Singh Sidhu, who heads the anti-narcotics Special Task Force (STF), told Hindustan Times the surge in registrations at out-patient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) centres across Punjab was because the supply chain of drug trafficking rings has been disrupted by the strict lockdown.“The supply chain crunch has already been there and that is why we had over four lakh registrations at OOAT centres across Punjab since 2017. Lockdown has helped us further tighten the grip,” he added.A total of 309 cases were registered by Punjab Police under the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and a large quantity of drugs have been seized, including 22 kg of heroin and more than 527 kg of poppy husk, since March 23, when the curfew was imposed.A total of 498 people have also been arrested in connection with drug smuggling during the lockdown.The anti-narcotics task force was set up after the Congress government, headed by Captain Amarinder Singh, came to power in April 2017. It was one of the key elements of the party’s manifesto.Drug abuse, coupled with corruption, had dominated the 2017 assembly elections in the state, with the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) making it their main campaign plank against the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).The 26,000 fresh registrations at de-addiction centres include 2,375 in Ludhiana, 1,966 in Moga, 1,604 in Bathinda, 1,542 in SAS Nagar and 1,518 in Tarn Taran.Sidhu said the total number of patients registered at OOAT centres in Punjab since 2017 stands at 440,165.According to the report “Magnitude of Substance Abuse in India”, released in February 2019 by the Union social justice and empowerment ministry in collaboration with the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC) of Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), there are 720,000 drug users in Punjab.Sidhu described the increase in people registering at de-addiction centres as a “huge success” in the “war” against drugs in the border state.Punjab shares a 553-km border with Pakistan and successive state governments have often talked about the neighbouring country’s involvement in narco-terrorism through several Indian states.Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has been demanding a national drug policy to enable states to follow a similar approach and strategy to tackle this menace.Interacting with the national media last week through video conference, Singh said Covid-19 has broken the supply chain of drug smuggling rings in his state.“The only good thing that has come out of Covid-19 is that the supply of heroin and other drugs has been broken. We are happy. We already have a 1,000-personnel task force that has been continuously working on this front,” he said.Sidhu agreed: “We had already managed to effectively block the supply chain and reduce the demand by the comprehensive action against drug abuse (CADA) strategy being implemented in Punjab through a three-pronged approach based on a balanced emphasis on enforcement, de-addiction and prevention (EDP). It is a reasonably good model.”He added, “Covid-19 has done us an extra help in further tightening the supply line and prompted more people to approach drug de-addiction centres.”He said this will have a positive follow-up effect, given that those whose supply chain has not been affected by the lockdown will be encouraged by hundreds of people thronging the de-addiction centres.“They will see the benefits of the people who have gone into the treatment and also get influenced because we have seen that 85% of addiction happens through peer pressure,” Sidhu said.The state government has also launched mobile OOAT vans to provide treatment and consultation to addicts at their doorsteps to ensure strict social distancing norms.Asked about the challenges faced by the STF in ensuring the supply chain remains disrupted even after the lockdown, Sidhu said: “It is possible some supply will come once the lockdown is lifted. But with so many people registering with de-addiction centres, they have come onto our radar and if they drop out of the programme we will be able to trace them and persuade them to come back.”He added that police have also made inroads in areas where supply could not be contained earlier.Sidhu described the de-addiction centres as major life savers. “Imagine if such centres wouldn’t have been there during this lockdown period, lack of supply and withdrawal could have had disastrous consequences and possibly a rise in suicide bids,” he said.“I always say we had nothing when we started in 2017, then we had some strategy in 2018, and in 2020, we are constantly adapting to the situation. All our models are flexible and we are making them better as we go on. If we further increase our momentum, we should be out of this menace by next year and hopefully have good results,” Sidhu remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-dealt-blow-to-punjab-drug-smuggling-official/story-aqmBGMnh2d9Gxvs7wKwm5K.html

Two districts in Kerala which were reported Covid-free in more than a week are marked in the ‘red’ zone and another which has at least nine active cases are marked in ‘green’. Among 14 districts of the state, seven are classified in the ‘red’ zone category, six are in ‘orange’ and one in ‘green’ zone. The classification of Covid-19 zones in the state has worried Kerala government which has now decided to approach the Union Health Ministry for the rectification. Kerala, which was one of the top coronavirus hotspots in the country just last month, has been reporting fewer cases and a high rate of patient recovery in the last few weeks. The number of Covid-19 fatalities in the state stands at 3. The state was the first to report the country’s first coronavirus cases in the month of January - all three patients had successfully recovered. On Wednesday the state had reported a single case. Among 387 positive cases, 220 had discharged leaving only 167 in hospitals.Interestingly, Wayanad in north Kerala which has only a single case and Thiruvananthapuram and Pathnamthitta which did not report new cases in the last few days are all in the ‘red’ list. Kasaragod, Kannur, Malappuram, Ernakulam are the other districts that fall in the ‘red’ zone as classified by the health ministryCoronavirus-free Idukki and Kottayam districts are in the ‘orange’ zone. Other districts in the zone include Thrissur, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Kollam. Kozhikode, on the other hand, that has nine active cases is the only district in the state in the ‘green’ zone.According to Union Health Ministry’s directive ‘red’ zone comprises the districts which report the maximum number of cases with high possibilities of community transmission. It has identified 170 districts across the country in the ‘red’ zone. Non-hotpots, but those regions that have enough chances of the virus spreading, are classified in the ‘orange’ category - six districts in Kerala are in ‘orange’ category. ‘Green’ zones the safe areas with respect to the virus spread.“It seems the classification has been done without realizing the ground situation. Some of the districts which have done a stupendous job by containing the virus are again in the hotspot list. We are upset with this. The state government will take it up with the Union Government,” said a senior official of the state health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-of-14-kerala-districts-in-covid-19-red-zone-centre-s-classification-surprises-state/story-I1UlxVEZyBcvowguDonZ2H.html

Initially, the government had enforced a 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak but further extended it by another 19 days because of a spike in viral outbreak cases.The army said its latest directive will not hinder operational tasks of units and those will be carried out with the requisite strength.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“Within the army headquarters; only the military operations, military intelligence, operational logistics, and strategic movement branches will function, to carry out operational and Covid-19 related tasks. However, duration of stay and strength within these branches is to be at a bare minimum till April 19,” the instructions said. The army said personnel from the remaining branches would work from home and any specific task would be handled on a case-to-case basis until April 19.The instructions said at the Command HQ level, only manpower, logistics, and operations branches would function with a skeleton staff. However, the intelligence branch would also function at the operationally critical Northern and Eastern Commands.The army said offices in its headquarters, Command HQ and formation HQ might start functioning at 50% of their strength between April 19 and May 3. The Directorate General Medical Services (Army) will continue functioning at full strength to provide a robust response to Covid-19 and all medical establishments and hospitals will continue functioning at full strength till May 3.“All training activities and temporary duties will remain suspended till May 3. Directions on actions to be taken after May 3 will be issued on receipt of fresh orders from the government. No activity is to be assumed,” the instructions added.All social, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural and religious gatherings have also been suspended till May 3. Nor will religious congregations, regimental or ceremonial functions be permitted.“Offices falling in ‘hotspots or containment zones’ will observe strictly ‘no movement’ till they are denotified. Exceptions to be given will depend on the local military authority,” the instructions said.The army, which is at the forefront of the country’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, took a raft of preventive measures in March to stop the spread of the viral outbreak within its ranks.These measures included the cancellation of all non-essential training, conferences and travel, a freeze on postings and foreign assignments, avoiding any assembly that involves more than 50 personnel and postponing all courses for officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-army-to-strictly-observe-no-movement-till-april-19/story-CigfvCaIOqZnf51rZQY1dM.html
16-04-2020||India||Govt data shows India better placed than others in Covid-19 fight||India is in a better position in terms of the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19 and the number of fatalities, according to Union health ministry.The health ministry data revealed that India has seen just nine cases per million - the lowest in the world - as compared to one of the worst affected countries Spain, which has seen 3,864 cases per million. Covid-19 has devastated Europe with other European countries like Italy and France recording 2,732 and 2,265 positive cases per million.Even the United States has close to 2,000 (1,946 to be exact) cases per million, as per the health ministry data.The number of fatalities is too is lowest in India - 0.3 deaths per million as against 402 in Spain. In Italy and France, the figure stands at 358 and 263 per million respectively.As the number of Covid-19 cases increased, the Centre proactively ramped up testing for the disease. The health ministry said that India has tested 2,17,554 people as the figure crossed 10,000, next only to Canada which has tested 2,95,065 people in the same category.It took more number of days for infection to double in India, due to the stringent measures put in place by the Centre. While in US, France, UK and other countries the infection doubled, first from 75 to 1500 and then from 1,500 to 3,000 in 2-3 days, in India the time taken for infection to spread was four days.Similarly, it took six days for the number of infected to spread from 6,000 to 12,000 in India, whereas the grim milestone was achieved in just four days in other Western countries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had highlighted the scenario in his address to the nation on April 14 as he extended the nationwide lockdown till May 3. He asserted that India has chosen the correct path and managed to avert to a large extent the damage caused by the pandemic in many countries.He acknowledged that the lockdown has come at a huge economic cost, but said the saving lives of the citizens is his government’s priority.The total number of Covid-19 positive cases reached 12,380 on Thursday, according to the Union Health Ministry. At least 414 people have died of the disease, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-data-shows-how-india-is-better-placed-than-other-countries-in-covid-19-fight/story-QeL3rG5kfrhqgS0Q4guMfP.html
16-04-2020||India||6.50 lakh medical kits to fight coronavirus dispatched from China: Indian envoy||The coronavirus medical test equipment being procured by India from China to combat the pandemic gathered pace on Thursday as 6.50 lakh Rapid Antibody Tests and RNA Extraction Kits were dispatched to the country.In a tweet, India’s Ambassador to China, Vikram Misri said the medical kits were dispatched early on Thursday from Guangzhou Airport in southern China.“#IndiaFightsCoronavirus A total of 650,000 kits, including Rapid Antibody Tests and RNA Extraction Kits have been despatched early today from Guangzhou Airport to #India,” Misri tweeted.Over two million test kits being procured from China will be sent to India in the next 15 days, Misri told PTI here.The Rapid Antibody Test Kits deliver results in 15 minutes and work on blood samples instead of nasal swabs to tell whether a patient has ever been exposed to the novel virus. The RNA extraction kit enables the total RNA extraction from tissues. This extracted RNA is a mix of a person’s own genetic material and, if present, the coronavirus’ RNA.Two major consignments of the medical kits were reported to have been sent to India from China earlier as part of the efforts to step up testing especially in hotspots during the ongoing lockdown in the country.On Tuesday, Misri told the media here that India has placed orders to procure 15 million personal protection gear from China for medical personnel treating COVID-19 patients, besides three million testing kits.The orders are being placed with bonafide firms with the help of the Chinese government.“I think facilitation of our needs and our requirements in a timely manner, in a smooth manner, on a predictable timeline at prices that are stable and orderly, would be the best signal possible to send for the India-China relationship,” Misri said.As its factories resumed operations after over a two-month grim battle against the coronavirus, China is busy tapping into the vast business opportunities of export of key medical goods, especially ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE), across the world, including India, where both private and government bodies are placing orders for the import of these products.India has extended its ongoing lockdown to fight the coronavirus till May 3. It has reported 414 deaths due to the disease and 12,380 people have been infected by the disease in the country.Considering the importance, Misri said the Indian embassy is facilitating commercial procurements besides coordinating flight linkages for their timely arrival in India.As demand for Chinese medical supplies scaled up due to the spread of the virus in several parts of world, China on Wednesday asked all the countries to import these items through reputed Chinese firms cleared by the government and vowed to punish those involved in counterfeit behaviour.Responding to questions about quality concerns raised by several countries related to medical equipment imports from China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on Wednesday that the Chinese government is facilitating the orderly exports.“We hope foreign buyers can choose products from companies that have been accredited by Chinese regulators with good production credentials,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-50-lakh-medical-kits-to-fight-coronavirus-dispatched-from-china-indian-envoy/story-GXk8x11ycBitxaPPweET4M.html
16-04-2020||India||Delhi HC denies interim bail to rape accused for father’s last rites, cites Covid-19 risk||The Delhi High Court has dismissed the plea filed by an accused in a rape case seeking interim bail to perform his father’s last rites, saying it would be dangerous to release him in the current coronavirus pandemic situation as he will get in touch with many people outside increasing the risk of infection.The court also said the bail application was totally silent on various aspects including record of recovery of the body of man’s father who allegedly died by drowning, documents of cremation and details of other ceremonies.“There is another aspect of this matter. The village of the petitioner (accused) is around 800 Km from Delhi so it will be highly dangerous to release the petitioner on interim bail as it is not known as to how many persons he will get in touch while he will be there in his village,” Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said.The court added, “There are great chances of his being infected and then his coming to jail after a period of interim bail would further complicate the matter which cannot be allowed in the current pandemic situation. Needless to repeat that the interim bail application is totally bereft of any details.” Accused Rakesh Kumar claimed that his father died on April 9 by drowning in a river in Kurwa village in Uttar Pradesh Ambedkar Nagar and sought to be released on interim bail for two months to perform the last rites and to settle family affairs.The man, against whom a rape case was registered against Kumar in 2014 at Anand Parbat police station, said he has been lodged in jail for over six years.The prosecution opposed the bail plea saying nothing has been placed on record to show that the man’s father died on April 9 due to drowning and contended that the allegations against him are serious in nature as he is accused of raping a minor girl.The high court, while dismissing the bail plea, said “Nothing has been placed on record to show that the father of the petitioner expired on April 9 by drowning. The petitioner could have filed the police documents regarding the recovery of the dead body of his father or any document to show that he was cremated.“More so, in the entire bail application it is not stated as to what all ceremonies have to take place and on which date these ceremonies are to be performed. The bail application is totally silent on this aspect.” The court, which was informed by the prosecutor that the trial court has fixed the matter for pronouncement of judgement, said it was expected from the lower court that the verdict would be passed as expeditiously as possible and when the situation warrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-denies-interim-bail-to-rape-accused-for-father-s-last-rites-cites-covid-19-risk/story-kx1yNLloPwp5NlpEYKa9tL.html
16-04-2020||India||‘Blunt instruments mustn’t be used against Covid-19,’ says Rahul: 10 points||Former Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi on Thursday held a press briefing wherein he talked about the prevailing coronavirus situation in the country. Gandhi said that the lockdown is not a permanent solution to the coronavirus outbreak in the country and described the measure as a “pause button”.He also slammed the government saying that the coronavirus testing in the country is not up to the mark and is also not strategic. He also said that though he disagreed with PM Modi on many issues, right now, the time isn’t to fight.“I disagree with Narendra Modi with a lot of issues but now is not the time to fight. Unite and fight the virus,” he said.Here’s a look at what else the Congress leader had to say:1. My main suggestion is that blunt instruments must not be used. We must work strategically. Lockdown has not resolved the problem, it has only postponed the problem.2. Lockdown is in no way a solution to the Covid-19. Lockdown is like a pause button. When we come out of the lockdown, the virus is going to start its work again.3. If you want to fight the virus, you’ve to increase the testing dramatically and your testing has to go from chasing the virus to moving ahead of it. You’ve to move to random testing and pre-empt where the virus is moving.4. Biggest weapon against coronavirus is testing - testing at scale so you know where the virus is moving and you can isolate, target and fight it. 5. Our testing rate is 199 out of a million, all tests that we’ve done in the last 72 days, work out to an approx average of 350 tests per district.6. We need to push testing aggressively and use testing strategically to assist the states in their fight. 7. Use testing not to just track patients but to create a map of India to see where the virus is moving.8. Now we’ve reached a level, where we are in an emergency situation. India must unite and fight against it. 9. To fight against coronavirus, our main force is working at the state and district levels. Success has been achieved in Wayanad, Kerala because of the effective machinery at the district level.10. Centre needs to work on the strategy on the issue of migrant labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-suggests-blunt-instruments-mustn-t-be-used-in-fight-against-covid-19-10-points/story-g1KPT3IEeew81EFhv32w3I.html
16-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Quarantined labourers learn to write for first time in Uttarakhand’s Champawat||55-year-old Pratap Bora, a resident of Kailali district of Nepal, who never went to school due to poverty, had never imagined that it would be in a quarantine facility that he would hold a pencil and a notebook for the first time in his life. And he is now both thrilled and amused that he has finally learnt to write his name in Hindi.“I have never held a copy or a pencil in my hand in my entire life. Here for the first time, I learnt to write in a notebook. Learning to write was a very different kind of experience for me. Now I can sign on any paper in Hindi. I feel I have got some extra special power,” said Bora with a smile on his face.Bora learnt how to write his own name as well as his village name with the help of government teachers at the relief centre set up at a school in Tanakpur area of Champawat district where he has been quarantined with others. Bora used to work as a labourer with a national highway contractor at Dhaun, 55 kilometres from Tanakpur on Pithoragarh road.When he was going to Nepal with other companions after the lockdown was announced, he couldn’t cross the border due to the sealing of the Indo-Nepal border and local administration put him under quarantine in the relief camp at the school.Likewise, Prahlad, 36, a resident of Bahraich area of Uttar Pradesh had never gone to school and worked as a daily wager. He too has learnt to write his name and names of other basic things.“Had I gone to school I would not have to become a labourer. Now, the time has gone but this learning has given me strength. In the future, I would definitely send my children to school,” he said.Faizan, 25, who hails from Bareilly worked in Nepal as a tile-laying mason, was going to Bareilly on foot due to lockdown and the unavailability of transport. Police caught him and his companions on the way to Bareilly in Banbasa and quarantined him here.“It was a thrilling experience for me to learn here how to sign. Now I will sign on paper instead of using my thumb impression while receiving wages in future,” he said.Similar are the stories of many labourers like Iqbal, Mohammad Shahid, Ramnath Bir Bahadur who are being imparted basic education at these relief centres in Champawat.“We have set up 10 centres in Tanakpur, Banbasa, Champawat and Lohaghat. Literacy class initiative is being implemented in our district only,” said SN Pandey, district magistrate, Chamapawat.“Thousands of labourers from different parts of India and Nepal are engaged in mining, construction of the building and all-weather road in Champawat. Literacy initiative will provide somewhat basic knowledge to such quarantined people” said Pandey. “48 Indian and Nepalese nationals have been put under quarantine in a relief centre set up in this school building in Tanakpur area of Champawat. Classes of yoga and meditation are other entertainment activities that are being held to keep quarantined people busy and to reduce their stress,” said Prema Thakur, senior teacher and in-charge of the relief centre in Tanakpur She said, “On the instruction of higher authorities, literacy classes were also conducted here. We provided them with pencils and notebooks for learning and writing. They showed good interest in learning”.“Similar literacy activities are being conducted at relief centres in Banbasa, Champawat and Lohaghat also. Some centres are using blackboards for teaching. Though much can’t be imparted in a short period, these people must have experienced the importance of education in life,” said RC Purohit, chief education officer, Champawat.“In the beginning, these people were shy about joining the class and holding a pencil and notebook, but later they showed good interest. Now, they seem to be happy after learning at least how to write their own names,” said Thakur.Notably, thousands of labourers were earning a livelihood through mining in Sharda and Ladhiya river as well as in the construction of the all-weather road in Champawat before the lockdown, the official said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-quarantined-labourers-learn-to-write-for-first-time-in-their-life-in-uttarakhand-s-champawat/story-CghEzNDn8XzJos3JWVAwxI.html

He also said that lockdown is just a pause button, and not a solution to check the spread of Covid-19.“We are in a very serious situation. People of India and parties need to work together,” Gandhi said in his opening remarks.“I have been speaking to large number of experts, both in India and abroad, as well as outside the government who have a better understanding of what is going on. We need to understand that lockdown is a pause button, it’s not a solution to coronavirus,” he further said.“When we come out of the lockdown, the virus will again begins its work. So we need to have a strategy,” said Gandhi.Speaking on Covid-19 testing in India, he said, there is a need to ramp up your testing facility, to prepare our hospitals. The biggest weapon in fight against Covid-19 is testing - it will tell us where the virus is moving, so you can understand where it is going, so you can isolate it.”“Our testing is not enough to understand where the virus is moving, and it has to go from chasing the virus to getting ahead of it,” added the Congress leader.Gandhi has been critical of the Centre’s handling of coronavirus outbreak.On Wednesday, he demanded that emergency ration cards should be issued to those facing a shortage of foodgrains during the lockdown enforced to contain coronavirus.In a tweet, he had said lakhs of people were unable to take benefit of the public distribution system (PDS) as they do not have ration cards.Earlier this month, he had taken a dig at the BJP-led government over the way lockdown was enforced, saying no country with such a huge number of migrant labourers has attempted it without arranging for their stay and food.With 941 more Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, India’s coronavirus tally crossed the 12,000 mark with the tally reading at 12,380 cases, said the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-not-a-solution-to-fight-covid-19-need-to-ramp-up-testing-rahul-gandhi/story-WN5xIDFQPBn4cb1Z9VhvWJ.html
16-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Delhi’s ILBS gets nod for trials to test plasma therapy efficacy||The Drug Controller General of India has given its approval to the Delhi-based Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) to conduct trials to test the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy for serious coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. The therapy uses plasma – a component of blood – extracted from healthy patients who have recovered from Covid-19 to treat those who are critical. The immune system creates an antibody to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, when it enters a human body. This antibody remains in the human body even after the virus has cleared out.“The antibodies from the recovered person will theoretically help critical patients in fighting the infection. It can be beneficial in the absence of any other vaccines to treat Covid-19. This procedure has been tried for several other viral diseases as well,” said Dr Sarin, director, ILBS.“We take around 300-500 millilitres of blood from those healthy people who have recovered from the infection and have high antibody level, from which plasma is derived, frozen and then administered to patients who are critical and have no other form of treatment available to them,” he said.However, no antibody tests are available in the country now, as it is not manufactured in India. “India doesn’t manufacture antibody testing kits. This makes it impossible to measure the antibody levels of a Covid-19 patient who has recovered. We’re choosing only those healthy patients who have recovered, as they are likely to have a good immunity response,” said Dr Sarin.The trial will be conducted only on healthy individuals, who have recovered from Covid-19 and will act as donors. The donors must not have comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, no heart condition and below 60 years of age. The therapy will be given only to the critical patients such as those with a respiratory rate higher than 30 (normal is 20), have an oxygen saturation of less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%), or have pus in their lungs.“Dr Meenu Bajpai will do the extraction at an isolated area at ILBS, and it will be administered to patients admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital under the supervision of Dr Suresh Kumar from Maulana Azad Medical College,” said Dr Sarin. As per the trial procedures, 10 patients will be randomly administered plasma therapy and an equal number will receive a placebo, as in it will devoid of any therapeutic effect but help in testing new drugs.The procedure will determine whether those who received the plasma recover faster than those who did not.“Healthy Covid-19 patients, who have recovered, should come forward to help those who are critical,” Dr Sarin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-delhi-s-ilbs-gets-nod-for-trials-to-test-plasma-therapy-efficacy/story-QLLOk41IoV5tTBtYBFT6aO.html

The company has been reported to be freezing operations worldwide and furloughing employees to brave the Covid-19 pandemic. Reports suggest that thousands of Oyo employees have been placed on furloughs and leaves for nearly 2 to 3 months as the company fights to weather the coronavirus pandemic. In a video message to his employees, Agarwal said that furloughs will keep jobs safe and will help the business in the long haul, Bloomberg reported.Earlier this month, Agarwal announced that the company revenues have taken a hit of as much as around 50-60 per cent. Oyo, however, has been leading initiatives to provide help during the pandemic. On Wednesday, the company said that it is opening its hotels for a free stay of doctors, nurses and other medical first responders who are helping in the fight against coronavirus in India. Select OYO Townhouse hotels in Gurugram and Bengaluru will offer the service, news agency ANI reported.With more than half of the globe under lockdown, the coronavirus pandemic has taken a massive toll on the tourism industry across the globe. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), the tourism sector accounts for one in ten jobs across the globe but due to the coronavirus crisis, as much as 75% of it under threat. “Research conducted by WTTC shows that 75 million Travel & Tourism jobs are at risk globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least 6.4 million losses across the EU, and one million in the UK,” mentions WTTC on its webpage.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cash-strapped-oyo-offers-free-stay-to-medical-personnel/story-Ev2PHATencuxuD1OmSqnAJ.html

16-04-2020||India||Centre asks states to ensure adequate safe drinking water supply during lockdown||The ministry of Jal Shakti, has written to all states to ensure clean water supply to citizens including those residing in shelter homes or undergoing quarantine or treatment during the ongoing pandemic. Offices and divisions concerned with the treatment and supply of water are part of the essential services allowed during the ongoing nation-wide lockdown that will end on May 3.In a letter that was sent on April 13, the ministry has said that state governments can use the flexi funds under the Jal Jeevan mission to meet the requirements that have arisen on account of the pandemic. The JJM aims to provide tapped water to every household.“The provision of Flexi funds up to 25% of the annual allocation already exists in the Jal Jeevan mission, it is reiterated that the Flexi funds under this mission can be utilised for mitigating drinking water requirements during calamities and whenever needed,” the letter says.Also read: 6,50,000 kits dispatched from China for India, to arrive later todayStates have also been asked to ensure that portable water supply, an essential service is maintained and necessary arrangements for manpower, chemicals, water testing, operation and maintenance are in place. “In case, people involved in running the water supply systems get infected, alternate arrangements have to be made so that there is no breakdown in service,” the letter says.The ministry had also issued an advisory for the states to ensure safe drinking water during the period of lockdown. State government have been asked to ensure that chemicals needed for purification of water are acquired, water supply is available in rural areas where the facility of medical sanitisers may not be available; and to accord priority for supply of water in deficit ares such as relief camps, places of quarantine, old age homes and slums.Also read: Food delivery agent tests Covid-19 +ve in Delhi, 72 families quarantinedThe centre has also suggested increasing supply hours so that people who have to fetch water from the public stand post are not inconvenienced and can follow the protocol of social distancing. Prof. Vikram Soni, Emeritus Professor at Jamia Millia and JNU said though there is little evidence to suggest the transfer of Cornoavirus through water; it is imperative that the authorities should provide clean water.“It is not just availability of water that is of concern but that it should be free from contamination. Contaminated river water which carries human waste, sewage and toxic waste can be a huge carrier of viruses and we do not know where and how they can mutate and strike… To avoid another catastrophe we must protect our good water sources with our life and make sure that contaminated water does not release another invisible monster to plague our world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-ensure-adequate-safe-drinking-water-supply-during-lockdown/story-oNKIMKJcfIvpPzD25vEASK.html

16-04-2020||India||India dials up medical diplomacy, sends 85 mn HCQ tablets, paracetemol to 108 countries||India has dialled up its medical diplomacy, sending loads of medicines to 100-plus countries over the last two weeks to help them fight the Covid-19 pandemic. A top government official told Hindustan Times that India is supplying nearly 85 million hydroxychloroquine tablets and close to 500 million paracetamol tablets to the 108 countries.This is apart from the 1,000 tonnes of paracetamol granules that have been sent to make tablets.“As we speak, a total of 4,000 plus consignments to 60 countries are being cleared for dispatch,” the government official cited above said. In all, the medicine supplies will cover 108 countries.ALSO WATCH | Covid-19 | ‘HCQ can be harmful’: AIIMS head on medicine amid export debateMany of the supplies have been made through special Indian Air Force flights, foreign evacuation charters and even diplomatic cargo.It is a huge exercise, and complicated too given that most countries, including India, have shut flight operations. As one example, officials speak about how Indian HCQ tablets to be delivered to the Dominican Republic, which is the current President of the UNSC, were placed as diplomatic cargo on a US evacuation flight to Atlanta, Georgia. This diplomatic cargo will then be flown from New York to the island in the Carribean region in a Dominican charter later on Thursday. The HCQ tablets sent as gifts to Mauritius and Seychelles were loaded on special Indian Air Force planes on Wednesday for delivery. For reaching the medicines to Afghanistan, efforts are being made to send the medicine by a special charter.According to South Block officials, 5 million HCQ tablets and a large quantity of paracetamol has been either supplied or in the process of being supplied to 31 countries as grant assistance to combat Covid-19.“The emphasis has been on clearing consignments to those friendly countries first which are badly affected by the virus. We will also be clearing requests from some other countries who have sought help in this hour of need. This will be done in a day or two,” said a senior official.Basically, India has decided to supply all the drugs that were lying in special economic zones or 100 percent export oriented units after ensuring that there was an adequate buffer stock for domestic requirements in a worst-case scenario.“Broadly, almost everything that was ready and lying at the airports/ports that cannot be used domestically as on April 14 has been cleared for exports,” said a Ministry of External Affairs official.India has already supplied 80 million HCQ tablets to 24 countries through commercial contracts including US, UK, Russia, France, Spain and Netherlands. It has also supplied large quantities of paracetamol to 52 countries including Italy, Sweden and Singapore. In some cases, both HCQ and paracetamol tablets were supplied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-dials-up-medical-diplomacy-sending-85-mn-hcq-tablets-to-108-countries/story-O6n44wY3cNKWUcKqKdphGP.html
16-04-2020||India||Your voice may be able to tell if you have Covid||The rush to understand, predict and head off the Covid-19 outbreak has prompted technology researchers to deploy artificial intelligence to create tools that can determine whether people are infected by analysing the sound of their cough, the way they speak or even breathe.Currently, most of these efforts are at a stage in which the researchers are gathering data – speech and coughing recordings paired with information whether someone has an infection. These are then fed to AI algorithms – specifically deep learning and machine learning programmes.“Since the voice production mechanism is so complex and dependent on cognitive abilities, any factor that affects your body or your mind will reflect in your voice. The changes can be in fractions of seconds -- what we call “micro” signatures, that are not audible to the untrained listener, but nevertheless present,” said Rita Singh, a computer sciences research professor at the Carnegie Mellon University, whose team created the COVID Voice Detector.The changes, added Singh in a video-call, carry “a surprising amount of information that can be linked to physiological factors”. “Any condition affecting the lungs or the respiratory system – as has been established in the cases of Covid-19 infections -- has a palpable effect on voice. Moreover, the cough of a Covid patient is also distinct from a healthy person’s,” she added.“The tool is basically a self-learning system that is now trying to learn signatures of a Covid infection that shows up in voice, not just in cough,” Singh said, adding that more data it is fed, the more it understands the signatures.At the core of the tool is a computer programme patented by Singh and used extensively in voice profiling work by law enforcement in United States, according to a homeland security research agency.A similar effort has been launched by researchers at the University of Cambridge. The COVID-19 Sounds app, available as a Chrome or Firefox plugin for now, is at present building a crowdsourced data set.“Having spoken to doctors, one of the most common things they have noticed about patients with the virus is the way they catch their breath when they’re speaking, as well as a dry cough, and the intervals of their breathing patterns,” said professor Cecilia Mascolo from Cambridge’s department of computer science and technology in an article published by the university.A third such initiative is being carried out by Mumbai-based Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Launched on April 7, Wadhwani’s Cough Against Covid mobile application asks users to record the sound of their coughing and share an image of a test result if they are positive.For such efforts to work, the quality and the accuracy of data is crucial. “Such a system needs to be thoroughly vetted by the medical community and thoroughly tested. It must have near-zero false positives and zero false negatives. This is impossible to achieve in a short run, so our goal is tempered down to being able to return more conservative factoids from voice that may still be helpful to everyone,” Singh said.As the disease brings much of the planet to a halt, scientists and health experts have called for technology to play a bigger part in tackling the pandemic – which has grown too quickly for conventional containment tools to have an effect.Software giants such as Apple and Google are working on a mobile phone-based contact tracing tool, a technology that several nations – including India with the Aarogya Setu app – have already deployed on their own.Apart from AI and proximity-estimating tools meant to trace contacts, researchers are also looking at internet-of-things (IOT) devices such as smart thermometers. “A company called Kinsa comes up with heat maps of fever prevalence. Such tools can be useful in identifying large outbreaks that health authorities can respond to and direct testing and containment resources if need be,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, the head of biostatistics at the University of Michigan.The efforts also present a challenge for privacy, since connected device data, personal audio recordings, location histories and health records need to be protected from profiteering and surveillance.India’s Aarogya Setu app has been criticised by privacy advocates for collecting too much data, the use of which is governed by privacy policies that, they say, lacks transparency and accountability. The developers and the government of India have rejected the concerns..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-voice-breathing-pattern-help-detect-covid-19-technology-explores/story-SiygaOmdRV6BU8Qhqg5XmO.html

16-04-2020||India||Whole country fighting under leadership of PM Narendra Modi: Yogi Adityanath||New Delhi: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath says his government is battle-ready to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. In an email interview to HT, he spoke about how his government is working to ensure food for the people amid the nationwide lockdown, which was enforced on March 25 to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak and has since been extended till May 3, and drafting policies for hassle-free transportation of essential commodities. Edited excerpts from the interview:Q: Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state. How many tests per million have been conducted till now? What other measures are being taken to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and its containment?A: The entire country is fighting against Covid-19 us under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is a battle to save humanity. The state government is working as per his guidance and the central government’s guidelines. Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in the country, and it is a big challenge for us to prevent the spread of Covid-19 here. We started working to prevent the outbreak soon after its alarm was sounded. In the last one month, where only 200 tests could have been performed in one laboratory, now 14 testing labs are functional and 2,500 tests are being done. Uttar Pradesh is also the first state in the country where Covid-19 pool testing has started. In pool testing, 8, 16 or 32 samples are being tested at a time. We have also identified and sealed hotspots in every district to prevent the spread of Covid-19. We have allowed only people associated with three essential services to enter these sealed areas -- the medical team, those related to sanitisation of houses and doorstep delivery.Q: UP has a large population of migrant workers, a sizeable percentage of whom, are back in the state. There are concerns that many of them may not be able to or may not even want to go back to their jobs when the lockdown restrictions are lifted. How will the state take care of thousands of unemployed people?A: Our government is serious about this issue. During the lockdown and after it is lifted, the state government will try to accelerate the infrastructure and labour-oriented projects that will provide maximum employment in a short time. We will also bring in more labourers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). Besides, the state government is also working on other schemes. We have constituted 11 committees under the chairmanship of ministers to draft a policy towards strengthening the state’s economy after the lockdown is lifted and to further extend the employment activities.Q: The pandemic has dealt a blow to the global economy. How will the lockdown, now extended till May 3, impact the state’s economy? How will the state emerge from the blow? A: The state government is working on a long-term strategy to give momentum to the economy. Our government has taken many important decisions in the cabinet meeting regarding this. State government policies are being formulated in keeping with the PM’s message of ‘Jaan Bhi-Jahan Bhi’. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya is heading the committee constituted to restart construction work on major projects of expressways, highways, public works department (PWD), and other departments. The committee, headed by Finance minister Suresh Khanna, will offer recommendations about which services should be carried forward to maintain the revenue receipts in the state. This committee will also recommend measures for the industrial sector and begin work in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Another committee, headed by Labour Minister Swami Prasad Maurya, will give recommendations to protect the interests of workers. We have also started work to ensure that farmers do not face any problem in harvesting, availability of seeds and purchase of their crops. We have started purchasing crops at the minimum support price (MSP) from April 15. Farmer producer organisations are being encouraged to buy crops from the farmer’s home or fields. In order to facilitate the harvesting of Rabi crop, our government has given an exemption to labourers or farmers while observing social distancing and has issued passes so that harvesters could reach their fields. We have opened seed and fertiliser shops for the sowing of crops.Q: Are there any specific sectors for which you need the central government’s assistance? Many states have indicated that they will need an impetus to help increase their incomes, GST compensation and increase in borrowing capacity?A. The relief package announced by PM Modi has provided great relief to Uttar Pradesh. Whatever further steps need to be taken will depend on the recommendations of the 11 committees. We are getting continuous support from the Centre. Our government will consider all issues related to increasing income, GST compensation and borrowing capacity after the suggestions of constituted committees.Q The government has eased restrictions to some sectors and road construction activities in areas that are not Covid-19 hotspots. Now, the PM has said there will be strict monitoring till April 20. Is UP in a position to resume work in any of its districts?A: According to the guidelines issued by the central government, the work of industries and road construction can be restarted. The committee, headed by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, will study the guidelines of the central government and submit its report accordingly after reviewing every aspect.Q: There were many complaints of police action in the state against people during the lockdown? Has any direction been given to the police?A. Uttar Pradesh Police is doing a commendable job during the lockdown. In this hour of crisis, people have come to see the humane face of the police. I conduct daily meetings with the officers and I have directed that no wrong step of any kind is taken anywhere. If during the lockdown, a person gets involved in any prohibited activity, then the police will definitely take action. In the Tablighi Jamaat case, the police had come forward and demanded their cooperation. But in many places, they had to face resistance, because of which they had to take action. In some places, the Jamaat members went into hiding and were later captured and kept in quarantine. This has been done to stop community transmission. On behalf of the government, the police have instructions to get the suspected cases admitted to a hospital and put them under quarantine.Q: The Centre has allowed wholesale markets to function and allowed the transportation of essential goods, yet there are difficulties in the food supply chain. In western UP, sugarcane farmers were gearing for sowing. What steps are being taken to ensure there are no disruptions?A: There is no shortage of foodgrains in the country and in the state. There is no problem with any kind of food supply in the state. We have enough rations available and have distributed fruits and vegetables through 13,977 mobile vans, e-rickshaws, tractors, and 29,100 carts to date. More than 20,000 people are distributing milk. Necessary items were distributed through 21,256 grocery stores in the state, using the help of 49,399 home delivery providers. We have fixed the responsibility of the District Supply Officer, who has to ensure everyone gets a ration. People’s ration cards have been made and they are given Rs 1,000 as immediate relief. We have allowed farmers and workers to go to the field for sugarcane harvesting and to bring sugarcane to the centres and mill gates. Permission has been given to open seed and fertiliser shops. I can assure you that not a single farmer in Uttar Pradesh will face any problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whole-country-fighting-under-leadership-of-pm-narendra-modi-yogi-adityanath/story-UZDVLCEgXPpcWuNOw6MV1L.html

We have come to know from the research in China so far that the virus which has affected humans either may have been because the bat virus developed such mutations that it developed the capacity to cause disease in humans or it got transmitted to pangolins from bats first and then to human beings. This question is being asked because we started a survey on emerging infectious diseases and to see if those viruses can be found in bats. We found the presence of coronavirus in two bat species but they are not capable of affecting human beings adversely,” senior ICMR scientist R Gangakhedkar said on Wednesday.“The instances of transmission of virus from bats to humans can happen may be once in around 1000 years or so. It is a rare event,” he said.Gangakhedkar, who heads the Head of Epidemiological and Communicable Diseases department at ICMR, said that a recent study by the medical body has found the presence of coronavirus in two Indian bat species, but those are incapable of affecting humans adversely.These bat coronaviruses have no relation with Sars-CoV-2 responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, he said.The Union Health Ministry, meanwhile, declared 170 districts in 25 states as Covid-19 hotspots on Wednesday and 207 districts in 27 states as non-hotspots, reiterating that there has been no community transmission of the disease in the country so far.Addressing the daily briefing to provide updates on coronavirus situation in the country, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said that states have been asked to classify districts witnessing higher number of cases as hotspots, districts where some cases have been found as non-hotspots, and those which have reported no cases as green zones.Hotspots are those districts which are reporting more number of cases or where the rate of growth of Covid-19 cases is high, Agarwal said, adding a detailed direction has been issued to states stating consolidated efforts are required to utilise this period of lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.In order to break the chain of transmission, focus needs to be on contact tracing, monitoring and clinical management. States have been asked to uniformly implement the containment plan in every district across the country, Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maybe-once-in-1000-years-icmr-on-covid-19-transmission-from-bats-to-humans/story-YqtqjDOK88gFRZejNbfeQO.html

It also said that Sharma even assaulted them and touched them inappropriately when they were about to leave the spot.Sharma was granted bail by the Metropolitan Magistrate on April 9, however, it was cancelled on the same day by the Additional Sessions Judge looking into the seriousness of the allegations. Aggrieved, he moved to the Delhi High Court seeking release from the jail.Appearing for him, his counsel contended that his client had been falsely implicated and he had only protested against the complainant and her sister for not maintaining the social distancing. He said that both the ladies became aggressive and told that they were doctors and knew the meaning of social distancing.However, the court said that Sharma being an educated man should have been respectful to the doctors rather than abusing and threatening them.“The country is passing through a very difficult phase and the doctors are rendering service to the nation.

He was posted in Silvani area of Bhopal’s neighbouring Raisen district.On Tuesday, a video went viral on social media in which a man is seen questioning SDM’s wife as to in what capacity she was driving the official vehicle. The man also asked the woman if she had a driving licence. The woman denied that she was driving the vehicle and was heard saying since her vehicle had developed some snag she had to take a lift.She said her driving licence was at home and refused to tell the man about her credentials.On Wednesday, Raisen district collector Umashankar Bhargava issued an order shifting the SDM from the district collectorate and appointing a new SDM LK Khare in his place.The order didn’t mention any reason behind the transfer. However, it read, “This order is to be enforced with immediate effect.”Bhargava couldn’t be reached for his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sdm-shifted-after-wife-seen-learning-driving-in-his-official-vehicle/story-eBjuyNwS4GaRw1VKGn2rXN.html

16-04-2020||India||Monsoon forecast brings relief to farmers, industry||The prediction of a normal June-to-September monsoon by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has brought relief to farmers, industry, and the government alike as it will likely lessen the strain on the economy from widespread disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic, experts said on Wednesday.The monsoon rains are critical because nearly 60% of India’s net arable land lacks irrigation and half the population depends on agriculture for a livelihood.With good rains, spending by rural consumers on manufactured items such as television sets and gold jewellery goes up, and boosts factory output. A deficient monsoon cuts rural consumption and also drives up inflation. A normal monsoon is key for robust agricultural output growth, which the government targets at around 4%.“Deficit rain could have toughened the fight against the covid-19 pandemic because not only does it necessitate costly drought-fighting measures, but poor rains also directly impact rural farm-derived incomes,” said economist R Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. Prediction of a normal monsoon rainfall is good news and offers a ray of hope of keeping farm incomes going amid such times, he added.The monsoon is said to be normal if rains are between 96% and 104% of the country’s long-term summer rainfall average of 88 cm. This year, the rains are predicted to be 100% of this average. Farmers await the arrival of monsoon on June 1 to begin kharif sowing of a range of crops such as rice, lentils, gram, soybean, cotton, tea, coarse cereals, fruits and vegetables. A good monsoon results in robust farm output and eases inflationary pressures. A poor one could increase pressure on rural incomes and the make-work rural jobs under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-forecast-brings-relief-to-farmers-industry/story-wGvTDA8cUV5DasWIKM5fnK.html
16-04-2020||India||Scientists divided over strain mutation: ‘Need more evidence’||A mutation in the coronavirus strain isolated in India has the potential to jeopardise global efforts to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, which has infected 2 million people and killed at least 126,000 in four months, according to a preliminary analysis of 106 Sars-CoV-2 and 39 SARS genome sequences.Scientists, however, warn against reliance on a single sample and say further confirmation is needed.The mutation was in the mechanism the virus uses to enter human cells. It was found in the strains isolated from a case in Kerala on January 27. The findings were published in the preprint server bioRxiv, which puts scientific papers in the public domain before peer-review.Sars-CoV-2 consists of a strand of RNA enclosed in shell covered with spikes. Most vaccine and drug development efforts are focusing on stopping the action of the spike protein.The study found changes in a part of the spike protein that allows the virus to bind to and penetrate cells. This protein targets cells containing ACE-2, a protein found in lung, kidney, heart, and gut cells in humans. “We identified a mutation that leads to weaker receptor binding capability.... This represents the first report of a significant Sars-CoV-2 mutant, and raises the alarm that the ongoing vaccine development may become futile in future epidemic if more mutations were identified,” wrote the study’s authors from multiple institutions in Australia and Taiwan. The study also provided direct genetic evidence that Sars-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than Sars-CoV, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome.“The lower receptor fit may make virus less efficient in transmission, but then we need to watch out for a change in virulence also. As of now this paper, is ‘curiosity’ information. We have to wait and watch,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The mutation appears to be random and not the result of natural selection by the immune system because there were no more variants in that part of the spike than elsewhere in the genome, say scientists.“The study lays too much reliance on a single sample with a variation that has been previously discussed. Unless one sees this confirmed further at sequence and protein level studies, at the minimum, no conclusion can be reached,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, Delhi.Most work on vaccines and drugs is targeting the spike protein to prevent it from binding to the ACE-2. Five vaccine candidates are in phase 1 clinical trials to establish safety for humans and 73 in exploratory or preclinical stages. A vaccine is likely to be ready in early 2021, according to an analysis of the global vaccine database of Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness (Cepi), one of the world’s biggest public funders of vaccine development. The analysis was published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-divided-over-strain-mutation-need-more-evidence/story-gKHWkQpzdmbSfD4SxoXzfJ.html
16-04-2020||India||Opening Covid-free areas may have limited economic impact||As the government prepares for the second phase of the lockdown, it has announced that states will lift restrictions on individual districts and cities based on their protection from, and exposure to Covid-19. This will help restart economic activities and provide some relief to livelihoods. To understand the economic impact of such a move, we looked at coronavirus disease and credit data (an indicator of economic activity) at the district level. There are 327 districts with no confirmed Covid-19 cases in India. That is 45% of all 717 districts in the country. However, these districts accounted for only 7% of the total credit in the third quarter of 2019, according to the latest data available from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This essentially means that even if the restrictions are lifted in districts free of the coronavirus, the economic impact will be limited. This is not only because of their low level of economic activity, but also because they are often tightly interconnected with other districts -- for resources, inputs and markets -- that are under lockdown. We classified the districts into four categories. The first is districts with no cases -- green. These will most likely see some economic activity post-April 2020. Next up are districts with five or fewer cases with the number of cases increasing at a very low rate of less than 20% over a week - yellow. The third, orange, are districts where the number of cases is growing at a rate of more than 20% and less than 100%. A 100% growth rate is when districts are doubling their cases every week. The last category, red, are districts where the number of cases has breached 100 or are doubling every week. These districts, 93 in all, account for more than 50% of all the credit flowing within the country. But, a large part of the credit goes to India’s large cities; 21% of all of India’s credit in Q3, 2019, went to Mumbai and 12% to Delhi. Cumulatively, nine districts that each account for more than 1% of total credit (together they account for 51%) have 43% of India’s total Covid-19 cases. Economic activity will be immensely affected without these districts also opening up.It may be argued that even within these districts and cities, restrictions will be opened up in some parts. But the analysis shows that across eight important states, the lion’s share of credit goes to districts where the number of cases are doubling every week or are at least 100. From the states’ perspective, even if a majority of the districts were to lift the lockdown, it will see very minimal business happening if the large metros and economic centres are still shut down. Of the total credit flowing within Maharashtra, 61% of it is in districts that have seen a high growth rate of cases and may be the last to open.  However, the impact of opening up will be higher if it is backed by other initiatives that improve productivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opening-covid-free-areas-may-have-limited-economic-impact/story-Q4kDmYmmoJf2iBg5rOHgYP.html
16-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Tuesday, the health department of New York City did something unexpected. It estimated the number of deaths that would have occurred in the city between March 11 (the day the city recorded its first death from Covid-19) and April 13 under normal circumstances, found out that around 3,000 more died than should have, and attributed the deaths to the coronavirus disease. It is likely that a few of these people were actually infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, but New York’s logic for adding them to its total toll from the disease (which went past 10,000 as a result) wasn’t that – it was that the pandemic disrupted its health and other systems, causing these deaths that would otherwise not have happened. As cities, states, and countries around the world grapple with the disease, it is becoming clear that there is often an unmeasured but significant cost in terms of lives (leave alone livelihoods). New York’s experience has highlighted one of the factors that seem to work in favour of the disease – density. The New York Metropolitan Area, which includes other parts of NY state and large and proximate cities in the states of New Jersey and Connecticut, has a population in excess of 20 million and a density of 2,500 people per square km. This is something that should worry both Mumbai and Delhi. The National Capital Region of Delhi (including some parts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana) has a population of around 46 million, and a density of about 840 people per square km. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region, including adjoining regions in Maharashtra, has a population of around 26 million and a density of 4,764 people per square km. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region and NCR numbers date back to 2011, India’s most recent census. With the city limits, the density is several times higher in both places. And within both regions, there are parts which are extremely crowded – Mumbai’s Dharavi slum for instance. On Wednesday, the number of cases in Mumbai were 1,896 and Delhi 1,578. Together, the two cities accounted for about 28% of all Covid-19 cases in India. Both cities have a high number of so-called containment zones – 438 in Mumbai, and 56 in Delhi. Thus far, 114 Covid-19 patients have died in Mumbai and 32 in Delhi. Both Maharashtra (Mumbai-specific test numbers aren’t available) and Delhi have also tested far more people (per million population) than other states. The number for Maharashtra is 462 per million, and Delhi 989 per million. The national average is 203.Given the number of containment zones in both the National Capital Region and the Mumbai Metropolitan Area, it is unlikely that both will benefit significantly from the partial relaxation of restrictions that will come into effect from April 20. While the relaxations are significant – some have described it as a “big first step” – it is unlikely they will make a big difference to economic activity in these areas. An analysis by HT’s data partner Howindialives took credit flow as a proxy of economic activity and discovered that 43% of cases are in districts that together account for over half of all credit flows. Still, it is a first step, and more such are needed – as is a generous economic relief and stimulus package that benefits both individuals and businesses alike.The guidelines (see page 2) issued by the home ministry are notable for another reason – they say that spitting in public spaces will be punishable with a fine across India. India is a country of expectorators and this is probably the first time there has been a move at the national level to crack down on the unhygienic practice||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-LIkJeRNvhCaOXP0ja5OjGN.html
16-04-2020||India||17 more cases, 1 new containment zone identified||People in Delhi who were infected with coronavirus (Covid-19) from coming in contact with a positive case was four times higher than those who got it from travelling abroad, as per the data released by Delhi government. So far, only 82 people who travelled internationally have tested positive for Covid-19 in comparison to 327, who got the disease locally. On Wednesday, Delhi reported 17 new cases of Covid-19, none related to the Markaz. On Tuesday, nine cases had been reported among those who had been evacuated in the special operation, down from 325 the day before.A total of 2,300 people were taken to hospitals and quarantine centres from Nizamuddin, of which 1,080 people tested positive — putting the positivity rate among them to 46%. “As so many people were living in such close proximity, a high number of people were thought to have the infection. This is the reason the government started testing even those without symptoms at the quarantine centres. Now, all the tests have been completed,” a senior official from the department of health in Delhi said. All those who had returned from international travel have completed their mandatory home quarantine, the data shows. The authorities also reported two Covid-19 deaths in the city on Wednesday — a 43-year-old woman who was admitted to RML Hospital and a 55-year-old woman at the Safdarjung Hospital. Of the 867 positive cases admitted to hospitals, 29 people are in intensive care, with five on ventilators. Just 323 tests were done on Wednesday, a day after the Delhi government decided to undertake a massive testing drive.An order has been issued to all registered nursing homes and private hospitals, stating that they shall not refuse treatment to the injured/ serious patients brought to them for any reason. On Wednesday, one new containment zone was added in Delhi, taking the total to 56. The zone was identified in North Delhi’s Model Town’s Police Colony. As many as three blocks (G, H and I) were sealed and cordoned off to prevent the spread of Covid. By late Wednesday evening, a block in South Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave was also identified as a potential containment zone. As it was a late development, the neighbourhood is likely to be added in the official list of the government on Thursday as the orders are still being issued, said a senior government official.“We are issuing containment order for B block of Safdarjung Enclave. Four persons of a family tested positive for Covid-19,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate of south zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-more-cases-1-new-containment-zone-identified/story-3OUl8yK0ELTFBQC6ukNeWO.html
16-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Govt lists curbs to be eased on April 20||The Union government on Wednesday conditionally allowed industries in rural areas and economic enclaves to reopen next week, green-lighted work under the federal job guarantee scheme, and permitted daily wagers in some areas to return to work, as it sought to get the country’s economic engine chugging again and lessen the pain of millions affected by the ongoing lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19. The guidelines on the restart of the economy , with a sharp rural focus, was described as a giant first step by some analysts. It comes after an initial three-week nationwide lockdown to flatten the curve of infections that ended Tuesday midnight was extended by 19 days to May 3. To be sure, none of the activities will be restarted in so-called containment zones declared by state and local administrations; district magistrates have been empowered to take decisions that work locally. No public transport including planes, trains, buses, metro rail and taxis will be available during the second phase of the lockdown, although courier services have now been allowed and will likely feed into air and rail cargo services, which were also operational during the first phase. “Select additional activities” are being allowed to “mitigate hardship to the public,” the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said in its order, caveating that “these additional activities will be operationalised by states/union territories/district administrations based on strict compliance to the existing guidelines on lockdown measures”. The conditional and partial opening-up was welcomed by industry and experts who saw it as striking a fine balance between easing restrictions and ensuring the pandemic doesn’t spread — especially with local officials being allowed to act quickly and reimpose them if infections flare up or emerge. “An important redeeming feature of the new guidelines operative from April 20 is the opening up of the agricultural and rural sector including MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) activities. MGNREGA works are allowed primarily for irrigation and water conservation works. Farming operations in the fields are allowed fully for farmers and farm workers. This would help save the rabi crop to a significant degree,” DK Srivastava, the chief policy advisor, EY India, said. The home ministry’s order laid down “National Directives for Covid-19 Management” that made masks compulsory in all public and workplaces; said spitting would be punishable with a fine, and banned the sale of liquor, tobacco, and chewing tobacco (gutka). The guidelines also specified social distancing and sanitation rules for workplaces and factories. The guidelines also said e-commerce companies would be allowed to operate, although it wasn’t clear whether this was merely an extension of the current situation — most already operate, delivering essential goods — or the delivery of non-essential goods would also be allowed. The stock markets lost all their early gains and closed down (the Sensex by 310 points at 30,379), although experts said this wasn’t because of the guidelines but global factors. Activities including food processing industries, road construction and industrial projects in rural areas will restart from April 20, as will irrigation projects, construction and other industrial projects, MHA said. The federal job guarantee scheme,the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), will restart with a focus on irrigation and water conservation works. Rural Common Service Centres (CSCs), delivering e-governance services to rural India will also be restarted.The guidelines also said that all farming-related activities will remain operational. With the harvest season on , it added that it will be business as usual in terms of procurement and that mandis (farm markets) operated by Agricultural Product Marketing Committees, satellite mandis notified by states, even direct marketing operations by states or industries to buy directly from farmers will all be allowed.“Since majority of farm practices, right from sowing, harvesting, grading, loading, cleaning, packaging etc. are done manually, an acute shortage of labourers is posing a challenge for harvesting,” said Shivendra Bajaj of the Alliance for Agri Innovation. Businesses dealing in agricultural equipment and their repair, and the manufacturing, distribution and sale of fertilizers, seeds and pesticides will go on, the guidelines said. The fisheries and dairy sector will remain operational and the government has allowed sale and marketing of tea, coffee, rubber and cashew nuts -- but with a maximum of 50% workers deployed in these plantations. The MHA order allows the restart of certain manufacturing activities from Monday in areas that are not hot spots or containment zones , and in special economic zones (SEZs) and industrial townships. It also allowed export- oriented units (EoUs) to operate. The order permitted manufacturing of essential goods such as medical equipment and pharmaceutical products, but also said food processing units could operate in rural areas. It allowed the manufacture of IT hardware, packaging material, the mining of coal and other minerals, and oil exploration and refining. However, it wanted employers to arrange transport of employees to the workplace and also suggested that they make “arrangements for stay of workers within their premises as far as possible”. The order allows construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings, and all kinds of industrial projects in rural areas and industrial estates. Besides, construction of renewable energy projects and in-situ construction within the municipal limits is also allowed provided workers are available on site and no workers are required to be brought in from outside, it added. Niranjan Hiranandani, national president of the National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco) and also of the industry body Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) , said the order permitted a “staggered reopening” of stalled construction works from April 20 with certain conditions. “The real estate industry acknowledges the positive impact this will have in handling the migrant crisis and avoid any strain further to the Covid-19 human-economic crisis,” added the Mumbai-based developer.“With this order, the economic drivers of the country will start moving again, even as we extend the lockdown. Considering the estimated loss of ₹26,000 crore per day to the Indian economy as a result of the lockdown, this relaxation is a constructive step,” he added.Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) president Sangita Reddy welcomed the government’s calibrated restart of the economy, but also stressed the need for a relief and stimulus package for industry. “It is now crucial to announce a relief and economic stimulus package, which protects wages, employment, and business.” Industry bodies have asked for a financial package of ₹14 lakh crore to ₹16 lakh crore to revive the economy, HT reported on Wednesday.Rumki Majumdar, an economist at Deloitte India, said, “Allowing certain economic activities, especially in areas that are not hotspots and have low probability of turning into one, will likely help the vulnerable section of the population in sustaining their livelihood.”“However, several hot spots are also manufacturing hubs (such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi, among others), which makes it difficult to resume factory activities quickly,” Majumdar said.The exhaustive guidelines for services catering to urban India offer no room for recreational activities but focus on ensuring functioning supply chains for essentials.People can use their private vehicles for emergency situations or procuring essential goods, MHA said; in some parts of the country, the use of private vehicles for this was restricted by local administrations. To be sure, they will have to practice social distancing with only two people being allowed in cars. The home ministry said all kirana shops, even roadside carts that deal with “food and groceries, hygiene items, fruits and vegetables, poultry, meat and fish and animal feed” will operate.The guideline said, “all facilities in the supply chain of essential goods, whether involved in manufacturing, wholesale or retail of such goods through local stores, large brick and mortar stores or e-commerce companies should be allowed to operate, ensuring strict social distancing without any restriction on their timing of opening and closure.”E-commerce companies welcomed the move. “The resumption of economic activity from April 20 is a welcome step that will depend on unhindered availability of labour that is critical to deliver essential products to people across the country and ensure they can stay home safely,” a spokesperson for Amazon India said. In addition, the MHA order also allowed courier companies to function.Even as restrictions are eased in some parts of the country, Covid-9 hotspots will see stricter perimeter control to ensure no unchecked inward or outward movement except for medical emergencies and maintaining law and order.The government also invoked the Disaster Management Act, 2005 to lay down penal provisions for violations of lockdown measures. For obstructing any officials, misappropriating money or materials and for making false claims, people may face up to two years of imprisonment and fines.If someone is caught giving a false warning of any disaster, he or she may face a prison term of up to one year. Officials, too will face charges if they fail to perform their duties. The guideline also invoked section 188 of the Indian Penal Code to say that any disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant can lead to fines and one month’s jail term.A government statement said the objective of the fresh guidelines is “to consolidate the gains achieved during the 1st phase of lockdown and further slow down the spread of Covid-19 and at the same time provide relief to farmers and labour and daily wage earners.”It added that the government aims to ensure that “agricultural and related activities remain fully functional, the rural economy functions with maximum efficiency, employment opportunities are created for daily wage earners and other members of the labour force and select industrial activities are allowed to resume their operations with adequate safeguards and mandatory standard operating protocols (SOPs).”“ At the same time, keeping the imperative of containing the spread of Covid-19 in the country, National Directives for Covid-19 management have been laid down, which shall be enforced by the District Magistrates through fines and penal action as prescribed in the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-govt-lists-curbs-to-be-eased-on-april-20/story-D4S3uCEgXwLk8FmLTj0ekM.html
16-04-2020||India||Sunder Pichai, Satya Nadella, four other Indian-Americans in Donald Trump’s list of economic advisers||President Donald Trump has roped in six Indian-American corporate leaders, including Sundar Pichai from Google and Satya Nadella from Microsoft, to seek advice from the “brightest” and the “smartest” people on how to restart US economy that has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic.America’s economy, the world’s largest, has come to a standstill due the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 95 per cent of the 330 million population is under stay-at-home order amid a national emergency in place. A record number of over 16 million people have lost their jobs due to the ongoing economic crisis in the US, according to latest official figures. President Trump has named over 200 top American leaders from various industries and sections to create nearly a dozen and a half different groups as part of the Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups. These leaders will advise the president and offer recommendations on how to revive the American economy, which has hit an unprecedented ebb in just a few weeks due to the deadly coronavirus. “They’re the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest. And they’re going to give us some ideas,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus on Tuesday.In addition to Pichai and Nadella, the president has named IBM’s Arvind Krishna and Micron’s Sanjay Mehrotra to the Tech Group. Other members of the group are Apple’s Tim Cook, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. Indian-American Ann Mukherjee from Pernod Ricard has been named to the manufacturing Group, which among others include Caterpillar’s Jim Umpleby III; Tesla’s Elon Musk, Fiat Chrysler’s Mike Manley, Ford’s Bill Ford and General’s Mary Barra. Ajay Banga from Mastercard has been named to the Financial Services Group along with, among others, Al Kelly from Visa, Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman; Fidelity Investment’s Abigail Johnson and Intuit’s Sasan Goodarzi. The various groups created by Trump are: agriculture, banking, construction/labour/workforce; defense, energy, financial services, food and beverages, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, real estate, retail, tech, telecommunication, transportation, sports and thought leaders.These bipartisan groups of American leaders will work together with the White House to chart the path forward toward a future of unparalleled American prosperity, the White House said. “The health and wealth of America is the primary goal, and these groups will produce a more independent, self-sufficient, and resilient nation,” the White House said in a statement.President Trump recently said that reopening the country’s economy will be the “biggest decision” ever he will have to make. “I’m going to have to make a decision and I only hope to God that it is the right decision, but I would say without question it is the biggest decision I have ever had to make,” Trump said last week. He said the reopening the country to business activities would be taken at an appropriate time in consultation with his close advisors, including the members of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.Trump, however, did not give a definitive date for this at the briefing which the president has been hosting to provide Americans an update on his administration’s ongoing efforts in the war against the “invisible enemy”. Earlier, he was keen on reopening the economy by Easter (April 12) as the businessman-turned politician was reportedly under pressure from his friends on the Wall Street. The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that the global economy will this year likely suffer the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, as governments worldwide grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic.With schools and many businesses shut, the measures to slow the spread of the disease have taken a painful toll on the US economy.The coronavirus death toll in the United States crossed 25,000 on Tuesday with the country witnessing the highest single-day tally of 2,129. As of Tuesday, more than 6,05,000 Americans had tested positive for the novel coronavirus -- more than the other top three countries taken together -- according to Johns Hopkins University. Globally, 126,722 people have died and nearly two million people have been infected by the novel coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunder-pichai-satya-nadella-four-other-indian-americans-in-donald-trump-s-list-of-economic-advisers/story-9BIhHglNa95vyuvzcf986O.html

No segregation is being done in civil hospitals on the basis of religion, as clarified by the Gujarat government.”The USCIRF had tweeted that it was “concerned with reports of Hindu & Muslim patients separated into separate hospital wards in #Gujarat. Such actions only help to further increase ongoing stigmatization of Muslims in #India and exacerbate false rumors of Muslims spreading #Covid19.”On Tuesday, the USCIRF had welcomed the Indian Supreme Court’s decision to relax conditions for release of people detained as “foreigners” in Assam’s detention centres because of Covid-19-related concerns.The Supreme Court ordered the release of people held for at least two years and lowered the personal bond necessary to secure release from Rs 100,000 to Rs 5,000.In its 2019 report, the USCIRF had highlighted concerns that the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam “is an intentional effort to discriminate and/or has the effect of discriminating against Muslims”.The Indian government has reacted angrily to the USCIRF’s criticism in the past as interference in the country’s internal affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-uscirf-s-criticism-on-reported-treatment-of-covid-19-patients/story-Bfk627MHQThx23oYeAqaqO.html

16-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Two more Delhi cops test positive, families told to quarantine themselves||Two Delhi police constables from central Delhi’s Chandni Mahal area tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, senior officers said. Both the policemen were sent to a hospital in Saket for treatment and their families have been asked to quarantine themselves at home. The two men, in their early 40s, were posted at Chandni Mahal police station, the same area where at least 52 people have so far tested positive for the disease. Last month, many of them had even attended a congregation in Nizamuddin which emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said while one of the constables was posted at a picket in the area, another was attached with the Station House Officer.“Their reports were received on Wednesday according to which they are Covid-19 positive. They were immediately sent to Max hospital in Saket for further treatment. Their families have been asked to quarantine themselves at home,” Bhatia said.A senior officer who did not wish to be named, said since the two constables lived at the Chandni Mahal police station, many other personnel from the police station, including the station house officer (SHO) and other inspectors have been advised to go on home quarantine, as per the standard protocol pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic. The deputy commissioner of police (southwest), along with 37 personnel, including ACP of Safdarjung Enclave sub-division and the SHO of Safdarjung Enclave police station, were asked to go on home quarantine on Sunday because they had come in contact with an assistant sub-inspector (ASI), posted at AIIMS Trauma Centre police post, was tested positive for Covid-19.DCP Bhatia said the police staff who were in close contact of the two constables are being identified.With the two constables, the total count of Delhi police personnel testing positive far for Covid-19 has gone up to five. More than 1,500 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Delhi so far. On Sunday, a Delhi police assistant sub inspector, who was posted at the AIIMS Trauma Centre, tested positive for and was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Dilshad Garden.Last week, another ASI posted with Delhi Traffic Police had tested positive and was shifted to AIIMS Trauma centre for further treatment. Later in the week a head constable who was posted with the Bureau of Immigration, at the Delhi airport, had also tested positive and had to be admitted in LNJP hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-two-more-delhi-cops-test-positive-families-told-to-quarantine-themselves/story-FtknEaWwQk8NFRbaCzC4oI.html

16-04-2020||India||Medical staff at state-run hospitals in Bengal to work every alternate week, says Mamata||Doctors, nurses and other medical staff in state-run hospitals in West Bengal will now get a week-long holiday every alternate week, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday.Making another announcement she said that the state government will send small help, including monetary help, to migrant labourers, tourists and patients from Bengal who are stranded in other states because of the lockdown.“The doctors, nurses and other medical staff are not getting any rest. Hence from now on they will work for one week and then a week long leave. This will boost their energy level. The chief secretary has been asked to speak with the state health department and work this out,” said Banerjee, who also holds the portfolio of state health minister.The top brass of the police force have also been asked to see if the duty hours of police personnel could be curtailed by a few hours every day.“We will try to send some money to migrant labourers from Bengal stuck in other states. Some tourists from Bengal and some who had gone for treatment have also been stranded. If we get information, we will try to help them through our local sources. We have also sent help to a team of tourists stranded at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh,” she added.Banerjee had earlier written letters to chief ministers of 18 states requesting them to help migrant labourers from Bengal stranded in those states. In West Bengal more than two lakh labourers from various states have been given shelter in more than 700 camps. The chief minister also said that in some places doctors and nurses are being ostracized for treating Covid-19 patients.“I have got at least eight such cases. At Ranaghat in Nadia locals had protested when a nurse went to meet her family. I have allotted the nurse a rented government flat she can stay there,” Banerjee added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-staff-at-state-run-hospitals-in-bengal-to-work-every-alternate-week-says-mamata/story-5L63XyyqITzYTMgzXTybXN.html
16-04-2020||India||Normal monsoon forecast brings some cheer to India||Monsoon rains are likely to be normal this year at 100% of the long-period average (LPA), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday, bringing some cheer to farmers reeling under the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown that has disrupted agricultural supply chains across India.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season that generally begins in June and starts to retreat by September; the monsoon is key to the prospects of agriculture in the country.For the first time in its monsoon forecast history, IMD on Wednesday also released new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates, factoring in the likely impact of climate change, which has altered the way the south-west monsoon progresses over India.IMD’s new onset dates are based on an analysis of monsoon data from 1961 to 2019, and withdrawal dates are based on data from 1971 to 2019 by scientists in IMD, Pune.The dates show that farmers may have to make some changes in their sowing schedule. The new onset dates are delayed by three to seven days in many parts of central, west and east India while withdrawal is delayed by a week to two weeks from northwest India. But the onset date over Kerala continues to remain June 1 and withdrawal from the south peninsula October 15.Until 2019, the onset and withdrawal dates were determined based on records of 149 meteorological stations between 1901 and 1940. “The data we were using for monsoon onset and withdrawal was very old and based on only a few stations. It’s better to use latest data as much as possible. We don’t know if the changes in monsoon dates are a result of climate change. It is a possibility. It could also be a normal change in monsoon cycle or what we call natural variability. These things will have to be studied further,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.“Clearly taking into account data from the recent period makes more sense. Whether it is human-induced climate change or changes due to natural variability, taking data from so long ago (1901 to 1940) cannot be representative. What IMD has done is logical -- instead of farmers and others complaining about rains not arriving on time. The new data indicates a gap of one week for onset in some places and two weeks for withdrawal at some places, which is quite big,” said Krishna Achuta Rao, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, DelhiIMD said in its briefing on Wednesday that it expects a normal monsoon this year because prevailing neutral El Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions. El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean which is neutral now. El Nino years in India are linked to below normal monsoon rains and higher-than-normal frequency of heat waves. Last monsoon, weak El Nino conditions prevailed, which led to a delayed onset of monsoon rains, according to scientists.IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean; positive IOD conditions are usually associated with normal or above normal monsoon rains.But some global climate models are indicating the possibility of development of weak La Niña conditions over the Pacific Ocean during the second half of the monsoon season. La Niña is characterised by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific, just the opposite of El Nino.“La Nina is good for our monsoon. It is linked to normal or above-average rains in India,” said Rajeevan.South-west monsoon rainfall is crucial to rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds cultivation in the country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy and employs over half of its people. The farm-to-fork supply chain has been disrupted by the Covid-19 outbreak, subsequent lockdown, shortage of labour and transport bottlenecks. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Pune’s Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said global agencies too unanimously indicate normal monsoon rains for June to September, which is good news. “This is largely based on the favourable conditions in the Pacific as there is no coherent sign of an El Niño developing during the early stage of the monsoon.”The rain in the pre-monsoon period has also been above average, which experts say will help improve and retain soil moisture and help with sowing in some parts of the country. From March 1 to April 15, central India received 150% and northwest India 52% excess rain even as east and northeast India are 46% deficient, according to IMD.Ocean temperatures in the equatorial Indian Ocean are forecast to be warmer than normal, which has the potential to reduce monsoon rains but that is often not factored in by monsoon models, Koll said.This monsoon also offers unique conditions for meteorologists to study this link because air pollution levels have dropped dramatically across the country since the lockdown imposed on March 25. The lockdown will continue till May 3. Several studies in the past have linked high air pollution levels in India with weakening of the south-west monsoon. Light-absorbing particles like black carbon (BC) scatter and absorb solar radiation which then affects the clouds. The particles also act as surfaces on which water vapour condenses, thereby impacting rainfall and monsoon wind pattern.“I do not know if the monsoon models are factoring in this new scenario with less pollution. This has not happened before and hence can give us important insights,” added Koll.As per IMD’s new analysis, the monsoon’s onset over Kerala will continue to be on June 1. But monsoon advance dates over Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh are delayed by three to seven days compared to existing dates. Over northwest India, the monsoon will arrive a little earlier, on July 8 instead of July 15.The monsoon will now withdraw from northwest India almost 7-14 days later but there is no change in the final withdrawal date over south India, i.e. October 15.The zone-wise monsoon forecast will be released by IMD in the last week of May or the first week of June, IMD officials said on Wednesday.IMD’s forecasts are prepared using the Statistical Ensemble Forecasting System (SEFS). Since 2012, IMD has also used the dynamical global climate forecasting system (CFS) model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/normal-monsoon-forecast-brings-some-cheer-to-india/story-2bANQ1Vs4uxeIUKe9hwwzK.html
16-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Slow testing pipeline as big a worry as kit delay||India carried out close to 27,000 Covid-19 tests on Wednesday and added 22 new labs in the last two days, ramping up efforts to speed up a process that is crucial to determine the extent of the outbreak but has suffered from long delays due to several bottlenecks. The 26,351 samples processed on Wednesday, according to data released by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), represents a fivefold increase over the roughly 5,000 a day number at the beginning of the month. The total number of labs, including private ones, is now at 258.“We have added more labs, and since sample collection and data entry were identified as bottlenecks, we have strengthened the system of sample collection and added trained human resources to ramp up testing in a big way,” said CK Mishra, secretary, ministry of environment, who co-chairs the PM’s high-level committee on preparedness for medical emergency.Also read: Covid-19 cases breach 12,000-mark in India, death toll at 414Almost as much as kits, capacity and protocols -- which have been areas of debate and concern for India right through the last month when Covid-19 cases began to rise -- speed of testing is a critical area where India may be falling behind, with a large backlog of tests awaiting results at the end of every working day. In Delhi, where 16,605 tests have been carried out, 956 are still pending. India’s testing relies at the moment on the RT-PCR process, which is the most definitive diagnostic test for the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19. This involves swabbing a person for samples, which is then processed at a lab to if it matches the molecular signatures established with the virus.The process is meant to take 7-8 hours. But collecting the sample and collation of results – including accounting for all negative results as well – leads to about 24-36 hours from when a person’s samples are collected to the result reflecting in the official tally. In some cases, as the number of tests grow and testing centres get backed up, it can take up to 2-3 days for a result to get reported in certain states.Also read: Two firms begin production of antibody rapid test kits in IndiaWhen one considers that India’s cases are doubling at a rate of about six days, a lag of this nature leads to valuable time lost. “We will not know the full extent of the spread of Covid-19 unless we become more proactive in testing, instead of being reactive. Unless we test, we won’t know,” said Jacob John, professor emeritus and head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The number of confirmed coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases crossed the 12,000 mark on Wednesday, rising by 851 through the day. Quick testing is key to India’s containment strategy, according to experts, and will eventually determine when and what parts of the country are exempted from a lockdown that has halted economic activity and stranded hundreds of thousands of migrant workers.In South Korea, which has largely been seen as one of few countries to have flattened its infection curve, officials carried out 15,000 tests a day. Germany followed a similar strategy, testing 12,000 people a day.One way to speed up testing is using rapid test kits, which use a person’s blood to look for antibodies that can indicate an infection, are yet to be acquired or developed by Indian companies. Kits ordered from China have missed several deadlines after supplies were withheld due to quality checks, officials said.Two of three Indian manufacturers have begun production of the antibody-based kits after the national regulatory body for pharmaceuticals and medical devices issued manufacturing licenses. These can be deployed for pooling of samples, a batch testing strategy that can be used to do up to three times as many tests with the same number of kits.Meanwhile, in order to speed up the RT-PCR tests, the Union health ministry has designated 14 “mentor institutions” such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGI), Chandigarh, across states to handhold accredited labs in the region in carrying out the RT-PCR test. The 14 are within 12 clusters and the mentor institutions will ensure the identified labs meet NABL’s quality- and infection-control standards, and ensure the machines are run to capacity with two shifts, according to officials. The National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) provides accreditation to laboratories that meet the national accuracy, safety and quality standards.The government is also acquiring RT-PCR machines with larger capacities. “Orders have been placed for 12 RT-PCR systems that can test 1,536 samples in a single run, with the delivery expected in the first week of May. Ten of these machines will go to ICMR labs, one to NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control) and one to AIIMS,” said an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official, asking not to be named.Building on the National Health Mission, of which Mishra was the mission director in his earlier role in the health ministry, the ICMR has approved the use of machines that were used to drug-resistant tuberculosis to be paired with other RT-PCR devices to act as screening test for Covid-19. This pairing will be able to test up to 1,000 reactions per run.The TB test device, Truenat, is a small battery-operated device that can be operated by health workers with basic training even at Primary Health Centres. The other devices that it will be paired include Gene-Xpert, which is widely available across India. “Gene-Xpert platform is already being used across country for sensitive multiple-drug resistant TB tests and gives foolproof results. What really works in its favour is it doesn’t need a sophisticated lab infrastructure or highly trained technicians, and it gives results in 60 minutes. The only shortcoming is it runs two to four tests in one go, depending on the machine, but it can really help reach underserved areas with low access to technology,” said Dr Navin Dang, consultant microbiologist and founder of Dr Dang’s Labs, which was among the first labs to get approved for Covid-19 testing in India.At present, officials say there are adequate number of Covid-19 kits for RT-PCR tests. Most of the labs accredited at present have placed orders varying from several thousands to hundreds of thousands, and deliveries are expected in 5-7 days, according to an ICMR official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slow-testing-pipeline-as-big-a-worry-as-kit-delay/story-l1g970idAiM0SwFk743thM.html
16-04-2020||India||Centre lists curbs to be eased on April 20 amid lockdown 2.0||The Union government on Wednesday conditionally allowed industries in rural areas and economic enclaves to reopen next week, green-lighted work under the federal job guarantee scheme, and permitted daily wagers in some areas to return to work, as it sought to get the country’s economic engine chugging again and lessen the pain of millions affected by the ongoing lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19. The guidelines on the restart of the economy , with a sharp rural focus, was described as a giant first step by some analysts. It comes after an initial three-week nationwide lockdown to flatten the curve of infections that ended Tuesday midnight was extended by 19 days to May 3. To be sure, none of the activities will be restarted in so-called containment zones declared by state and local administrations; district magistrates have been empowered to take decisions that work locally. Also read: Covid-19 cases breach 12,000-mark, death toll at 414No public transport including planes, trains, buses, metro rail and taxis will be available during the second phase of the lockdown, although courier services have now been allowed and will likely feed into air and rail cargo services, which were also operational during the first phase. “Select additional activities” are being allowed to “mitigate hardship to the public,” the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said in its order, caveating that “these additional activities will be operationalised by states/union territories/district administrations based on strict compliance to the existing guidelines on lockdown measures”. The conditional and partial opening-up was welcomed by industry and experts who saw it as striking a fine balance between easing restrictions and ensuring the pandemic doesn’t spread -- especially with local officials being allowed to act quickly and reimpose them if infections flare up or emerge. “An important redeeming feature of the new guidelines operative from April 20 is the opening up of the agricultural and rural sector including MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) activities. MGNREGA works are allowed primarily for irrigation and water conservation works. Farming operations in the fields are allowed fully for farmers and farm workers. This would help save the rabi crop to a significant degree,” DK Srivastava, the chief policy advisor, EY India, said. Also read: Two firms begin production of antibody rapid test kits in IndiaThe home ministry’s order laid down “National Directives for Covid-19 Management” that made masks compulsory in all public and workplaces; said spitting would be punishable with a fine, and banned the sale of liquor, tobacco, and chewing tobacco (gutka). The guidelines also specified social distancing and sanitation rules for workplaces and factories. The guidelines also said e-commerce companies would be allowed to operate, although it wasn’t clear whether this was merely an extension of the current situation -- most already operate, delivering essential goods -- or the delivery of non-essential goods would also be allowed. The stock markets lost all their early gains and closed down (the Sensex by 310 points at 30,379), although experts said this wasn’t because of the guidelines but global factors. Agriculture and rural sectorsActivities including food processing industries, road construction and industrial projects in rural areas will restart from April 20, as will irrigation projects, construction and other industrial projects, MHA said. The federal job guarantee scheme,the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), will restart with a focus on irrigation and water conservation works. Rural Common Service Centres (CSCs), delivering e-governance services to rural India will also be restarted.The guidelines also said that all farming-related activities will remain operational. With the harvest season on , it added that it will be business as usual in terms of procurement and that mandis (farm markets) operated by Agricultural Product Marketing Committees, satellite mandis notified by states, even direct marketing operations by states or industries to buy directly from farmers will all be allowed.“Since majority of farm practices, right from sowing, harvesting, grading, loading, cleaning, packaging etc. are done manually, an acute shortage of labourers is posing a challenge for harvesting,” said Shivendra Bajaj of the Alliance for Agri Innovation. Businesses dealing in agricultural equipment and their repair, and the manufacturing, distribution and sale of fertilizers, seeds and pesticides will go on, the guidelines said. The fisheries and dairy sector will remain operational and the government has allowed sale and marketing of tea, coffee, rubber and cashew nuts -- but with a maximum of 50% workers deployed in these plantations. Industrial activityThe MHA order allows the restart of certain manufacturing activities from Monday in areas that are not hot spots or containment zones , and in special economic zones (SEZs) and industrial townships. It also allowed export- oriented units (EoUs) to operate. The order permitted manufacturing of essential goods such as medical equipment and pharmaceutical products, but also said food processing units could operate in rural areas. It allowed the manufacture of IT hardware, packaging material, the mining of coal and other minerals, and oil exploration and refining. However, it wanted employers to arrange transport of employees to the workplace and also suggested that they make “arrangements for stay of workers within their premises as far as possible”. The order allows construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings, and all kinds of industrial projects in rural areas and industrial estates. Besides, construction of renewable energy projects and in-situ construction within the municipal limits is also allowed provided workers are available on site and no workers are required to be brought in from outside, it added. Niranjan Hiranandani, national president of the National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco) and also of the industry body Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) , said the order permitted a “staggered reopening” of stalled construction works from April 20 with certain conditions. “The real estate industry acknowledges the positive impact this will have in handling the migrant crisis and avoid any strain further to the Covid-19 human-economic crisis,” added the Mumbai-based developer.“With this order, the economic drivers of the country will start moving again, even as we extend the lockdown. Considering the estimated loss of Rs 26,000 crore per day to the Indian economy as a result of the lockdown, this relaxation is a constructive step,” he added.Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) president Sangita Reddy welcomed the government’s calibrated restart of the economy, but also stressed the need for a relief and stimulus package for industry. “It is now crucial to announce a relief and economic stimulus package, which protects wages, employment, and business.” Industry bodies have asked for a financial package of Rs 14 lakh crore to Rs 16 lakh crore to revive the economy, HT reported on Wednesday.Rumki Majumdar, an economist at Deloitte India said, “Allowing certain economic activities, especially in areas that are not hotspots and have low probability of turning into one, will likely help the vulnerable section of the population in sustaining their livelihood.”“However, several hot spots are also manufacturing hubs (such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi, among others), which makes it difficult to resume factory activities quickly,” Majumdar said.Urban servicesThe exhaustive guidelines for services catering to urban India offer no room for recreational activities but focus on ensuring functioning supply chains for essentials.People can use their private vehicles for emergency situations or procuring essential goods, MHA said; in some parts of the country, the use of private vehicles for this was restricted by local administrations. To be sure, they will have to practice social distancing with only two people being allowed in cars. The home ministry said all kirana shops, even roadside carts that deal with “food and groceries, hygiene items, fruits and vegetables, poultry, meat and fish and animal feed” will operate.The guideline said, “all facilities in the supply chain of essential goods, whether involved in manufacturing, wholesale or retail of such goods through local stores, large brick and mortar stores or e-commerce companies should be allowed to operate, ensuring strict social distancing without any restriction on their timing of opening and closure.”E-commerce companies welcomed the move. “The resumption of economic activity from April 20 is a welcome step that will depend on unhindered availability of labour that is critical to deliver essential products to people across the country and ensure they can stay home safely,” a spokesperson for Amazon India said. In addition, the MHA order also allowed courier companies to function.Tighter rulesEven as restrictions are eased in some parts of the country, Covid-9 hotspots will see stricter perimeter control to ensure no unchecked inward or outward movement except for medical emergencies and maintaining law and order.The government also invoked the Disaster Management Act, 2005 to lay down penal provisions for violations of lockdown measures. For obstructing any officials, misappropriating money or materials and for making false claims, people may face up to two years of imprisonment and fines.If someone is caught giving a false warning of any disaster, he or she may face a prison term of up to one year. Officials, too will face charges if they fail to perform their duties. The guideline also invoked section 188 of the Indian Penal Code to say that any disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant can lead to fines and one month’s jail term.A government statement said the objective of the fresh guidelines is “to consolidate the gains achieved during the 1st phase of lockdown and further slow down the spread of Covid-19 and at the same time provide relief to farmers and labour and daily wage earners.”It added that the government aims to ensure that “agricultural and related activities remain fully functional, the rural economy functions with maximum efficiency, employment opportunities are created for daily wage earners and other members of the labour force and select industrial activities are allowed to resume their operations with adequate safeguards and mandatory standard operating protocols (SOPs).”“ At the same time, keeping the imperative of containing the spread of Covid-19 in the country, National Directives for Covid-19 management have been laid down, which shall be enforced by the District Magistrates through fines and penal action as prescribed in the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-lists-curbs-to-be-eased-on-apr-20/story-sSirWzham465ZroKskkuzH.html
16-04-2020||India||With lockdown extended, anxiety grips stranded migrant workers||With the nationwide lockdown extended till May 3, distress among migrant workers continued to grow, a non-government organisation report on Wednesday said, even as the Centre said the revised guidelines were aimed at reviving the rural economy and thus providing relief to the migrant workers. On Tuesday, close to 1,100 workers came out on the roads in Mumbai and Odisha wanting to return home. Similar protests on Wednesday were reported from Surat in Gujarat, Ludhiana in Punjab and Murshidabad in West Bengal, where workers sought permission to return to their villages.Workers in several states, such as Punjab, Telangana, Haryana and Odisha, said they would start walking back home shortly as the ration they have received is about to be exhausted and they do not have any money left. Some states, such as Odisha, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, on Wednesday announced fresh allocations of ration for the migrant workers and reviewed supplies of essential goods in labour camps even as the migrant workers seethed over the extension of the lockdown. Most state governments assured work for them after April 20, when industrial and construction activity will be allowed.Additional Secretary in the Home Ministry, Govind Mohan, said that no movement of migrant labourers is possible till May 3 as no public transport is permitted to operate during the lockdown period. The home ministry has provided funds under state disaster relief provisions to extend facilities at relief and shelter camps for labourers and will continue to extend support, Mohan said, adding that activities allowed by the revised guidelines are focused at helping the rural economy.According to a report released by the Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN), a group of volunteers monitoring migrant workers stranded across states, most of the distress calls received by the group were from Maharashtra, followed by Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. “About 28% of those who have reached out to us are originally from Jharkhand, about a quarter are from Bihar and about 13 % are from Uttar Pradesh,” the report, prepared on the basis of conversations with 11,159 workers till April 13, said.The report said that since the lockdown was enforced from March 24, over 350 government orders have been issued by the Centre and the state governments detailing relief measures, including providing shelter and cooked meals.“Despite some meaningful state orders, the workers’ testimonies present a sombre picture,” the report said. It added that among the states from where stranded labourers have requested help, Karnataka has been most prompt and Maharashtra, most patchy.Maharashtra chief minister Uddav Thackeray said that the government has provided the best possible facilities to migrant workers considering that Mumbai is a hot spot of Covid-19. Health officials from Karnataka did not respond to queries.The report also said that around 50% of those who called the network of volunteers reported that there was food left only for a day and more than two-thirds said they have not received any ration from the government. About 78% of the stranded workers said they were running out of money and have not received salaries, the report said.The report quoted migrant workers from different parts of the country saying that the situation was turning dire for them and they plan to go back to their homes and asked the state governments to pay emergency relief of Rs 7,000 to each stranded migrant worker, double PDS ration for three months and pay wages to all enrolled MGNREGA workers.Three separate incidents of migrant workers trying to walk back to their homes in other states were reported from Hyderabad. All of them were sent back. “Due to various misgivings about the lockdown, the people are deciding to take up this Herculean task of returning to their far away native places by foot,” said Cyberabad police commissioner, VC Sajjannar.In Machhiwara town, near Punjab’s Ludhiana, about 150 migrants are stuck with no wages and no means of getting back to their homes. They live in dingy one room quarters away from their families. Infuriated over not getting paid, some of them called the police yesterday. “The factory owner has to pay Rs 25,000 to me and that is lot of money for me,” said Ravinder Yadav, a worker, claiming others were also waiting to get wages. Similarly, in Sherpur Kalan, an industrial area in Ludhiana, hundreds of migrants came on the roads on Wednesday and alleged they were not being provided ration by the administration. “We are living in hell. Struggling to get food and now the landlord has asked us to vacate,” said Jaikant Kumar, 26, another worker, who belongs to Sitamarhi in Bihar.Stranded in Gurugram, workers from Bihar have sought the help from the Bihar government to ensure their return home. “We are in trouble here and want to return to our village but we can’t find any means,” said Pankaj Rishi, a construction worker . According to Bihar government estimates, around 50,000 workers from Bihar are stranded in different states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.Nishant Kumar Pandey, 30, resident of Pandey Tola in Muzaffarpur district, working in a cloth manufacturing unit at Ahmedabad, said he wants to return as the factory has been closed indefinitely and the landlord has asked him to vacate the house. “My wife is pregnant and she was refused medical assistance in hospital emergency barely a week ago. I don’t have much money left and want to return home as there are no avenues of earning here,” he said.In Haryana, state government officials said that the migrant workers housed in various camps have shown no interest in the state’s offer to work as farm labourers as they want to go back to their homes. “We allowed them to work if they want but they did not show any interest and said that they want to go back to their homes,” said Panipat deputy commissioner Hema Sharma. The district officials said that the labourers have been advised to remain in the camp and not to leave the camp without permission. “Without trains or buses, they cannot go to their home state. It is better for them to stay here and earn their money,” said Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav.Reports of workers’ distress also came from Odisha. In Odisha, Anil Rana, a migrant worker from Jharkhand, said that his family does not have money to buy even ration and that supplies provided by Odisha government would get over in a few days. “That [ration we got] is about to get exhausted in 2-3 days. After that, what will we do?” Rana asked. In the steel city of Rourkela, Shaym Mahato and 20 other workers from Chakradharpur area of Jharkhand, are desperate to go back home as they don’t have any work. “Once the ration gets over, we will all walk back to Chakradharpur,” he said. In Uttar Pradesh, there are still about 1.25 lakh workers in 5,200 shelter homes across the state, a fortnight after the state arranged buses to take many workers from Delhi border to their villages. UP chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, announced that the migrants in shelter homes who have completed the stipulated quarantine period would go through health screening once again and then will be sent home with an advisory for another 14-day quarantine at their homes. Kerala has no reported unrest among migrant workers after the second phase of lockdown was announced on Tuesday.(With input from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-lockdown-extended-anxiety-grips-stranded-migrant-workers/story-9H9uVSLLp3gDFFSAq0N1LJ.html
16-04-2020||India||BIS specifications for PPE kits call for virus-resistant material||The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has released the national specifications for coveralls or bodysuits that healthcare workers need to wear while tending to patients with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Material used for the suits must be not only fluid-resistant but virus-resistant, said a BIS document.So far, the manufacturers have been making coveralls that are only fluid-resistant , following the guidelines laid down by the Union health ministry in an 11-page document on March 24.“The personal protective equipment kits were mostly imported before the Covid-19 crisis. When there was a global shortage of the protective gear, the health ministry, along with the textile ministry, looked at various material that can be used to make the PPE kits with respect to the disease we are dealing with. Once, the material was in place, manufacturers were identified,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said at a media briefing.With the new specifications in place, manufacturers have begun a search again for materials that can be both fluid- and virus-resistant and yet are “breathable” to ensure that doctors workings during the summer months without air conditioning are comfortable.“Initially, there was no clarity on what was needed, this is a very new disease and everybody is learning as they go {along}. However, after the health ministry guidelines came out, most manufacturers started using non-woven material and laminated it to make it fluid-resistant. But this lamination means that the material is not breathable,” said Rajiv Nath, founder and forum coordinator of the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD).“... a lot of fast-paced research is happening and a few companies have found some breathable fabrics that just need to be certified.” said Rajiv Nath, founder and forum coordinator of Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD).Nath added: “Now, to make the coveralls viral -resistant, the seams would have to be taped, or glued, or sealed with heat; however the technology to do so is not available in India. But the machine used for sealing leather with heat or a glue developed by the Defence Research Development Organisations is being tested.”The new specifications will also help in standardising quality.“So far, all the different state governments or institutes like AIIMS {All India Institute of Medical Sciences} had different specifications for purchasing the PPE kits as there were no details mentioned in the health ministry guidelines. Now, with these specifications the manufacturers can work towards achieving a fixed standard,” said Nath.To ensure that the PPE kits are of good quality, the government has now designated at least seven laboratories that can evaluate the kits. These labs check gloves for any leakages and tensile strength. The protective clothing is checked for the seam strength, resistance to fluids, resistance to punctures and tear and resistance to microbes. The masks and head-cover respirators are checked for functioning of inhalation and exhalation valves and field of vision, among other things.Trustin Analytical Solutions in Chennai has been approved for testing gloves, and SGS India Private Limited, another company based in the same city, has been approved for testing gloves, plastic-based products, protective clothing and respirators. The Rubber Research Institute of India has also been approved for testing rubber-based materials. This is apart from the four laboratories – the South India Textile Research Association, the Defence Research and Development Establishment, Heavy Vehicles Factory, and the Small Arms factory – that had already been designated by the ministry of textiles to perform such quality checks.“Our laboratory is NABL accredited and also recognised by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation as a centre for testing medical devices. For the current need in PPE, we have been asked to test medical gloves,” said Mahendran M, owner of Trustin Analytical Solutions. NABL is short National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.A certification from these bodies ensures that the PPE kits are safe to use.“However, the implementation is patchy. The manufacturers are required to get certified from these agencies to sell their product to HLL {Lifecare Ltd}, which is the agency procuring for the central government. However, different state government follow different specifications and they do not necessarily ask for the certification,” said Malini Aisola, co-convenor of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN).This is the case in Delhi, which had floated a tender for 120,000 PPE kits through the Central Procurement Agency in March.“This tender is being given to us as a piecemeal of about 3,000-4,000 kits a day. When we had floated the tender there were very few manufacturers who had come forward, and many did not necessarily have the certification. Even the ones with good products were not able to reach the only certification agency then – SITRA – in Tamil Nadu because of the lockdown. So, we started procuring the products after checking them for fluid-resistance ourselves,” said a senior Delhi government official.To test, water was poured into the body-suit to check for leaks. For the next batch of procurement, the government will purchase kits from manufacturers that are certified, in case there are enough such manufacturers, according to the official, who requested anonymity. “It is good that there is a national standard now, we have been procuring the PPE kits locally and there are several that do not match the health ministry standards. If all the kits already come certified from the government then we will not have to worry about the quality,” said a doctor from Lok Nayak Hospital on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bis-specifications-for-ppe-kits-call-for-virus-resistant-material/story-jESWvRdeuLsuksAeMVVqSI.html
16-04-2020||India||Bengal guv seeks Central forces to ensure lockdown; sparks row||West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar again got into a war of words on Wednesday after the latter suggested chief minister Mamata Banerjee to consider requisitioning central paramilitary forces to ensure strict implementation of the Covid-19 lockdown in the state.“Lockdown protocol has to be thoroughly implemented to ward off #coronavirus. Police and administration @MamataOfficial failing to effect 100% #SocialDistancing or curbing religious congregations be shown door. Lockdown must succeed-examine central para forces requisitioning!” Dhankhar tweeted.TMC spokesman Snehasish Chakraborty said Dhankhar, who has been at loggerheads with the state government, has no work other than trying and disturbing the state government. “The Mamata Banerjee administration is completely preoccupied with responding to the unprecedented situation... and has no time to respond to someone behaving like a Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] worker,” said Chakraborty.There have been reports of several gatherings, especially around markets, from places like Asansol, Murshidabad, Birbhum and Kolkata. In Murshidabad, hundreds gathered on Wednesday and blocked a road demanding relief material. In North Dinajpur district, dozens took to the streets to protest against the poor quality of food grains given as relief.The West Bengal police said they were taking additional measures to avoid large gatherings of people moving out of their homes to buy essentials. Drones were being used across the state to identify crowded places and lockdown violators. The police were also using microphones to urge people to stay indoors.A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 1,174 markets have been relocated to spacious areas so that social distancing could be maintained. “Areas of 963 markets have been expanded. There still are 256 markets that remain crowded. The administration is looking for suitable alternative places.”Mamata Banerjee has repeatedly said that she wants “a strict lockdown with a humane face”.Separately, BJP lawmaker John Barla has written to Union home minister Amit Shah alleging he has been placed under house arrest. “I was out to supervise relief work and supply of essentials to the needy but the police seized all items and told me I was supposed to stay home because the lockdown also applied to me,” Barla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-guv-seeks-central-forces-to-ensure-lockdown-sparks-row/story-vU7qUFy87e3X0EvEIT3zrO.html
16-04-2020||India||Could virus have silently infected far more than reported, asks study||Scientists are increasingly turning to daily death data to estimate the size of the Covid-19 outbreak around the world, with one such model showing India possibly saddled with a far higher number of infections than reported.The projection, by researchers from the Imperial College London, underscores how the disease multiplies silently among populations, complicating efforts to cut off its spread especially at a time when authorities need a clear picture to be able to relax lockdowns.In the seven days starting March 22, the country is estimated to have had 16,800-23,600 true infections as opposed to the 2,395 that were reported, according to the short-term forecast. According to the researchers, the projections were based on the number of deaths and predicted that fatalities in the week ending on April 11 would likely be somewhere between 119 and 567. By last Saturday, the actual number of deaths reported was 288. As of Wednesday, India’s death toll stood at 423 and the total number of cases at 12,330.“We use the reported number of deaths due to Covid-19 to make these short-term forecasts as these are likely more reliable and stable over time than reported cases,” said the authors, including the team that came up with a crucial report on March 16 estimating the trajectory of the pandemic in a now-famous effort that is seen to have compelled the United Kingdom government to take strict measures.The need to use the fatalities parameter and work backwards is based on the assumption that Covid-19 deaths are more likely to be reported than cases, which may be missed for several reasons. “One of the issues is that cases with Covid-19 can present with a range of symptoms -- some of them for example are too mild to be reported, and hence cannot be tested,” said Sangeeta Bhatia, the lead researcher on the project, in an email interview to HT. “Another factor that contributes to the variability in reporting is the limited testing capacity in each country. Related to this limitation is the decision about whom to test. In the early stages of the outbreak, India, like many other countries, was testing only travellers from affected regions or contacts of travellers,” she added. This is particular worrying for India, where the strategy to contain cases hinges on putting in force a hard lockdown in hot spot areas, and opening some of the others up to stave off further economic devastation. On March 25, India was put under the world’s biggest lockdown that will now last till at least May 3, with some relaxations planned after April 20 in areas deemed relatively safe.The premise for the projections rests on ascertaining the true number of cases first by looking at the number of deaths in the previous two weeks and the number of reported cases in the 10 days prior to that period. “If we assume that all deaths due to Covid-19 are reported, then very roughly we can look at the expected number of fatalities based on the case fatality ratio, to estimate the number of underlying cases that would result in the observed number of deaths,” Bhatia said. The ratio between reported and underlying cases can then be used to predict the number of deaths in the following week. Using these trends, the report pegged India’s disease transmission rate – the average number of people infected further by one patient – at 3.11. This means that a Covid-19 patient on average was infecting three more people before the country was put under a nationwide lockdown. The number is closer to the worst-case scenario transmission rate of 4 identified by the Indian Council of Medical Research in modelling done in February. The best-case scenario, ICMR scientists told HT last week, was 1.5.For a disease to stop spreading, the transmission rate needs to reduce to less than 1.Fatality data has been similarly used by public health experts in the United States to estimate the trajectory of the Covid-19 epidemic and predict demand for hospital resources. A model by University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation uses daily death data to calculate hospitalisation-to-death ratios, “which then inform the model parameters used for predicting hospital bed need”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-virus-have-silently-infected-far-more-than-reported-asks-study/story-APp7KcesUk5gWXVsvkZ6KN.html
16-04-2020||India||With 41 new positive cases, Rajasthan Covid count 1,046||The number of Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan went up to 1,046 on Wednesday as 41 people tested positive for the disease on the day when the state government announced that offices, industrial activities will resume fully in rural and partially in urban areas from April 20.A statement from chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s office said the resumption of the industrial activity will help migrant workers get work. It added industries with residential facilities for workers will be allowed to function in urban areas. The statement said orders have been issued to resume work in government offices partially in urban areas. In rural areas, government offices will open fully to facilitate agriculture works and procurement of farm produce. The Centre on Wednesday announced industries located in the countryside will reopen from April 20 while farm activities will also resume a day after the 21-lockdown imposed to check the pandemic was extended till May 3.Rohit Singh, additional chief secretary (health), said 28 new Covid-19 cases were reported from Jaipur on Wednesday, seven each from Jodhpur and Kota and one case each from Dausa, Nagaur, Tonk, and Jhunjhunu.Singh said 147 people have so far recovered and 74 have been discharged. He added of the total 37,860 samples taken for testing in Rajasthan, 31,902 have tested negative and 4,912 were being tested.Singh said the recovery rate in the state is between 14 and 15%. It was a bit higher earlier, touching 17% on April 1. But since then, there has been a sharp rise in the number of positive cases against those who have recovered and the rate has fallen. As of April 15, it stood at 14%.Rajasthan has the fourth-highest Covid-19 cases in the country after Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Till April 9, Rajasthan had 500 cases. In four days, the figure has almost doubled.In Ramganj, one of the Covid-19 hotspots in the state, 82.5% of the samples taken have tested positive. Singh said that during random sampling, 345 of 418 samples have tested positive in Ramganj. He added a large number of cases have been reported because of aggressive testing.The health department is carrying out random sampling in Ramganj, which has been divided into 30 clusters. Authorities have sealed Ramganj and barred entry and exit of people from there as the government is trying to prevent community spread of the disease. Across the state, 430 doctors and nursing staff are in quarantine or home isolation..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-41-new-positive-cases-rajasthan-covid-count-1-046/story-ZVxsJVZm1MRJd3h0GBiW5I.html
16-04-2020||India||I&B secretary writes to ministries over payment of dues to media houses||Union information & broadcasting (I&B) ministry secretary Ravi Mittal has written to his counterparts in other ministries and requested them to pay up the amount owed to media houses (for ads), citing the financial pressure they are in on account of the ongoing lockdown. Various Union government ministries owe at least Rs 400 crore to media companies. Mittal’s intervention came on April 11, days before the 21-day lockdown imposed late last month was on Tuesday extended till May 3 to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of the total amount, 12 ministries owe around Rs 224 crore. According to information available with HT, the letters were sent to the ministries of telecommunications, sports, youth affairs, the departments of posts, electronics and IT, and the NITI Aayog, among others.In his letters to the secretaries -- HT has seen some of the letters -- Mittal cited the media’s role in supporting the government’s efforts in dealing with the pandemic while highlighting that their “financial health” was turning from bad to worse. “Newspapers have cut down their pages to unprecedented levels with many merging weekend supplements into the main edition[s]. Despite these measures, newspapers are losing money. Similarly, the FM Radio sector is also under stress due to low advertisement and stoppage of transport,” Mittal said in his letters. Mittal underlined that it is of vital importance that all payments due to the private media sector are made to enable them to pay their employees, keep their businesses afloat and prevent layoffs. “As you would appreciate, these media houses are also supporting the government’s efforts to communicate with its citizens during the current crisis arising due to COVID-19,” he wrote.Most ministries issue advertisements through the I&B ministry’s Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC) ,which was formerly known as the Department of Audio Visual Publicity. After the publication of advertisements, the BOC receives payments from the concerned ministries for disbursal.The Union health and finance ministries have pending bills worth over Rs 81 crore. Other ministries that also owe substantial money to media houses include rural development, labour, human resource development, agriculture, tourism, and road transport and highways.Mittal wrote his letter days after the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) communicated to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 24 that while newspapers were going beyond the call of duty to spread awareness in the face of the global pandemic, they were in grave danger of turning sick. “You can imagine the devastating impact of these closures on the hundreds of employees and their families as well on the larger ecosystem including suppliers, printing presses, distribution mechanisms including newspaper vendors and delivery boys, etc,” lNS said in a letter, a copy of which HT has seen.The letter cited the “triple whammy” of the coronavirus, collapsing advertising and the customs duty on newsprint and said this has led to a situation where the newspaper industry was on the brink of collapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-b-secy-writes-to-ministries-over-payment-of-dues-to-media-houses/story-B7kpJXaOkiwrcDnhlZtQKI.html
16-04-2020||India||170 districts in ‘red zone’, govt also lists 207 areas with Covid-19 clusters||Containment zones across between a fourth and half of India’s districts will not see any easing of lockdown restrictions after April 20. A letter from India’s health secretary Preeti Sudan to the chief secretaries of states lists 170 districts classified as hot spots, or in the “red zone” . It adds that 123 of these districts have seen large outbreaks of Covid-19 infections and 47, clusters . The letter, a copy of which has been seen by HT, also lists 207 more districts where there are “clusters” of infections. All other districts are in the “green zone” . The letter, sent on Wednesday, is significant because it comes after the home ministry issued an order explaining guidelines for easing lockdown restrictions after April 20, with the explicit rider that this would not apply in containment zones. Home secretary Ajay Bhalla subsequently wrote to the chief secretaries emphasising that permitted activities would not be allowed in “containment zones within hot spots, demarcated by the states/union territories/district administrations as per guidelines of the ministry of health”. He also made it clear that the states and UTs “cannot dilute restrictions imposed” through the guidelines but “can impose stricter restrictions” depending on the local requirement of the areas. HT has reviewed a copy of the letter.States have defined containment zones within districts, ranging in size from a single building to an entire city or the district itself. While many of the containment zones are likely to be in red zones, some are also in the districts with “clusters”. That’s because most states do not have a protocol for declaring containment zones. The health ministry letter defines hot spot districts as “high caseload districts” where the number of cases double in four days or less. It asks states to review the list every Monday on the basis of the preceding week’s data. It recommends “strict containment measures” in the hot spot districts and “containment measures” in other districts reporting clusters of infections. When there are no new cases of Covid-19 in such hot spot districts for 14 days, they transition to the “orange zone” according to the letter. And if there are no cases for 14 more days, the districts in the orange zone transition to the “green zone”, it added. “In the high-risk districts, the states have been directed to strictly implement measures meant to contain large outbreaks and cluster containment. For those districts in the green zone, our effort will be directed at ensuring that the disease doesn’t spread there, for which states have been asked to go for extensive community engagement, and strict monitoring of influenza like illness and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) ,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry.Defining for the first time what a cluster and outbreak scenario mean, the health ministry said that fewer than 15 cases make for a cluster and more than 15 cases mean it is a local outbreak.“We have also told states that besides the hot spots identified by the Centre, states which are fighting the battle at field level may declare additional districts as hot spot districts and take required action accordingly. The ministry has come out with a detailed action plan for containment measures, and states have also been asked to create a district-specific crisis management plan to actively search for cases that should include door-to-door screening and testing of symptomatic ILI (influenza-like illnesses) and SARI cases,” he added.In his letter, Sudan requested the chief secretaries to use the extended lockdown to convert the hots pots (red) to “orange, and in turn, green zones”. The letter also directed the chief secretaries to the health ministry’s containment plan, detailed on April 2.  According to the plan, a hot spot will be split into zones: a quarantine or containment zone and a buffer zone around it. For both zones, access– particularly outbound travel – will be cut off and all movement of vehicles and public transport will be halted. People will be encouraged to stay indoors for the first 28 days in both zones, the document states, adding: “based on the risk assessment and indication of successful containment operations, an approach of staggered work and market hours may be put into practice.”These measures will be paired with increased disease surveillance: more random tests on hospitalised cases, testing of all suspected cases, isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts. The ministry also said that India was doing far better than other countries in terms of checking the spread of disease. “Our recovery rate is also improving; based on data as on date, 11.41% have recovered, and this figure is increasing,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/170-districts-in-red-zone-govt-also-lists-207-areas-with-covid-19-clusters/story-lXj4g8PWb14El6yx4ktdDI.html
16-04-2020||India||Two firms begin production of antibody rapid test kits in India||New Delhi Two of the three Indian manufacturers of antibody-based Rapid Test Kits (RTKs) for Covid-19 have begun production after the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the national regulatory body for pharmaceuticals and medical devices, issued manufacturing licenses.The move comes at a time when the RTKs that the Indian government ordered from China and which were supposed to arrive first by April 5, then April 9 and finally by Wednesday, have still not reached.Earlier this month, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) validated samples of RTKs manufactured by three companies, Vanguard Diagnostics in New Delhi, the state-owned HLL Lifecare Limited in Kerala and Voxtur Bio Limited in Gujarat, following which they applied for, and received, their manufacturing licenses. While HLL and Voxtur have begun production — the former expects to deliver its first batch of 100,000 RTKs by April 20 — Vanguard aims to start production within three weeks.These kits are in great demand because unlike the RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) tests currently in use, which take up to five hours to throw up a result, RTKs provide results in 30 minutes. However, ICMR’s protocol requires a confirmatory RT-PCR test to back up a negative RTK result. Public sector company HLL Lifecare Limited, known for its production of popular condom brand Nirodh, began producing RTKs in its Manesar, Haryana plant on April 14. It aims to ready its first batch of 100,000 kits by April 20.“We have just started [manufacturing the kits] after receiving the approval from CDSCO on Monday [April 13]. We have the capacity to produce 100,000 testing kits in a week. We will be supplying directly to the ICMR,” a senior executive at the company said on condition of anonymity. .The executive added that some of the material needed to manufacture the RTKs is imported from the US. “As of now we are comfortably placed in terms of stock… We are trying to scale up but there are several logistical issues. We import our raw material, but not from China. We import raw material from a US company.” “We have started production. We are planning to make 25,000 kits a day,” E A Subramanian, director of technical operations of the HLL Lifecare added.Surat-based Voxtur Bio Ltd is using indigenously manufactured raw material to develop the kits. “We have got nothing to do with China or any other country; we are manufacturing the kits and the raw material required to develop the kits indigenously. We have the capacity to produce 10 million kits a month, and we can double it if required. But we have to look for vendors, distributors and manage other logistics, so it takes about 10-12 days to start the production from the day you get the licence,” said Khushroo Pastakia, CEO and managing director, Voxtur.He did not specify the quantities of kits currently under production.Vanguard is putting processes in place to produce RTKs in large numbers. “We haven’t started manufacturing yet as we are internally getting ready for production. If all goes well then we should be able to start production in the next two to three weeks. There’s a lot of demand for rapid test kits, and everyone is working hard to ensure that the kits are produced in India. In my opinion, during the next few weeks many other manufacturers will also be ready,” said Veena Kohli, CEO of Vanguard Diagnostics Limited said.The list of manufacturers is a dynamic one: the CDSCO provides licenses as and when the ICMR validates sample kits. In all, ICMR has validated 13 RTKs, of which four are made by Indian manufacturers. This includes antibody test kits of Indian vendors with Chinese suppliers. Chennai-based CPC Diagnostics received the go ahead from both ICMR and CDSCO to import Chemi Luminescence Immuno Assay or CLIA-based antibody detection kits, which are not the same as RTKs, but close — the CLIA kit also requires a specific instrument to conduct the antibody test. These kits, which CPC has been sourcing from YHLO, a Shenzen, China based company, are also used to perform other kinds of tests, including fertility and thyroid tests , and thus several accredited labs in the country already possess them, a company spokesperson said. “By using this system a laboratory can test 100 samples per hour,” he added. The company expects to receive the supply of the CLIA-based antibody test kits this week. The order was placed at least two weeks ago, and the delay is due to a number of factors the spokesperson said. “The government of India has been following due process in validating and approving kits. This process takes time. The restriction on air traffic has been a major reason for delay of receiving test kits and sending them for approval. This factor will continue to delay supplies. Currently the world demand being large it will be difficult for us to obtain the entire quantity of kits we require in a short period.” China recently restricted export of its supplies of antibody test kits to a few companies following quality control concerns raised by different European countries.Mumbai-based Lab Care, which has a manufacturing facility in Gujarat also received ICMR approval for its RTK, but it is yet to receive its manufacturing license. “We have applied for a manufacturing license, and expect to receive it within 10 days,” said Ravi Chadha, director, Lab Care. Chadha said the company can make between 125,000 to 150,000 kits every day. Lab Care imports its raw material from China, and finding new suppliers would involve new ICMR approvals. What’s more, it cannot stock raw material till it receives its manufacturing license. “For the Chinese to dispatch raw material is a task given the current situation. And even once the raw material is sent from China to Delhi , transporting that to the manufacturing unit will be a challenge,” he said.With inputs from Snehal Vivienne Fernandes and Dhamini Ratnam||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-firms-begin-production-of-antibody-rapid-test-kits-in-india/story-zSj1RKKKFKwKAKTl7VlifJ.html
16-04-2020||India||Only 2 people allowed in private cars on essential run||Private vehicles will be allowed on the roads in emergency situations provided they aren’t carrying more than one passenger, who will be seated in the back. Two-wheelers will be allowed to ply, but without anyone riding pillion, the home ministry said in guidelines released on Wednesday for the extended Covid-19 lockdown. “These specific norms will come into effect from April 20. In some parts of Delhi/NCR these rules were being implemented. There will be strict checking on the number of passengers in a car. As the guidelines clearly state, only one more person will be allowed. It will be enforced across all states,” a senior government official said. Before Wednesday’s notification, there had been no guidelines for private vehicles plying during medical emergencies; they have been allowed on the road in exigencies and for picking up essential supplies.The guidelines will not be applicable to areas within a Covid-19 containment zone, where all traffic will be prohibited, the official said on condition of anonymity.Special flights ferrying medical and veterinary personnel, scientists, nurses, paramedical staff, lab technicians, midwives and catering to hospital support services will also be allowed during the lockdown lasting until May 3. “So far, we are only operating cargo flights; the ministry will be working with the home ministry to cater for any special flights for medical personnel,” a civil aviation ministry official said.Movement of all trucks and other cargo vehicles, with two drivers and one helper, subject to the drivers carrying valid driving licenses; will be allowed. Empty trucks and other goods vehicle will be allowed to ply after the delivery of goods, or for pick-up of goods.Vehicles used by e-commerce companies and courier services will be allowed to ply with necessary permissions if they are used in the transport of essential goods.All passenger flights, trains and metro rail services have been suspended by the Centre until May 3. Only cargo operations by land, sea and air have been allowed since the announcement of the lockdown on March 24 which took effect the following day. “Movement of staff and contractual labour for operations of railways, airports/ air carriers, seaports/ ships/ vessels, landports and ICDs is allowed on passes being issued by the local authority on the basis of authorizations issued by the respective designated authority of the railways, airports, seaports, landports and ICDs,” the guidelines state.The ministry of civil aviation has launched a service called “Lifeline Udan” for transport of medical cargo across the country. So far, 277 flight have been operated. To step up cargo operations, Indian Railways, in addition to running freight trains for supplies of essential commodities, has also begun parcel trains to increase supply of essential items like medical supplies, medical equipment and groceries in small parcel sizes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-2-people-allowed-in-private-cars-on-essential-run/story-3sBm1uQH7FhUlSh1exzK6N.html
16-04-2020||India||Amendment to Factories Act to extend work hours unlikely: Officials||A recommendation by senior civil servants to extend the work hours of employees at companies selling essential foods and groceries to reduce their staff requirement is unlikely to be implemented immediately, officials aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.Government top brass, while accepting most of the suggestions by the empowered group of secretaries, is unlikely to consider amendments proposed to the Factories Act at this juncture because of multiple reasons.The note of the secretaries, recommending 12-hour shifts in factories, said: “The additional 4 hours a day will be paid as overtime subject to an overtime limit of 24 hours per week...This would allow {factories} to run the majority of operations for 6 days with a reduction of close to 33% of people passing through the facility on a daily basis.”Officials said the proposal hasn’t moved forward because the government wants to focus primarily on the rejuvenation of the agri and rural sector. A senior official also added that the proposal is not under consideration as any move to amend the Factories Act when thousands of workers are stuck in heir homes because of the lockdown for the coronavirus disease and living through uncertain times will send a wrong political signal.“The focus should be to give opportunities to as many workers as possible,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amendment-to-factories-act-to-extend-work-hrs-unlikely-officials/story-CSuGFA7IajUKudzVAYmNWJ.html
16-04-2020||India||In relief to truckers, govt opens highway repair shops, dhabas||Truck repair shops and eateries located alongside highways will be allowed to reopen to serve truck drivers stuck across state border since the lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) went underway on March 25, providing a degree of relief to transporters, who on Wednesday sought an economic relief package.The ministry of home affairs on Wednesday issued guidelines to the effect, coming to the rescue of truckers stranded en route because of strict enforcement of the lockdown although cargo vehicles carrying essential supplies have been exempted from the restrictions. The closure of truck repairers and eateries has proved to be an additional inconvenience.Movement of all trucks and other goods carriers, with two drivers and one helper, subject to the drivers carrying a valid driving license, will be allowed, the guidelines said, a day after the lockdown was extended until May 3. Empty trucks will be allowed to ply after delivery of goods or for picking up goods.Following the release of the home ministry guidelines, transporters reached out to the government, seeking an economic relief package to bring back workers and resolve supply chain hurdles.They also sought clarity on the opening of booking offices and warehouses for loading and unloading goods.“We welcome the fresh guidelines as allowing the movement of all goods carriers will ease some pressure on the sector, especially for those whose vehicles loaded with non-essential goods that are stranded.. But there are still many challenges. There is no clarity on opening of booking offices, godowns, factories and warehouses and unless that is resolved it will remain a challenge to unload loaded goods and book goods,” said Kultaran Singh Atwal, president of the All India Motor Transport Congress.“The transport sector is one of the worst affected sectors with {the proportion of} idle vehicles reaching above 90%. More than 20 crore people are directly and indirectly dependent on this sector. The government needs to give immediate stimulus for this sector so that it continues to drive the economy,” Atwal said.Transporters have sought a social security cover of Rs 15,000 per month from the Centre for workers engaged in the supply chain. They have also sought loans at low rate of interest for working capital.“Amid the prevailing uncertainty, the next two quarters would be extremely critical and nightmarish for the road transport sector as poor consumption will lead to weak demand and hence less transportation activity. It will take about six or more months to revive production and consumption in the country and to get transportation activity to reach an average level. Social Security for the people engaged in the supply chain has been a long pending demand..,” Singh said.The Centre is also considering a demand for providing a Rs 50 lakh insurance cover for those engaged in the supply chain. “A decision on the demand for insurance cover will be taken soon,” a senior government official said, requesting anonymity.According to fleet management firm LocoNav, the daily average movement of trucks and distance covered has dropped to 20% during the lockdown. “We are hopeful of it recovering marginally now after the MHA guidelines. Depending on the drivers and availability of labour we are hoping supply movement picks up to 40% now,” said Shridhar Gupta ,co- founder, LocoNav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-relief-to-truckers-govt-opens-highway-repair-shops-dhabas/story-XGuG3yuEbNWPZpIYziUIZM.html
16-04-2020||India||Lockdown 2.0: Bengal allows jute mills to operate with 15% labour, industry says unsustainable||The West Bengal government on Wednesday decided to allow the jute industry to operate with 15 per cent of its regular workforce during the lockdown after several requests from the Centre.Industry captains, however, said that most mills would be unwilling to start operations because working with 15 per cent of the workforce would mean higher losses than keeping the mills shut. They also apprehend law and order problem among workers over choosing this small number from among them.On Wednesday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said, “I have received a call from union textile minister Smriti Irani and also from Maharashtra and Telangana, requesting that the mills be allowed to operate. The harvest season in our state has approached too. If we don’t allow operations now, plastic may take up jute’s place.”Follow coronavirus latest updates here.However, while Irani in a letter to the chief minister on April 13 had requested to allow at least 18 jute mills – the letter had also named the 18 mills identified by the ministry – with 25 per cent of their regular workforce, Banerjee on Wednesday allowed all mills to operate.“It will be injustice to allow only 18 mills to operate. So, we are allowing all the mills, with 15 per cent of their regular workforce on alternative days, given that they maintain all protocols, including social distancing and wearing of masks and use of hand sanitizers,” the chief minister said.The mills have been shut since the lockdown was announced last month.Bengal has 60 jute mills that directly employ about 200,000 people. Mills on average employ 3,000 people. Hastings Jute Mill in Hooghly district, for example, has 4,338 workers on its roll.Industry captains said running mills with only 15 per cent of the workforce is not sustainable. “We are waiting for the written communication from the state government but we can say that mills would run into losses if they are to work with only these much of the workers, as the tariff for our main produce gunny bags is fixed,” said Raghavendra Gupta, chairman of Indian Jute Mills Association. According to the owner of a jute mill, 15 per cent workforce is required only for maintenance purpose. “The cost of running the mills and paying wages would be far higher than the income from the produces, as very little amount of production would ultimately take place,” said a jute mill owner who did not want to be identified. Another mill owner said, “Nearly 80 per cent of a mills’ workforce live in the vicinity. Choosing only 15 per cent from among them could lead to law and order troubles.” A senior labour department official, however, ruled out the apprehension of law and order problem. “When chief minister said ‘every alternate day’, she meant the workforce, not functioning of the mills. So, in effect, 30 per cent of the workers would be engaged, each getting work every alternate day.” Earlier, after the Centre had received requests from the governments of Punjab and Telangana as well as FCI for urging Bengal to let the mills start operation immediately, E K Majhi, additional secretary in the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution wrote to West Bengal chief secretary, stating that “It is of utmost importance that jute mills immediately resume their operations for manufacturing/dispatch of jute bales to meet the requirements of the State Procurement Agencies/FCI.”“I shall, therefore, earnestly request your indulgence to direct jute mills to immediately start manufacturing/supply of jute bales so that during the peak procurement period, procurement operations of government are not disrupted due to a shortage of jute bags,” the letter said.Bengal had then turned down the Centre’s request, with chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, saying that the state would not act on the basis of a letter from the textile ministry when the lockdown was announced by the Union home ministry.On Wednesday, the state government also allowed brick kilns to function with 15 per cent of the workforce, work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guaranty Act, work for housing scheme for the poor and small industrial clusters ‘on case to case basis’. The government has already allowed the tea gardens to operate with 15 per cent of the workforce. Banerjee said that in every sector workers will have to follow social distancing and use masks and hand sanitisers.According to the state’s bulletin published on Wednesday, the number of active Covid-19 cases stood as 137. The Union ministry of health and family welfare (MHFW) put the cumulative number of people testing positive for Covid at 213. Seven persons have died and 37 have recovered or have been released, the MHFW said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-2-0-bengal-allows-jute-mills-to-operate-with-15-labour-industry-says-unsustainable/story-l3tftAHir9rZ9ig7xsEDXI.html

Jammu region is constantly being punished by the BJP government for no fault of its people.”Furqan Ali, a 23 year old youth from Srinagar, said that 2G network was a cruel joke on millions of students across the UT. “The administration gives us lame excuses that restoration of 4G network may lead to terror attacks, and keeps denying the law abiding citizens their fundamental rights. Not everyone is a terrorist in J&K,” he remarked.School education department director Anuradha Gupta said that on March 26, a day after the lockdown began, they switched over to other modes of communication like online classes, TV, radio, conference calls etc for keeping the schoolchildren abreast with their studies. “Schools heads and teachers were also roped in to help the students using these modes,” she added.Meanwhile, the home department has decided to continue 2G internet services in the UT till April 27. TThe 2G mobile internet services has been extended in Jammu and Kashmir till April 27 for postpaid and only verified prepaid SIM, according to an order issued by the home department secretary Shaleen Kabra.“The postpaid SIM card holders shall continue to be provided access to the internet but these services shall not be made available on prepaid SIM cards unless verified as per the norms applicable for postpaid connections,” the order said.The order attributed the decision of not restoring 4G internet to “social media applications that are used for the circulation of photographs of terrorists of proscribed terror organisations, mobilising crowds and spike in terror attacks”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elusive-4g-internet-adds-to-lockdown-woes-of-j-k-students/story-ZPiCNcjvXGd6qjU0Y5SuVO.html
16-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Tamil Nadu dairy farmers face uncertainty in lockdown||In the highly competitive milk industry where it is common for private companies to woo farmers at higher prices than the government-fixed rate, the new normal for S Arokyasamy, secretary of Vetri, a dairy Farmer Producer Company (FPC) in Krishnagiri district, is a distinct loss of advantage. In the past 10 days, Vetri has struggled to find buyers for the 1300 litres of milk produced daily by its 160-member farmers. Many of Vetri’s clients — a bulk of which are small dairy shops, hotels, restaurants, factory canteens and colleges — have shut shop because of the lockdown that’s now extended to May 3. In fact, nearly half of the 20.6 million litres of milk produced each day by the state’s 2.5 million dairy farmers is bought by the unorganised sector, like Vetri’s clients and even milkmen who supply non pasteurised milk to households. Co-operatives and private sector companies buy close to 37% of it. Unlike vegetable farmers, dairy farmers do not have the option of delaying the harvest or storing it for a day or two given the perishability of milk, which is why getting a good rate for their product is essential. Quite like the commodities market, prices fluctuate daily. And the season has just begun.“Summer is usually the most profitable period for us as demand skyrockets. That’s when private companies pay a significant premium. Now, with most private companies shut, our only option is to sell at whatever price the companies offer. On top of that the price of cattle feed has increased during the lockdown. It’s a double whammy for us,” Arokyasamy said.The price of cattle feed like gram husk has gone up by a third in the lockdown and now sells at Rs 1250 per quintal; steep for diary farmers who haven’t even been able to make a sale.However, not everyone’s having a bad season. The state owned Aavin — a brand run by the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation (TCMPF) — has ramped up procurement at Rs 31 per litre, the rate fixed by the state, and has also added close to 25,000 more farmers into their network comprising 210 cooperatives. TCMPF has increased its daily procurement by up to 7% or roughly 200,000 litres, according to K Gopal, secretary, animal husbandry, Tamil Nadu. The government now buys close to 3.5 million litres a day. “The government policy is to ensure that neither the farmers nor consumers get affected during the crisis. The dairy development department is creating hundreds of new village co-operative societies and enlisting as many farmer members as we can in double quick time,” Gopal said.Earlier private players would lure farmers away from state co-operatives by paying them anywhere between Rs 5-8 a litre more than Aavin. Now, they don’t have to. Milky Mist, an Erode-based dairy firm and the country’s largest producer of cheese and paneer, has increased procurement by 50% to 600,000 litres a day with its supplier network ballooning from 47,000 farmers to 60,000 in just a few days during the lockdown. Earlier, they would procure milk at a rate at least Rs 2-3 higher than the government rate. Milky Mist now buys milk at Rs 31 a litre, benchmarked to Aavin’s price. Founded by T Sathish Kumar, a 44-year-old first generation entrepreneur in 2018, the company doesn’t sell milk. It sells value-added products such as cheddar, cottage and mozzarella cheese that have a long shelf life. Thus, it can afford to buy milk in vast quantities at prices lower than usual. It also has the capacity to process one million litres of milk a day. “We can absorb additional supplies because all our logistics infrastructure such as refrigerated tankers are owned by us. With grocery shops delivering at consumers’ doorsteps efficiently in the state, we are witnessing a big spike in home consumption demand,” said Kumar. Aavin cannot lower its procurement price like private players, but because it is owned by the government it has an advantage others don’t possess in the lockdown. All its outlets and parlours are open for trade as usual. In the absence of competition, its milk sales have increased by 150,000 litres a day, and the household consumption of value-added products such as palkova, a milk-based sweetmeat, butter and paneer have shot up. Aavin is using the opportunity to expand into the suburbs of Chennai’s satellite towns — a delivery van now visits at least 15 new suburbs.“Since private companies have abandoned farmers, we have filled the vacuum. This is a hugely competitive market. The private players with huge advertising and marketing budgets, and the ability to pay higher procurement prices ate into our market share. Now, we are using this as an opportunity to expand our market,” said S Vallalar, managing director, Aavin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-tamil-nadu-dairy-farmers-milked-dry-in-lockdown/story-MuiIUa6akVi4tAAqYMCmoL.html

It is important to underline the threat posed by the disease; it is important to emphasise the measures that every individual must take against it; it is critical to even adopt extreme measures such as lockdowns to prevent the spread of the disease. All of this, therefore, requires messaging that is focused on the dangers of the disease.Yet, at the same time, there needs to be a second message along with it. It has to revolve around how the disease is, overwhelmingly, not life-threatening. It has to emphasise that those who are infected with the virus are not criminals, but are victims — and even if there is no cure, the right remedial care will see them recover. It has to be focused on how patients require empathy, not ostracisation. And it has to emphasise that the reason both the infected and those vulnerable to infection are asked to isolate and quarantine is so that they don’t spread it to others.This dual messaging is important because of increasing reports that many who develop symptoms are reluctant to go to hospitals because of the stigma around the disease. This, in turn, means they report at a later stage, when symptoms become more severe — in the process, they transmit the disease to many others but more important, their survival prospects diminish. Tackling the stigma around it is an important element in the battle against the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/battling-the-stigma-around-covid-19-ht-editorial/story-Tev4DuyvTW0tv57UIo1d3I.html
16-04-2020||Editorials||Needed: A reformed WHO| HT Editorial||The United States’ decision to stop funding the World Health Organization (WHO) could not be more badly timed. The WHO remains the closest thing to an international coordinating and information-gathering body during the pandemic. At a time when multilateral cooperation could not be more needed, United States (US) President Donald Trump has concluded there is greater political benefit in turning on the agency. His action is partially symbolic: The US has already provided funds for this financial year.However, a large share of the blame rests with the WHO. The director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, allowed his organisation to become entangled in great power rivalry. This is a minefield which all multilateral organisations should avoid. He tried a strategy of accommodation to persuade China to be more open about the pandemic, to the extent of appeasing it. The WHO issued a stream of flawed advice based on the information provided by Beijing, including criticising the decision of India and other countries to impose a travel ban on China. Some of his comments, such as criticising Taiwan despite its exemplary handling of the virus, were gratuitous. The approach yielded little. The WHO needed to take a harder line, for example, about the limited access foreign scientists have been getting to ground zero of Covid-19. The agency also has long-standing internal issues. Donors tie much of its funding to specific programmes; so it has minimal capacity to watch out for black swan events. Its regional directors are answerable to multiple national health ministers. Half of its 10 largest donors are non-governmental organisations. But many of these defects ultimately derive from the agency’s long neglect by governments. The US, whatever Mr Trump’s own views, has long been the WHO’s strongest supporter and contributes a quarter of its budget. China, for all its evident influence, pays less money than Rotary International. The WHO has played a quiet-but-crucial role in global health. It effectively runs the health services in some 30 countries. India is also a beneficiary, especially in the agency’s efforts against tuberculosis and polio. The WHO standard-setting helps India serve as the world’s generic drug maker. The world can ill-afford a cash-starved WHO — despite its flaws — in a time of pandemic. India should consider joining other governments in pledging to fill any financial gap that may occur. New Delhi should also clearly warn the agency to be more open in calling out China and other governments who fail to meet their medical obligations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/needed-a-reformed-who-ht-editorial/story-cYDke0DcZZApyi7x5dwZtM.html
