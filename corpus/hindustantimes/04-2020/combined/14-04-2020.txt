14-04-2020||News||Covid-19: What India must do next| Analysis||The decisive action taken by the Indian leadership in flattening the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) curve is laudable. In choosing between the proverbial kuan (well) and khai (chasm), one takes steps to avoid the most catastrophic scenario. With the Prime Minister announcing the extension of the lockdown, the valuable time that has been bought must now be used to prepare. But for what? A defensive war or an offensive one? The first will be fought by socio-political measures such as lockdowns and care of the vulnerable; the latter will be fought by science and technology. When physician Harvey Fineberg recently talked about 10 weeks to crush the curve in America, he outlined six key steps. With slight modifications, these are the following: One, establish a clear command system. Two, test widely. Three, protect health workers with proper gear and equip hospitals for a surge in demand. Four, determine and track who is infected, likely to be infected, exposed, unexposed, or recovered. Five, inspire and mobilise the public. And last, but not the least, learn from research to continually improve. These principles apply equally to India, but the relative difficulties of each step are very different.For India, the command system is clear and active, the public is engaged, but testing is low, the determination of the five classes (of step four) is not yet clear, and supply chains of protective gear and hospital equipment are thin and fraying.The sixth step, research, has to not only meet these defensive challenges, but also launch an all-out offensive against the enemy. We must innovate at every step, use our fabled “jugaad” as a stop-gap defensive measure, while our premier research institutions work to provide new weapons in this fight.While the challenges are severe, the unified response of the government, industry and academia in this time of crisis has been heartening. For example, to test widely, we need diagnostic kits. As global supplies of kits and their components start becoming scarce, Indian industry and start-ups, supported by academia, are developing indigenous alternatives. Medical researchers, epidemiologists, molecular biologists, and technocrats are jointly formulating strategies for minimum testing for maximum insight.Apps like Aarogya Setu leverage India’s digital and telecom infrastructure and tech talent to supplement community testing and provide virtual intelligence. Previous investment in high-quality basic research is also paying off. The recent development of futuristic alternatives such as a Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based paper strip test, which may eliminate the need for expensive and scarce real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machines, came from years of background work.While issues remain in expeditiously bringing new tech to market — for example, sufficient quantities of the input materials for the CRISPR test are difficult to find — a strong academia-industry combine is working hard to overcome the obstacles. Meanwhile, numerous research labs across the nation are using their infrastructure to enhance the national Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR testing capacity. Young companies funded by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Department of Biotechnology industry programmes are coming out with affordable and simple indigenous diagnostic systems that can be used by local centres without advanced infrastructure. Together, these form a viable plan to widen the testing net and effectively determine local and personal risks.Similarly, procurement challenges in personal protective equipment (PPE), hospital beds, oxygen, ventilators, and newer anti-viral drugs, must be met by focused science. Towards this, Indian research organisations are using cross-sectoral strengths to create the necessary pipeline of products. When biohazard suit production was constrained by the unavailability of seam sealing tape, a sealant glue from submarine applications was substituted by Defence Research and Development Organisation, ensuring that these suits can be produced in large numbers, forming a robust line of defence for frontline health workers. An indigenous oxygen concentrator from the CSIR Venture Centre may make the difference between life and death for hypoxic patients, if central oxygen supply runs short.Lifesaving drugs, with promise in Covid-19 treatment, are being synthesised by CSIR labs in collaboration with pharma majors. Inspiration from traditional medical systems is guiding the ministry of Ayush’s efforts. The idea is to not blindly copy anyone, but to take the best of what is available and by using universally-recognised scientific principles, modify it to local contexts and needs. We have bought ourselves time to prepare and have the scientific capacity to deliver. This war will be won by smart data-driven defence, coupled with strategic offence.While the medical side defends with what they have, the research side must support them with what they need. Importantly, we must not take our eyes off the real solution — effective treatment and vaccines; developed in India for the world. We have the leadership to inspire and mobilise the public. Can science guide decisions to shape the public health response and to restart the economy? If we do this well, not only will we save grief to hundreds of thousands of Indians, but also contribute to global good and emerge a stronger nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-what-india-must-do-next-analysis/story-o7Juz3amKSikUJNDSIOPMM.html
14-04-2020||News||The pandemic will change public life as we know it| Analysis||No one should seek to read much into the economic predictions at the moment with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in full flow. However, Covid-19 is likely to profoundly impact the way governments, companies and citizens behave, changing public life as we know it.Former United States President Ronald Reagan famously said that the nine most scary words in the English language are: “I’m from the government and I’m here to help”. This approach influenced political thought for a quarter-century. But Covid-19 has put governments at the forefront of the response. There is now a greater questioning of why the role of the government has been needlessly reduced in many countries. India too has edged towards an erroneous consensus that we need to keep government small. This is likely to change.Former national security adviser and foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon, wrote in Foreign Policy that governments will take on a renewed confidence in their power to shape the destinies of their nations. In responding to the crisis, governments have perhaps found powers they either did not know they had or were unwilling to use. This new-found power will influence how other matters of state are dealt with later. The climate crisis fraternity may now see greater receptiveness to demands for more stringent environmental emission standards. Demands for strengthened health care, better social security nets and the like have been denied for long, due to various fiscal reasons. The boundaries of the envelope of what government can do has clearly been expanded way beyond what people would have expect only a few weeks ago.For long, there has been an uncritical acceptance of lower wages in some jobs such as nursing and teaching. Caught in the middle of a pandemic, we now see that these groups take on an unusual level of importance. To this list of critical roles are included not just doctors and nurses but also teachers, delivery staff, store clerks and bank tellers. While granting that, in most cases, wages will be determined by market forces, other forms of benefits such as additional income support could be promised to such groups to partially offset the personal risks taken by these groups when they are expected to keep essential services afloat.Historically, governments have claimed an absence of fiscal space to fund such welfare activities. In India, there should now be a strong case to increase spending on health care and insurance. Budget 2021 will hopefully place greater importance on these. As we debate how adverse individual health outcomes impact society at large, there will also be a recognition that large-scale unemployment, partly caused by a potential economic slowdown, too damages the economy. Governments will need to implement Keynesian steps to create more jobs and would be well advised to breach their current fiscal target. Now they should have the confidence to push back on the deficit hawks. Fiscal deficits in the United States rose to 10% of GDP under Roosevelt’s “New Deal” in the mid-1930s. That was a major factor in enabling the US economy to recover. Indian must move to a 5% fiscal deficit for some years — as long as the money is used in a directed manner.Greater governmental powers do come with their own risks. Kishore Mahbubani, dean at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, has pointed out that at a cultural level, so far, East Asian economies have demonstrated better capability in handling the pandemic. Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore, all stand as poster children of good administration. This crisis will be a shot across the bow of those in the West who claim that their models of government have little to learn from others. Citizens, in many countries, seeing governments with stronger hand work well could perhaps push democratic nations towards greater authoritarianism.Another medium-term impact of Covid-19 should be a greater openness to using technology. Telemedicine, which has been untapped, will see a surge. It has always seemed unambitious that this market is estimated by India to be just about $32 million, roughly one day’s revenues of one of the many IT majors. In the sphere of education, several lobbies have taken the position that no version of online education will be acceptable for the award of formal degrees. Now, they have scrambled to find ways to make online learning and assessment possible.In a similar vein, for long, working mothers, those with ageing parents, and the disabled have requested organisations to display greater flexibility in offering work-from-home (WFH) options. However, even enlightened companies have generally offered WFH facilities for a maximum of two or three days a month. The pandemic has shown that it is indeed possible to manage some parts of our business on a remote basis. This is a dramatic change in lifestyle for those who need it. One would expect the share of women in the workforce, which has been dropping in India in recent years, to see some revival.The 2008 financial crisis led to a distrust of experts, especially those prone to making economic prognostications. This distrust of a small part of the educated elite spilt over into scepticism of other classes of experts who indeed had something useful to say.A consequence of this trust deficit was the inclination to vote persons without meaningful expertise in public office. Governance is for serious persons who have dedicated their time to politics and administration. It is no surprise that the best administrative responses have come from thoughtful leaders in Singapore, South Korea, or Germany. One hopes that we will see a diminished enthusiasm to vote for TV stars, actors and sportsmen. Several of these changes may well usher in a period of more egalitarian growth, driving investments the government should always have made and enabling a wider base of consumption.The trente glorieuses (three decades of high growth) in France and the Golden Age in the US were driven by deep-rooted and sensible governmental interventions. India has to do the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-pandemic-will-change-public-life-as-we-know-it-analysis/story-WoGvZWxxsfY8lCrx0kqWFL.html
14-04-2020||News||Covid-19 and the contours of a new world order| Analysis||The world is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. People are dying in large numbers. Health care and the economy are under severe stress. Countries are turning inwards, closing borders, to protect their people. As historian Yuval Noah Harari wrote, more and more countries are becoming nationalist and protectionist, even, in some cases, even authoritarian.But the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has taught us a different lesson, a lesson of interdependence. The pandemic is global. The battle to combat it too must be global. We depend on each other for our health care equipment, services, transportation facilities, and, finally the vaccines, as and when they are invented. India has imported masks and testing kits from some countries, while exporting critical drugs such as hydroxychloroquine to many countries, including the United States (US). Global supply chains have become critical not only for health care products, but food and other supplies too.In fact, one big realisation for countries from the pandemic has been that nationalism of the closed kind won’t work. Donald Trump’s “America first” nationalism didn’t work. He had to turn to China, India, and South Korea for supplies. A recurring theme of many a political scientist about American exceptionalism stands shattered today. Isolationists in all countries, including India, must realise that post-Covid-19 world will be more integrationist than isolationist.For some time now, it has become a fad with political scientists to talk about multi-polarity. But the 21st-century world is no longer being led by countries alone. We have corporations that have bigger GDPs than many countries in the world. We have players outside the State that wield enormous influence on people across national boundaries. More important, in the era of social media, a number of power groups have emerged in the world that defy national boundaries. While nationalism as a political ideology is making a return, the world is also slipping into what author, Parag Khanna has described as hetero-polarity. It may be premature to predict the post-Covid-19 world order, but it can conclusively be said that we are moving into a hetero-polar world, with multiple State and non-State power players actively crisscrossing each other’s paths.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to lead India into that world after the pandemic. Modi described the situation as “World War-like”. That has catalysed the building of a narrative around World War II. Comparisons are being drawn between Modi and Franklin D Roosevelt, who led America into WWII. Incidentally, both Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler came to power in America and Germany respectively in the same year (1932). While Hitler turned into a despot, subjecting European neighbours to domination and aggression, Roosevelt focused on rebuilding America. His “New Deal” led to massive infrastructure building such as highways, bridges and railways in America, and helped the country come out of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Expectations are that Modi will also do something similar.Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 forced Roosevelt into the war. By the end of the war in 1945, the US emerged as the leading world power replacing Great Britain. But Roosevelt’s contribution to the War was not just about the defeat of the Axis powers. Roosevelt was instrumental in building two global institutions. Through the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, he laid the foundation for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The US dollar emerged as the global currency. In April 1945, the United Nations Organization (UNO) was born with the US and its allies in the driver’s seat.At a time when this post-Covid-19 world order appears to be in disarray, it will be tempting to expect Modi to don the Rooseveltian mantle and take the lead in building new global institutions. Institutions of the WWII vintage such as the World Health Organization and United Nations Security Council have become overtly partisan and lost their credibility today. “The United Nations is far less credible today than it has been through its history”, S Jaishankar, India’s external affairs minister said recently. With the US facing its worst nightmare, and the credibility of the Chinese leadership at an all-time low, the presumption that Modi should step into the role that Roosevelt played 75 years ago sounds logical.Perhaps, Modi should go back, not 75 years, but by a century, and look at the role Woodrow Wilson had played at the end of World War I. “Wilson saw America’s mission in World War I not as material aggrandisement but as leading all nations into a new international community organised to achieve right ends,” wrote political scientist, Joseph Nye. Wilson’s famous 14-point charter for world peace, outlined in his address to the American Congress in January 1918, underscores the moral leadership of America.Wilsonianism of the 20th century was represented by liberal internationalism, democracy, non-intervention, collective security and humanitarian cooperation. In the last six years, Modi has shown his commitment to all these political ideals. In fact, during his Covid-19 consultations with the G20 and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation partners, he presented his model centred on humanism as “human-centric development cooperation”. Modi-ism of the post-Covid 21st-century world can be borne out of the democratic and humanist credentials that he has displayed in the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-and-the-contours-of-a-new-world-order-analysis/story-DUqursm0t8sunJl1gaBJmO.html
14-04-2020||News||Some options for the RBI as it preps to kickstart post-Covid economy | Opinion||Good news rarely makes the news. The Reserve Bank of India under Governor Shaktikanta Das displayed great calmness in pulling YES Bank away from bankruptcy, buffering the systemic damage from IL&FS and proactively encouraging change of guard at ICICI. Instead of a deserved “break”, RBI is now marshalling India’s financial “army” against Covid. The RBI has to navigate between moratoria on loans to help businesses impacted by Covid-19, and ensuring that unscrupulous promoters do not take undue advantage. The RBI’s guidance on changes needed to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, debt restructuring processes and recognition of impairment will be critical to softening the economic disruption from Covid-19.With a deflationary threat hanging over India, RBI has to design an effective means of funding a stimulus whose size will dwarf anything seen before.The RBI will also have to ensure that capital levels at banks remain acceptable, that the giant PSB mega merger succeeds, and progress made in recognising NPAs is not frittered away. Direct liquidity may need to be provided to NBFCs and AMC-MFs. Liquidity that has dried up for corporate bonds needs to be resurrected.Not only will RBI have to balance often contradictory priorities and on a gigantic scale, they will simultaneously need to plan for the unwind– to commence normalisation of the economy. Some changes, and additional investments will help keep RBI’s regulation top notch.Revamp NBFC supervisionGovernor Shanktikanta Das highlighted concerns related to the non-bank financial companies (NBFC) while announcing enhanced supervision of the largest 50. At nearly Rs 20 lakh crore in assets, private NBFCs are an important part of credit delivery. The reliance on short-term funding is quite high, and there are concerns about “co-lending” with banks. There is also a significant size concentration with the largest private NBFCs.Given IL&FS, DHFL issues and the worries about other prominent NBFCs, the sector needs constant, consistent, tighter monitoring. It is suggested that all NBFCs with assets more than Rs 5,000 crore be “deemed banks”. Their supervision, monitoring etc. should reside with RBI’s banking supervision team, and they would need to comply with prudent norms around capital adequacy, cash reserves like normal scheduled commercial banks. Such NBFCs should also, subject to their meeting other RBI criteria, be given a 12-month fast-track into becoming a bank. Simultaneously, there is a need to reduce the categories of NBFCs. The fundamental risks for “lending” NBFCs are the same – credit and operational risk, liquidity, capital adequacy and governance. Once we move “large” NBFCs into banking, the rest can be treated as one – albeit differentiated between deposit and non-deposit taking. This will reduce the load on RBI and improve supervision.Modernising and simplifying supervisionThe RBI’s supervision and risk monitoring remains fairly reliant on data submitted by financial institutions. There has been a focus on static rather than dynamic data. Combined with scheduled inspections, this may allow sector players to camouflage shortcomings in their operations. A welcome change has been discussions with stakeholders started by the RBI – forcing greater attention on corporate governance. There is a need to simplify the reams of static, often unusable, data that is submitted to the RBI – where data metrics become more important than the underlying risk.Going beyond numbers, simplified supervision could reduce the data points but add emphasis on contingency planning, stress tests and “directional” indicators on balance-sheets. To help with this, the RBI needs access to the most updated data-mining technology. It needs to be able to pull data, at short notice, from the core-banking systems at financial institutions. Technology can then be used to red-flag issues e.g. shifting exposures for evergreening, undisclosed group relationships between borrowers, window-dressing etc. Some work has started, but this needs to be accelerated. RBI needs ongoing engagement with larger financial institutions so that problems are identified early. It needs to be further empowered to proactively examine warning signals (such as the ones IL&FS had emitted for years) through surprise, specific focus inspections. Revisit ‘Payment’ BanksWhile the announcement of Payment Banks grabbed a lot of attention, their real utility and contribution to the financial system – in terms of inclusion or improving transactional efficiencies is questionable. Progress in payments technology has made them almost redundant. Perhaps we can allow them to close down or easily merge with existing banks. This can ease the supervisory burden on RBI.Empower regional officesIndia’s financial sector is too complex to be supervised primarily out of Mumbai. Regional offices need greater leeway and role in supervising local financial institutions, as well as regional operations of national financial institutions. Like the Fed, regional offices should have formal inputs into monetary and regulatory policy issues, adding regional flavour and priorities.As the RBI leads the financial response to COVID, there is a need to give it the right tools to cope with the greater complexity and scale of modern banking regulation.(Saket Misra is an international investment banker)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/some-options-for-the-rbi-as-it-preps-to-kickstart-post-covid-economy-opinion/story-5hlTZY48jKngtVUg8JZDgJ.html
14-04-2020||News||The quest for justice in Bangladesh||On April 12, Abdul Majed, one of the assassins involved in the killings of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family was hanged in Dhaka. A former army captain, Majed was reportedly hiding in Kolkata. In 1998, a trial court had sentenced him and 11 others to death, and in 2009, the Bangladesh Supreme Court upheld the sentence. When his last recourse, the clemency plea to the president, failed, he was finally executed just after midnight.In 2010, five others convicted of taking part in the assassination conspiracy were sent to the gallows. One among the twelve convicted, Major Aziz Pasha died in 2002 in Zimbabwe while in hiding. The rest five are still absconding. Bangladesh will not be able to achieve closure on Bangabandhu’s assassination until the five conspirators still alive are brought to justice.When Majed was arrested last month, Bangladesh’s home minister hailed the development as the “biggest gift” for his country, which has had to postpone a year-long birth centenary celebration of Bangabandhu, on account of the coronavirus. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to attend the celebrations.Bangabandhu’s assassination changed the course of the country’s history. In 1977, soon after the assassination, the country came under the military dictatorship of General Ziaur Rahman, the then army chief, after he ousted President Khondoker Mostaq Ahmad. Zia was a reluctant “freedom fighter” and deserted the Pakistan army when he realised that Pakistan’s defeat was inevitable.He, however, showed his true colours after the assassination of Bangabandhu. As soon as he grabbed power, he pardoned Bangabandhu’s assassins and rewarded them with diplomatic postings. He permitted leaders of organisations — such as the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and the Razakars — that collaborated with the Pakistani army in the genocide to return. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had banned these organisations, and declared them war criminals after Bangladesh’s war of liberation.Zia passed an indemnity law in 1975, granting amnesty to those who were part of the assassination conspiracy (The indemnity law was revoked when Sheikh Hasina came to power in 1996). He also allowed many to form political parties and contest elections in the 1980s. He patronised pro-Pakistan politicians and organisations. With other politicians, he cobbled together the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), whose leadership was passed on to his widow, Khaleda Zia, after army personnel, in a coup attempt, assassinated him in 1981. Khaleda Zia, in coalition with Pakistani collaborator, JeI, served as the country’s prime minister for two terms. During her rule, Bangladesh-India ties had hit rock bottom.Only two family members survived the assassination of Bangabandhu and his family: Sheikh Hasina, the incumbent prime minister, and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, who were in Germany on August 15, 1975, the day the killings took place.As prime minister, Sheikh Hasina has shown remarkable determination and tenacity in pursuing the killers. In 2008, she included the issue of the war crimes tribunal in her manifesto. She persisted despite domestic and international criticism, and the tribunal eventually completed the job entrusted to it. Several assassins and JeI leaders were convicted and hanged.Sheikh Hasina has always believed that Zia was a party to the assassination conspiracy and played a key role in it. This fact is at the core of the bitterness and rivalry between her and Khaleda Zia.Intelligence sources point to the role of Zia and his army colleagues in the assassination conspiracy, which was encouraged and financed by Pakistani generals and the Inter-Services Intelligence, smarting from their defeat and humiliation in the 1971 war. Zia, trained under the Pakistani army, had imbibed its ethos and instincts. Military coups were part of its DNA. This led Zia to anchor the country’s nationalism in Islamic and anti-Indian terms, as opposed to the secular values of the War of Liberation, espoused by Bangabandhu and his colleagues in the Awami League. General Hussein Muhammad Ershad, Zia’s successor as the army chief, who later served as the president of the country, amended the Constitution to make Islam the State religion of Bangladesh.Majed’s arrest led to speculation over the reasons and circumstances under which he returned to Bangladesh. He may have been located and identified by India’s intelligence agencies and handed over to Bangladesh. Earlier, the agencies had launched a failed manhunt to find Risaldar Muslehuddin, another assassin, who was also reportedly hiding in India.The hunt for the killers will continue. Intelligence cooperation between the two countries has improved during Sheikh Hasina’s regime. She will not give up on bringing the assassins to justice. India must give her unstinted support in this endeavour.Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty is a former High Commissioner to Bangladesh and a former Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs; he is currently, a Visiting Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, Delhi.

14-04-2020||News||Why we need Ambedkar more than ever||Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar — whose birth anniversary falls on April 14 — was a major aberration to the Indian nationalist iconography. His fearless challenge to Mahatma Gandhi’s moralist appeal was based on the assessment that social elites lack ethical convictions to emancipate the Dalits. Ambedkar wanted to elevate the Dalits from their subjugated and depressing social condition to an equal claimant over social rights and political power. This democratic assertion is often belittled as a narrow political act, reducing Ambedkar to a mere Dalit leader. But he was much more than that. In post-Independent India, Ambedkar’s political philosophy has churned around three major themes. First, he hoped that the modern Constitution, with its rational and welfare-oriented directives, will be more effective in bringing substantive social changes. Second, he assumed that Dalits will emerge as a potent political force and will participate in the new democracy. Third, he visualised that Buddhism will help India reinvent its glorious ethical past and advance liberal principles (mainly liberty, equality and fraternity).In the post-liberalisation period, multiple communities have adopted Ambedkar as a key thinker on subaltern rights, social justice and ecological issues. Dalit and other social movements place him on a high mantle as a heroic individual, as an apostle of great virtues, as one of the leading nationalist icons. However, Ambedkar’s ambition to establish socially marginalised groups as a crucial participant in political power has remained unfulfilled. The Dalit political movement has been peripheral and insignificant, while Hindutva organisations have appropriated Ambedkar as their core cultural symbol, and have successfully attracted newer Dalit communities into their fold.The last political outfit that Ambedkar established, the Republican Party of India, crumbled soon after its inception. Another radical alternative, the Dalit Panthers, died a slow death. In Uttar Pradesh, under the leadership of Kanshi Ram and, later, Mayawati, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) offered a political alternative. But over the last decade, it has become a peripheral force. In the rest of India, the Ambedkarite political movement is still at a nascent stage. Since Narendra Modi came to power, the representation of Ambedkar as a Hindu reformist nationalist icon has taken precedence over his radical anti-caste identity. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wishes to showcase that they are equally sensitive to Ambedkar’s political ideas and committed to the values of constitutional justice. On April 14, 2017, Modi visited Deekshabhumi at Nagpur, and announced various welfare measures for the Dalits, which is a loud political statement. Across the country, his government has built monuments, statues, memorials and organised cultural programmes and symbolic events to prove its sincerity towards Ambedkar and his followers. The BJP also tried to test its pro-Dalit social engineering in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has a dedicated samarasta (harmony) programme to connect the most disadvantaged social groups into the Hindutva project. The sub-caste factionalism within the Dalits helps the BJP to mobilise the worst-off Dalits. Popular Dalit personalities such as Ramnath Kovind who was elected as president as the nominee of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and NDA allies Ramdas Athawale or Ramvilas Paswan have helped the BJP expand its electoral support-base. The new Dalit leadership often speaks the political language of the RSS, without being apologetic of its communal character. For the first time, the BJP has also gained considerable support among the Dalit middle classes as well as within the neo-Buddhists. The new Dalit entrants in the Right-wing politics regard it as a pragmatic and rational option, especially when the “secular” political parties have failed to bring any substantive material benefits to the community.The rise of the BJP, the decline of the independent Dalit political movement, and the relegation of parties with the social justice ideology to the sidelines, make us believe that a large number of Dalits have moved away from Ambedkar’s radical vision. But this is too early to say. Despite the success of the Right-wing in appropriating Ambedkar, his political and social vision remain a challenge to the Hindutva cause. For India’s future, Ambedkar envisioned an ideological force of democratic socialism. He valued modernity as a force of humanity’s progress towards true freedom, by which he meant liberation from conservative religious bondages and establishment of fraternal social life. Ambedkar’s political philosophy is a dynamic resource yet to be activated in its true spirit. Like Karl Marx, any reading of his key texts not only ignites our critical capacities but also introduces us to the grave struggles that people are engaged in against social and economic oppression. Ambedkar’s critical insights liberate us from the dungeon of the caste psyche, cultural prejudices and upper-caste hegemony. Ambedkar in its true spirit would be a bête noir to the Right-wing school of thought. He was extremely harsh against the Brahminical Hindu religious order, and was unapologetically critical towards nationalist leaders (including Gandhi and Nehru). He forcefully rejected Hindutva as the ideological force to imagine the new nation. In his book, Pakistan or the Partition of India, he proclaimed that the “Hindu Raj” will be the greatest calamity for the country, and, therefore, it must be prevented at any cost. Some Dalits today have moved towards Right-wing politics, with the hope that it will bring them some material benefit. However, such hopes are rarely fulfilled. Though economic growth, in general, has improved, the real-life conditions of the Dalits, Adivasis and other marginalised communities prove their persistent marginalisation and exclusion. Further, upper-caste cultural hegemony, the social elite’s dominance in public institutions, the growing relegation of Dalits into the informal labour market, and the absence of political deliberation on social justice has become the new norm. Ambedkar’s political philosophy is under-utilised. When the deprivation and destitution of a large mass are growing, while the economic and the political power of a minority social elites is on a rapid surge, it is imperative to bring the discourse of social justice and socialism back. Ambedkar will continue to be the key intellectual figure that provides the critical resource to challenge the dominance of the Right-wing.

14-04-2020||Lucknow||102 new corona cases in UP, death toll rises to nine||The statewide tally of Covid-19 patients increased by 102 cases on Tuesday to 660 from 558 on Monday, even as the death toll in the state reached nine from five on Monday, according to the health department. The four deaths on Tuesday were reported from Agra (two), Kanpur (one) and Moradabad (one). Earlier one death each was reported from Basti, Meerut, Varanasi, Bulandshahr and AgraAddressing a press conference, principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the coronavirus (Covid-19) patients who died were old and suffered from co-morbidity -- more than one disease like diabetes, cancer, kidney, liver or heart ailment.He said the health department has urged people to take adequate measures to protect ailing senior citizens.In 75% of the cases, it has been observed that people infected with coronavirus remain asymptomatic and with time the infection goes. The people need to follow the Covid protocol issued by the health department that includes social distancing, covering of the face and cleaning the hands at regular intervals. These measures will protect senior citizens from getting infected with the virus. The people should take proper food to strengthen their immunity, he said.Recently the health department had released data showing that the ratio of youths and middle aged people infected with coronavirus was higher than elderly people.According to the data, 44% of the positive patients were of the age group of 21-40 years and 27% of positive cases were of people in the age group of 41-60 years.Only 13% of the patients were above 60 years and 16% were in the age group of zero to 20 years.

14-04-2020||Chandigarh||Mustard procurement in Haryana begins today||Mustard procurement set to begin at 165 centres across Haryana on Wednesday will be a test for the state government. To overcome the coronavirus outbreak during the procurement season, the state government not only has increased the number of purchase centres from last year’s 64, but also capped the number of farmers visiting these centres per day at 100. The market committees have been asked to ensure that the produce arrives at the centres on the basis of e-gate pass available only to registered and verified farmers. The mustard procurement will also provide an opportunity to agencies to iron out snags pertaining to social distancing measures and hitches at newly created makeshift centres before April 20, when wheat procurement, estimated at 70-80 lakh MT as compared to 7-8 lakh MTs of mustard, would start on a much bigger scale. “The mustard procurement will help us learn and figure out whether the ‘100 farmer a day’ model is good or needs modification during wheat procurement,” an official said.Sanjeev Kaushal, additional chief secretary, agriculture, said the Haryana State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation (Hafed) and Haryana State Warehousing Corporation (HSWC) will retain 75% of the mustard procured this season and auction it through commodity exchanges with the government’s approval. “The mustard will be procured by the agencies at MSP of ₹4,425 per quintal and the profit or loss during the auction will be borne by the state government,” he said. The remaining 25% mustard will be procured by the agencies for National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed). “It’s a proactive step of Haryana government to purchase the entire mustard produce at MSP. The price support scheme (PSS) under which the procurement of mustard is done has been relaxed,” Kaushal added.Notably, Union agriculture ministry had last week increased the daily procurement limit for mustard and gram from 25 quintals to 40 quintals per farmer. Arhtiyas to get higher commissionOfficials said handling charges of the arhtiyas (commission agents) have also been increased from ₹40 per quintal to ₹55 per quintal for the 75% of procurement done by the state agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mustard-procurement-in-haryana-begins-today/story-AEuNFrX8acgZexwaOOqRHN.html

14-04-2020||Chandigarh||COVID-19: Punjab begins wheat procurement under shadows of pandemic today||With Punjab set to start wheat procurement on Wednesday under the shadows of Covid-19, the state food and civil supplies, and agriculture departments have dispatched hundreds of gallons of sanitisers and thousands of gloves and masks to all 1,864 grain markets (mandis) and purchase centres besides rice shelling mills temporarily designated as procurement stations. With a bumper crop likely this time, the total wheat arrival is n expected to surpass the targeted 135 lakh tonnes. Due to rainfall and fall in temperatures at the maturing stage of the crop, both harvesting and procurement were postponed by a fortnight. To maintain social distancing to avoid the spread of coronavirus, procurement will be made in a staggered manner as farmers will enter the mandis with passes issued to them.For day 1, the Punjab Mandi Board, a subsidiary of the agriculture department that runs procurement centres and mandis, has issued 7,000 passes to the farmers to bring their produce. Early wheat arrival is expected in the mandis of Patiala, Sangrur, Mansa, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ludhiana and Khanna districts. Passes are being issued 72 hours in advance.“The Covid-19 hotspots pose a challenge to us. Seventeen such areas have been identified in Punjab and we will have to ensure the procurement does not get impacted. We have authorised the deputy commissioners to take call in their areas accordingly keeping in view the situation,” said additional chief secretary (development) Viswajeet Khanna, who heads a state-level committee on harvest and procurement. The harvesting is going to be smooth but we are concerned about lifting and transportation of produce to the storage points, he said. As of now, three mandis at Manalgaglan, Pathlana, and Uchalad in SBS Nagar’s Banga area besides another in Mohali’s Derabassi have been closed, Khanna added. These fall in pandemic hotspots. “Based on the information collected by the agriculture department, the wheat production in the state could touch 185-190 lakh tones, of which 137-140 lakh tonne is expected to arrive for procurement. “We have sufficient funds for purchase even if the arrivals go beyond our target of 135 lakh tonne. The government has made arrangement of a cash credit limit for Rs 26,000 crore and we may get more,” he added.On the precautionary measures being taken for the safety of farmers, commission agents and the procurement staff, state food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said at least 50,000 litres of sanitiser and over 1 lakh masks and gloves have been made available in the mandis. “The department is also arranging N-95 masks for 7,000 procurement staff members deputed on the ground. All mandis will also have indigenously developed handwash stations. About arrangements in the mandis, food and supplies director Anandita Mitra said 30X30 square grids have been marked in the mandis for receiving the produce, and each square is sufficient to unload 150 quintals of produce and parking a tractor-trailer. A truck driven by the same driver will be allowed for movement of grain between a mandi and the storage point, she added. State divides quota of procurement agenciesThe state food and civil supplies department has divided the quota among four procurement agencies and centre’s food corporation of India. Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said keeping in view the expected arrival of 135 lakh tonnes of wheat, Pungrain has been given 26% (35.10 lakh tonnes), Markfed 23.5% (31.72 lakh tonnes), Punsup 21.5% (29 lakh tonnes), State Warehouse Hosing Corporation 14% (18.9 lakh tonnes) and the central agency Food Corporation of India (FCI) 15% (20.25 lakh tonnes) at an MSP of Rs 1,925.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-punjab-begins-wheat-procurement-under-shadows-of-pandemic-today/story-S3huiX1K6gw3iO8WHqOn6L.html

14-04-2020||Mumbai||High-risk contacts with symptoms to be tested on priority, says BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to prioritise testing of symptomatic high-risk contacts of coronavirus positive patients and give second priority to asymptomatic high-risk contacts to ensure early detection of those who need critical care. The decision was taken even though BMC data for Mumbai shows that more than 70% patients do not have symptoms. Until now, the BMC was testing all high-risk contacts, irrespective of symptoms, however, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, in a meeting with ward officers recently, asked them to prioritise symptomatic high-risk patients. However, all high-risk and low-risk contacts will be quarantined institutionally or at home, irrespective of symptoms. Those having symptoms have a problem in breathing, cough and fever, while a majority of them don’t show any symptom owing to their immunity.The BMC officials said this is in line with the Central government’s guidelines for testing, considering symptomatic high-risk contacts are more prone to transmission and require more attention than asymptomatic contacts. More than 10,000 high-risk and low-risk contacts have been placed under quarantine, and 4,000 have completed their 14-day quarantine period. A BMC official said, “We are not saying we will not test asymptomatic positive patients, but we are going to prioritise those who have symptoms. This will help us get quicker test reports of those who are symptomatic and if found positive, they can get timely medical care.’’ Sandhya Nandekar, assistant municipal commissioner, R North ward, which covers Dahisar and part of Borivli, said, “We will look at it on a case-to-case basis. If required, test can always be done. Also, we are quarantining all high-risk and low-risk contacts.”Currently, the BMC has been collecting 4,000 swabs at government and private labs daily and getting results for 2,000-2,300 tests a day. It aims to increase the testing capacity to 5,000 in the coming days. A BMC official said, “At times, it takes two days for results to come, considering the backlog. By prioritising symptomatic tests for high-risk contacts, we are just streamlining the process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-risk-contacts-with-symptoms-to-be-tested-on-priority-says-bmc/story-s1bjW649GVuUK43IBc51DJ.html

Farmers were allotted earmarked slots to unload their raw cotton. It will send a positive message to wheat growers and arhtiyas that invitation-based staggered purchase of food grain can also be a hassle-free and organised operation,” said Chahal.On Monday, HT had first reported that the mandi board officials had planned to test the working of the staggered wheat procurement plan in Mansa.Cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel said the purchase was delayed by a day on Tuesday due to last-minute preparedness issues.“CCI offered minimum price of ₹5,241 per quintal, while the maximum rate was recorded at ₹5,405. Cotton was purchased as per the quality parameters of the central agency. Farmers have an estimated stock of 50,000 quintal and the CCI will buy the pending material in the coming weeks in a similar manner,” said Goel.Tractor trolleys were duly sanitised before entering the mandi premises and social distancing was ensured, said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cci-procures-446-quintal-cotton-from-20-farmers-in-mansa/story-F1WC4DcjGrbs9Sf8H6xDbK.html
14-04-2020||Lucknow||Agra toll 3; sole reason for death in all cases not Covid-19||Two more women who had tested positive for COVID-19 died in Agra, taking the toll to three.With four new patients testing positive, the number of positive cases rose to 142. On Monday alone, 35 cases tested positive, taking the number to 138. With identification of four more positive cases, the number rose to 142.Both the women were admitted at a hospital near Bhagwan Talkies crossing, one of the hotspots with over 20 infected staff and contacts.Last week, a woman who also had asthma had died of coronavirus infection.District magistrate Prabhu N Singh, while confirming the two deaths, said all three deceased were aged women.“The first woman who died was 76-year-old and patient of asthma. She got the infection from her grandson who had returned from Netherland. She was brought here under critical condition. She was on support of steroid and oxygen. Cardiac arrest was assigned as the cause of death,” said the DM.“Another woman who died on Monday was 48-year-old. She was already admitted to the hospital near Bhagwan Talkies as a brain hemorrhage patient. She had large intra cerebral hemorrhage leading to raised intracranial tension which required ventilator support. As such COVID-19 cannot be assigned as sole cause of death because in such type of cases of primary disease, mortality is very high,” said the DM.“Mortality rate of Intra cerebral hemorrhage is as high as 44% in the first month and 75% in the first 24 hours so assigning this death because of corona virus is not justified,” said the DM.“The third patient was having carcinoma lung with kidney failure, both leading to decreased immunity and super infection with COVID 19,” said the DM.“In case of carcinoma lung too, mortality rate is very high and added renal failure further increased the chances of death. As such in this third case of death, COVID-19 does not seem to be the sole cause of death,” he said.With the hospital already a hotspot, samples of all these women, recuperating in intensive care unit, were sent to Lucknow’s King George Medical University (KGMU) soon after their death.

14-04-2020||Gurugram||Nuh police raid 15 distillation units brewing liquor illegally||The Nuh police on Tuesday raided 15 distillation units brewing country liquor illegally in the villages near the Rajasthan border and arrested three men. The police said that at least 10 suspects fled from the spot.Over 20,000 litres of fermented wash, 60 liquor barrels and 100 tins and jute bags were destroyed in the villages, said police adding that 25 barrels of brewed liquor were also destroyed.The raid was conducted on the directions of director general of police Manoj Yadav. Police officials said these villages are a hub for illicit liquor trade and supply spurious liquor to various parts of Nuh, and parts of Haryana and Rajasthan.Superintendent of police, Nuh, Narender Bijarniya, said three police teams were formed and the Rajasthan police were contacted after receiving information that illicit liquor distillation was being carried out in the 15 villages. “Due to the lockdown the suspects had re-established their business, as liquor vends are closed and the demand for liquor is high,” he said.More than 100 police personnel, including some from Rajasthan police, reached Nanuka river Tuesday morning.“After we started the raid, we found that these villages which are located on the riverside and hills have a history of supplying nearly 5,000 bottles of illicit liquor on a daily basis to different parts of Haryana and Rajasthan. No police officer would dare to conduct a raid in the village, as attacking police personnel was common. Many villagers were involved in the business,” said Bijarniya.The raid began at 5 a.m. and continued till 2 p.m and the police managed to arrest three men who were allegedly found storing liquor in drums. Other suspects fled from the spot, the police added.Police officers said villages along the Nanuka river shores are famous for brewing illicit country liquor. They brew nearly 20,000 litres a day and sell each litre for at least ₹350.In view of the illicit liquor trade in these villages, police officials have been asking the residents not to patronise them.Bijarniya said they have roped in women, whose husbands had died following consumption of spurious liquor, as informants.Police registered cases against the suspects under section 61 of excise act and section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) at Chopanki and Nuh police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nuh-police-raid-15-distillation-units-brewing-liquor-illegally/story-igJE1Gq6jHG99EjF9aOeEK.html

14-04-2020||City||MCG to discontinue use of sanitisation tunnels, advises citizens not to install devices||Gurugram: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Tuesday issued instructions to its health department to discontinue the use of ‘sanitisation tunnels’, set up at the Civil Hospital in Sector 10, ESI Hospital in Sector 9, and at Vikas Sadan. At least one condominium in the city, and one automobile manufacturing facility in Manesar, had also installed such devices, and will have to discontinue their use, an MCG official said. The city’s first disinfection tunnel, at the Sector 10 Civil Hospital, became operational on April 8. At the time, the MCG’s official handle had tweeted, “The tunnel sprays a diluted Sodium Hypochlorite solution on the person walking through it, thereby considerably reducing the number of germs on the individual.” However, a reading of available, scientific literature on the subject shows that there is little evidence to support this claim. Even the World Health Organization (WHO), in an advisory, stated, “Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes.” Sodium hypochlorite, a key ingredient in bleach, is only effective as a surface disinfectant, said multiple doctors who spoke to Hindustan Times. With this in mind, states including Punjab and Tamil Nadu (which was the first to resort to their use) have also issued orders calling for a withdrawal of the technology. In New Delhi, AIIMS, which had installed a disinfection tunnel developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on a trial basis, also discontinued its use starting April 13. HT also spoke to a doctor at Civil Hospital who, requesting anonymity, said, “We were made to compulsorily walk through the tunnel while entering and exiting the premises, without any personal protective equipment (PPE), on multiple days. While I have not felt any major side-effects, I experienced lasting skin irritation. We have raised the issue with the health department. It is good news that they will not use the devices anymore.” BluRain, a Gurugram-based landscape water solution company, has been in discussions with hospitals, offices, schools and hotels to install such devices. The company’s technical head, Pawan Sharma, said, “In the first three or four days, we must have received around 20-21 enquiries from factories, especially in the automotive sector, as well as government institutions and residential societies for purchase of the tunnels.” Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, said on Tuesday, “We have been receiving lot of queries from RWAs regarding disinfection tunnels. MCG had also experimented with them a week back, but now the WHO has issued an advisory discouraging the installation of disinfection tunnels, as they may cause more harm than good. MCG also recommends that disinfection tunnels should NOT be installed in condominiums/sectors/colonies/offices/commercial complexes/market etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcg-to-discontinue-use-of-sanitisation-tunnels-advises-citizens-not-to-install-devices/story-AxA3XvxEtld8qcSG5lUzjI.html

14-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Covid lockdown: Two treat 60 birds through video call||Two bird lovers have been treating birds at the bird hospital in Sadar Bazar giving them first aid, medicine and looking after them, as the sole doctor who was in charge of them is stranded in Uttar Pradesh due to the nationwide lockdown.Ever since the lockdown started, Pramod Kumar and Shiv Kumar have treated more than 60 birds at the hospital. Neither of them has left the hospital even for a single day since the lockdown started only to look after the birds. “To be honest I don’t know how to treat the birds very well, but working in the hospital for nine years has given me enough experience to give them first aid. In the last 20 days, my colleague Pramod and I have treated birds who arrived with their throats slit and claws injured. There were two whose feathers were stuck together,” Shiv, who has been working in the bird hospital as a compounder, said.Besides treating several birds, the duo has also taken care of a peacock who was dropped at the hospital by some people last week. “The peacock arrived in paralysed on one side, so we decided to get in touch with the bird doctor who guided us on what to do. Now the peacock is better and is showing signs of improvement,” Pramod, a member of the housekeeping staff, added. The treatment for the birds is presided over through video call by the hospital’s bird doctor. Everything is discussed—what should be done to a specific bird and the medicine that is to be provided. Dr Raju Kumar, who looks after the birds in the hospital, said, “I had to leave Gurugram for some work in Bulandshahr before the lockdown started. Now, I am in regular touch with both the workers in the hospital through video calls. I tell them the medicine the birds should be given and they are doing a fine job.”The duo is not only taking care of the birds that come to the hospital but the stray dogs who have become regular visitors now. “During the lockdown, we would see a couple of dogs roaming about near the hospital so we kept a bowl of water for them. We also feed them biscuits and whatever we have in stock,” Shiv said.Birds of all kinds, including parrots, crows, pigeons and koels are harboured here. The hospital also has a large number of crows, falcons and eagles under treatment. “Our job is to treat the birds and then let them go. Some people bring in birds and these feathered patients are given medicines and a nutritious diet,” Pramod added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/60-birds-treated-through-video-call/story-Uf4WP4XNDFxyN9natUbV1H.html
14-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s Park Place has adopted a senior citizens’ first policy||Amid the ongoing national lockdown announced to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), residents at Park Place in Sector 54 are taking special measures towards the safety of elderly living in the high-rise. Residents at the condominium have created a roster of citizen volunteers to tend to the needs of senior citizens, who are at a high risk of contracting the infection.Yogesh Saini, a member of the volunteer team dealing with Coronavirus-related activities, said that a team of volunteers had been constituted to look after the needs of elderly residents and a separate WhatsApp group comprising senior citizens of Park Place had been formed to coordinate the efforts and cater to requests. “Senior citizens are at high risk of contracting Covid-19, due to which we are taking extra precautions regarding their safety. We have appointed volunteers to take care of senior citizens and ensure that they do not face difficulties of any kind,” Saini said. Siddharth Punia, another volunteer spearheading the efforts, said that specific days in the week had been reserved to supply requirements to the elderly. “On specific days, we request all senior citizens living alone without any domestic help to share their list of requirements with us. Be it groceries or medicines or any other requirement, we make a note of it and ensure that our volunteers deliver it to their doorstep while taking all precautions,” Punia said. The condominium has barred the entry of part-time domestic help such as maids, cooks, drivers, car washers, and dog walkers among others. External workers are only being allowed in special cases wherein the occupants are either physically challenged or are senior citizens living alone. External vendors such as food delivery persons and newspaper vendors, meanwhile, are halted at the main entrance. Residents are required to collect the delivered items from the gate. All persons entering the building with deliveries are thermal scanned and mandatorily required to use sanitisers. Within the condominium, common areas are regularly sanitised by the MCG and the RWA. Given the lockdown, the apartment has cut down the strength of its non-essential staff and provided all staff members with boarding and lodging facilities within the condominium to reduce the chances of exposure to the world outside the premises. Surat Singh Yadav, estate manager, Park Place, said that 70 members of the staff had been housed within the condominium complex to take care of essential services. “Around 70 members of the maintenance and security team have started living within the complex so that basic tasks can continue as usual. Moreover, the safety of both residents and the staff is taken care of with reduction in movement,” Yadav said. He added that the condominium had tied up with a food outlet, which was delivering food, and the staff was not required to cook. “Besides providing them with food, we ensure that their health check-ups are done regularly. They have been given accommodation in flats and we make sure that social distancing rules are followed within these flats. The staff has also been provided with PPE kits which they use while entering apartments for the sanitisation work,” Yadav said. Yogesh Saini, a member of the volunteer team dealing with Covid-related activities, said that all Covid-related announcements and advisories were being shared with residents through Whatsapp and Facebook groups. “There is constant dialogue with the residents and they can approach us with any requirement. The volunteers ensure that the needs are met,” Saini said. The condominium has essential shops within the complex that are catering to residents. “Everything is available within the complex and for other necessities, we are allowing delivery services till the gates,” Saini said. Besides, in the area around the general store and other common areas, the floor has been marked to facilitate social distancing. “We have drawn circles on the floor at a distance of 2 metres from each other so that people maintain distance while standing outside the shop. More than five persons are not allowed inside the shops at a time. Guards have been placed within the shopping area to ensure that the rules and social distancing protocols are followed,” Saini said.Punia, another volunteer, said that the Covid-response team had been monitoring the grounds, shopping complex, and other common areas to ensure that people abide by the lockdown conditions. “Initially, some people could be seen strolling around and were not taking the lockdown seriously. However, we started making announcements via loudspeakers and even got the police to take rounds of the complex. People are strictly abiding by the lockdown now and not coming out for any unnecessary reason,” Punia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-park-place-has-adopted-a-senior-citizens-first-policy/story-OQKmrTvK4TWUK2UQXPRsXJ.html
14-04-2020||City||Lockdown extension: City stores see sharp increase in sale of essential items||Gurugram: Soon after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on Tuesday morning to extend the ongoing nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19 till May 3, grocery stores and supermarkets across the city saw a significant increase in customers as people tried to stock up on essential items. Residents and shopkeepers attributed the increase in purchasing to growing uncertainty about any changes in the enforcement of lockdown and the outcome it may have on the supply of essential items.At several stores across the city, long queues could be witnessed as people purchased items in bulk, to stock up for at least a month to ensure they do not have to venture out during the lockdown.Brishti Mohapatra, a resident of DLF 5, said that after the district administration on Friday demarcated nine containment zones, several residents in her condominium could not get their items delivered as delivery personnel were not allowed through the area by the Gurugram police. A day later, once the administration specifically stated that such online services would not be curbed, deliveries resumed in the area, she said. However, after another 19-day extension, Mohapatra said she did not want to take any chances. “Amid the growing uncertainty regarding the supply of essential items, I simply did not want to take any chance. I was not alone, there were more than 50 people at a supermarket on Golf Course Road doing the same,” said Mohapatra.Ved Pal Raghav, president of Gurgaon Wholesaler’s Association, an umbrella body that overlooks operations of over 150 wholesale stores and 1,200 retail stores in the city, said that there was a 30-40% increase in sales on Tuesday, compared to the preceding days.“I was apprised by several wholesale and retail shop owners that they witnessed nearly double the total number of customers in comparison to the last few days. Overall, the total sales across the city increased by 30-40% today. Most customers told us that, fearing further extension in the lockdown, they wanted to store items in bulk,” said Raghav. Some customers complained about the shortage of essential items of popular brands. “I went to the supermarket in my locality around 3pm. Almost all the milk, salt, and sugar packets were over. The ones that were there were from unfamiliar brands. Surprisingly, one of the store operators at the cash counter informed me that most of the stock had replenished by noon,” said Harshit Kumar, a resident of Sector 50.Nitin Yadav, a grocery shop owner in Sector 49, said that there were long queues outside his shop than usual, and his workers had to interfere to ensure social distancing is followed.“There was a significant rush today. There were queues of more than 10-12 buyers at the cash counter through most of the day. On several occasions, I had to ask my workers to create space and ensure they maintain social distancing,” said Yadav.The district administration said that it is taking all steps to ensure there is ample supply of essential goods. “We have consistently ensured from all concerned stakeholders that the city is well stocked and there is ample supply of goods during the lockdown. We will continue working towards this end to ensure residents are least inconvenienced,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-extension-city-stores-see-sharp-increase-in-sale-of-essential-items/story-4dUHoPiR9nhftugpUN3EXI.html
14-04-2020||Chandigarh||Over 77% Tablighi contacts test negative in Haryana||Health authorities in Haryana heaved a sigh of relief after 77% of the samples taken from the contacts of the Tablighi Jamat missionaries turned out negative for Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The test results of these high-risk individuals assume significance in view of the fact that the missionaries and their contacts account for 121 cases, which is over two-thirds of cases in the state. Data accessed by Hindustan Times showed that out of 662 contacts tested, only 13 turned out positive. “Though the lab reports of 135 samples of the contacts and 61 of the Jamatis are still waited, I can now say that we have been able to contain the community spread of coronavirus due to relentless screening, intensive testing and isolation of habitations,” additional chief secretary (ACS), Health, Rajeev Arora said.The ACS, Health said they we will however not let their guard down. “The habitations will continue to remain isolated for 14 days. I also expect a small increase in the number of positive cases. But the possibility of a substantial increase in the number of positive cases is very less,’’ he said.Hotbed Nuh seems contained, says officialsThe Tablighi Jamat is an over 100 year old Islamic group that meets often at Delhi’s Nizammuddin in a five-storey building called the Markaz. Last month, certain Covid-19 deaths were linked to this group . When authorities traced their members, they found that many of them were foreigners from affected countries and had come in contact with many others who later travelled to other parts of the country, As per the statistics, 1,461 Jamatis and 662 of their contacts were tested by the health authorities from across Haryana.The bulk of such individuals came from the Nuh district of Mewat region where 353 Jamatis and 12 of their contacts were tested for coronavirus. The lab findings had thrown up 38 positive Jamatis in Nuh district, the highest in the state. “We had six new disclosures on Sunday whose samples have been taken. The police however is investigating whether they would qualify as Jamatis or their contacts,’’ Nuh Civil Surgeon, Virender Yadav said.“ More than 233,000 households in 501 villages of Nuh district were screened door to door after isolating the habitations. The number of persons screened in this hotspot is over 1.4 million,’’ said a health official indicating the intensity of the containment operation. In Palwal district, 65 out of the 89 Jamatis tested and 22 out of 39 contacts tested turned out to be negative. Officials said that results of 13 samples of contacts in Palwal district are awaited. In Yamunanagar district where three Jamatis were tested positive on Sunday, 132 samples out of 160 of missionaries have tested negative. The result of 25 samples of missionaries and 37 samples of their contacts are awaited, statistics show.Number of Jamatis traced: 1648Foreign nationals: 107Number of samples of Jamatis taken: 1461Positive Jamatis: 108Number of Jamati contacts tested: 662Positive contacts: 13||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/over-77-tablighi-contacts-test-negative-in-haryana/story-o5E2QdxgiRGynmHsYErwTM.html
14-04-2020||Lucknow||1.41 lakh posts of teachers, headmasters vacant in UP govt primary schools||With over 1.41 lakh posts of teachers and headmasters lying vacant across UP, government-run primary and upper primary schools, numbering around 1.59 lakh, are reeling under acute shortage of teachers, reveals latest data available with UP basic education department.Officials share that updated details regarding vacant posts have come light through data collated as part of the inter-district transfer exercise of Basic Shiksha Parishad’s teachers recently.Although reluctant to go on record, basic education department officials say these vacant posts are besides the 69,000 posts of assistant teachers the recruitment process for which is held up as a result of an ongoing litigation in the Allahabad high court.“If these posts also included, the number of vacant posts will go up to 2.1 lakh,” said a senior official of the state basic education department.He said if one looks at just the government-run primary schools in the state, a total of 1,60,533 posts of teachers and headmasters are lying vacant. “Even if one deducts the 69,000 posts stuck in litigation, 91,533 posts are still left vacant. If one sees the upper primary schools, an additional 50,088 posts are vacant,” he added.The state government has stopped direct recruitment of assistant teachers in government-run upper primary schools numbering around 45,625 in the state. The government has decided that vacant posts here are to be filled only through promotions, share officials. Before that, direct recruitment of 29,334 assistant teachers of science and mathematics were initiated in 2013. However, that too attracted litigation and filling of vacant posts out of these is sub judice in the Supreme Court, they claim.In these upper primary schools, 1883 posts of headmasters are also lying vacant, say officials.The government-run 1,13,289 primary schools in the state also face another piquant situation. Here the number of headmasters far exceeds the numbers prescribed by norms. Norms say that only schools having 150 or more students can have a headmaster. The government has resolved to not remove any headmaster who at present is stationed in a school. As a result, against 22,444 sanctioned posts of headmaster, the state’s primary schools have 68,191 headmasters working in them— an excess of 45,747 headmasters as per the new data, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/1-41-lakh-posts-of-teachers-headmasters-vacant-in-up-govt-primary-schools/story-LWRE6fQxclV82KPCLytEgK.html
14-04-2020||Gurugram||In Gurugram slums, not keeping safe distance is a cry for help||In the urban village clusters of Sikander, Nathupur and Chakkarpur, where a mix of daily wage workers and house help live surrounded by some of city’s most affluent areas, not following social distancing norms is a cry for help. “We sit in large gatherings to gain attention of passersby or agencies so that they visit us and get to know that we have been sleeping on an empty stomach. Our children are only eating one meal a day,” Roshini Devi, a native of Bihar who has been living in Sikanderpur area for the last 16 months with her five children and husband, said standing in a queue for water outside a local resident’s house which enjoyed supply. Some 10 women had line up to fill water. Another group of women, their faces a mix of worry and fatigue, were seen talking about “the old days before the lockdown”.Daily wage earners have been the worst affected by the nationwide lockdown enforced to check the spread of Cornavirus disease (Covid-19) in India. The lockdown, which has dried up all sources of income across the country, was extended till May 3 on Tuesday when Haryana’s Covid tally touched 184, with 32 cases from Gurugram, including 1 death. The state has 141 active cases.“If we are destined to die on an empty stomach, we will. We have been eating dry roti and water for 15 days. It is very difficult to live like this; no water, food or electricity. Initially, we were happy; we had heard that the government agencies would provide cooked food or ration, but they only came here once and that too on April 9. We were able to stretch our meagre savings only on the basis of charity by locals, RWAs and NGOs,” Roshini said who has now given up on her dream to build a house back home in Bihar. Area councilors, however, denied the claim that no food had been distributed. They claimed that they were distributing cooked food but the slum residents were insisting on only accepting ration. Ward 34 councilor RS Rathi said, “I am myself visiting Sikanderpur and delivering food to more than 900 families and community lunch is provided to all the people. Even community centres are organising ‘langars’. There is no shortage of food as many residents are going and giving with bread, milk and vegetables.”Roshini’s neighbour, Bharti Anand, also a native of Bihar, however, said, “Food is supplied, but only to a few families who know the village sarpanch. We are neglected and we sit all day and night in wait of cooked food or dry ration.”Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri assured he will take up the issue of distribution of ration with agencies involved and will ensure no one sleeps hungry. “There is enough ration and many volunteers are helping in providing food and dry ration in these areas,” he said Tuesday. When Team HT visited these places on Tuesday, groups of people were seen moving around freely, sitting together talking how their savings were running out or how it would have been better to do someone’s house work—all RWAs in the city have told residents to pay their house help for the length of the lockdown. Nearly 2 lakh migrants, most of them daily wagers, reside in Sikanderpur, Chakkarpur and Nathupur. Majority come from poor villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. While some are here with their families with an average of two to three children, others save up to send money home. Most were unhappy with the extension of the lockdown announced on Tuesday. None of them wore a mask—compulsory in Gurugram—or were interested in social distancing as no one ever told them about it. Only a few fellow people seemed to know that it was mandatory to wear masks, but did not understand why, nor did they know that a scarf would also suffice.“Everything we know about this illness is through messages or videos on the internet,” Mahesh, a resident of Chakkarpur said, adding that no government official or policeman had ever come to tell them about what’s happening. Vikas Paswan, who lives in Sikanderpur and is a native of Bhagalpur in Bihar, said they were ready to come on the roads to protest and ask the government to provide them with buses so they can go home. Vikas lost his job as a construction site worker, which fetched him ₹600 per day. “What is the point in staying here when the authorities have no interest in our lives? They must let us go. We are being held hostage in these slums. We are not allowed to move out, we fear police action and we are not getting any food or water from agencies,” he said.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Tuesday morning said that addressing the woes of the daily wage earners was among his top priorities, no concrete set of instructions have been issued nor mechanism created by any key ministry or state administration to ensure this most marginalised section of the society can continue to earn its living. “There has been no work for almost two months now. Our saving will last another week and we have children to feed. We cannot borrow meals as everyone is facing the same problem and we can’t even beg; there are no people,” said Sikaderpur resident Shanti Kumari, who worked as a daily wager at the Marble Market.People in Nathupur were equally worried and scared. Sanjay Paswan, a daily wage earner, said they come out in the evening and chat, play cards and look for at the road waiting for food trucks or cars of residents who come to distribute food. STARK CONTRASTMeanwhile, things looked more cheery in Chakkarpur where a large section of the workers are engaged in people’s homes and were receiving their salary regularly. Suresh Yadav of Bihar, who has been living in Chakkarpur for three years, said, “Our area comes alive at night; we watch movies, cooking meals together and play cards all day because most of the women here work as domestic helps and are getting money so we can enough our meals,” he said.Asked why they weren’t following social distancing, residents said that since they were not in the containment zone they could go to markets and “be normal”. These select families in the slum, however, have become the envy of their less fortunate neighbours. “Why this discrimination? Even we should not get paid money by the contractor for not working as we were hired for a project and not our fault,” said Vinod Shukla, a daily wager.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/in-gurugram-slums-not-keeping-safe-distance-is-a-cry-for-help/story-oB23BLpb4NTRNvpd0HFl3I.html
14-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad police chase away Delhi buses from border area, UP to shift stranded migrant workers to home towns||The Ghaizabad police on Tuesday deployed additional personnel and maintained strict vigil in areas bordering Delhi in view of the nationwide lockdown being extended till May 3, to prevent the spread of Covid-19. They also stopped two Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses ferrying migrant workers and sent back the buses to Ghazipur, police said.According to officials, they were apprehensive that migrant workers from Delhi would arrive at the Ghaziabad-Delhi border in hopes of catching buses from the ISBT at Kaushambi. Thousands of migrant workers had swarmed the border area on the night of March 23, after the lockdown was first announced, in a bid to board buses to their home towns in Uttar Pradesh.“As a precautionary measure, we enhanced the deployment in border areas ad maintained strict vigil. On Tuesday evening, two DTC buses, which arrived near the Delhi-Ghaziabad border at UP Gate, were stopped by us. Each bus had about 40 to 45 migrant workers and the buses were sent to Ghazipur,” Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram), said.“When we contacted Delhi officials, they told us that migrant workers were being shifted from Kashmere Gate to the Ghazipur shelter home. Since the buses came close to our border we stopped them and sent them back. No bus or other such vehicle will be allowed to enter the state,” she added.When contacted, the deputy commissioner of Delhi police (east), Jasmeet Singh, said homeless people were being moved from Kashmere Gate to a shelter home in Ghazipur, east Delhi.“The buses were passing via the Delhi-UP border and that must have created some confusion. No bus was to enter Uttar Pradesh,” the DCP said.The officials of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), the nodal agency for providing shelter to the homeless in Delhi, confirmed that around 100 homeless persons were being shifted to a shelter in Ghazipur on Tuesday evening.“The group is part of the 550 who were left without a place after a fire. In the evening, they were being sent to a shelter facility in Ghazipur. One should not believe in rumours. The CM has also issued a statement,” Bipin Rai, member, DUSIB, said.On Saturday, two homeless persons had set two shelter homes on fire, after a tiff broke out between them and the civil defence volunteers over food distribution. Following the fire, the Delhi Police had written to the government informing it that the shelter homes in north Delhi’s Kashmere Gate were packed beyond capacity and that distributing food was a problem. Most of Delhi’s homeless people live in these shelters at Kashmere Gate.Late Tuesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had appealed to workers to travel and to wait till May 3.“We will ensure adequate food and medicines. DTC or UP government buses are not available for you to go home. These are rumours. People may try to exploit you. Be cautious and stay wherever you are,” he had said.Last month, tens of thousands of migrants had gathered in Anand Vihar and Kaushambi in the hope of catching buses to their home towns in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Many of them were left stranded and are lodged in shelter homes across the city.On Tuesday, UP officials said arrangements will be put in place to shift them to their home towns.“The revenue department has given clearance for migrant workers in quarantine facility to be sent home. This will be done once their health checkup is completed,” Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), said.“We are arranging buses for them. They will also be given food grains. But, they will have to remain in home isolation for 14 days. The buses will be arranged by Wednesday,” he said.(With inputs from Delhi bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-police-chase-away-delhi-buses-from-border-area-up-to-shift-stranded-migrant-workers-to-home-towns/story-kWuZ7HXoWLAWzJ72fuBKRI.html

The family alleged that the mob believed him to be a virus carrier and thrashed him. His attackers also made videos of him on their phones and then widely shared them on the social media captioned, “coronavirus positive Muslim man”.Knowledge Park Police have registered a case and launched an investigation into the matter.Mohammad Zakir, the man’s uncle, said the 32-year-old man was on his way to meet his wife and son who were at his in-laws’ place in Rabupura, Greater Noida. “My nephew got married two years ago. He was walking to his in-laws’ place and had reached Momnathal village around 8am. A group of youngsters stopped him on noticing his long beard. They thrashed him and made two videos on mobile phone and linked him with Tablighi Jamaat. The malicious videos were later uploaded on Tiktok by a person named Shravan Chaudhury,” he said. Zakir said his nephew had no connections with the Jamaat.He said the police and health department officials later reached the spot after getting a call from area residents and took the man to the Greater Noida Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) for medical examination.Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said the man was later shifted to a quarantine facility in Greater Noida. “On Sunday evening, we received information that the man had jumped off the seventh floor and died. His test reports for Covid-19 were negative. Police have registered an FIR against unknown persons under Section 306 of the IPC (abetment to suicide) on the complaint of the quarantine facility manager. The police are investigating the matter,” he said.The man’s family said he worked as a cab driver and was going through a financial crisis for some months. “He had five sisters and one older brother. He was facing some financial crisis and was depressed. He was also undergoing treatment at a mental hospital in Delhi. We reached the hospital when we received information that he had been quarantined. We informed the police and hospital management that he was not a coronavirus patient but they did not listen to us. They said that man will remain in quarantine till his test reports came,” Zakir said.“The mob that thrashed him is responsible for his death. The quarantine facility management was also negligent and police should probe their role too,” Zakir said. The body was later handed over to family and it was buried Monday night. The district administration has already ordered a magisterial probe into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mob-thrashes-muslim-man-calls-him-corona-carrier-he-later-jumps-to-death-at-quarantine-facility/story-6LvrlFO1O5lURVlSG3xVlO.html

The new hotspots were identified after 16 new Covid-19 cases were found on Monday night in the district.With this, the district has now 29 hotspots. Officials said that they have intensified containment activities such as sanitisation and surveillance in the slums and villages. On Tuesday, health officials picked up some people from the slums of sectors 5 and 8, and they were brought to a government quarantine centre as five people were found positive for Covid-19 from the area last week.On Tuesday, the district reported just one Covid-19 positive case.After the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to extend the lockdown till May 3, the district magistrate on Tuesday held a meeting with the officials to intensify the containment work in hotspots.The officials are particularly worried about areas such as JJ Colony in sectors 8 and 5, and villages Patwari, Ghodi Bacheda, Chaura Sadatpur, Kulesra, Bishnoli and Wazidpur. The officials are surveying the areas to avoid community spread of the disease. The officials fear that if people at these places will not follow social distancing, then the spread might increase drastically. They have also increased the number of random testing from these identified villages and slum areas of Noida.“With the extension of the lockdown, we are going to intensify our containment drive at the hotspots. There will be enough police deployment in the district to ensure the lockdown. Cluster containment is our main focus. We will also start random testing of people in the affected areas to ensure that the infected patients are identified,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate.Currently, there are 230 suspected Covid-19 patients in the government quarantine centres in Greater Noida. The administration has been facing criticism for not maintaining hygiene at the quarantine centres. The chief development officer Anil Kumar Singh held a meeting with other officials to ensure that the food is of good quality at the centres. Officials were also asked to make sure that hygiene is maintained in the premises.By Tuesday night, the health department had put 1,310 people under surveillance. A total of 1,556 samples have been collected so far. A total of 80 cases have come out positive, while 25 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-new-hotspots-identified-in-gb-nagar-admin-intensifies-surveillance-in-slums/story-ZFNCtu7FEp0ZJYia9LDiBO.html

However, a 53-year-old woman from Supertech Capetown was found positive for Sars-CoV-2 virus on Tuesday, taking the total number of positive cases to 80 in the district, officials said. The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida discharged five patients on Tuesday afternoon, six patients were released by Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital in Noida Sector 30. In total, 25 patients have been discharged till now in the district. According to the officials, of 26 Covid-19 patients at GIMS, 17 have been discharged. On Saturday, two discharged patients were called back after their third sample report came positive following a technical glitch at the Aligarh Muslim University’s laboratory. However, one of the two patients was discharged again on Tuesday. Dr Saurabh Shrivastava, head of medicine department at GIMS who is also heading the team of doctors treating Covid-19 patients, suggests that giving medicines to asymptomatic patients have resulted in their early recovery. “Most of hospitals are not giving medicines to asymptomatic patients, but we have been doing that. We have given medicines to all our asymptomatic patients which resulted in early recovery. In the tests conducted after a week, we have got the viral clearance of the patients which means we stopped the infection within seven days,” he said. The authorities at GIMS are expecting to discharge remaining nine patients in the coming days. “We are expecting that in coming few days all our remaining patients will be discharged. If the viral clearance comes in one week, then still the patient is supposed to be in the hospital for two weeks as per the protocol,” added Shrivastva.Patients are being given hydroxychloroquine for one week and Tamiflu for five days in the first week. If the viral clearance report is negative, then only hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are given in the second week, the officials said.Meanwhile, the woman who was found positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday is linked to the chain of Ceasefire company in Sector 135. Till now, 51 persons have been found positive for the infection with direct or indirect links to Ceasefire. On late Monday night, GB Nagar witnessed 16 new Covid-19 cases which included a person from Delhi who had links with Ceasefire. The Delhi resident will not be counted in GB Nagar, although he is being treated in Noida, the officials said. This was highest number of positive cases found in one day in the district since the outbreak started on March 12.Of the 16 cases, nine linked to Ceasefire are from sectors 5 and 8, two are members of Tablighi Jamaat from Kulesra village in Greater Noida, three from a private hospital in Sector 62, one health care professional, while the source of infection of a girl from Eta Sector, Greater Noida is yet to be found out.“All the persons who have been found positive were already under quarantine at our government centres which shows that our strategy is working. We have been keeping people under quarantine who are primary or secondary connections of the infected persons,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.The district administration received over 250 reports on Monday. All the reports have come from the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) in Sector 62.

In her complaint, she alleged that her social media account was hacked and that her profile photograph was photoshopped and garlanded. Several social media posts, using her photoshopped image, went viral, claiming that she died as a “corona warrior” while treating patients in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.The woman claimed that her family in Ghaziabad is in a state of mental distress as they have been receiving hundreds of calls since the posts became viral. In one of the posts, the victim, Vandana Tiwari’s picture was seen garlanded and the accompanying text mentioned that she left behind a 3-year-old child.“Initially my sister in Nepal came across one of the posts and she called me on April 10. I was shocked to see that the post has gone viral over different social media platforms. Since then, I have been receiving calls from various acquaintances,” said Tiwari, who is a consultant assistant professor of Sanskrit in DU.She also said that she is now facing a tough time in proving that she is alive and that the post is not related to her in any way. Pradeep Tiwari, her husband, who is a mediaperson, said that ever since the posts become viral the family is trying to find the real culprit behind the incident. “We came across a profile of a person who first shared the post. We contacted him through an online messenger and he apologised and removed the post. He even sent messages to his group members, saying that the post was fake. By that time, however, individuals, groups and politicians have shared the posts widely across various social media platforms,” Pradeep Tiwari, said.“The post with a garlanded picture of my wife mentioned that Dr Vandana Tiwari from Jain Colony, Indore, has left behind a three-year-old child. A friend of mine called me up from Gujarat and told us to be cautious. He said that some mischievous elements might take advantage of such posts and demand financial help from public. Finally, we approached the Indirapuram Police for help and submitted a written complaint,” he added.The officials of the Ghaziabad police said that they have registered a first information report(FIR) under the provisions of the IT Act, Section 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act.“The investigation is on. We have also approached social media companies and the posts will soon be removed,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer, Indirapuram.The family of the victim added that they also came across a viral post of a pharmacist with the same name, who had died in March in Madhya Pradesh, .When contacted on the issue of pharmacist Dr Vandana Tiwari, police officials from Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh, said that Tiwari was pharmacist, but was not involved in coronavirus treatment. “She was a pharmacist with Shivpuri Medical College and had developed some health complications after which her husband left with her for their home town in Gwalior on March 31. There, she was treated at a hospital but died on April 7 owing to brain haemorrhage,” said Rajesh Singh Chandel, superintendent of police of Shivpuri. After the death of pharmacist Vandana Tiwari, several social media posts went viral in which a woman was shown lying in an ICU ward of a hospital. The posts mentioned that the woman had gone to Uttar Pradesh for a coronavirus test but was attacked by a mob after which she died.The Uttar Pradesh Police, through its twitter handle @Uppolice, on April 9, refuted this post, stating that the death of Vandana Tiwari was related to Madhya Pradesh and had no connection with UP. The cyber cell of the Agra police was also directed to take action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-posts-claiming-death-of-a-du-professor-go-viral-fir-registered/story-OZfq57o7AHcXXLzVQFMSTN.html

14-04-2020||Lucknow||Undeterred by lockdown, these women are making masks to earn a living||In a bid to support their families financially amid lockdown which has stopped sand mining and stone quarry work in trans-Yamuna area, some women of these tribal and other marginalised communities have come forward to earn a living instead of depending merely on government assistance. A large population in trans-Yamuna area depends on sand mining and stone quarries where they work as labourers. However, with all mining activities coming to a grinding halt following the lockdown, labourers are facing a threat of survival.Even before the lockdown when there were few cases of coronavirus in the country and masks were fast disappearing from the markets, some women working in self-help groups were manufacturing them to distribute them to migrant labourers and members of their marginalised communities free of cost, said social activist Subedar Singh of trans-Yamuna area.The women started manufacturing masks in bulk for commercial purposes a week ago, Singh added.Singh said at present there were over 50 women in Meja, Koraon, Lohgara and Ghoorpur areas belonging to Kol tribe, Mushars and boatmen communities who were manufacturing masks at their homes. These women worked in small groups in their respective areas and each group made some two hundred masks a day, Singh added. “The manufactured masks are collected and supplied to local markets by another group of women. The women engaged in manufacturing and supply of masks belong to extremely marginalised sections and are mostly illiterate,” Singh added.“Each mask costs Rs 10 in market which is much cheaper than other masks available,” says Shivangi who leads a group of 10 women in Lohgara area.“We arrange cloth, elastic, thread and other raw material from nearby markets and distribute work among ourselves as per our skills,” Shivangi, a member of Kol tribal community, said.“Reeta, Reema, Kanchan and other women of Mushar community in Meja area were worried after the lockdown but have now found work at their home. We take care that there is lesser assembly of women and women mostly work from home,” says their group leader Ruby.Similarly, Sneha Sagar is leading the women of boatmen community in Ghoorpur and adjoining areas after men of the community were rendered jobless following the sudden lockdown on March 25.“Women of marginalised communities are not only saving people from coronavirus infection by manufacturing masks in bulk but are also earning a living for their families,” says volunteers of a self-help group Akriti and Sudha.Social activist Subedar Singh said some NGOs and social organisations of the city had approached the women and had taken samples of the masks manufactured by them. “Once receiving the nod from them, more women would be engaged in manufacturing of masks that will be purchased by these organisations to be distributed free in the cities as well,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/undeterred-by-lockdown-these-women-are-making-masks-to-earn-a-living/story-FRsoFr9gONtHfOJXzXojmI.html

14-04-2020||Mumbai||Festivals celebrated with caution amid pandemic||As the nationwide lockdown continued on Tuesday, the Sikh community in the city opted for a subdued Baisakhi festivities with religious ceremonies with a limited number of people at gurudwaras.Earlier the community had planned grand Baishaki celebrations wherein three groups from Amritsar were expected to be in Mumbai for the celebrations. However, after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the event was cancelled.Manmohan Singh, general secretary of Sri Guru Singh Sabha, popularly known as Dadar Gurudwara, which the apex body of gurudwaras in Mumbai, said that ever since March 20, they have reached out to around more than 1.5 lakh people, which includes patients in government hospitals and needy across the city, at places such as Antop Hill, Chembur and Mankhurd, among others.The volunteers prepare meals at Dadar Gurudwara and give it to the civic body to distribute at hospitals and to local NGOs to feed the poor.“It is Baisakhi every day because just as our Guru said that needy should be fed, true Guru ka langar is being served to those who actually need it,” said Singh.Bengali community, which celebrated Bengali new year Pohela Boishakh on Tuesday, was hoping to conduct religious prayers on Akshay Tritiya on April 26, had the lockdown been called off on Tuesday.Debashish Chatterjee, a Mulund resident, said, “Every year businessmen conduct Ganesh puja to mark the starting of new account books and calendars for Bengali businessmen. However, this year they conduced prayers at home instead of gathering together.”“A lot of people go for celebrations organised by jewellers and purchase token jewellery to mark the new year. But, this year it was difficult to even get sweets. We brought a packed tin of rasgolla as fresh ones were not available,” said Chatterjee.The other festivals that were celebrated on Tuesday include Tamil New year Puthandu, Odia new year Pana Sankranti, Assamese new year Bohag Bihu and Malayalam new year Vishu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/festivals-celebrated-with-caution-amid-pandemic/story-1RibydNeJrISm4o2fZcSNP.html
14-04-2020||City||Mercury crosses 40°C in parts of Delhi, dusty winds from Rajasthan hit air quality||New Delhi: As the maximum temperature on Tuesday crossed the 40°Celsius-mark in parts of Delhi, strong gusts carrying dust from the western parts of India pushed the national Capital’s air quality deeper into the “moderate” category on Tuesday.The overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi stood at 130 — in the ‘moderate’ category — on Tuesday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, an increase from Monday’s 126. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the spike in pollution was due to strong winds from west and north Rajasthan bringing dust into the city. A senior CPCB official said parts of Rajasthan had received rain last week, but that the temperature in the state had crossed 40°C over the last two or three days. Since the heat has led to water in the soil evaporating, the soil itself has become loose and is being easily carried by the wind, which is present blowing in Delhi’s direction.“That is why the spike is in PM10 (dust particles of diameters less than 10 micrometres) levels. PM2.5 (ultra-fine particles of diameters less than 2.5 micrometres) levels have not shown much variation,” the CPCB official said.System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), the Union ministry’s weather and air quality monitoring centre, predicted that this dust will deteriorate Delhi’s air quality further, into the lower range of ‘poor’ zone, by Wednesday.“Though chances of any heavy dust storm are remote, long-range dust transport from the dry and arid western region is expected by April 15 to further deteriorate air quality towards the lower end of the poor category, with PM10 the lead pollutant. This impact is purely attributed to external natural dust, and has nothing to do with local emissions,” said a spokesperson from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change.The PM10 levels shot up from 99.4ug/m3 at 1 am on Monday to 138.3ug/m3 at 6pm on Tuesday, while PM2.5 levels rose from 39.3ug/m3 to 54.4ug/m3 in the same period. Meanwhile, the city’s mercury levels also shot up. According to the IMD, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, considered the official marking for the entire city, was 39.7 °C, four degrees higher than the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 23.2° C, two degrees above normal.Meanwhile, the maximum temperatures at the Palam and Aya Nagar weather stations crossed the 40°C-mark on Monday. At Palam, the maximum temperature was recorded 41.2°C, and the minimum was 24.1°C. At Aya Nagar, the maximum settled at 40.4 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature data at Aya Nagar station was unavailable.IMD scientists said temperatures are likely to remain in the same range on Wednesday, after which there will be a marginal drop in the maximum temperature.“From Thursday, there is a possibility of overcast skies, with chances of scanty rain in some parts. There is also a forecast of a western disturbance crossing Delhi on April 17.

On Tuesday, 14 staffers and party workers of Awhad tested positive.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of Thane Municipal Corporation, said, “Six people tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. The NCP leader has also tested positive and we are testing his close contacts.”Paranjpe confirmed the news that he has tested positive. He told HT, “I got myself tested yesterday. I do not have any symptoms but have been admitted at a private hospital in Thane.” His family members too are undergoing tests and are quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncp-leader-anand-paranjpe-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-1JsyObdZEfaWeURrRTZHYJ.html
14-04-2020||Chandigarh||After PGIMER, Chandigarh admn to discontinue sanitisation tunnels amid health concerns||Following in the footsteps of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, the UT administration has decided to remove two disinfection tunnels already installed and stall three other proposed tunnels.The PGIMER, in a statement issued on Tuesday, had stated that disinfectant tunnels were not only harmful but also created a false sense of security.Two tunnels were set up at the Sector 26 grain market and at the municipal corporation office in Sector 17, with three more such installations in the pipeline. Around ₹8 lakh were spent on the 16-ft long one at the grain market and ₹30,000 on MC tunnel.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “We had sought an opinion from the PGIMER regarding the use of disinfectant tunnels. After their recommendation, we will remove the tunnels already installed in the city.”Chairman of the Covid-19 Prevention and IEC (information, education communication) Committee, PGIMER, JS Thakur said, “Initially it was believed that a tunnel that sprays a diluted mist of sodium hypochlorite solution will work like a mass disinfectant, that is, we can disinfect a large number of people. But now, it has been discovered that the use of these tunnels gives a false sense of security and may have adverse health effects on the human body.”Sodium hypochlorite is a chlorine compound often used as a disinfectant or a bleaching agent.Thakur added that spraying alcohol or chlorine all over the body will not kill viruses that have already entered the body. “How will a surface disinfectant stop the virus from spreading from human to human, and how will it kill a virus already in the body? We need to think about this.”According to the World Health Organization (WHO), disinfectants will work on surfaces, but not on the human body. In a public advisory, WHO stated, “Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes in the eyes, and mouth. Beware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.”HARMFUL EFFECTSAlthough a 0.5 percent solution of hypochlorite known as Dakin solution is used for disinfecting areas contaminated with bodily fluids, including large blood spills, a higher concentration of sodium hypochlorite (5%) exposure may cause nasal and ocular irritation, sore throat and coughing.A stronger concentration (10-15%) can cause serious damages including burning pain, redness, swelling and blisters, damage to the respiratory tract as well as the esophagus, serious eye damage, stomach ache, a burning sensation, diarrhea and vomiting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-pgimer-chandigarh-admn-to-discontinue-sanitisation-tunnels-amid-health-concerns/story-8xp3jOqGdIrl0PlbiK05XK.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||As lockdown gets longer, stricter policing in lanes, colonies||Enforcement on lockdown and social distancing norms will get stricter across Delhi from Wednesday, senior Delhi Police officers told Hindustan Times. Police officers will now make more visits into residential neighbourhoods to ensure people follow the curbs, and that apart from the main roads, the focus also be on local markets and parks within colonies. “Two station house officers (SHO) have already been suspended. The message is clear. Either ensure people maintain social distance, or be ready to face the consequences,” an officer said. Two SHOs, of Amar Colony and Bara Hindu Rao police stations, were transferred on Friday for failing to ensure social distancing norms in their respective jurisdictions. The officer said police have also been made aware of reports of crowding in neighbourhood parks and playgrounds. “Every police station area is divided into many beats, and each beat has a constable. The constables have been told that they are responsible for the crowding in their respective beat. They will visit the parks and corners to check if people are gathering in groups,” another senior police officer, who chose to stay anonymous, said. “Beginning Wednesday, they will first take a round of their beats on their motorcycles and request residents not to crowd. They will also help residents if there is an emergency. But if people still gather and do not maintain social distance, the police officers will act against them,” the officer quoted above said. Another senior police officer said while the force, till Tuesday, conducted checks and focused on main roads across the city, their focus would also be on Delhi’s several shelter homes, where thousands of migrant workers and others are lodged.The officer said police have received reports of crowding in several shelter homes. “Many such homes are sheltering people well beyond their capacity. There are several people lodged in shelter homes in Dwarka and Kashmere Gate in north Delhi. Police officers will now be posted around-the-clock at shelters to ensure that they follow social distancing norms. We will post an adequate number of officers to ensure a social distance is maintained. Our officers on the ground are also in touch with government representatives at the shelters,” said a police officer, who asked to be kept anonymous. For stricter compliance of social distancing, all police stations across the city have spoken to Market Welfare Associations, and discussed opening retail shops in colonies in a staggered manner. In local markets at East of Kailash, CR Park, Sarita Vihar and New Friends Colony for instance, retail shops will be shuttered before 6pm to avoid rush in the evenings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-lockdown-gets-longer-stricter-policing-in-lanes-colonies/story-6y88liMvZH4r8lWlrm0HtN.html
14-04-2020||Mumbai||Sanitiser tunnels, military drones to keep police safe||With hundreds of Covid-19 cases being reported in the city daily, Mumbai Police is taking several measures to ensure safety of their forces. From erecting sanitising tunnels at police stations looking after hotspots, to putting up tents for personnel to rest, and providing military drones to monitor containment zones, a slew of steps are being taken. According to Maharashtra Police, 23 positive cases in forces in the state were reported till Tuesday, of which 12 were reported from Mumbai Police, 10 from Thane, and one from Mumbai Railway police. Another 47 personnel from the state (five officers and 42 constables) have been home quarantined.Mumbai Police have erected sanitising tunnels at the police stations looking after Covid-19 hotspots. “The tunnel will spray sanitiser on the police personnel passing through it. Any cop who comes back after bandobast duty has to compulsorily pass through it to ensure he does not contract the disease,” said a police officer.Vinoy Kumar Choubey, joint commissioner of police (law and order) said, “Around 35-40 sanitizing tunnels have been erected at those stations where maximum cases of Covid-19 have been reported,” These tunnels are in addition to the earlier inducted five sanitising police vans.At many places in the city, tents have been erected for policemen to have brief rest periods during bandobast duty.Pranaya Ashok, deputy commissioner of police, operations, and spokesperson for Mumbai police confirmed the development and said,” We have distributed them with over 20,000 face shields, face masks, gloves, etc. We are also supplying rations to their families so they can fully concentrate on their duty.”Apart from the six audio-enabled drones being used to monitor containment zones while maintaining social distancing, as reported by HT earlier, now two more military drones are being used for patrolling. “These drones move faster and can hover for more hours,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sanitiser-tunnels-military-drones-to-keep-police-safe/story-dl6bwTAie0bKfkVYBtGN8O.html
14-04-2020||Mumbai||79% of those who died of Covid-19 had co-morbidities: State data||A total of 79% people who died of Covid-19 had co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, or blood pressure, according to a report by Maharashtra’s Medical Education and Drugs department based on Tuesday morning’s data from the health department.According to the data, 120 of the 152 who died had co-morbidities, while 32 didn’t have such existing conditions. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had reported on Monday that 87% of Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai were due to co-morbidity and 7-8% had age-related risk factors. According to data for Mumbai as on April 9, the maximum deaths were recorded in the 61-70 age group (22), followed by 51-60 age group (11), 71-80 age group (8), then 41-50 years (6). Experts said the main reasons for Covid-19 deaths in patients who don’t have co-morbidities are late diagnosis, low immunity and age-related issues linked to immunity. It also depends on the health of a person’s lungs, said experts.A city-based senior physician said, “In most cases of deaths without co-morbidities, we have noticed that Covid-19 was diagnosed in advanced stages. Symptoms of Covid-19 are very similar to normal flu symptoms. Patients who died were brought to the hospital just three or four days before the day they died.”Amit Deshmukh, Maharashtra minister for medical education, said, “The key to beating the infection is early detection of Covid-19. It is important not to ignore early mild symptoms or self-medicate at home with flu and body pain tablets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/79-of-those-who-died-of-covid-19-had-co-morbidities-state-data/story-8nWQZfDIcVxZ1laBEkpH4L.html
14-04-2020||Lucknow||UP: Won’t be able to pay salaries, say owners of 400 shut units||Due to closures of 95% factories and large dip in production due to lockdown, Chamber of Industries and Development (CID), an umbrella body of industries has expressed inability to continue paying salaries to hundreds of workers employed with 400 big and small factories in Gorakhpur Development Industrial Area(GIDA).The move could severely affect over 12,000 workers in the region.GIDA, which witnessed a record investment of Rs 1300 crore in UP government’s flagship investors’ summit in Lucknow in 2017, houses 400 big and small factories manufacturing range of goods from sanitary pads, medicine, syringes, iron rods, cement, biscuits and pan masala. These factories had open avenues for locals and had checked the migration in a big way.On Tuesday, Praveen Modi, general secretary, CID, shot off a letter to commissioner, industries and establishment department, Lucknow, saying the salaries could not be paid for the month of April.“The factories are hit hard by the lockdown. The raw material in stock is rotting and finished goods are lying dumped in absence of transport. Payment from the market is completely blocked . Owners have incurred loss of hundreds of crore of rupees and they are in no situation to pay salaries until things settles down and production resumes,” he said while fearing that many factories could shut permanently.Earlier, the administration had given permission to operate units involved in producing essential goods like breads, biscuits , medicine but the restriction on movement of workers, who come from outside and non access to passes hit the manpower and the production as well at these 5% functional units.Demand of salaries without work by workers at homes is also adding to the woes of factory owners, he said.Divisional commissioner Jayant Narlikar said, “We are waiting for new guidelines after extension of lockdown and if it has scope we will ensure functioning of essential goods factories by allowing workers to stay at the factories. As far as payment of salary is concerned I have issued a press release stating that wages of months of March should not be stopped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-won-t-be-able-to-pay-salaries-say-owners-of-400-shut-units/story-bOTDbJ8jYjUhKE4ZDZ7UMI.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal criticises those giving ‘communal colour’ to Tablighi incident||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said he would visit a few containment zones on Wednesday to understand the ground situation and hit out against those who sought to communalise the Tablighi Jamaat incident.With eight new pockets and localities added to the list, Delhi now has 55 containment zones, which are areas that are under strict surveillance to ensure complete quarantine. Movement of people inside these zones is severely restricted and there will be door-to-door health checks and periodic disinfection.“Any place with three or more cases have been marked as containment zones in Delhi. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has been monitoring the situation. I will visit a few of them tomorrow for a review of the situation from the perspective of the residents,” said the chief minister in a video conference. He said that a team of around 14,000 people are conducting door-to-door health checks, enforcing surveillance and delivering essentials. Kejriwal said, “Delhi also has the burden of those who came from abroad. Of all the states, Delhi received the maximum people who returned from other countries. Another reason was the Tablighi Jamaat.”Tablighi jamaat Kejriwal said it was a matter of concern that certain people were communalising the pandemic.He said, “It saddens me that in the time of the pandemic, there are still people who are trying to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims. I observe on social media that even in times when the whole world is in distress, people are trying to create a rift between the two communities, by posting hate videos and content. We can only move ahead and overcome obstacles if we stand united.“All the anti-social elements who are sowing seeds of hatred in the minds and hearts of the people are not only working against nature but also against our nation. Our country can only progress if all the religions, caste, and states work together and stand united. That is the only way that we can fight against the pandemic,” he said. On Monday, the city government started a sanitisation programme in which it engaged 10 Japanese hi-tech machines and jet machines of the Delhi Jal Board to spray disinfectants in containment zones, buffer areas and high-risk areas. On Tuesday, Kejriwal said that the sanitation drive will continue for the extended period.Food centres mapped The around 1,000 night shelters and food distribution centres of the Delhi government can be located on digital maps. The Delhi government has tied up with Google and Map My India to help direct people to these centres. “As we prepare for an extended lockdown, we are proud to work together with Google Maps India in ensuring easy accessibility of all our food and night shelters. We are committed to doing everything possible to make life easy for those most affected by the lockdown,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-criticises-those-giving-communal-colour-to-tablighi-incident/story-4PtF7LpELYUKspMrPShUeO.html
14-04-2020||Mumbai||Have developed compound that has potential to kill virus: Researchers||Researchers from a Bengaluru-based institute have developed a compound that may potentially kill the Sars-Cov-2 virus on any surface. Sars-Cov-2 is the strain of coronavirus that causes Covid-19.A team of scientists from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (InStem) and other research institutes in Bengaluru are developing new disinfection technology; efficient sampling and new pooled testing methods; and technologies to screen potential drugs to treat the virus.Among these is a compound developed at Instem’s lab, which potentially kills the virus on any surface. “The indigenously-designed compound when stitched on masks, coats and other protective gear acts as a disinfectant and neutralises the virus,” said Praveen Vemula, one of the principal investigators and a member of the faculty at InStem. “Recent studies have shown the virus can stay alive on a mask for a week to a couple of days. The compound-embedded personal protective equipment can be washed and reused at least 25 times,” he said. Efforts are currently on to identify industry partners to scale up production of the compound and InSteam is discussing whether or not to file a patent for their product.While Covid-19 pooled testing is being developed owing to an acute shortage of reagents for the manufacture and procurement of Covid-19 diagnostic test kits, developing a rapid colour-based assay for point-of-care Covid-19 detection is also underway. With research suggesting that anosmia – loss of sense-of-smell – is a symptom of Covid-19, NCBS scientists have proposed an olfactory test for anosmia to identify potential Covid-19 clusters and high-risk individuals.Satyajit Major, director of NCBS, said “Wanting to utilise our depth of expertise in the basic sciences, we decided to shift our thinking and efforts to try and mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic.” Other research projects include a rapid screening method of FDA-approved drugs that interfere with viral entry and processing; a study to ascertain if existing antivirals for other coronaviridae infections can be repurposed; and developing mathematical models on the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/have-developed-compound-that-has-potential-to-kill-virus-researchers/story-fYD5hyh3D9mDSrXrpj7n7I.html

14-04-2020||Delhi||Create new system to hear more cases during lockdown: lawyers tell Delhi HC||With several lawyers backing for courts to function during the lockdown, the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) has written to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice requesting for a system where more hearings can take place in matters to obviate public suffering. KC Mittal, chairman of the BCD, says that video conferencing is not feasible for many lawyers and that such wide infrastructure did not exist. He said that several lawyers have written to him to get the courts functional due to financial constraints. “We know many (people) are languishing in jails. They are not able to approach the court for bail, and in many cases, where application were moved prior to lockdown, are pending consideration, but not being listed. There are many such applications where notices have been issued to state, but are not being taken up and consequently, the person remains incarcerated. Similarly, in other matters, where urgent hearing is required, in cases of interim relief, matters are not being taken up,” he wrote to Chief justice DN Patel.The BCD suggested that even if a regular hearing is not possible, some broad parameters and adequate protecting measures may be introduced to hold few courts, by restricting and regulating the entry of advocates through a protective mechanism in the courts so that minimum possible work can be undertaken. “Since most of the advocates are not in a position to avail videoconferencing facility fully, it may also be considered to set up App or any mechanism to give effect to hearing in more matters,” it said.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi High Court had suspended its work along with that of the subordinate judiciary. Most urgent matters are being heard by only a couple of judges through video conferencing. Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa said that although the lockdown is understandable, it has paralysed the entire criminal justice system. “We have to enhance the use of technology in the day to day functioning of the courts. Efforts towards this are being made, but they are not enough. More judges must hear the cases by videoconferencing. We must start hearing cases which are urgent (and not only extremely urgent). We have to liberalise the process of listing so that more cases are cleared for hearing. Our endeavour must be to achieve hearing via video conferencing by all the Judges at the earliest. The state government should also allocate more funds for upgrading the eCourts in Delhi,” he said.Manish Bhadoria, a lawyer practising at the Karkardooma court, said that the opening of the courts with certain restrictions would ease the pressure of cases and would also help the advocates to be financially viable.“A large chunk of the lawyers practising at the Karkardooma court are daily earning lawyers. Due to this lockdown, their problems have increased and opening of the courts might bring some respite to them,” he said.“In the last 21 days of the lockdown, I have appeared in several bail matters of those arrested in the north-east riots. I visited the court 10-12 times for the hearing since getting a matter listed at the court is a tedious process. Even when it is done, the video conferencing happens only with the cell phones of the court staff who comes for the Duty Magistrate,” Bhadoria added.Advocate Sanjoy Ghose, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, said that even though the courts should start functioning it might not be practically possible with the public transport not plying.“Many lawyers, as well as the litigants, are dependent on public transport. The courts cannot function without the assistance of the court staff who would not be able to reach the courts. So it might not be viable to start the functioning of the courts even though several important matters are not being heard due to the lockdown,” he said.Advocate Mahavir Sharma, chairman of the coordination committee of the Delhi District Courts, said that they would wait for the directive of the Delhi High Court and decide on the further course of action. The Delhi High Court is likely to issue an official statement in the evening today.Meanwhile, a judge at the Rohini court complex heard matters over phone and dictated the order over the speaker of the phone since the parties did not have the video conferencing facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/create-new-system-to-hear-more-cases-during-lockdown-lawyers-tell-delhi-hc/story-SgHLEzsJcZEF66C3si4jnJ.html

Meanwhile, the latest data released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) showed G-South ward, which covers Haji Ali, Mahalaxmi Racecourse, Worli, Lower Parel, Currey Road, Elphinstone Road and Saat Rasta, has recorded the highest number of cases (308).Dharavi reported the first case on April 1, a 56-year-old garment shop owner, who succumbed to the infection. The civic authorities swung into action, targeting high-risk as well as low-risk contacts. By April 9, Dharavi recorded 17 positive cases. The BMC has created a total of 29 containment zones to restrict public movement in the area. “Cases are increasing day by day, but this is the result of our proactive search operation of high-risk contacts and testing methods. We have successfully tracked 1,381 high-risk contacts and 3,450 low-risk contacts to avoid further spread of the disease,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner, G-North Ward (which covers the area). Around 2,184 people from Dharavi have been home quarantined, said officials. There are reports that people are not cooperating with the authorities, saying they are more afraid of losing their jobs.The 240-hectare slum pocket has 850,000 residents and a population density of 66,000 per sqkm, making it one of the more cramped spaces in Mumbai, the world’s fifth most densely populated city. Activists and health workers had expressed concerns over how social distancing is practically impossible in an area where an average of 10-12 people stay in each of 57,000 housing units measuring around 250 sq ft.Following the G-South ward is the E ward (Byculla) with 125 cases, D ward (Malabar Hill, Walkeshwar) with 107 cases, M-East (Govandi, Mankhurd) with 86 cases, and H-East (Bandra, Khar, Santacruz) with 85 cases. Considering the urgent need of hiring medical staff including doctors, nurses, lab technicians, ward boys and other paramedical staff, the BMC on Tuesday came up with a notification to fill up required posts on an urgent basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dharavi-s-covid-19-case-count-touches-55/story-WMe2xjSC2NmsKZMo3mO7TI.html

14-04-2020||Mumbai||Seven districts have no case of Covid-19 so far||While Maharashtra has reported the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, seven districts in the state – Parbhani, Nandurbar, Nanded, Wardha, Bhandara, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli – have not reported a single case so far. Local authorities are now adopting safety measures like organising door-to-door surveys; quarantining people with international travel history; treating those with respiratory problems; home delivering essentials; setting up mobile clinics; disinfecting vehicles entering the district; and restricting the supply of produce from districts affected by the virus. This is in addition to the lockdown restrictions imposed by the state government.Under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, the state government has empowered district collectors to take decisions they feel are necessary to contain the coronavirus outbreak.Parbhani collector Deepak Mugalikar said his district borders were sealed even before the decision by the state government. “We chose to seal the border on March 11. With the help of asha and anganwadi workers, door-to-door surveys were carried out of 2.5 lakh houses in the city and around 30,000 houses in villages. With this, we could identify 62 people who had travelled abroad but did not report to the local authorities. They were quarantined at government facilities and all tested negative. Also, 1,150 people with respiratory problems were identified, of whom 750 who needed treatment were admitted to hospital and treated,” Mugalikar said.“Around 36,000 people who have come from cities such as Mumbai and Pune were also home quarantined for 14 days. Vegetable markets were divided into several sections and a mobile application is being used for home delivery of essentials. People have to put in their demand and we ensure they get the items at home,” he said.In Parbhani, 333 people were tested and 289 reports came back negative. Test reports of the remaining 35 people are still pending.Vipin Itankar, district collector of Nanded said they identified 70,000 people who had come from different cities and were quarantined for 14 days. “With the help of asha and anganwadi workers, we are still conducting regular medical check-ups of these people as we have heard that a person can test positive even after 14 days. We have also set up 14 fever clinics and one mobile clinic to test people having symptoms of cough, cold, and fever,” Itankar said. Those who have returned from abroad were also quarantined and tested negative. In Nanded, medical check-ups are being conducted on those entering the district with supplies of essential commodities, Itankar added.Wardha collector Vivek Bhimanwar said that they are strictly following social distancing in the district by dividing two major vegetable markets across 18 open grounds. “All the crowded places are being monitored by a dedicated officer. Around 16,000 people who have come from cities like Pune and Mumbai have been home quarantined and visited twice in a day by dedicated staff. Also, 230 people who had travelled abroad were quarantined at government facilities and were tested. Test reports of around 160 people have come back negative,” Bhimanwar said. The districts adjoining Wardha, such as Nagpur and Yavatmal, have reported Covid-19 cases.

14-04-2020||City||42-year-old woman found murdered in Ludhiana’s BRS Nagar||A 42-year-old woman was found murdered on Tuesday at I block of Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, a posh locality in Ludhiana.The victim, identified as Geeta Rani, used to run a book store in Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar market. Police said, “On Tuesday morning, Geeta’s domestic help, who came to fetch money from her, spotted her body. She found the main door of the house open and Geeta lying dead on the floor with a polythene bag around her face. She raised alarm and informed the landlord, who lives on the ground floor of the house. Later, the police were called on.”According to the police, the woman was murdered two days ago, but the landlord was unaware about it.“The woman lived alone in a rented accommodation as her husband, who works in a private company in Hyderabad, used to visit her in a month or so. She was earlier living in Hyderabad and had relocated here eight months ago,” police said, adding that it was their second marriage after they had met on a social networking site. They got married a year ago and had strained relations. Since no valuables were found missing from the house, police suspect rivalry behind the murder.They have been scanning CCTV cameras installed in the locality.“It is suspected that the woman has been suffocated to death, but the things will be clear only after the postmortem report comes. Two or more people can be involved in the murder. Before suffocating her to death, the assailants have hit on her head with some blunt weapon, there were marks around her neck also,” assistant commissioner of police (ACP, West) Sameer Verma said.Victim’s brother Hemant Verma, a resident of Noorwala road, told police that his younger brother Lokesh Verma informed him about the incident on Tuesday morning, following which he rushed to the spot.The Sarabha Nagar police have registered a case against unidentified accused under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.Meanwhile, there was panic in the area when the locals spotted the police personnel wearing personal protection kits in the locality. They thought the woman has died due to coronavirus infection. Later, the police informed that it was a murder.Fourth murder after the lockdown After the lockdown, it is the fourth murder in Ludhiana. Three cases have been solved by the police.On March 23: A courier company employee killed his colleague with bamboo stick and iron rod at their office on Gill Road.On March 29: Suspecting his wife of infidelity, a labourer murdered his wife in Gahi Bhaini village. On April 3: A salesman of a liquor vend was hacked to death in Chapki village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/42-year-old-woman-found-murdered-in-ludhiana-s-brs-nagar/story-WtPqvzeWtOTjLIRlor0DoK.html
14-04-2020||Lucknow||UP to send local migrants back home; those from other states will stay||Hours after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to extend the lockdown till May 3, the Uttar Pradesh government cleared the air on sending back home over 1.25 lakh migrants lodged in over 5,000 shelter homes across the state.“The migrants who have completed 14 days of quarantine will be permitted to leave for home after their health check-up. Those who have not finished the quarantine time will have to wait. The migrants from other states will stay wherever they are till the lockdown is in force. The health department will screen all of them and the revenue department will give them food packets similar to what flood victims are given,” said Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary, Home.Chief minister Yogi Adiyanath, while announcing his government’s intention of exploring partial relaxation in lockdown in some sectors on Sunday had said that the migrants who have completed the stipulated quarantine period would be sent home with an advisory for another 14-day quarantine at their homes.On Monday, he said that the health teams in host districts would first do their health checkup and the district administration will make lists of people (with their names and proper addresses) before sending them off to their home districts. Back home, the district’s administration will keep surveillance on them for another 14 days.A state government said: “We will play a good host to migrants. We will drop them home. They cannot go home on their own because public transport continues to be off-roads.”After the lockdown on March 24 when all public transport system had come to a grinding halt, a large number of UP migrants in other states had started making mass movement.They reached bordering districts--with the majority at Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi.Migrants walking home long-distance turned a phenomenon and public outrage. The state government then decided to press in 1,000 buses, brought in 2.7 lakh migrants from outside UP and also transported nearly 1.7 lakh, inter-districts migrants. By the time the Central government ordered to seal the borders, most of these transported migrants had reached their homes. And remaining 1.3 lakh were lodged in 5,200 shelter homes across the state.However, the migrants who are in UP, but belong to the other states, will continue to stay at the shelter homes and same is the case with the UP migrants who are stranded in other states.The state government, last month had appointed nodal officers for different states who will coordinate with those states where UP migrants are stranded and organise for their well being in the shelter homes in those states.A UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) officer said we had not started preparing for the migrants ride home but will announce as soon as we get a green signal to operate.Another officer said the decision had been taken about sending the migrants home but the procedures that had to be followed will take some time.Lucknow Division Commissioner, Mukesh Meshram said: “We will start processing their departure formalities as they complete their 14 days quarantine cycle. Because, on reaching home, they have to be in home quarantine, we have worked out food packets for them. Each food packet will have 10 kg wheat flour, 10 kg rice, 5 kg pulses, 5 kg potato, oil, 250 gram each of chilli, turmeric, salt, and sugar. This is enough for a family for fourteen days, but in case they exhaust it before 14 days, then the respective district administration will make one more supply to them.”The district administration and panchayat will keep an eye on the heath and quarantine of the migrants for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-to-send-local-migrants-back-home-those-from-other-states-will-stay/story-Psfy8NaT0fPtsjxhTYVcZP.html

As many as four of these beds are equipped with ventilators. Besides, arrangements for seven-bed high dependency unit (HDU) have also been made.For years, critically-ill patients have either been referred to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh, or Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, due to lack of proper ICU and ventilator facility. Around 30 medical staff, including four doctors, are currently working in the ICU. The strength of the staff will be increased with installation of more ventilators.Meanwhile, the doctors and paramedical staff are working round the clock in isolation wards and high risk areas in the hospital.

14-04-2020||Chandigarh||17 shops gutted in furniture market on Chandigarh-Mohali border||At least 17 shops were gutted in a fire that engulfed the Sector 53 furniture market late on Monday night. The blaze started at about 11 pm after what people reported sounded like a gas cylinder blast in the house of a migrant worker, police said.However, no casualties were reported as the area was deserted because of the curfew imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.“People say that they heard a blast which sounded like a cylinder explosion, which seems possible. However, we are verifying the claims. Petrochemicals kept outside the shops in large quantities also acted as a catalyst to the fire,” said a fireman, resting anonymity.About 11 fire tenders from across the city were pressed into service, but most of the shops with wooden furniture and furnishings were gutted by the time the flames were doused at about 4 pm on Tuesday morning.In 2018, Chandigarh police had registered an FIR following a complaint by market president Satish Bhandari’s son that the market had been deliberately set ablaze on December 11, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/17-shops-gutted-in-furniture-market-on-chandigarh-mohali-border/story-aK0YSm8C72iia3YBIGqD8O.html
14-04-2020||City||Admn disallows use of sanitisation tunnels in city||With the state government discouraging the use of sanitisation tunnels stating that the chemical being used can be harmful for the body and that tunnels also create a false sense of security, the district administration has decided to wrap up the operations of the tunnels installed at the premises of different government departments.The tunnels, which were earlier installed at the municipal corporation (MC) headquarters (Zone A office), civil hospital and the mini-secretariat, which houses the deputy Commissioner’s (DC) office, the police commissioner’s office and key offices of the administration, are now being made dysfunctional.Administration officials said, apart from harmful effects of the tunnels, the major concern of the government is that the people were having a false sense of security after moving through these tunnels and they might get diverted from washing their hands and other precautionary measures.The department of health and family welfare had, on Monday, citing the advisory of the World Health Organisation (WHO), issued directions to the DCs that the tunnel should not be used as it creates a false sense of security among residents. Also, alcohol and chlorine, used in the tunnels, can be harmful for mucous membrane. Further, sodium hypochlorite solution is recommended for sanitisation of surfaces and instruments.While the tunnel was made operational at the DC office last week, it was established at the MC headquarters a few days ago.A tunnel had also been installed at Gurdwara Manji Sahib in Alamgir village. The administration officials have appealed to residents to avoid using the tunnel and take all necessary precautions and maintain hand hygiene.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said the aim of the government to divert the public from using the tunnels is that the tunnels create a false sense of security. It is possible that the person is not properly sanitised in the tunnel and he might spread the disease. The public should take all the precautions and should maintain hand hygiene to avoid infection.‘NEED TO FIND ALTERNATE DISINFECTANT’“Rather than dumping the idea of installing disinfectant tunnels just due to the use of a chemical – sodium hypochlorite – the state government should work to find an alternative solution/chemical to disinfect human bodies in tunnels,” said Jatin Sood, owner of the Royal Group of Industries, Mandi Gobingarh, who had supplied the tunnels in different parts of Punjab and has been getting orders from other states, including Haryana and Himachal as well.Samrala industrialist Harjeet Singh, who had installed the tunnel at the MC headquarters, said the tunnels were being used by different countries and rather than scrapping the project, the government should find an alternative to sodium hypochlorite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/admn-disallows-use-of-sanitisation-tunnels-in-city/story-TkGyfwYtTuVFhjF2eouKEN.html

High-risk zones, where N-95 masks, gloves, coveralls, goggles, head and shoe cover are provided, include the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) section, Covid-19 sample and testing centres, the ICU/critical care ward, and the isolation ward.In moderate-risk areas, where only N95 masks are provided, include the triage area in the OPD, some parts of the emergency ward and doctors’ chambers in the few functional OPDs. Masks and gloves are being provided in low-risk areas.PGI director Jagat Ram said, “We have adequate stock of PPEs, masks, sanitizers and in this regard, a resource management committee for steady supply of goods and materials has already been constituted. All equipment is being provided as per the standard protocol, which is being updated as suggestions are received from departments and workers.”An official notice circulated in all departments reads that the it has come to notice of the director of the institute that the faculty members, nurses and other staff of the institute have publically conveyed that there is a shortage of safety gear and sought funds for the same.It further mentioned that none of the employees of the institute should request for donations and creation of funds by making contributions. Approval of the director should be invariably taken in such circumstances and non-compliance thereof may invite suitable disciplinary action, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-warns-docs-staff-against-creating-funds-for-ppe-purchase/story-ElzaihYuzuhm6SVJQFxaDP.html

Officials said the woman is a a post office employee and lives in Sector 15.It was on April 9, when three Panchkula men, who attended a Tablighi Jamaat event last month in Sikar, Rajasthan, tested positive for Covid-19, taking the count to five. The first two Panchkula Covid patients, a woman salon worker and a staff nurse, however, recovered and were discharged from the civil hospital in Sector 6 on April 11. With this, there are now four active cases in Panchkula. District nodal officer Dr Rajiv Narwal said the post office employee was admitted to hospital on April 11 with symptoms. Her blood samples were sent for testing but they were cancelled and the PGIMER lab in Chandigarh sought fresh blood samples.“The woman’s second sample tested positive. As per initial details, it has been learnt that she and her husband have stayed put at their residence and only went to the market for essential goods. We have also admitted her husband and his samples have been sent for testing,” said Dr Narwal.Officials said prima facie there has been no travel history.

14-04-2020||City||Working in the Times of Pandemic: ‘Virtual teaching has proved beneficial for students’||While the lockdown has slowed down life for many, Ravinder Kaur, a government school teacher, finds herself more occupied these days with taking virtual classes and attending household chores.42-year old Kaur, who teaches English and Social Studies in Government Senior Secondary School, Nurpur Bet, said, “I am looking forward to reopening of schools after normalcy returns so that I no longer have to be on phone all the time.” “Earlier, I used mobile only to take calls and, sometimes, to use the social media, but these days, I’m on phone throughout the day either checking the assignments sent by my students or clearing their queries. I hope, we collectively succeed in overcoming this situation and go back to the traditional way of teaching,” said Ravinder, who, presently, takes virtual classes for Classes 7, 8 and two batches of Class 10 (including a new batch of this session) from her school. Likewise, she also teaches around 100 meritorious students of Class 10 in the district in a separate session from 12 to 1 pm. These are the students, who have scored more than 95% in the pre-board exams and are being prepared for admission to meritorious schools.“Around 9 am, I give all my students the day’s assignments and check their work the very day. I inform them a day ahead if I have to take their test. All government teachers are trying their best to ensure that students keep in touch with their studies amid lockdown,” she said.Commenting on the effectiveness of the virtual teaching, Kaur said the medium comes with lots of loopholes and challenges, it has proved to be very beneficial for the students keen on continuing their studies even amid the lockdown.“A teacher always knows what potential every single child in a class carries. So, whenever I give students an assignment and an average performer sends back a precise answer without even a single mistake, I know it has been copied. I always call such students and tell them not to copy answers from the internet and try to attempt it on their own,” said Ravinder, sharing that virtual teaching does not provide a teacher an opportunity to form a rapport with the students and discipline that an ambience of the class provides and the process is largely mechanical. Kaur, who is a mother of a 13-year-old son, also spends her evening in cooking different delicacies.“I’m really fond of cooking, so I have been using my evening time in learning new dishes. Recently, I made an Arabic dessert, Umm Ali, which was liked by everyone in the family. I also tried my hand in making samosas and bundi laddoo,” shared Ravinder, who lives with her husband Mandeep Singh, mother-in–law Inderjit Kaur Bhatti and son in BRS Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-in-the-times-of-pandemic-virtual-teaching-has-proved-beneficial-for-students/story-HeoZuY3sitViyNkbAAUTPI.html

14-04-2020||Mumbai||Social distancing goes for toss in Bandra, ‘homesick’ migrants protest||Ignoring lockdown norms, over 1,000 migrant workers who earn daily wages gathered here on Tuesday demanding transport arrangements to go back to their native places, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the coronavirus-enforced curbs till May 3.The gathering in suburban Bandra, in violation of lockdown norms, created a potential law and order situation for an overstretched police force and the men in uniform resorted to mild force to scatter the crowd.A police official said the migrants, who assembled around 3 pm, were dispersed two hours later and have been assured accommodation and food till the lockdown lasts.In viral videos, police were seen resorting to mild cane-charge to disperse the migrants, who had gathered at the bus depot near the Bandra railway station in suburban Mumbai.Most of these migrant workers were from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bihar, and they reside in nearby slums and other areas on rent.Police authorities heaved a sigh of relief as no untoward incident occurred at the site, where more than 1,000 people were estimated to have been present.The daily wage earners were demanding arrangement of transport facilities so that they can go back to their native towns and villages.The gathering in Mumbai came close on the heels of a violent protest last week by migrant workers in Surat, who, too, were demanding that they be sent back to their native places.Daily wage workers have been rendered jobless ever since the lockdown was announced late last month to stem the spread of COVID-19, making their life a constant struggle.Though authorities and NGOs have made arrangements for their food, most of them want to go back to their native places to escape the hardship brought by the sweeping curbs on movement of people. Train and bus services were suspended as part of the lockdown exercise.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the migrant workers who gathered outside Bandra railway station might have expected that the PM would order reopening of state borders.They were told by the police that borders are not going to be opened and the situation was now under control, Deshmukh said.The migrants were assured that the state government will make arrangement of food and accommodation for them, following which the crowds dispersed, the minister said.The gathering triggered a blame-game between the Shiv Sena-led government and the opposition BJP.Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray blamed the Centre for the protest by the migrant workers and sought a road map to facilitate their journey back to their native places.In a series of tweets, Thackeray said, “The current situation in Bandra, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the union government not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home migrant labour.” “They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home,” Thackeray said. He said feedback from all migrant labour camps is similar - that these workers want to go back to their native places.“Many are refusing to eat or stay in these camps,” he said. Currently, more than six lakh people are housed in various shelter camps across Maharashtra, he added.Describing the Bandra gathering as an intelligence failure, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya said the state government should explain how so many people gathered at a spot despite the lockdown.BJP leader and former minister Ashish Shelar said the protest shows failure of the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in enforcing lockdown.Lockdown should be made successful because it is for the safety of people, who should be provided with foods and other essential commodities at their doorstep, Shelar said.Additional CP Manoj Sharma said, “These all are local residents. A large number of people reside in this locality (Bandra), no legal action has been taken yet.” According to a police official, the daily wage earners assembled at the bus depot and squatted on the road leading to the suburban railway station.Local Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique said this situation arose when people came to know about the lockdown extension.“This is not a government failure, because we are also monitoring the situation from the very beginning. I personally distributed essential commodities to more than 50,000 people.Under such a situation police should talk politely with the common man,” Siddique said.One of the labourers, who did not reveal his name, said, NGOs and local residents are providing food to migrant workers, but they want to go back to their native states as the lockdown has affected their source of livelihood.“Now, we don’t want food, we want to go back to our native place, we are not happy with the announcement (extending the lockdown),” he said.Asadullah Sheikh, who hails from from Malda in West Bengal, said, “We have spent our savings during the first phase of the lockdown. We have nothing to eat now, we just want to go back at our native place, the government should made arrangements for us.” Another labourer, Abdul Kayyun, said, “I am in Mumbai for last many years but have never seen such a situation. The government should start trains to shift us from here to our native place.” Hundreds of migrant workers took to the streets of Mumbra town in Thane district on Tuesday, demanding that they be sent to their hometowns in light of the COVID-19 lockdown, which has rendered them jobless.Workers, mostly from Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, who live in rented accommodations, claimed house-owners were demanding rent from them and they were unable to procure essentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-distancing-goes-for-toss-in-bandra-homesick-migrants-protest/story-s2IZyeWZ3yGqIoRgBAjRRJ.html

14-04-2020||Chandigarh||Curfew in Chandigarh extended till May 3, relaxation timings to be decided April 20||Following the Centre’s decision to extend the lockdown till May 3, the UT administration on Tuesday, decided to continue the curfew in tandem with the Centre.The development comes on a day when no fresh case of Covid-19 has been reported in the city, while two patients have recovered and were discharged from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. With this, the total number of active cases in the city, which has recorded 21 cases since March 18, stand at 12.The Chandigarh administration will also take a call on fresh restrictions or relaxations during the curfew, if any, on April 20, after examining the extent and frequency of coronavirus cases in the city.The decision was taken in the daily review meeting chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore. He urged residents to bear with the inconvenience in the larger interest of the country.Even as the administration debated over relaxations to be introduced during the curfew, a decision has been taken to implement Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of stricter enforcement till April 20, and not introduce any relaxations in this week. Badnore said the next week would prove extremely crucial and any relaxation at this stage will spoil the benefits accrued so far by maintaining strict curfew in the city. The curfew imposed on March 24, a day before the 21-day lockdown was announced from March 25 onwards.Significantly, while most states opted for a lockdown, Chandigarh, like Punjab, imposed a curfew. However, after it was slammed for failing to deliver essential commodities to the doorstep as promised, the administration had to introduce an eight-hour relaxation. Later, the relaxation period was halved to four hours from 11 am to 3pm. Any change in curfew relaxation timings will be examined next week.Reiterating that all restrictions should be enforced strictly, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, on Tuesday, wrote to the administration, stating, “With the extension of the lockdown, all restrictions imposed in various sectors and on various activities, will continue to remain in force. These restrictions, which have been spelt out in consolidated guidelines of ministry of home affairs, must be enforced strictly.” The letter further emphasised that the UT could not dilute restrictions imposed by the Centre. UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “We are already one-step ahead of the lockdown as we imposed a curfew. No additional restriction is needed at this point, but a review will be done on April 20.”Some instructions are still awaited from Government of India regarding benefits to be provided to affected farmers and daily wage earners. The departments concerned will examine and submit their proposals to the administrator for a final decision, Parida added. The central government is expected to issue detailed guidelines to all states and Union territories on Wednesday.CURFEW EXTENSION---Curfew extend till May 3---Decision on fresh restrictions or relaxations on April 20---Curfew relaxations timings remain from 11 am to 3 pm---Curfew passes issued under ‘Government officers/officials’ and ‘essential services’ extended up to May 3||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/curfew-extended-in-chandigarh-till-may-3/story-3k5gfuvqVrVxS3uz3UU69I.html
14-04-2020||City||Eerie silence prevails at otherwise bustling Ghumar Mandi market||The Ghumar Mandi market, which was once a hub for buyers and bustling with people, is now being haunted by an eerie silence due to lockdown in the wake of coronavirus outbreak.The pedestrians who used to struggle for walking space due to huge vehicle movement on the market roads, are now nowhere to be seen. Since the lockdown has been imposed, over 500 shops have been shut and only stray dogs are seen wandering around on empty roads.Though residents and shopkeepers are missing the daily hustle and bustle of the market, they are now being able to hear the birds chirping, something that earlier got lost in the din due to traffic.The main market of Ghumar Mandi is spread over a 1.1km-stretch, from Bhai Bala Chowk to Ghumar Mandi Chowk, to Aarti Chowk. Located at the heart of the city, it has been the hub for buying wedding apparels, cosmetics and artificial jewellery. Besides, one could even find products of daily use in the market–there are shops selling kitchen utensils, electronics, garments, footwear, grocery, hardware, and medicines. Further, there are even some restaurants and street food points.Lavdeep Gautam, a resident of Krishna Nagar, Ghumar Mandi, said the market area is just a walking distance from his house and he has never seen such silence in the otherwise vivacious place. “Sometimes, it feels like we have gone back in time. It is pleasant to see clean, empty roads where no horns are blaring, but the cause of this calm is unpleasant,” he said, adding that the area was giving employment to thousands of persons. “Many workers were living hand-to-mouth and now, it has become difficult for them to survive,” he added.“In 1937, there used to be only around seven shops here. The area turned into a full-fledged market after 1984 when people from various states and districts settled here and set up their shops,” said Pawan Batra, president of Ghumar Mandi market association.‘DIDN’T KNOW THAT LOCKDOWN WILL GO ON FOR SO LONG’“We had closed the market on March 20, two days prior to the curfew order by the state government. We were prepared for this lockdown but we didn’t know that it will linger on for so long,” he said.Though earnings are being hit, staying inside homes is crucial to arrest the spread of the virus, he added. “For everyone’s safety, we should follow the instructions of the government,” Batra said.“All shopkeepers are taking care of their workers during these hard times. I have 100 people working with me. Earlier, I used to pay them salaries on the seventh of every month, but this time, I paid them salaries on April 1 so that they can manage their household expenses,” he said.Batra added that as markets are closed, miscreants can easily target the shops. “The administration can enrol volunteers, especially for night duties, so that thefts can be prevented,” he suggested.Meanwhile, other shopkeepers said for the first time, the entire nation is under lockdown for so many days. “Except for the manufacturing of essential commodities, all other economic activities have come to a halt. It has become difficult for us to pay salaries to the employees from our savings. If one employee is getting ₹10,000 per month and there are 50 employees working in a firm, an employer has to shell out ₹5 lakh from his own pocket. Though we have paid salaries for this month, how will we pay the employees the next month?” they said.Aneesh Kapila, owner of a clothing store in the market, said, “If we stay alive, we will work hard to again earn our livelihood. As of now, it is important to save ourselves.”Talking about losses, he said, “There are no sales, no purchases, and the clothes in the shop are gathering dust. We are paying salaries to the employees from our savings. So there are heavy losses,” adding that he paid 120 workers their salaries from his savings.“As the lockdown has been extended, all shopkeepers will conduct a meeting to discuss about the payment of salaries at the month end as it has become difficult for us to pay all salaries,” he added.Gurdeep Singh, owner of a hardware shop in Ghumar Mandi, said the shopkeepers are surviving through their savings, from which they have paid the salaries to their employees.“The administration is only thinking about labourers and not us, shopkeepers. How we will earn our livelihood when at the end of the day, we are the receiving end?” the shopkeepers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eerie-silence-prevails-at-otherwise-bustling-ghumar-mandi-market/story-5Nv97vPSLq2HymD0x1ZkZL.html

Thereafter, samples of those found positive would be sent for further testing, he added.The minister said this initiative will help in real-time assessment of potential cases and would save the time. Epidemiologist Harmandeep Kaur Brar, coordinator for Covid-19 patients in the district said, “We can now start screening residents from Dera Bassi’s village and then to other areas. With testing being the key to control the spread of the pandemic, the government is planning to continuously expand its testing facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-health-minister-sidhu-launches-rapid-testing-facility-for-covid-19-in-dera-bassi/story-wCbi7cnSlPAWktOsnNJLNK.html

The civic body was so far using 40 backpack sprayers and four horticulture tankers to spray 1% Sodium Hypochlorite, a sanitising solution, on its open roads, markets, parks, JJ clusters, etc. However, now three of its fire tenders will also be pressed into service. “Today, we covered several avenue roads with these fire tenders, such as Lodhi Road, Subramanyam Bharti Marg, Max Muller Marg, Shahjahan Road and Pandara Road. On Wednesday, Mother Teresa Crescent, Park Street, Shankar Road, Mandir Marg and RK Asharam Marg will be covered,” a senior official of the council said. “The advantage we have with fire tenders is that they have a very long range—we can cover a large area with their help in a short time. As per our calculation, we can cover all of Lutyens’ Delhi with these tenders in just six days,” he said. Lutyen’s Delhi is spread over 42.74 sqkm. Only about 3% of Delhi’s geographical area and population is under the NDMC’s jurisdiction, but this includes the Parliament, North Block, South Block, Supreme Court and other sensitive installations. So far, one area—Bengali Market on Babar Road, and the adjoining Todarmal Road, Babar Lane, and School Lane—has figured as a Covid-19 containment zone under the NDMC jurisdiction. Besides, the Charak Palika Hospital the NDMC runs in Moti Bagh is also a screening centre for the disease. Recently, the NDMC set up a unique ‘Flu Counter’ there with adequate barriers between healthcare providers and the incoming patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ndmc-presses-its-fire-tenders-into-service-for-disinfection-in-lutyens-delhi/story-wvF8HkVouWkI4YK3uEexVL.html

He said a complaint has been forwarded to the police demanding action against the MLA and his associates.District SAD president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said, “The Congress is playing politics at this time of crisis when poor people are struggling to get food. Earlier also, Congress leaders had taken the credit of langar. being distributed by gurdwara committees.Refuting the allegations levelled against him, MLA Talwar said, “No ration has been distributed in the said area. They are working to prepare separate lists of migrant labourers living in labour quarters and other residents due to which they needed their voter cards for writing down their address.”Talwar added, “There are 2.5 lakh migrant labourers residing in his constituency and he had asked the administration to deploy quarter owners to feed the labour. This is why separate lists are being prepared so that the administration could provide ration to other residents. The final decision on the same is yet to be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-mla-accused-of-urging-locals-to-vote-for-party-in-exchange-of-ration/story-TIcYhocCHVQ5v22xSg0ihK.html

The extension of cancellation in train services was issued by the railway ministry an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Tuesday. “It has been decided that the cancellation of all passenger train services on Indian railways, that is express, passenger trains; suburban trains and trains of metro railway, Kolkata shall be extended till 3rd May 2020.” mentions the circular. The circular however states that train services may resume after evaluating the coronavirus situation. “Resumption of train services as may be warranted in consideration of public safety, keeping in view the emergent situation, shall be announced in due course.” states the circularLocal train service that will remain suspended for a total of 42 days is the longest in recent times. Train services were earlier suspended for 72 hours during floods of 26 July in 2005. Local train operations were delayed but train services did not stop after the 26/11 attacks in the city. The train services were also operational during the 1992 Mumbai riots.Passenger associations have stated the extension of cancellation is the need of the hour. “Earlier when local train services were operating for essential workers, but people misused it. Social distancing is very crucial right now and local trains can become easy carriers of the virus. The government should focus on providing better road transport during the lockdown,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-local-trains-suspended-till-may-3/story-ZpfQcYUO2EgvJQ1HSxP7VI.html
14-04-2020||Chandigarh||Veggie prices unlikely to rise in Chandigarh despite curfew extension||Prices of vegetables and fruits are not likely to rise in the city even though the Centre announced an extension of the lockdown period on Tuesday, up to May 3.Earlier, prices had doubled for most fruits and vegetables around March 24 when curfew was imposed. But on Tuesday, no jump in sales or prices was reported, which UT administration officials attribute to their enterprise of selling green groceries via CTU buses.Speaking about this, Rashwinder Singh, who works as the auction recorder for Chandigarh market committee at the Sector 26 mandi, said, “Sales on Tuesday remained on par with previous days and there was no panic buying. The mandi has plentiful supply so people have nothing to worry about. Rates have stayed constant for the past several days and are unlikely to change now.”Punjab farmers, however, are complaining that they are getting very low prices for their vegetables. Prahlad Singh Bhamia, a farmer from Fatehgarh Sahib, said, “We are selling vegetables at a loss and the extension of curfew means we will go on losing money. The government should provide more benefits to farmers to ensure we don’t suffer.”Officials of Punjab mandi board confirmed the adequate supply of vegetables in Mohali, too. Auction recorder for PMB, Harpreet Singh, said officials were supplying vegetables to residents and have been able to meet most of their orders.Most vegetables are being sourced locally in Punjab. But fruits such as grapes and oranges come from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, so transporters say supply may be affected. Secretary of Chandigarh transport association, BL Sharma, said, “Trucks are not plying regularly as industries are shut. Fruits formed only 20% of the cargo and only refrigerated trucks are running, so supplies may diminish by May.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/veggie-prices-unlikely-to-rise-in-chandigarh-despite-curfew-extension/story-KQjebkJO10qcnPFAFAseWI.html
14-04-2020||City||Advance payment scheme: Ludhiana firm pays ₹10cr power bill to PSPCL||A week after receiving no response on its offer to give consumer 1 per cent interest per month on advance payment on power bill, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) received its first advance payment of ₹10 crore from an industrial enterprise based in Mandi Gobindgarh of Khanna circles under Central Zone. M/S Oasis Enterprise has made the advance payment for the next six months to PSPCL on April 13. PSPCL’s central zone that includes Ludhiana (east), Ludhiana (west), Khanna, and suburban circle covers majority of industrial clusters in the state concentrated in Ludhiana and Khanna.Confirming it, DPS Grewal, engineer-in-chief, central zone, PSPCL, said “It is the first such payment. It is a positive development and it will help PSPCL. This is highest advancement payment ever made to the power corporation. I have contacted company’s owner Sushil Gupta and expressed my gratitude for making such a big advance deposit. He is committed to deposit more amounts in advance. I urge all the consumers, including domestic and commercial, to come forward to help PSPCL improve its financial position during the lockdown.”Grewal said that he has approached all big groups, including Oswal, Vardhman, Hero Cycles and industrials associations, in the central zone and asked them to avail the offer.“While some are contemplating the offer, others are waiting for the guidelines from the government about the conditional withdrawal of the lockdown from April 20 before taking any financial decision. We are hopeful that all consumers will come forward since it is a lucrative offer,” he added.Official informed that some PSPCL employees have already started paying their electricity bills in advance.“Khanna superintendent engineer (SE) Himmat Singh Dhillon has recently deposited electricity bills of a whole year in advance. Similarly, many of the staff members have also made advance payment,” he added.Meanwhile on Tuesday, Vardhman Adarash Ispat Pvt Ltd, based in Ludhiana, also made an advance payment of ₹3 crore to PSPCL. Only those confident of paycheck will avail offer: Consumers“Though it’s a great offer, however, only those who are sure of their next paycheck would go for it. Survival is the priority for the people, not savings,” said Aayush Chaku, a resident of Model Town Extension. “1 percent return is a handsome offer made by the PSPCL, but sadly the industrialists in Ludhiana have no incoming payment right now, so I don’t think they would be taking the offer. Since the lockdown, we are only paying bills, giving salaries and providing essentials to our workers. It is a good offer made in a wrong time,” said Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU)PSPCL offer to its consumersStaring at losses due to the non-consumption of electricity by bulk consumers amid lockdown, PSPCL had last week made the offer to all its consumers.“PSPCL offers all its categories to make advance payment towards their electricity bills up to March 2021 and earn 1% interest on advance payment. Thus consumer will earn 12 % interest per annum (double the rate of interest per fixed deposit),” PSPCL’s appeal read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/advance-payment-scheme-ludhiana-firm-pays-10cr-power-bill-to-pspcl/story-sB7oS60aNKOgubh1aAQa2I.html

Frankly, I was worried about my family even though we were not showing any symptoms and when my second son tested positive I was alarmed. We were aware of the fact that our relative Baldev had died due to Covid-19,” said Harjinder Singh.He said the staff gave them healthy meals and kept their morale high even though they could not communicate with other relatives during their three-week stay at the hospital.Virk’s wife, Baljinder, said she was slow to recover but it was all right as her husband and children were with her. “All of us are constantly motivating each other and we have faith in God. On March 28, after my first report was negative I got the confidence that I would recover soon,” she told HT over the phone.Baljinder says people diagnosed with Covid-19 should not panic. “Doctors are there to help us, there is nothing to worry about. Just cooperate with and have faith in the health officials. You will recover for sure.”Now quarantined at home, the family is checked up regularly by accredited social health activist (Asha) workers who are also providing them meals and medication, said Asha supervisor Meena Rani.Phillaur SDM, Dr Vaneet Kumar, who with senior medical officer, community health centre, Bara Pind, Dr Jyoti Phokela, has been supervising the entire contact tracing and containment exercise, and sending people for testing, said that just like the Virk family, other people can recover from the virus without panicking and other residents should take precautionary steps to stay safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-have-full-faith-in-health-officials-say-family-of-four-that-beat-covid-19/story-AWtsFyL15o3Dqxh1zaPQ6N.html
14-04-2020||City||Kin of suspected Covid-19 victims made to scramble for bodies at Ludhiana civil hospital||The ordeal of kin of the suspected Covid-19 victims seems to be unending. Besides being denied treatment at private hospitals, the kin of the deceased have to run from pillar to post for possession of the body at the civil hospital.As the test reports are getting delayed, the bodies of the deceased keep lying in the hospital for nearly two to three days, while the kin of the victim battle with anxiety.Mukesh, elder brother of 10-year-old girl who died at the civil hospital on Friday, said it was on Sunday that the family learnt that the deceased was tested negative for coronavirus.His ordeal did not end here. Mukesh had to look for the body, as there was no one to guide him. “We weren’t informed whether my sister had tested positive for the virus or not. Police told the family that she had tested negative. On Sunday, I visited the civil hospital, where I was told to collect the body but nobody informed me from where or guided me through the process. After shuttling from one office to another for over an hour, I was told that the body was kept in the mortuary. There I was asked to show the report. Again I went to the doctor concerned, who gave me a slip and thus the body was released,” said Mukesh, who has lodged complaint with the health department in this regard. He said that compassion was completely amiss. “We were already going through a tough time as my sister could have survived had she been given the treatment on time. And to top it all, the indifferent attitude of the health department has disappointed us,” said Mukesh.He is not alone, relatives of Paramjit Kaur narrate similar ordeal.Sukedev Singh, son of 60- year- old Paramjit Kaur who died on Saturday, said neither doctors nor the staff did anything to save his mother.“First the private hospital denied admitting my mother on learning that she had breathing difficulty. And when I took her to the civil hospital, the staff there told me why I have brought her to the hospital. No one came near my mother and I helplessly watched her die. Instead of hospital, I got a call from the police that my mother was tested negative. It is painful that doctors first delayed the treatment and then remained mum about the test report,” said Sukhdev Singh. Surinder Kumar, a resident of Amarpur, said that he was shifted from flu corner to isolation ward. “For two days no one even checked about my health. The place is fully infected and sanitisation has been given a complete miss,” said Suresh.Following all guidelines: SMOSenior medical officer (SMO), civil hospital, Ravi Datt said, “We are following the guidelines. First, our rapid response team visit the locality and home quarantine the person if they find any symptom. Then suspected patients are rushed to the hospital. If the report comes out negative, the patient is sent home with an instruction to remain home quarantine for two weeks. In the case of death, we inform the police chowki located on the hospital premises and the police officer concerned gets in touch with the family of the deceased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kin-of-suspected-covid-19-victims-made-to-scramble-for-bodies-at-ludhiana-civil-hospital/story-IFC4Xg0azrCYAtgtTrcsvJ.html

14-04-2020||City||Lockdown: Absence of migrant labourers, contractors likely to hit litchi crop in Punjab||Absence of migrant workers and contractors who fled the state after the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to hit litchi production at a time when Punjab seems set for a bumper crop.Litchi (Litchi chinensis) lasts for about a fortnight after it ripens in the first week of May, so preservation and marketing it requires advance planning. This year, however, most growers, some of them well-heeled orchardists and big landlords, are wondering how they will fare as people who worked for them had left for their villages in Uttar Pradesh (UP).The contractors take land on lease for two years after paying an advance to the landowners and then make the remainder of the payment after selling the fruit in various markets.A bulk of the produce, being expensive, is sold in Pathankot, which has a litchi processing plant; and in Chandigarh and Delhi, where it is in demand.Traders in these cities are also the financiers of the contractors.Dilbag Singh Cheema Lali, owner of an 11-acre orchard in Ranjit Bagh village, says if the labourers and contractors do not return to Punjab the growers will face a total loss.The growers have also submitted a demand charter to Gurdaspur horticulture deputy director, Dr Lakhwinder Singh, urging him to request the deputy commissioner to allow the labourers and contractors to handle the preservation and marketing of litchi grown in about 200 acres in the belt covering Dhariwal, Dinanagar, Gurdaspur, Sujanpur and Narot Jaimal Singh.When contacted, Dr Lakhwinder Singh said he was confident that the growers with their experience in fruit production, would be able to manage things with local labourers. “If the migrant contractors or labourers are called from UP to Punjab, they will first be quarantined for 14 days and then it will be too late for them to do anything to market the crop,” he saidMeanwhile, Cheema demanded that the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), which supplied power for only four hours at night to the orchards, should increase it for two hours more to allow daytime irrigation.Two litchi varieties, namely Dehradun and Kalkatti, are grown in the state.Cheema also said litchis attracted bats so nets were spread over trees and lights installed to keep them away as had been reported that bats were the cause of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-absence-of-migrant-labourers-contractors-likely-to-hit-litchi-crop-in-punjab/story-drP2XSm4p6W3HNiK6UTqrM.html

A kilogram of these drug ingredients, which earlier cost ₹7,000, is now being sold at ₹48,000.These small units in Baddi have the capacity to manufacture around one to five lakh tablets daily, while the bigger companies can produce about 1 crore tablets in a day.“The trade of HCQ is now totally controlled by the government, but there are some traders who are indulging in black marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients of HCQ,” said Dr Rajesh Gupta, president of state drug manufacturing association.“The Centre has already stored adequate stock of HCQ and there are around 3.5 crore tablets stocked in government stores. This will boost the stocks up to 10 crore tablets besides supplying the drug to foreign countries,” Gupta said adding that the demand for anti-malarial drug was far more than the manufacturing capacity of state’s units.The units producing active pharmaceutical ingredients for HCQ are based in Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh.The government has ordered the manufacturing the units to increase the production of HCQ to treat Covid-19 patients across the country,” said state drug controller Navneet Marwah. “So far we have not received any complaints about the increase in the price of HCQ ingredients,” he claimed.There are 40 units in the state that have the approval to make HCQ tablets. These are based in the pharmaceutical hubs of Baddi and Nalagarh in Solan district, Kala Amb and Nahan in Sirmaur district and Sansarpur in Kangra district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/drug-ingredients-get-dearer-as-hcq-demand-goes-up-in-hp/story-C3dmCKkBe4xFHwl1692ifO.html

14-04-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER’s young medical team proud to be on the Covid-19 frontline||Their seniors are their ‘guiding force,’ but young doctors, nurses and other health workers at the frontline of the Covid-19 battle at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) are glad to get this opportunity, even though it’s “difficult to breathe,” at times in personal protective (PPE) gear.Dr Deep Kanth’s duty starts at 3am and for the next six hours the 27-year-old wears the “suffocating” and “heavy” PPE suit attending to the critically ill Covid-19 positive patients at PGIMER’s Nehru Extension Hospital, now referred to as Covid Hospital.When he was assigned to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital, Kanth, said he was happy. Speaking to Hindustan Times after intubating a patient and attending to three others, he said the only person he was worried about was his mother, who was hypertensive.“She lives close by, but I cannot see her as I am dealing with Covid-19 patients,” he said.As Kanth’s duty ended at 9 am, Dr Anu Kewlani, aged 29, took over.Anyone entering the ICU was required to first wear sanitary clothing or scrubs, then the hazmat (protective) suit and PPE, which included gloves, eye protection and safety footwear. Then he or she attended to patients and answer emergency callsThe first day, Kewlani said, was difficult because of the PPE. “We have to wear three layers and it gets so uncomfortable. You can’t drink water or urinate for six hours and at times it’s hard to breathe. But when you know that this is keeping you safe you have to accept the discomfort.” “Grateful” to be given the opportunity to work with Covid-19 patients,” Kewlani said her family back in Madhya Pradesh was proud of her.She in turn was proud of how PGIMER was managing the health crisis. “Seeing how the senior doctors have managed things and set up the Covid Hospital, I am proud to say I work for the institute,” Kewlani added.About 10-15 young nurses work in a shift. “All young nurses in their late twenties or early thirties are posted here. It’s tough for those in their 50s as they have multiple ailments, but they never hesitate to support us,” said a nurse.Tinson Thomas, 31, nursing officer, got married recently and cancelled plans to go home for Easter. “On the first day at the ICU I was nervous, but when you look at worried patients, you know you can’t afford to lose your calm,” he said.“Pray for us,” he requested this correspondent.On the young staff at the battle zone, Dr Jagat Ram, director PGIMER, said, “The seniors are the guiding force, who are working the entire day planning everything, holding meetings, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. The younger people are on the frontlines.”The high-risk health workers were not allowed to go back home and put up at the private rooms in Nehru building for seven days. After that they were home quarantined for 14 days.“Rooms in the private wards are our new homes for the time being. These have separate entry and exit points. Our meals are kept outside the rooms and we are not allowed to venture out,” added Kanth.All of the young doctors, however, had just one plea for the public: “Please follow the lockdown sincerely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pgimer-s-young-medical-team-proud-to-be-on-the-covid-19-frontline/story-qGwhYlzKreRY1RCmSJWTAN.html

If a resident is found violating the order, a notice will be issued for the first offence, a challan of ₹1,000 will be imposed the second time, three-time offenders will have to pay ₹2,000, and the fourth time will elicit disconnection of water supply without notice. Booster pumps and hose-pipes will be confiscated. To get the connection restored, defaulters will have to pay ₹5,000 along with an affidavit.Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said teams are already conducting random checks in morning hours.Mohali, on an average, requires 30MGD (million gallon daily) of water, but the supply is limited to 20MGD—10MGD from the Kajauli waterworks and an equal amount from 75 tube-wells. During peak summer, however, the demand reaches 32MGD, causing a shortage of 12MGD.Sunil Kansal, chief engineer of GMADA, said, “Though we will start challaning for wastage of water from April 15, no aggressive drives will be held as some employees are busy on Covid-19 duty. Moreover, due to the lockdown, people are not using their vehicles, so washing will also be less.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/water-wastage-to-elicit-fine-in-mohali-from-april-15/story-4Sbj7hcZXAz85a3YpYS8HO.html

It states that pursuant to the Supreme Court directives, the Maharashtra Legal Services Authority on March 27 asked the state government to identify the under-trial prisoners and convicts lodged in jails across Maharashtra, who fulfil the criteria set out by the apex court.However, the NGO has complained, the state prison authorities have not acted with the required sense of urgency and till date, only 1,000 prisoners have been released from Maharashtra prisons, though about 11,000 prisoners in state jails are entitled to be released under the Supreme Court order.“In the light of the present situation of the outbreak of Covid-19, there is an immense urgency to depopulate and de-congest the prisons as the progress of the disease is increasing rapidly, besides, there is absolutely no facility for social distancing in prison cells, across Maharashtra,” states the notice issued by advocate Nizam.Despite the impending danger to the lives of the inmates, there is a lack of urgency on part of prison authorities, it adds.The NGO has urged Maharashtra home department and the prison authorities to release the prisoners entitled to be released under the apex court order dated March 23 be immediately released on cash bail or sureties extending up to ₹5,000 each. It has also offered to provide free legal aid to these prisoners and has sought the list of the eligible prisoners from the home department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ngo-issues-notice-to-government-over-decongestion-of-prisons/story-7ahRWDD31VqoIenY9n3QRP.html

Despite transportation of essential items being permitted, the lorries are unable to reach their destinations. The RO-RO services could help transport traders across the country.What is RO-RO serviceThe RO-RO service allow trucks to be loaded on railway flat wagons. Each train has the capacity to carry 30 to 40 trucks. The service are very popular in Southern Railways.Explaining more about the service, divisional railway manager GM Singh said, “ The division is ready to commence the service on a commercial basis, if a demands come from the operator or from the state. However, the final decision will be taken after consulting the railway board.”When asked about whether there was a destination limit for transporting trucks, he said, “ We will drop it across the country, but there are some conditions required to be fulfilled to run these types of trains. For example the station needs a proper ramp from where trucks can be loaded and later unloaded at the location like in our region, Ambala, Patiala and other district stations which have these ramps.In Chandigarh, around 800 transporters and workers are stranded at the transport parking in Sector 26 amid the curfew, including those from different states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/railways-can-ferry-stranded-trucks-if-asked-ambala-div/story-c8xslD6j7EhIH6xiQQeOUN.html
14-04-2020||City||With senior citizens left to fend for themselves, Delhi Police step in||New Delhi: At 99 years old, and living alone in his Defence Colony home, Inder Dev Sawhney, is the eldest senior citizen in the city, according to Delhi Police records. He had returned home after a fortnight under observation at a city hospital just a week before the nationwide lockdown was first announced on March 24. He was entirely dependent on his caretaker, Sanjay.But from March 25, when the lockdown kicked in-- which has been now extended til May 3 -- Sawhney had to fend for himself. Sanjay, not among those listed as providers of essential services, was not allowed to step out of his home nearly seven kilometres away from his employer’s residence. With his two children settled abroad and relatives unable to travel, Sawhney dialled the Delhi Police senior citizen helpline – 1291.“For the first five or six days, I managed things myself. The problems began when I started running out of medicines and other essential items. Sanjay wanted to come, but the police did not allow him. I then called the helpline and told a police officer about my problem. They called Sanjay to Defence Colony police station and gave him a curfew pass, which has allowed him to continue visiting me,” said Sawhney, who ran a fabric showroom in Connaught Place till 20 years ago. A curfew pass is issued by the police and Delhi government to allow those involved in essential services to travel around the city during the lockdown, as well as cross the national capital’s interstate borders.Sawhney was not alone in his distress call to the police. The senior citizen helpline’s call records show that distress calls by senior citizens have increased nearly 20-30% during the lockdown.While the number of Covid-19 cases continue to rise across the country, elderly citizens, especially those who live by themselves, have been left stressed and anxious. At a time when most of the city has been mandated to stay indoors, the elderly must contend with the absence of house helps, arranging their own medicines, ration and other essential items, and contending with medical emergencies.To help them tide through till such time restrictions are lifted, Delhi Police personnel have been making efforts to come to the aid of senior citizens.The helpline has received nearly 1,200 calls since the lockdown was announced. Apart from seeking help, the elderly have also called the police about the availability of vaccines in the market, or about precautions to keep the contagious disease at bay.There are around 39,000 senior citizens registered with the Delhi Police.“Initially, on an average, 80-90 calls were being received every day, while before the lockdown, this number was between 50 and 60 a day. A majority of the registered senior citizens call us to complain that their caretakers or house helps were not able to travel because of the lockdown, or because they need medicines. We helped some of them by issuing curfew passes to their helps. The calls have come down in the last three-four days” said Muktesh Chander, special commissioner of police (operations).A homemaker living alone at her Vasant Kunj residence, 75-year-old Raj Handa said, “As soon as the lockdown was announced, I purchased rations and other essentials to last for around two months. But, I was not able to buy my medicines when they ran out. I called the police and they delivered the medicines the very next day.”For 95-year-old Kailashwati, who had been on ventilator support in a private hospital and had been recently been discharged, the police ensured nursing staff could make daily visits to her Shalimar Bagh home.“I sought the police’s assistance for my mother so that we do not face problems in the event of a medical emergency. The local police acted on our request swiftly, and assured that the nursing staff coming to our house would not be stopped,” said Mohit Rattan, Kailashwati’s son.The police’s senior citizen cell has also started calling each of those registered with them to ask about their well-being and if they had any personal requirements.“We have so far contacted almost 37, 000 of them. All their issues are being resolved. If anybody seeks our help in procuring ration or medicines, the concerned local police station is being informed. They deliver the items as soon as possible,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rajan Bhagat, who is supervising the senior citizen helpline.“A policewoman called me yesterday and asked about my well-being and if I needed anything. I thanked her for it. We feel secure when police personnel come to ask about us or call us. They always try to resolve our problems,” said Sharda Mishra, who is in her 80s and lives in Greater Kailash.“A lot of elderly people in cities and even villages are living on their own, and many of them are diabetic or suffering from heart ailments. During these uncertain times, the stress and sense of helplessness will increase among elderly people. So, it becomes very important for their family members, friends, and neighbours to speak to them regularly and know about their well-being,” said Dr. SK Khandelwal, former professor and head of department of psychiatry in AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-senior-citizens-left-to-fend-for-themselves-delhi-police-step-in/story-IXUqYu8IwoS2enSQGD796N.html
14-04-2020||City||‘Revenues hit, ₹1,600 cr spending cut proposed by depts’||A debt-ridden state, Punjab has been hit hard by the coronavirus-induced national lockdown at a time when finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal was slowly trying to put the state’s finances back on track, forcing him to now redo his budget maths. Manpreet spoke to NAVNEET SHARMA about the sharp dip in state revenues, his contingency plans and expectations from the centre. Edited excerpts:What impact will the extended curfew have on the state’s economy?There has been hardly any economic activity in the past three weeks. The state is suffering a loss of at least ₹7,000 crore a week in its GSDP (gross state domestic product). This has hit tax revenues. We are losing ₹150 crore a day in goods and services tax, value-added tax, state excise, etc. Add to this, another ₹30-odd crore loss to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). We have to look at our budget calculations again.How do you plan to cope with this unexpected situation?It is an act of God and no one could have predicted it. I do not even see the end of the tunnel as yet. Once we get there, we can talk about solutions. With no tax coming, all we can do is slash our expenditure.What kind of spending cuts are we talking about?There is a cabinet sub-committee that has been formed by the chief minister to look into this whole gamut. Of the 42 government departments, 16 have given proposals for cut in expenditure of more than ₹1,600 crore, suggesting curtailment of projects or their deferment till the next financial year. Other departments are still to submit their suggestions. The sub-committee will meet on Wednesday. At this moment, we are just thinking of staying on course vis-a-vis our committed expenditure, including salaries, pensions, debt servicing, old-age pensions, Covid-19 expenses and power subsidy.Which means capital expenditure will take a hit.That’s true. We had proposed capital expenditure of ₹10,000 crore in the budget this year. We are still in the first quarter. I am hopeful things will stabilise.When do you expect the economic activity to resume in Punjab?We are lucky that procurement season is starting (from April 15). We have a bumper harvest and ₹24,000 crore will be infused for wheat procurement in next few weeks. Though all states are in lockdown, no other state has the advantage that we have at this moment. When farmers get money, economic activity starts. Then, there will be another ₹40,000 crore from paddy.What are your expectations from the Centre? Is any help coming?No, we have not got anything. We are still waiting for pending receivables such as GST compensation arrears. If they (Centre) are not collecting any taxes, I also have to curtail my expectations. But I foresee that at some point, all the state finance ministers will have to go to the Centre on these issues. I am sure the Centre will try its best to help the states. Right now, all they are talking about is an increase in the state’s borrowing limit (fiscal deficit), which will only add to our debt.What’s your take on PM’s statement on the need for striking a balance between “jaan” (lives) and “jahan” (the outside world) for lockdown?As the finance minister of a small state, I don’t have the status to say anything on his comment. But slogans alone won’t work, better planning is needed. We need two doctors – one who will take care on medical side and the other who can pull India out of this economic crisis. This is not a child’s play. India is in danger of falling into a debt trap. We will have to find some way out because the impending economic crisis could be bigger than coronavirus. If India can manage this crisis as well as help others with vaccines and medication, then you do not have to lead delegations to other countries for seeking investments. There will be so much goodwill that they will come on their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/revenues-hit-1-600-cr-spending-cut-proposed-by-depts/story-VVSqk3xs0i6LXOPVhLgFzH.html

They also focus on the contact tracing of the suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases, following the same protocol. Though all senior officials are actively involved at the district as well as state level, the control room’s dedicated team has in it senior-most to junior doctors of the integrated diseases surveillance programme (IDSP) wing, which collects all types of Covid-19 related information. It also passes on the government’s instructions to the district teams on real-time basis, besides keeping tabs on each case, say doctors of IDSP, which is headed by Dr Usha Gupta.Director general, health services, Dr SB Kamboj says an adequate number of Isolation beds have identified in various government and private facilities besides persons quarantine facilities in rooms and dormitories. According to official information, 11 full or partial covid hospitals and medical colleges including one at Nalhar (Nuh), Mullana (Ambala) and Agroha (Hisar), besides exclusive covid wards in 26 other government and private hospitals and medical colleges in the state.

14-04-2020||Lucknow||Pt Channulal Mishra sings Karo-Na song!||People from various fields of performing arts are contributing their bit to spread awareness about the deadly coronavirus infection. Padma Bhushan Pt Channulal Mishra too has done it in the way what he is best known for. The legendary singer has come up with a song ‘Gandagi Karo-Na’ that he has written, sung and composed.Over the phone from his native city Varanasi he said, “My song is a message to the society. I feel from ‘gandagi’ (unhygienic conditions) is something that is cause of all ‘bimari’ (diseases). Then it may be living in unhygienic conditions, not washing hands or following practices that are not as per the social norms. Today, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the social norm is to stay inside and keeping oneself clean.”In the song he has also mentions about the collective efforts required in defeating the deadly virus from contraction. All these emotions and expressions he has written and composed in the song that he has shared on his website and YouTube channel.This song is based on ‘dhun’ (tune). “It’s not based on any raag. Raags have their own ‘niyam’ (rules) while this is based on dhun.”Mishra urges all to follow the lockdown rules. “In Benaras we say ‘Malik kahe jo kijiye, shaam ko paise lijiye’. So, whatever our PM is suggesting we must follow it completely as he is advising after looking into all the possible scenarios,” Mishra says.Talking about his daily routine he shares, “In morning, I practice one hour of ‘pranayam’ (yoga) and ‘vyayam’ (exercise) and over hour of puja-archana (prayers). Then post breakfast it’s time for TV show ‘Ramayan’. Then I take a training session of my disciple Aman which is followed by the ‘Mahabharat’ show. A simple meal usually ‘khichdi’ and afternoon sleep. Evening again its training time followed with lemon tea. Thereafter, I watch the repeat telecast of both TV shows.”The simple classical singer sums up in a sentence, “Chana for food, Gangajal for water, music and the land of Baba Vishwanath you don’t need anything more in life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/pt-channulal-mishra-sings-karo-na-song/story-WC9YJVTDTMZFUO50QFQIVJ.html

14-04-2020||Chandigarh||After 3 killed in shelling, Kupwara villagers feel civilians new target of Pak army||The killing of three civilians, including a minor, in three Kupwara villages, has left the residents feeling they are the ‘new targets’ of the Pakistani forward posts along the LoC.On Sunday evening, three civilians – an 8-year-old boy, 36-year-old woman and 18-year-old youth –were killed when shells landed in three villages of Kralpora block in Kupwara. This is the first time that civilians were killed during Pakistani shelling deep inside Kupwara. Last year, shells had damaged a few houses in the villages, but no casualty had occurred.Locals said that the shells which landed in Tumna, Redi and Hatchmarg villages might have been aimed at the big army installation in the neighbouring Panzgam locality from where the Indian Army has been targeting Pakistani posts with heavy artillery.Kralpora block development chairman Mohammad Akbar said it is the first time that shells have fallen deep inside Kupwara villages. “People are quite scared after three civilians got killed due to the mortar shelling. Now, the villagers are demanding community bunkers for their safety,” he said adding that Panzgam villagers had earlier protested against the installation of artillery guns in the ground close to the village.Stating that there was no fresh shelling in the area since Sunday, Redi block development chairman Firdous Ahmad said, “This is the second time since last year that shells have landed in our village. The government should now provide us with community bunkers. Last year, I had written a few times to the government asking for bunkers, but nothing happened. Bunkers were given to areas which are closer to the LoC.”Ahmad, however, said that tension between the locals and the army began at Panzgam after the latter moved heavy guns in the ground being used by villagers. “Without any notice to the villagers, the army began shelling across the LoC at night. Earlier, army used to fire shells from inside their camp which is spread over a vast area. Now they are using the ground close to villagers’ houses.”Ahmad termed it unfortunate that while the world is dealing with coronavirus, India and Pakistan are engaged in ceasefire violations and getting civilians get killed. “Both the governments should focus on handling Covid-19, instead of shelling,” he said.Local villagers said though the LoC was far from the area, they were on the target now.Redi sarpanch Hyder Ali told HT that when shelling began, dozens of civilians left the village for safer areas. “Now, people have started to return.

As he sat down to speak to Hindustan Times, though, he was free for almost 15 minutes before there was a car he had to attend to, at the fuel station where he works in south Delhi’s Saket. “I hope laziness does not set in by the time my workload gets back to the usual,” says the 45-year-old, who has worked at the station for the last 22 years. He dispenses fuel and the driver hands him the payment -- the exact amount billed -- in currency notes. “Some customers ask me to keep the change so as to avoid any kind of contact,” says Pandey. Pandey has noticed another marked difference in the behaviour of motorists coming to the station ever since the 21-day nationwide lockdown, which has been extended further till May 3, began.“Earlier, they would make every effort to hide the card swipe machine from me while entering their card pin. After the lockdown, they prefer to tell me their pin code rather than key it in themselves”.Many don’t even want the receipt or memo anymore, he adds.As for him, Pandey says he has been taking all possible precautions to keep himself germ free. He rubs sanitiser on his hands after refuelling the car, and says he does so each time he feels he has come in contact with a customer. On occasions when drivers use the card swipe machine, he gives the gadget a rubdown with sanitiser as well. “Physical contact is inevitable, though. Most people pay by cash which may have changed multiple hands before reaching me. Fingers often touch while exchanging cash,” he says. The usual timings for this fuel station were 6am to 12 in the night. With customers dwindling due to the lockdown, though, it operates for general motorists only till 9 pm. “However, a couple of my colleagues stay on till midnight in case an ambulance comes by which needs fuel,” he says.These days, Pandey leaves his home in Sangam Vihar around 7.45am on a motorcycle to begin his duty from 8am. He faces no hurdles at police checkposts; his uniform and identity card help him sail through. He has brought along his lunch from home, but he isn’t sure when he’ll get to have it. “Footfall has dipped by nearly 90% and I am not sure when a customer would arrive. Since the number of attendants too has been reduced I have to take care of multiple pumps, unlike before when I was tasked with handling just one. If I start eating and a customer comes, I may have to get up mid-meal to attend to them,” he says.Unlike many other essential service providers struggling to find tea while out on work during the lockdown, Pandey has had it easy. “A colleague who stays nearby brings tea for us twice a day,” he says.Though work is much less than usual, spending his free time at work is a bit of a challenge. He isn’t allowed to use his mobile phone at the fuel station for the fear of fire. “If I receive a call, I walk out of the premises, keep it short and return,” he says.So far, the lockdown has given him mixed feelings. One day, a woman drove into the fuel station, asked Pandey and the others to be careful, and then left as quickly as she came. “It was a warm feeling,” he says.On another day, a man riding a motorcycle demanded that a five-litre bottle he had be filled with petrol. “We have been turning down such requests ever since the Delhi riots. That man called the police to complain that I wasn’t doing my duty,” he says. Fortunately for him, the police gave the customer an earful.A welcome change, though, is that Pandey has also not experienced any untoward situation involving inebriated men and goons, after the lockdown was imposed. “Instances of customers in a drunken state and ruffians bullying us would take place almost every day. However, with the liquor shops now closed, we have been able to avoid that menace,” he says.When Pandey leaves from work at 4pm, he will call his wife to keep hot water ready. “I take my work clothes off outside the door of my house and head directly to the bathroom where I wash them and take a bath,” says the father of three.With less work, Pandey and his colleagues have to report to work only on alternate days. And that had him worried for several days until the payday arrived. “I received my entire salary,” he beamed happily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mixed-feelings-about-the-lockdown-says-fuel-station-operator/story-W4PbLvUpZhyrHIwex2L4vN.html

Many of us live far away from our orchards and are not able to go there. Stone fruits are about to ripen and we have requested the government to reopen factories which produce stone fruit packaging material,” said Surinder Mehta, an orchardist from Kotgarh.Dr Manmohan Singh, director of the state’s meteorological department, said due to a fresh western disturbance, the higher reaches were likely to get snow with rain rain in the middle hills for the next few days. A yellow (severely bad weather) warning has also been issued for the middle hills on April 17, even as weather remained dry in the state during the last 24 hours.Minimum temperatures were normal while maximum temperatures were one to two degrees above normal.Shimla remained dry with minimum temperature at 15.5 degrees Celsius.Minimum temperature in Kufri was 12.5 degrees C, while Manali recorded 8.2 degree C and Dalhousie 14 degrees C.

14-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Our biggest challenge is contact tracing as positive cases are rising, says PMC assistant health chief||Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) assistant health chief, Dr Vaishali Jadhav, has been playing a crucial role in handling the Covid-19 pandemic. Her responsibility is to undertake contact tracing of Covid-19 patients and to initiate a survey in a one-three km radius of positive cases and sanitise the locality. Here’s what she had to say about her work. What is your role in this crisis? My primary responsibility is contact tracing. Once a positive patient is found, we start the contact tracing of the persons who may have come in contact with the patient and may have got infected. I pass on the information to the concerned ward office where various medical teams have been formed. These teams visit the family members and others who came in contact with the positive patient and check whether they are displaying any symtoms. They are also asked to remain in home isolation. Our teams keep a follow-up for the next 14 days. My other responsibility is to undertake a suvery in a 1km to 3km radius of the infected person and sanitise the area. How does your day begin and roll out? My day starts very early and how it pans out is not in my hands. On an average, for the last few days, work has been going on till 10 pm as our teams have been encountering various problems which need to be sorted out. We need to update information time to time. Although the physical work gets done during 8am to 10pm, work on the phone goes on throughout, from early morning.What precautions are you taking?I have been visiting some hospitals while doing co-ordination alongside and therefore have to take basic precautions such as using the mask, hand gloves, frequent washing of hands and use of sanitiser. Keeping social distance during site visits and in the office is also important.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How do you see it unfolding? Positive cases are increasing day-by-day and they have started multiplying. It is tough to say that how many days such a situation is going to continue. If people remain at home and follow the guidelines given by centre, state and municipal corporation, it would help us to take control over situation much earlier.What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?Since cases have started multiplying and the number of positive cases is increasing, our biggest challenge is contact tracing. The faster we are able to do the contract tracing, lesser would be the number of people infected. Our main challenge is to increase the search teams and increase manpower. We have appealed to the citizens that the health teams are working for their safety. Therefore, citizens should co-operate and give proper information. It would help us control the situation faster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-our-biggest-challenge-is-contact-tracing-as-positive-cases-are-rising-says-pmc-assistant-health-chief/story-0uQcuXXDIgTDfALuKv4Y5M.html

The entrance test for all the undergraduate courses, including vocational and traditional programmes, will be held in the first week of June, while the entrance test for Masters in Computer Applications is scheduled to be held on June 20. However, there will be no entrance test for Masters in Arts, Science and postgraduate diploma courses.According to a college official, all courses are based on choice based credit system (CBCS) syllabus, giving flexibility to students to choose their course from a list of elective, core and soft skill courses.“We have planned to hold the entrance tests in June, which used to be earlier conducted in May, expecting that the lockdown would be lifted by then and the situation will be back to normal. In case of any change in the date of the entrance test, it will be notified on the college website and college notice board”, the official said on Monday.PWC, founded in 1940, is the first college in the state to earn the status of an autonomous college, in 2018.On the other hand, students are quite worried about filling the online admission form due to lack of digital documents.Priya Kumari, a class 12 student, said, “I wish to apply for Bachelor of Business Administration in PWC as it is the best college for girls in the entire state.

14-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid-19 cases rise from 72 to 1,510 in 16 days||The number of coronavirus cases in India crossed the 10,000-mark on Tuesday, with the infections doubling over six days (till Monday) and the government expanding containment efforts and ramping up testing in an attempt to curb the highly contagious pathogen from sweeping across the country.Delhi recorded its biggest daily spike yesterday with 356 cases on Monday, according to Delhi government health officials. The national capital has recorded 1,510 cases so far, becoming the city with the most number of infections.The number of cases in Delhi increased from 72 on March 29 to 1,510 on Tuesday - most of the 356 cases reported on Monday appeared to be linked to the Nizamuddin gathering. The national capital reported its first case on March 2, when a 45-year-old who travelled from Italy tested positive. According to officials in the Delhi government, about 1,050 of the total cases are attendees of the Nizamuddin event or their contacts.The Delhi government has set up a task force to identify suspected coronavirus cases in all districts of the city.Amid the rising number of cases, a ‘Corona Foot Warriors Containment and Surveillance Force’ has been constituted at every booth level by Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, a Delhi government official told news agency PTI.Each team of the force will have five members including a booth-level officer, civil defence volunteer, police constable, sanitation and anganwadi worker, the official said.The government launched a massive sanitisation drive in those areas declared as red zones, and high-risk zones identified by the colour orange to prevent the spread of the disease. “Massive sanitisation drive underway in Delhi. Sixty machines, including 10 hi-tech Japanese machines, have been deployed,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.The administration also ran a pilot disinfection drive using the hi-tech Japanese spray machines at Rajinder Nagar Assembly constituency.Meanwhile, in order to ensure strict compliance of social distancing norms, the Delhi government will implement odd-even rules in all wholesale markets of the city. Traders will sell vegetables on alternate days, Delhi Development Minister Gopal Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-covid-19-cases-rise-from-72-to-1-510-in-16-days/story-Y52zHhkzMqaJtY3JXGqZJP.html

14-04-2020||Mumbai||Maha jumps from 1,000 virus cases to 2,000 in six days||Maharashtra doubled its tally from 1,000 to 2,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in six days as it recorded its biggest 24-hour jump in cases with 352 more patients on Monday, taking the number of infected people in the state to 2,334. The state recorded 11 deaths on Monday, the health department said, taking the toll to 160.The Maharashtra government on Monday also officially extended the lockdown, which was to end at midnight on April 14, till April 30. On Saturday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had already said the state would extend the lockdown. The state government is also looking at allowing micro-, small- and medium- enterprises (MSMEs) to start operations in districts that are not affected or less affected by the outbreak. A proposal for allowing industries is being prepared by the state industries department. However, the state has not taken a call on colour-coding districts based on the severity of cases and relaxing curbs in regions that are not much affected.Of Monday’s cases, Mumbai recorded 242 alone, taking the city’s tally to 1,540. Besides Mumbai, 39 cases were recorded in Pune; 14 in Malegaon; 11 in Nagpur; nine in Thane; seven in Mira-Bhayander; six in Pimpri-Chinchwad; five in Vasai-Virar; four each in Aurangabad, Buldhana and Kalyan-Dombivli; one each in Ahmednagar, Dhule, Nashik, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Raigad and Yavatmal. Of the 11 deaths in Maharashtra, nine were in Mumbai and one each in Pune and Mira-Bhayander.The state took 30 days to cross the 1,000-case mark on April 7, while it crossed the 2,000 mark in just six days on April 13. The state health department is not perturbed by the doubling of cases as the spread of the virus is still in stage two or the local transmission stage, where disease transmission is limited to those with travel history to affected countries or those in contact with the infected person.State health commissioner Anup Kumar Yadav said the coronavirus spread is not “exponential” and is under control. “We are still in stage two of transmission. The spread is now in clusters, but it is not exponential. Our cluster containment plans are showing results and it is not going out of control. Any infectious disease has a growth pattern. One is the way it is growing now, and the other is it growing exponentially, which is seen in some other countries. We are confident that the measures we have taken at an early stage are well-placed; it is responding well. So it should not go out of control,” Yadav said.According to Yadav, the state is conducting an average of 3,000 coronavirus tests daily, and he attributed the increasing number of cases to aggressive testing too. The state government, he said, is now awaiting antibody test kits from the Centre to carry out “rapid testing”. “We are waiting for the kits. It would be first used by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). We do not plan to use it elsewhere in the state. Besides, we are also awaiting the Centre’s nod for pool testing permission, which the state had sought,” he said.Malegaon in Nashik district has seen a surge in the number of coronavirus cases. On Monday, 14 cases were reported from the area, taking the tally to 29. It is being looked at as another cluster where the spread had spiked. The district authorities in conjunction with the municipal council are looking at demarcating containment areas in Malegaon.Meanwhile, the state government is considering allowing industrial operations across the state except for areas of Mumbai and Pune, which has a high number of coronavirus case. State industries minister Subhash Desai held a review meeting on Monday and had directed the department to submit a proposal on where the MSME and other industries can be reopened.“Excluding the areas of Mumbai and Pune, which has a high number of Covid-19 cases, a proposal should be prepared to allow industries to start their operations with certain restrictions in the rest of the districts of the state,” said Desai, in a statement.Desai further asked the department to give priority to food processing units that would provide relief to farmers. These units would also provide employment to labourers, said Desai, adding that all these things will be put before the chief minister for approval.Senior state government officials said the state has so far not decided to relax lockdown measures in the areas that are less affected by the outbreak. Senior officials also added that no decision on colour-coding districts has been taken so far. Thackeray held a meeting with divisional commissioners and senior police officials on Monday to take stock of the situation.On the lockdown extension, a notification issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Monday read “It is expedient to take measures further to contain the spread of coronavirus, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 2 of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 the state government directs that the lockdown orders shall now be extended up to and inclusive of April 30, 2020.”Officials said that the rising numbers of cases have forced the state government to extend lockdown till April 30 to prevent the state from slipping in to phase three — community spread — of Covid-19 outbreak.“It was necessary to extend the lockdown period as the state has been the worst-hit by the pandemic and more than a hundred cases are coming per day for more than a week. The spread can be arrested only with the help of a lockdown,” said a senior official requesting anonymity.“We are planning to give relaxations in areas that are not affected or have minimal cases. We have advised to allow to start industries with conditions such as they will have to accommodate workforce if not at the work place, then somewhere near the workstation so that workers won’t have to commute and social distancing can be maintained,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.There won’t be any relaxations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune Metropolitan Region, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-jumps-from-1-000-virus-cases-to-2-000-in-six-days/story-HqgS2s3y5trkySpfCeCovK.html

As a result, the MC has decided to add more lockers to make space for urns that have not been collected by the families of the deceased.While several in the town had asked the UT administration to issue them special transit passes to Haridwar so they could immerse the ashes in Ganga river, MC’s medical health officer Dr Amrit Warring said there were no directions from the UT to issue such passes to the relatives of the deceased.“Therefore, extra lockers are being provided for safekeeping of the urns till the time these are not handed over to their relatives,” he said. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) local convenor Prem Garg said that the cremation ground is full of urns as nobody is taking them to immerse in Ganga due to the lockdown. “I request the administration to issue special transit passes to the relatives to take these and immerse these in sacred rivers,” he said.He added, “I, too, offer to take all those unclaimed urns to Haridwar in a vehicle and immerse all these after performing collective rituals at the ghat on behalf of the relatives of the dead.”A senior official of the UT administration, who did not wish to be named, said they had issued few transit passes recently, but the visitors were not allowed to enter Haridwar. “I had also spoken with the Haridwar district magistrate, who said no one was allowed to enter the city for performing last rites till the time the lockdown is in place,” he said. He added that the effort is to increase the number of lockers in order to ensure safety of the urns. “Since the cremation ground is under the MC, they are taking all possible measures to increase resources,” he said.There is no official figure on the number of unclaimed urns lying with the MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-absence-of-lockers-urns-hang-from-trees-at-chandigarh-cremation-ground/story-yK0ltZI0jQ9nAHFZzyMGtK.html

14-04-2020||City||Summer break in Chandigarh government schools from April 15 to May 15||In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent curfew imposed in the city, the UT administration on Monday decided to advance summer vacations in schools.During the daily review meeting chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore, it was decided that all government schools and government-aided schools — around 115 with more than 1.5 lakh students — will have summer vacations from April 15 to May 15. Private schools have been advised to adopt the same schedule. The 21-day curfew, which was imposed on March 24, is all set to be extended by at least another two weeks, said a senior UT official, privy to the development, adding that the decision to advance summer vacations was taken in view of it.POWER, WATER BILLS, PROPERTY TAX DEFERREDThe last date for payment of electricity bills already issued has been extended from April 15 to April 30. The decision will benefit around 2.25 lakh consumers in the city.The administration has also decided that electricity bills for the next bill cycle will be issued on average basis as direct meter reading is not possible. If any consumer wants to take their own meter readings for actual consumption bill, they may send a WhatsApp or text message to the subdivisional officer (SDO) concerned. From divisions number 1 to 10, the phone numbers are 80541045-01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, and 10, respectively.Due to closure of Sampark centres, electricity consumers can make digital payments at sampark.chd.nic.in and through esampark Chandigarh mobile app.Late payment surcharge has been fixed at 1% per month instead of 2% per month from March 24 to June 30.A moratorium on payment of fixed charges is provided to all industrial and commercial consumers for the bills raised during the period from March 24 to June 30. These deferred charges will be covered in an equated manner over the next three bills to be raised after June 30.The administration has also deferred the recovery of municipal and cow cess charges in electricity bills.Similarly, the payment of water charges and recovery of property tax imposed by the municipal corporation have also been deferred till further orders.Also, with curfew expected to continue, easing of restrictions is expected for home delivery of food, private clinics and people walking in early hours, said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/summer-break-in-chandigarh-government-schools-from-april-15-to-may-15/story-IL1WuSCCkMXioiVM2sZrUM.html
14-04-2020||Ranchi||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, Jharkhand hints at parole for Lalu Prasad||The Jharkhand government on Monday sought the advocate general’s views on the possibility of granting parole to incarcerated Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad who is undergoing treatment at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). Lalu, who is serving imprisonment for his role in the fodder scam, is under treatment in the private ward of RIMS here. The hospital is also the dedicated state Covid hospital where seven positive cases are now under treatment.The issue was discussed in the cabinet on Monday. “The chief minister has taken a serious view of the issue. He called the advocate general in the cabinet meeting and has sought legal opinion over the issue. He will soon give his advice,” agriculture minister Badal Patralekh said after the cabinet meeting. Backing a parole for the former Bihar CM, the minister said he stands the risk of being infected as he is in old and is in proximity to the building where Covid-19 patients are being treated.Last week, the Jharkhand government had said the decision to release Lalu Prasad and other prisoners on parole would be decided by the respective courts.The 72-year-old former chief minister of undivided Bihar has been serving a jail term after his conviction in the fodder scam in December 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/amid-covid-19-pandemic-jharkhand-hints-at-parole-for-lalu-prasad/story-odMtOVvC8JyaoHNNQI7VXP.html
14-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh PGI to inject hope with plasma therapy trials in critical Covid patients||The Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is planning to start convalescent plasma therapy for Covid patients, wherein blood plasma from those who have recovered from the infection will be infused into critical patients.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said: “PGI is planning to start a trial of blood plasma therapy, wherein plasma from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient will be taken and its anti-bodies transfused into another critically ill patient. This will boost the patients immune system which could help fight the virus.”He said paper work for the therapy has been started and they will soon begin trials. Explaining the therapy, a doctor from PGI’s blood transfusion department, not wishing to be named, said, “We all know that a recovered patient has developed antibodies. In this trial, blood plasma will be taken from one who has recovered from Covid. This plasma, which is expected to contain antibodies specific to the novel coronavirus, will be transfused into a critically sick patient to boost recovery.”He said only those patients will be included in the plasma therapy trial who have completed 28 days of recovery and it cannot be done without their permission.He said trials for the investigational new drug will begin after taking due clearances. “We are making a project proposal to be sent to drug controller general of India (DCGI) for clearance. Apart from this, the Indian council of medical research (ICMR) has also sought entries from hospital that wish to start the trial. We, too, will also write to ICMR,” he said.It will take at least two weeks to get all clearances, he added. “The four departments – internal medicine, blood transfusion, virology and preventive and social health – are working together for this. We are positive this therapy will help critically ill patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-pgi-to-inject-hope-with-plasma-therapy-trials-in-critical-covid-patients/story-YuvSXXSnPdWFIZ78ndk4FN.html
14-04-2020||City||Costly labour, curbs on movement rock the boat for Mohali farmers in harvest season||His face covered with a white cloth, a sickle in his hands, Ashok Kumar from Uttar Pradesh is busy harvesting the wheat crop in Dayalpura village, Dera Bassi, for which he will be paid ₹400 per day with ration and food.“Ghar ja nahi sakte thay, paise thay nahi jab se kaam band hai, so ab fasal kaat rahe hain (couldn’t go back home, didn’t have money, so now I am harvesting wheat),” said Ashok, who worked as a labourer at a construction site before the curfew was imposed. It was difficult for a few days but now they will be able to earn some money, he said.He and scores of other migrant labourers have picked up the sickle to harvest wheat for landowners whose farm labour is not available owing to restrictions on movement from one state to another.NO CHOICE BUT MANUAL HARVESTING Amid complaints of high labour cost and restriction on movement, Mohali farmers have started harvesting crops. Farmers who earlier opted for combines now have no choice but to opt for manual harvesting as their labourers are not back yet. Where labour is not available at all, family members are picking up the sickle and toiling in the fields.“In Dera Bassi and Zirakpur area, migrants are being employed to harvest wheat and they are doing it readily. Earlier, construction work was a priority for labourers due to better wages, but the curfew has stalled all work so the labour force is willing to harvest the crop. In return, farmers will pay them in cash or kind, depending on their agreement,” said Amrik Singh Malkhpur, a landholder in Malkpur village, Dera Bassi. He also said that social distancing was being maintained during manual harvesting.Harpal Singh Sodhi of Dera Bassi owns land in Dayalpura and is facing trouble in going to his fields. “They don’t stop a tractor but moving on a two-wheeler is a complete no-no. The labour is charging ₹5,000 to ₹6,000 per acre along with ration. This will make it expensive for the farmer.”Rajinder Singh Bhanojia, sarpanch of Bhanojia village in Mullanpur, said that construction labour was charging ₹400 per day along with ration. “Manual harvesting is slow and so the farmer will end up paying more. Combines will be allowed only after April 15,” he said.COMBINES IN DAY TIME ONLY Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has issued orders that combine harvesters will be allowed to operate only from 6 am to 7 pm.Pradeep Bhatnagar of Dera Bassi said that combines were available but restrictions in the use of combines will slow down harvesting. He said, “Farmers will have to spend more. With farm labour not available as they couldn’t return after Holi, farmers will face a tough time taking their grain to mandis. Migrants are available but they are asking a high price.”The district administration will be issuing special pass​es indicating the date on which farmers will be entitled to carry their produce to the mandi. Social distancing norms will be strictly followed by the labour as well as the government staff at the mandis. Special steps are being taken to provide masks, sanitisers and soaps in all the mandis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/costly-labour-curbs-on-movement-rock-the-boat-for-mohali-farmers-in-harvest-season/story-GB1kkKciDtRDcm2UbqD3xN.html
14-04-2020||Lucknow||Muslim cleric issues advisory for Ramzan||Leading Muslim cleric Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali has issued an advisory for Muslims on how to observe Ramzan during the lockdown. Farangi Mahali has appealed to all Muslims to follow the lockdown guidelines strictly during the holy month that is expected to begin from April 24. “Only those living inside mosque will read ‘Tarawih’ (extended prayers at the night after the Isha prayer during Ramzan) inside it while the rest can do the same at their home as coronavirus has to be controlled with the cooperation of every individual,” said Mahali who is also Imam of Eidgah Aishbagh.The Central government has enforced 21-day complete lockdown in the entire country to fight coronavirus pandemic. Though the lockdown period is supposed to end on April 14 but is likely to be extended.“In such case I advise all Muslims to follow the lockdown guidelines and maintain social distancing while fasting during this period. All Muslims are expected to pray at home for end of corona pandemic and things returning back to normal.”He also added that Iftar (ending the day’s fast) in mosque must be avoided and only those people living inside the mosque can perform iftari inside. Those who used to organise iftari for the poor and needy in the past can donate directly to the poor instead of making them assemble at a point. No one should assemble at the mosque.“I also call upon the people to ensure that no one sleeps hungry. Also people should carry out zakat (donation) as it is mandatory in Islam. Besides, everyone should try to read complete Quran Majeed during this holy period,” said Mahali, who is also the chairperson of the Islamic Centre of India.Similarly, Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, Imaam of Asafi Masjid, has also appealed to the members of the community to follow the lockdown guidelines during Ramzan.“Everyone should fast and pray inside their house for the end of the corona pandemic so that normalcy could return. There is no other alternative but to follow social distancing to save humanity. Even in Arab countries lockdown is implemented to control the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/muslim-cleric-issues-advisory-for-ramzan/story-5LaTjDZ4wox7GYNPFITwqO.html

The reports were getting delayed for the last one week, following a sharp rise in the number of people being tested in the district. All the reports have come from the National Institute of Biologicals in sector 62. The Aligarh Muslim University had also sent pending reports to NIB to reduce load. Officials were compiling the data till late Monday night.Referring to the cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, officials said at least 72 persons who had attended the Markaz meeting and their contacts are under government quarantine.“All the persons who have been found positive were already under quarantine at our government centres which shows that our strategy is working and we have managed to contain the spread. We have been keeping people under quarantine who are primary or secondary connections of the infected persons,” said Narendra Bhooshan, Chief Executive Officer, Greater Noida Authority.According to the officials, some of the identified coronavirus positive patients include a 34-year-old woman and her 11-year-old son from a group housing society in Sector 62. A 17-year-old girl from Eta Sector in Greater Noida and a 25-year-old man from Gaur City in Greater Noida West.Three of the latest cases are linked to the woman from Delhi, a lab technician attached with a private hospital in sector 62 who was found positive on April 7. The mother of the 11-year-old was the roommate of the 20-year-old nurse attached with the hospital. The child lived with their relative in the same sector. The man from Gaur City is also colleague of the 20-year-old.In another development, a 32-year-old man who killed himself at a quarantine centre on Sunday evening has been found negative for Covid-19. The person had allegedly jumped from the 7th floor balcony of the quarantine room at Galgotias University in Greater Noida. Officials received his reports on Monday. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-highest-spike-in-a-day-gb-nagar-reports-16-more-cases-total-at-80/story-JDGhRtE9Jhi3hPDlS7xe6N.html

It has been declared a containment zone with residents being tested and no one allowed to step out of their homes“I could never imagine all of this happening in the village because of me. I have been cursing myself ever since I tested positive. Initially I thought I had picked up the infection from a worker, but when they all tested negative I was shocked and till date I don’t know how the infection came to our village,” he told the Hindustan Times.‘Thankful for early detection’A panch or village official was required to interact with people, said Singh, who owned a business to decorate marriage palaces in the area. “I used to meet a lot of people every day. But I am thankful that due to early detection many people were saved, otherwise the number would have crossed 100,” he added.When asked why he and the sarpanch violated curfew orders, Malkit Singh said his house was right in front of a dharamshala (community centre) and meetings were held there by village officials to plan the distribution of essential supplies. “The mistake we made was that we did not maintain social distancing or wear masks as these were not available in the markets,” he said.‘God will take care of things’Speaking to HT, the sarpanch said she was praying for life to return to normal in her village. “We do not know what happened but the Almighty will make things right. I really feel sorry that our village has now become infamous, but we have faith in God and will win the battle against the disease. It may take some time, but the good old days will return,” she said.The sarpanch’s husband, admitted at Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur said the maximum persons infected in the hospital were their relatives. “It is a tough time for all of us. We request the villagers to stay indoors,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cursing-myself-since-i-tested-positive-for-covid-19-says-panch-of-punjab-hotspot/story-MGWedsDqG2buMXTGzFsaAL.html
14-04-2020||Lucknow||Yogi: Corona impact on China can be investment op for UP||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the Covid-19 (coronavirus) impact on China could be an investment opportunity in disguise for Uttar Pradesh. He also asked officers concerned to “take ‘strictest’ action against anyone who conceals Covid-19 infection or deliberately spreads it.”Yogi was speaking at a review meeting he held with the Covid-19 management ‘Team-11’ to review the lockdown scenario in the state. “Under the present global scenario, the US, Japan and several other countries intend to withdraw their investments from China. This could be an opportunity for Uttar Pradesh,” said Yogi, according to a statement issued by his office. He asked infrastructure and industrial development commissioner, principal secretary of MSME and principal secretary of industrial development to make proposals regarding this aspect.Yogi further said: “Identify anyone who hides the infection or attempts to deliberately spread it. Not only this, but also act against any district magistrate or district police chief if they commit any lapse on this count.”The chief minister, talking about the Covid-19 hotspots in the state, said testing for coronavirus must be ramped up in the hotspots. “Make categories in the hotspots and then put multiple teams to executive testing. Also, consolidate door-step delivery of essential items in the hotspots. Work so well that the people in the area get to notice the work being done for their benefit,” he said.Principal secretary, medical and health, Amit Mohan Prasad informed the chief minister that Pilibhit emerged as the first district in the state to have become a Covid-19-free district. All the coronavirus positive patients there have been cured.Yogi said that emergency and critical care should be restored in hospitals without compromising on coronavirus safety protocols. Principal secretary, medical education Rajneesh Dubey informed that the state had only one Covid-19 testing lab on March 3, now it has 14 operational testing labs. Yogi asked him to start a lab in Mathura too soon. Yogi asked the officers concerned to start making arrangements for sending home those persons who have completed 14-day quarantine at shelter homes. “Also, make arrangements for take-away food packets (of grains) for them before they start their homeward journey. Provide a list of such people with their names and addresses to the respective district administrations so that the administrations monitor them for their health status,” Yogi said.Taking about people from other states and countries stranded in UP, Yogi said, “Contact them and sort out their pro​blems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-corona-impact-on-china-can-be-investment-op-for-up/story-UEd9KGCYTXSTC7kYvUZRQO.html
14-04-2020||Noida||‘Ceasefire’, Noida’s own Covid-19 super spreader company||Contrary to its name and nature of work, a Sector 135-based security and fire safety solutions company ‘Ceasefire’ has put lakhs of residents of Gautam Budh Nagar at risk of contracting the deadly Covid-19 virus and offered no solution on how to make them safe.After the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which accounted for 1,071 Covid-19 cases in Delhi -- about two-thirds of the total cases confirmed of 1,510 (till Monday) -- Ceasefire has emerged as the second biggest super-spreader in NCR.The company was directly, and indirectly, responsible for a majority of Covid-19 positive cases in Gautam Budh Nagar, prompting the Uttar Pradesh government to declare 13 areas of the district as Covid-19 hot spots. Till Monday evening, of the 68 cases in the district, 41 have been linked to Ceasefire – about 64% of all cases – while another 13 cases have been found in other parts of India, taking the overall tally of Ceasefire-related cases to 54.The nightmare started on March 16, after an auditor of the company complained about symptoms of Covid-19. The visiting auditor had come from the UK. The company’s managing director, too, had returned from the UK on March 1, while another employee had returned on March 7.Shockingly, instead of being isolated by the administration, they themselves volunteered to go into quarantine, which they jumped soon after. The MD is still at the isolation ward of a hospital, despite two of his reports coming negative for the disease as doctors believe he is an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. “Nobody wants to spread a pandemic in society. The moment we noticed that our company has become the source of infection, we asked all employees to go into quarantine and take tests of Covid-19. But, we didn’t anticipate the speed of the spread and by the time things got worse, many lapses had happened on our part as well,” the MD said.When asked why his company had concealed the travel history of its employees, he refused to answer.According to the administration, all three persons jumped their quarantine and were attending office, consequently spreading the virus among other employees and then to their family members. The district administration and the health department proved a colossal failure to check the spread of the disease in its nascent stages, with the result that the company and the cases it gave rise to became the root cause for the transfer of then district magistrate BN Singh and chief medical officer Dr Anurag Bhargava. In a meeting with district officials on March 30, chief minister Yogi Adityanath expressed his displeasure with these officials for their inability to contain the surge in Covid-19 cases and divested them of their duties. While Bhargava refused comment on this, BN Singh said that he had done what “was deemed best at that time”.The first thing that the new district magistrate Suhas LY did upon taking charge on March 31 was to seal the Ceasefire premises and sanitise it. But that was too little, too late.The first Ceasefire employee had tested positive for Covid-19 on March 17 and by March 25, 12 employees were positive. But even then, no one from the health department or the district administration bothered to visit the company. Ceasefire employees said security guards were reporting for duty even after so many employees had tested positive.Company officials claim that it had asked all its employees to stay at home after the first case was reported. But due to 21-day nationwide lockdown from March 25, instead of staying put at home, several of them went back to their respective hometowns. A Ceasefire employee, preferring anonymity, said, “At first, I didn’t understand why the company asked us to remain on leave. I knew of their mischief only when my wife, mother and son tested positive for Covid-19. They are now in the isolation ward. But, since I am not positive for the disease, on the doctors’ opinion that I may be a carrier, I have put myself in quarantine,” he said.When the state government found that the company had succeeded in giving the slip to the administrative and health authorities – by breaking the quarantine periphery – it asked the Noida police to step in for some fire fighting.The Noida police collected employee details and started coordinating with the police in other districts from April 1. Commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said it was really hard to reconnect the broken links. “There were many torn links in the case. The toughest task was to solve the matrix, to identify the super spreaders (person responsible for transmitting the disease to most others),” he said.With the intervention of the Noida police, the administration was finally able to carry out contact tracing of infected persons and get a handle on consequent infections using comprehensive coding. Sample this: Of the total 162 of employees at Ceasefire, 23 tested positive. “Ceasefire employees spread the virus to persons in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, besides to many in districts of Meerut, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar,” Singh said.The police chief further said so far, the police have established telephonic conversations with over 1,200 B parties (contacts) of infected persons, living in different states and have also established direct or indirect contact with all employees of the company.“All of them have been put under home quarantine and we are in regular touch with them. While 26 persons have been found to be primary infections, 28 others have been declared as secondary infections,” he said.Explaining the coding process, Singh said employees of the company have been marked with abbreviated code of Ceasefire, i.e. CF-1, CF-2 and others. “For the B-parties – who were in contact with the employees – we have given codes like CF-1/1, CF-1/2 and so on. For the C-parties – who were not in the direct contact with the employees, but in the contact with B-parties, the code is like CF-1/1/1, CF-1/1/2 and so on. With these codes, we are now able to establish whether the new cases have any connection with the companies or not,” he said. Singh further said that a similar sort of coding for everyone who lives or works in GB Nagar, is already on the cards, to trace out the cases systematically. “A complete database is a must to win this crisis. We are safe till we are able to trace out cases and their sources. The moment the tracing chain will be broken, our situation will be dire,” he said.Dr Saurav Srivastava, the head of Covid-19 ward at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, also agrees that systematic contact tracing is a must.“There is a hairline difference between an infected person and a carrier. It is not necessary that a carrier will always test positive for Covid-19,” he said.In the context of Ceasefire-related cases, Dr Srivastava said it is still a mystery that two persons from the company, who are believed to be the key sources of infection, had tested negative in repeated tests.“In cases of this nature, it is hard to identify the exact source. Strangely, four other Ceasefire employees were also found negative in tests, but 12 of their family members were found positive for Covid-19. As a doctor, I can’t rule out that they might have overcome the infection at an early stage – maybe due to a strong immunity,” he said.Earlier, the Expressway police had lodged an FIR against Ceasefire under Section 45 (offences committed within India), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.The FIR was lodged on the orders of the chief medical officer for hiding the foreign travel history of a few employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ceasefire-noida-s-own-covid-19-super-spreader-company/story-mDqszFJCD5QQvfHdv22uKL.html

About 32 others were arrested for venturing out without masks and 18 FIRs registered.A number of Punjab and Haryana bureaucrats were among 466 rounded up and let off with a warning.The special drive to nab walkers was carried out in 120 parks across the city, including 40 in the central sub-division, 35 in the east and 45 in the south sub-divisions.Police stations under which maximum arrests were made included Sarangpur with 98 persons in six cases; Sector 11 with seven persons in two cases; Sector 3 with six persons in one case; Sector 26 with 15 persons in six cases; Industrial Area with nine persons; Sector 19 with three persons and Sector 34 with nine persons in five cases.Majority from colony areasA majority of the people arrested by Sarangpur police are from colony areas. “They went for walks in the morning even after repeated warnings,” said a police official.Among those arrested were a 26-year-old B Tech graduate working in a private firm in Mohali and a 35-year-old man with a degree from an Australian university working for an international firm, said a Sector 19 police station official, requesting anonymity.The Punjab and Haryana bureaucrats rounded up were let off with a warning, said a senior police official carrying out the drive.“Senior citizens too were rounded but they cited health problems as the reason why they needed to walk,” said a police official posted in the south subdivision. Without masksOf the 32 arrested without masks, 14 were from the east sub-division in 13 cases. Only two cases were registered in the central sub-division with 11 persons; and three cases with seven arrests in the south.Commenting on the drive, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagadale said, “The crackdown will continue till the time people completely adhere to the prohibitory orders. They need to understand that it is being done for their welfare and keeping their safety in mind. Anybody found going for a walk will be booked immediately.”The cases are being registered under section 188 (disobedience of order promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, under which a person can be fined up to Rs 1,000 and be imprisoned for up to six months.The chief patron of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) and president of the Senior Citizen Council of Sector 38, Major (retd) DP Singh, said, “All RWAs and senior citizen groups had messaged members to abstain from morning walks to stop the spread of Covid-19. The police must continue to take action against people not following orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/150-arrested-for-venturing-out-of-house-for-morning-walk-in-chandigarh/story-ItAz6ahCMr4vqy1negOD8H.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||What makes an area a red zone?||Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim and Sadar Bazar in Old Delhi, G and D blocks of Nizamuddin West in the south-east district, and B block in north-west Delhi’s Jahangirpuri, apart from the two designated coronavirus disease hot spots at Nizamuddin Basti and Dilshad Garden, are among the 47 containment zones declared by the Delhi government to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).But the reason why these areas have been picked for greater curbs are varied -- from population density, to awareness, to a cluster of infections, to proximity to high-risk areas, to the inability to track the source of infection. Multiple state government officials HT spoke to said that there were no common rules, guidelines or checklists to define containment zones. An order by the Delhi government’s directorate general health services, dated April 12 said that containment activity can be undertaken “even if there is a clustering of three cases.” But the order also said that a final decision will be “taken on the ground by the district authorities as per the geographical boundaries of the area of the cluster”.“The aim is to stop the chain on of transmission of Covid-19. We are declaring an area a containment zone, even if there is just one case but if we feel there is a threat of clustering or community transmission. While basic guidelines have been given to district administration, but the final decision is left to the medical team and the district magistrate at the ground level,” said a senior district official who asked not to be named.So, for example, Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim and Sadar Bazaar were sealed after small clusters of Covid-19 cases was reported in these areas; parts of Nizamuddin West neighbourhood were declared containment zones because of their proximity to Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti; and Vardhaman Apartments in Mayur Vihar was declared a “red zone” though there was just one case reported because the common areas and utilities of the society were found hard to protect from contamination.While there is a 21-day lockdown in place across the country, the containment zones have stricter restrictions. People living here -- the zone could be a block, a street, a plot, or just a building -- are not allowed to step out of their houses, and essentials are home-delivered directly by the authorities.They are also subjected to the Delhi government’s enhanced safety protocols -- described last week by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as “Operation SHIELD”. The S stands for sealing, H for home-quarantine, I for isolation and tracing, E for essential supplies, L for local sanitisation, and D for door-to-door checking. “The objective is to contain the area so that proper disinfection of the neighbourhood and screening of residents can be done to avoid further spread of the virus. A neighbourhood in south Delhi’s Deoli was declared a containment zone after eight members of a family were found positive with Covid-19. Similarly, some areas around the Markaz building in Nizamuddin were turned into containment zones after many people evacuated from there were tested positive with Covid-19,” said joint commissioner of police (southern range) Devesh Chandra Srivastava.While these parameters seem obvious and objective, the selection of areas where there are no more than one or two cases is more complicated, and based on subjective calls by health officials.A second senior government official who asked not to be named said that one of the key parameters considered while deciding these areas required enhanced containment was unclear source of infection, which could be a sign of “community transmission” -- the third stage of the spread of any infection in which the chain of contamination can no longer be established. Once stage three sets in (the first two stages are travel history and local transmission), the next level is epidemic.There are several containment zones where only one case was reported. These include Gandhi Park in Malviya Nagar, and the slum cluster at South Moti Bagh (south Delhi); H and E blocks of Abu Fazal Enclave, Garhi village in East of Kailash, and Mahella Mohalla in Madanpur Khadar (south-east Delhi); and Kalyanpuri, Khichripur and Pandav Nagar in (east Delhi). “A majority of these areas are thickly populated. To break the chain of transmission of the virus, it was felt necessary to declare them as containment zones and screen all the people even though in some areas the patients have recovered. In some areas, the contact history of the patient is yet to be traced due to which chances of more testing positive area high. We are screening all the households in the containment areas and also doing testing of suspected cases,” said the second official cited above.The “densely populated” theme runs across at least 25 of the 47 zones and includes the working-class neighbourhoods of Kalyanpuri, Khichripur, Madanpur Khadar, Jaitpur Extension, Deoli and Sangam Vihar, where officials say the awareness of social distancing is limited as compared to the city’s relatively upscale colonies.“To ensure that the spread of the disease is contained, some aggressive measures have to be taken else it can lead to community transmission. This may be the reason why some of the areas have been declared as containment zones despite just 1-2 cases being reported from there,” said DrJugal Kishore, head of the department community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.In south-west Delhi’s Mahavir Enclave, which was declared a containment zone on Sunday, a nurse working at a hospital that has a Covid isolation ward was diagnosed last week. Her two children and a neighbour also tested positive. “It’s a dense pocket where people interact frequently. So the risk of transmission is very high. We tested as many as 70 persons in the containment area today, and the results are awaited,” an official said.Several officials said the biggest problem Delhi was facing was the possibility of “clustering” in residential localities. “With the movement of residents restricted in containment zones, the district administrations have got some success in slowing down the transmission. Extensive door-to-door screening in each containment zone is also helping identify new cases,” said the first official. Some of the areas where clustering appears to have occurred -- apart from Nizamuddin Basti and Dilshad Garden -- are in central Delhi. Of the 13 deaths reported in the district, five were reported in Chandni Mahal and four in Sadar Bazaar.“Out of 102 people staying in 13 different locations in the Chandni Mahal area, 52 have tested positive. The interaction between people who tested positive and residents of Chandni Mahal can’t be ruled out,” according to the Friday order designating the area a containment zone, issued by the Delhi government’s Central Zone district magistrate, Nidhi Srivastava.“When Sadar Bazar was declared a containment area there were seven cases and now there are 18 Covid-19 positive cases,” said a senior central district official aware of the development.The government says that its “SHIELD programme” is also allowed them to test those with symptoms, isolate and treat patients, and stop further transmission.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday had said that Dilshad Garden, a Covid-19 hot spot, was “Coronavirus free” with no new cases reported in the last 10 days due to measures taken under the SHIELD programme. Dilshad Garden was among the first areas to be declared a containment zone on April 8.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) backed the Delhi government’s decision to declare 47 containment zones. “It is a good thing they are doing by declaring containment zone even if there is one case reported from the area. If these measures are not taken right now, the situation will boomerang. Contact tracing and surveillance is the key to contain the spread of transmission of this disease,” Dr Kant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/what-makes-an-area-a-red-zone/story-91MOdLOYTeGTUrXHIF083I.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||356 new cases in Delhi: Highest spike puts count at 1,510||The number of confirmed coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital jumped to 1,510 after 356 -- nearly twice the previous high for single-day new cases -- more people were found with the virus. Over 90% of the new infections detected are among people evacuated from the Nizamuddin building of the Tablighi Jamaat.Monday’s numbers underline a trend seen since the end of March: 70% of all new cases in Delhi are from those who were evacuated from the building, where they shared space in close quarters. Of the 1,451 active infections, 49 are in the intensive care unit with five of them on ventilator. So far, samples from 15,032 people have been collected in Delhi and result of 1,008 were awaited till Monday evening.“Most of the 998 samples that remain to be tested in government labs are from the people evacuated under the special operation,” said a Delhi government official. The government stopped referring to the cases linked to the Nizamuddin cluster as those from the ‘Markaz’, replacing it with ‘special operations’. The city reported four more deaths on Monday, taking the death toll due to the illness to 28. A break-up of the 24 deaths reported till Sunday showed that half of the deaths were in one hospital – Dr Ram Manohar Lohia. The hospital has treated only 34 of the 1,120 cases in the city. The death rate at the hospital is a whopping 35%, whereas the death rate among the other cases are just 1%.“Most of the Covid deaths that have occurred in our hospital are of patients who were referred from other hospitals at an advanced stage and had significant comorbidities. The patients who are attending our hospital early in their course of disease or do not have significant comorbidities are faring very well,” said the hospital in a statement.“Whenever such kind of statistic is presented, the first thing we need to see is whether the hospital is receiving the highest number of cases or the most critical cases. And, that is what must have happened. Initially, RML was the only testing centre and it was the first hospital people were getting admitted to. So, most of the critical cases remained there, that could be the reason for the high mortality rate,” according to Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicineSome blame it on the infrastructure. “It is a new medical college, the facility is smaller and the equipment is not advanced, all these issues definitely play a role in mortality,” said a doctor from a government hospital, on condition of anonymity. At least seven more health care workers from two private hospitals in the city have tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, taking the tally of doctors, nurses, technicians, and sanitation staff with the infection in the city to 55. Of these, 23 are from the Delhi State Cancer Institute, which has become a hotspot for Covid-19. Four patients and the relative of one have also tested positive for the infection. A 2-year-old boy, the son of one of the nursing staff who tested positive earlier, also tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/356-new-cases-in-delhi-highest-spike-puts-count-at-1-510/story-rW1SY80ifhnbzY3byuU4DO.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||In pandemic-hit city, Emoha steps up to help the elderly||Sixty-nine-year-old Sneh Grover, a resident of west Delhi’s Maya Enclave, was worried when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown from March 25, to control the spread of Covid-19.Grover lives with her husband, and reports of senior citizens being more vulnerable to the virus had only added to her panic. Last week, however, her problem was solved when Varun Suri stepped forward.Suri is a volunteer with Emoha Elder Care, a tech start-up offering solutions that enable elders to comfortably live at home. Emoha has been providing services for senior citizens across Delhi and the neighbouring satellite towns for over two years, and recently launched a special programme ‘Elders First, Ghar pe Rahiye’ to help senior citizens in Delhi-NCR survive the lockdown. Emoha volunteers, while delivering essentials at doorsteps, also ensure their own safety by strictly following social distancing norms.In a span of two weeks, more than 2,500 volunteers signed up to help out the elderly purchase their everyday essentials, so that they do not risk their health by stepping out. With Covid-19 cases on the rise in the region, Emoha has launched a free 24x7 helpline — 1800-123-44-5555 — for senior citizen needs.Hindustan Times has partnered with Emoha to cater to the needs of the elderly.From delivering essential commodities at their doorsteps to providing emergency ambulance coordination, virtual doctor consults and even virtual recreational activities, Emoha is going all out to help out the elderly as the pandemic rages on in the city.Saumyajit Roy, CEO and co-founder of Emoha, said they have stepped up their operations considering the elderly needed the most care, during such a crisis. He said that along with expanding their volunteer base, the caregiver service is now also roping in more health care experts to have sessions with their clients to ease the panic around the infection. He added: “Emoha’s strength lies in the fact that our elders feel comfortable calling us for any help they need and we encourage young people to come forward and join us to make this happen.”To register as a volunteer with Emoha Elder Care, people need to sign up on their website www.emoha.com or download the Emoha Responder App on Google Play/iOS store. Likewise, an elder seeking help can also sign up on Emoha’s website, which has over registered 2,600 senior citizens.Explaining how Emoha functions, Roy said most volunteers cater to senior citizens living in their vicinity. For instance, he says, when a senior citizen calls the Emoha helpline to place a request like help with grocery delivery from a neighbourhood, the request will be flashed to all volunteers in the area; these volunteers can then coordinate and buy the required items. Since the requests are forwarded from with a vicinity, volunteers do not have to depend on any mode of transportation to complete the task., and Emoha recommends the elders reimburse the volunteers through digital payments.In Gurugram, the startup has also collaborated with the police to cater to the needs of seniors.Sharing his experience with the service, 63-year-old Murli Das, a resident of east Delhi, said he requested Emoha to help him get two of his wife’s medicines, which he was unable to find in his neighbourhood medical stores because of lockdown restrictions.“The volunteer was a young man named Kamal. He called to assure me that he will find the medicines as soon as he can. Within a few hours, he was at my doorstep. It had been many days since we had spoken to a friendly voice from outside, it felt nice,” Das said in a video message.“In such times when stepping out means risking your lives, it is important to care for our elders. In a day I get three to four calls from my area for the delivery of basic requirements like vegetables and groceries. I just have to buy some extra while I buy some for my own house,” said Shafiq, another volunteer from Emoha.Health experts said such initiatives were welcome because it was important for senior citizens to stay at home. “Anyone above the age of 50 years need to be extra careful. The elderly have compromised immunity and their lungs take more time clearing up. All these factors make them extremely vulnerable to coronavirus,” said Ravi Shekhar Jha, senior consultant and head of department, pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Hospital, Faridabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-pandemic-hit-city-emoha-steps-up-to-help-the-elderly/story-ruXFKN73yLMDgkhuqXEzRN.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi doctor couple quarantined together caught up with friends and each other||Getting back in touch with old friends and spending hours talking to his wife – this summed up the experience of Dr Mohinder Sardana, 62, at the isolation facility of Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Rohini, where he was admitted after testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). His wife, Poonam Sardana, 61, a gynaecologist who worked at the same clinic, was also infected and admitted to the same room. “The facilities at the hospital were great; I got to share a room with my wife. We were served good breakfast, lunch and dinner. The doctors and staff were very nice and polite. But 14 days is a long time. I called up my friends from medical college and some people I haven’t talked to in years. My wife and I also had the time to just sit and talk to each other, which we miss out during our routine,” Dr Sardana said. He also used the time to watch some movies on his phone and read up a little.“I even got calls from some of my patients who came to know that I had Covid-19,” he said. He and his wife were discharged on Monday after testing negative for the infection twice consecutively.So far, at least 51 healthcare workers across the city have contracted the disease. Dr Sardana has been working at his clinic in North Delhi’s GTB Nagar for 38 years now. He has been treating people with fever and cough for as long as he can remember, but one such patient who came to his clinic in the first two weeks of March passed on the infection to him.Watch:  Delhi’s Dr Mohinder Sardana’s coronavirus experience in isolation ward“I had a slight fever on March 23, nothing out of the ordinary. So, I just had paracetamol and got back to work. Two days later, the fever came back. I also developed a cough that worsened the next day. This got me worried. I closed my clinic and went to get myself tested at one of the private labs. The report came back positive for Covid-19,” Sardana said. A total of 1,154 people in the city have contracted the infection and 24 have died of it. Once he tested positive, his wife – a gynaecologist who works at the same clinic – their maid, and five employees went to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital to get tested for the infection.“They collected our samples and admitted all of us to the isolation ward in the hospital,” Dr Sardana said. His wife and one of their employees tested positive for the infection on March 30.“I must have passed on the infection to her, as she had stopped going to the clinic about a week before the nationwide lockdown was announced. But what is concerning is that the surveillance teams haven’t been able to trace who passed on the infection to me,” Dr Sardana said. The surveillance teams collected the details of hundreds of patients who had visited his clinic about a week before he started showing symptoms. “My register was locked at the clinic, so I provided some of the numbers on my phone. They also tracked my phone to find the other people I might have come in contact with. They also screened people in a 2km radius of my clinic, but nobody was found positive,” he said.Apart from the fever and cough he had for a couple of days, he did not experience any other symptoms. “As for my wife and employee, their symptoms were even milder. They just had a body ache for a couple of days, took some pain medicine and were fine,” Dr Sardana said.“If the symptoms are so mild, how can we expect to know who is Covid-19 positive and who is not? I am a doctor; I suspected it so I got myself tested. Nobody else would even think of getting the test done for such mild symptoms,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-doctor-couple-quarantined-together-caught-up-with-friends-and-each-other/story-9DTg4CpiS3C016KNng76TP.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||In areas where social distancing not followed, shops to shut early||At several places across the city where the police have received complaints of residents not following social distancing, shopkeepers have been instructed by the police to shut retail shops by 6pm. Retail shop owners in different parts of the city said they were instructed by the police to close shop before the evening rush. Senior Delhi police officers said that police stations across the city are discussing with market welfare associations the different ways to prevent crowding, such as closing early or allowing shops to open at different times of the day. The police are yet to issue a formal order to implement this across the city. Several shopkeepers said they started closing early on the police’s orders, while some said they were doing so on their own. Raj Arora, who owns a grocery store in East of Kailash, which has three containment zones (areas sealed to contain the spread of Covid-19) around, said they were closing their shop before 6pm. “In the evening, the queues get longer. We were told to maintain social distancing norms by the local police else we could be booked. After some areas were sealed, it was decided that we will open the shops only till 3pm to restrict the movement of those who come out in the evening,” Arora said.In nearby Kailash Colony and Greater Kailash-I M-block markets also, retailers said that two days ago, the area station house officer had asked them to shut shop by 6pm, as some crowding was observed around that time. “More movement was seen on the streets and the market around 6pm when people would just come out to get supplies. The two provisional stores and even vegetable vendors in the market now shut down by that time,” said Rajendra Sharda, president, GK-1 M-block market.Joint commissioner of police(southern range) Devesh Srivastava said the police are in touch with all market welfare associations. “We will ensure that people have access to essential items. At many places such as in Govindpuri, the market welfare association told us that they would decide the timings to open shops. They have assured us that they would do it in a staggered manner. Many other market associations have come up with their own ways of ensuring social distancing.” The police said they are focusing on social distancing at market places. Two station house officers were on Friday transferred from their post for failing to ensure social distancing. In north Delhi’s Ashok Vihar also, grocery store owners have decided to shut down early. “There was a lot of movement in the evening and hence the police asked us to close early. We have been closing down by 4pm for the past week,” Sandeep Bhatia, a shopowner in phase-2 Ashok Vihar, said.Several shopkeepers said that while they have been following orders, they are at the receiving end from both the police and the residents. Amit Dudeja, who owns a department store near Tara Apartments, Alaknanda, said that despite the circles drawn on the ground that designate waiting spots, people do not follow the rules of social distancing. “The police lodged a case against me last week for the same even though I had been following all the steps. It was just that people were not standing the way they were supposed to in the queue. Since then I decided to down my shutters by 3pm. Most people come to the market in the evening just to get out of their homes for which we have to pay a price,” Dudeja said.In places like Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal, which have been declared containment zones, the police are allowing shops to open for three hours in the morning and the evening. Deputy commissioner of police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said, “ The staggered timings are only for areas in containment zones. We are doing this to ensure social distancing. At the same time, we will ensure that people are not deprived of essential goods.” Senior government and police officers said that they have discussed different ways in which other countries have managed crowding at markets. If the number of cases continues to rise, the state government and police could issue gender-based lockdown rules such as allowing only men and women to shop on different days. In Peru and Italy, the government has ordered men to leave the house three days while allowing women to leave the other three. But several senior officers, who spoke to HT on condition on anonymity, said it was too early to even suggest such rules because the volume of cases in Delhi is comparatively lower than the cities of such countries. GOVERNMENT ON SOCIAL DISTANCING AT WHOLESALE MARKETSDevelopment Minister of Delhi Gopal Rai on Monday held a meeting with the members of the market associations of seven wholesale markets of Delhi. The government in a press statement said they have implemented an odd-even policy in the markets to avoid crowding. “...The odd-even scheme will allow sale at odd-numbered platforms in each shed on dates ending with 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 and even-numbered platforms on dates ending with 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8...The government has also directed a change in the timings... Vegetable markets will be open from 6am to 11am and fruit markets will be open from 2pm to 6 pm. The entry to these markets will be allowed only through coupons...” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-areas-where-social-distancing-not-followed-shops-to-shut-early/story-xTIVaxUQYTZyZsXlaOdzWK.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||Lives locked down, but learning spreads it wings online||Darshan Ram, 17, had not expected to begin his last year in school from home. Instead of leaving for school at 6.30 in the morning, the class 12 student of Bluebells School International now begins his day an hour later, in front of his computer screen.“My routine has changed since we have to attend online classes from home. I wake up only half an hour before classes begin. Since we have been asked to dress formally and not attend classes in night suits, I change my clothes, eat something, and then attend sessions between 8am and 12pm,” he said.For school-going children across the capital, a new academic session is generally marked with new books, bags, uniforms, and the excitement of starting another year with friends. However, with the rapid spread of Covid-19 cases and the subsequent shutting of all schools, most students and parents are now adjusting to a new alternative — online learning.While the switch from regular classes to digital happened in a flash, Ram isn’t complaining. After attending the online sessions, the Noida Sector 104 resident spends the next few hours completing assignments sent by his school via email. “None of us had ever imagined that we would start our final school year like this. One positive thing about the lockdown is that I’m getting a lot of time to do the things I’ve always wanted to. I’ve recently started a YouTube channel with my father where we upload skits on different topics,” Ram said. Both private and public schools in the capital have switched to online lessons via videoconferencing, recorded video and audio lectures, presentation slides, podcasts, portable document format (PDFs), worksheets and activities on emails. With homes turning into classrooms and books being replaced by computers and phones, the education sector is slowly being reshaped by the lockdown, leading to a shift in the lives and lifestyles of thousands of students, and their parents.Several students said the online mode has made learning more interesting. Himanshi Sanyal, a class 12 student at Mount Abu School in Rohini, said every morning, she looks forward to the online classes. “It becomes easier to understand topics with PPTs and visuals. We generally have 35-minute long sessions in school. But online, we are getting 45 minutes to an hour on each subject. We are getting more opportunities to learn and the responses to our queries are quicker,” she said.Some students, however, miss the fun and banter that a classroom with its desks and blackboard affords. “When we sit with friends, we understand things better and it is much more fun. That togetherness is what I miss now. Also, we are not used to sitting in front of the computer screen for four hours every day and it often causes my eyes to ache. I miss going to school,” Myra Chawla, 14, a class 10 student at KR Mangalam World School, said. School from home amid work from homeParents, too, are taking extra measures to adapt to the new lifestyle. Shreya Sharma, mother of a class 9 student at DPS Mathura Road, said parents have to maintain a classroom-like environment at home while their children are tuned in to a session. “We need to make sure that there is no noise in the background while our daughter attends her classes. Nobody enters the room where she sits with her laptop,” Sharma said.“I also sit with my daughters to get their assignments done since the coaching centres are also closed,” Suman, a lawyer, who has three school-going children, said.Some parents are making alternative arrangements for themselves so that their laptops are available for their children’s classes. Shantanu Sharma, a resident of Mayur Vihar-1 who works with an IT firm, said they have only one laptop at home. “I also have to work from home and have to stay connected to my office throughout the day. Now I’ve changed my shift timing so that the laptop remains available for my 13-year-old son till noon,” he said. New experience for teachers The shift in the medium has been a learning curve for teachers as well. They are now preparing e-learning material, while also adapting to new applications and the look and feel of an online class. Vineeta Nanda, a primary teacher at Mount Abu School, said although there were hiccups initially, things have become streamlined now. “We were all new to the apps. But students were excited from Day One. They are really ahead of us in terms of technology. The lockdown has given us an opportunity to brush up our IT skills and experiment with different methods of teaching. We are making videos and PPTs on every topic. That way, we are developing e-learning material that can be used later during regular classroom sessions as well,” she said.Some private schools also held special training sessions for teachers to make them capable of making the most of the new medium. Manju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International, said, “While our students and teachers are well trained in using online learning tools, the current situation is different and calls for extensive interactive classroom-like structure. We held a seven-day training session for our teachers from nursery to class 12 to handle this.”Is online the way forward?Ritu Madan, officiating principal at Springdales Dhaula Kuan, said her school is also experimenting with podcasts. Madan said her computer department was engaged in conducting training sessions for teachers on how to prepare educational podcasts. Other than that, the school is also encouraging students to use the CBSE’s learning apps.In a city that is no stranger to emergency school closures owing to everything from pollution to extreme weather conditions and political agitations, an alternative learning medium could be the answer to ensuring an uninterrupted academic session. Last year, the government had shut schools for over a week on account of severe pollution. In February, schools in northeast Delhi were shut due to communal riots. Several principals said with a proper online learning mechanism in place, students will not lose out on classes during situations when they are unable to reach schools. “Sometimes, senior students need online modules for clearing their doubts when they remain at home before exams. Also, schools are often suspended due to pollution or agitations and conflicts. That was why we were preparing an online teaching module. We wanted to create a learning model which would be sustainable in the future as well,” Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School in Saket, said.Are students ready for digital learning?Although India’s internet penetration stood at 52.08% in 2019, as per Telecom Regulatory Authority of India data, not many have access to high bandwidth internet connections or devices needed to facilitate online learning. Experts have pointed out that this will be an obstacle in making digital learning a viable alternative.“Right now, we have rushed into online learning, but solid groundwork is needed to make it a viable alternative. For instance, even if students do not have phones or computers at home, they don’t need to go all the way to school. They could go to a local shop or any shared space where they could download lessons and access the e-learning content,” educationist Meeta Sengupta said. “Proper pedagogies and supportive structures have to be designed. Schools should have an online community manager who could manage all content and content curation.”For now, schools have tasked groups of teachers to work closely with students who lack such computer devices and tools. For instance, Springdales Dhaula Kuan has teachers calling all such students and taking a regular update on their learning progress. “Almost all students are on WhatsApp at least. We have a separate group of teachers who ensure that learning material reaches them. The teachers also monitor the progress of the students by calling them,” Madan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lives-locked-down-but-learning-spreads-it-wings-online/story-HE9gL1NxbzpYHsqaroyvvM.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Three new containment zones in west Delhi, one more in Central Delhi||The Delhi government on Monday declared four new Covid-19 containment zones, taking the total of such zones in the national capital to 47. While three new containment zones are in west Delhi district, one is in central Delhi. Till Monday evening, Delhi recorded 1,510 Covid-19 cases and 28 deathsDays after five persons, from the same family, tested positive for Covid-19 in Paschim Vihar, another case was reported from the area but from a different locality -- Krishna Apartment, a middle-class neighbourhood. With this, there are two containment zones in Paschim Vihar. The other two containment zones in west Delhi are East Patel Nagar and a JJ cluster in Madipur after one case each was reported from these areas. There are now seven containment zones in west Delhi district. “The patient from Patel Nagar is admitted to a private hospital and as per the hospital, the patient had a travel history to a foreign country. One positive case was reported from Krishna Apartment. The patient from Madipur JJ colony is a contractual employee. Contact tracing of these cases is on. The area around these locations have been made containment zones,” a west district official, requesting not to be named, said.He added that community screening will be started in these localities from Tuesday.Madipur councillor and mayor South Delhi Municipal Corporation Sunita Kangra said, “Madipur patient used to work at Agrasen Hospital. He tested positive two days ago. Lanes around his house have already been disinfected. Two more cases were suspected in the locality but their test reports were negative.” Sant Nagar in central Delhi was declared a containment zone on Monday, after a person tested positive for Covid-19. With this, there are four containment zones in central Delhi, which has reported 13 deaths due to Covid-19 so far. DM (central) Nidhi Srivastava said Balaji Apartments, in Sant Nagar, Burari, was included in the list of containment zones after one person tested positive a couple of days ago.“Only one Covid-19 positive case is reported from there so far. It’s a micro containment zone as flats here are located in close proximity and so there are potential chances of a virus spread. All 27 flats in the three-storey building have been sealed. Necessary steps are being taken to ensure that residents do not face any problems,” Srivastava said.The Delhi government, on Sunday, had announced 10 new containment zones, including three in East of Kailash residential neighbourhood in southeast Delhi, the district with the highest number of containment zones (12) so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-new-containment-zones-in-west-delhi-one-more-in-central-delhi/story-vw9cC0LfOAsAhOIwtAMDhI.html
14-04-2020||Delhi||Areas without containment zones on a war footing to avoid clusters||The 47 containment zones in the national capital are spread over nine of Delhi government’s 11 revenue districts, barring Northeast and Northwest Delhi, where there are no sealed areas. But the administration is working on a war footing to ensure there is no “clustering of cases” in these two districts.From completing contact tracing of existing cases to routine screening in residential neighbourhoods, especially in high-density areas, the administration is taking all possible measures, leaving nothing to chance.The Northeast district is highly vulnerable due to its densely populated residential neighbourhoods. Several pockets here were adversely affected by the communal riots in February, displacing thousands. The district is also in close proximity to Dilshad Garden, one of the two Covid-19 hot spots in Delhi.While 24 and 30 cases have been reported from East Delhi and Shahdara, respectively, two of the three districts in the trans-Yamuna region, only nine cases have been reported from the Northeast Delhi, the third district, which comprises neighbourhoods of Karawal Nagar, Yamuna Vihar, Gokalpuri and Shiv Vihar.In Northwest Delhi, which comprises Model Town, Shalimar Bagh and Rohini, 13 cases have been reported so far.District magistrate (Northeast Delhi) Shashi Kaushal said that house-to-house screening, health check-ups, quick response, round-the-clock monitoring, intensified sanitisation drives and awareness campaigns are some of the measures the administration has taken to control the spread of coronavirus in the region.“So far, no cluster cases have been reported. There are only nine cases (till Monday morning) in the entire district. Containment zones are generally formed when several cases are reported from a single cluster,” Kaushal said.District magistrate (Northwest Delhi), Sandeep Mishra, too, said that “no clustering of cases” has been reported in his area. “All the 13 cases are isolated cases and we have done primary and secondary contact tracing in 11 cases. We are in the process of completing the contact tracing of two cases. There are no signs of clustering in any of the localities from where these cases have been reported,” said Mishra, who has 161 teams doing the screening in the area.While there are no containment zones in their areas, both DMs said that they are taking stringent measures to avoid clustering. Rigorous monitoring, house-to-house survey, health check-up along with blocking of roads are conducted.“Except for sealing the area, we are taking all other measures that are being taken in a containment zone. Rigorous monitoring and screening of households in being done by the health team comprising ASHA and ANM workers. Regular announcements, urging the public to follow social distancing and stay indoors, are also being made,” Kaushal said.Mishra said that in the recent rapid response team (RRT) meeting, it was decided that there is no need, at present, to declare it a containment zone. “All the cases are reviewed by the RRT. As there is no clustering being reported, we don’t want to strain our existing resources by declaring a containment zone, as we will have to divert our staff to the zone. Right now, we are keeping a strict vigil on those who are in home-quarantine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/areas-without-containment-zones-on-a-war-footing-to-avoid-clusters/story-RlvAwqtQWO0OXci5zyOlML.html
14-04-2020||Gurugram||20 medical teams to be formed to operate mobile clinics in Gurugram||To address the regular medical issues of citizens left unaddressed due to the unfolding of the Covid-19 crisis, the state health department, on Monday, directed all district administrations to form 20 teams, consisting of doctors, paramedics and pharmacist, to operate mobile dispensaries. These teams will visit different areas of the districts in Haryana Roadways buses, which will be converted into mobile clinics, to provide general OPD services and trace people exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms.“For mobile dispensaries to function, a minimum of 20 teams have to be formed, which will include doctors, paramedics and pharmacists. They will visit their assigned areas, examine the health condition of people who approach them for check-ups and provide them with medicine,” additional chief secretary of the health department Rajeev Arora said, adding that this service should become operational latest by Wednesday. In his address on Friday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said there are 250 mobile dispensaries in the state and their number will be increased to 500. The Haryana Roadways has been instructed to make its fleet available to run these mobile clinics. On Monday, Haryana Roadways officials said they have received instructions from the principal secretary of transport and are awaiting a response from the district administration and chief medical officer. Four buses of the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) are being used to carry health teams from hospitals to containment zones, for door-to-door surveys and thermal screening.District surveillance officer Sudha Garg said the department has received the order and has been preparing the plan to start the service. She said the survey of Sector 39 containment zone is over and at least 7,800 people were screened with the help of 19 teams. She added that 27 teams have been formed specifically for Pataudi, from where five cases have been reported and 20 teams have been formed to visit village Raipur in Sohna, from where 10 cases have been reported. As part of the order, from Tuesday, normal OPDs will start at community health centres (CHCs) and primary health centre (PHCs). At the Sector 10 Civil Hospital, doctors have started operating five OPDs—three for flu, one for general medicine and one for paediatrics—in an open area which has been covered by tents. “Except maternity ward and neonatal intensive care unit, none of the health facilities are operating at the Civil Hospital as Covid-19 cases are coming to give samples. For the protection of doctors and health staff, we have set up these tents. We have three flu OPDs as most of the people visiting us are worried about having Covid-19 symptoms. We have demarcated areas to ensure basic social distancing rules are followed,” said a doctor at the flu centre, who preferred not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/20-medical-teams-to-be-formed-to-operate-mobile-clinics/story-FnVv9nSGdmqgwHpRQIMiWP.html
14-04-2020||Gurugram||Work on hold due to lockdown, newer Gurugram sectors will have to wait for piped water||The ongoing lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 has indefinitely delayed piped water connections to the city’s newer sectors, 81 to 99, which currently rely on private tankers and borewells.With many labourers returning to their hometowns, officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that the work of laying distribution pipelines in newer sectors, which was previously set to be completed by June, has been suspended.The GMDA was working on a temporary arrangement to supply water from its water treatment plant in Chandu Budera by May. Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA, said, “The work to lay pipelines in this area was supposed to be completed before the onset of summer, but as of now, we are unable to state by when this can happen. Most of the labourers involved in the project have returned to their houses in Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, and there is not enough manpower available.”Residents of these sectors are growing increasingly worried, with private tanker facilities also having reduced their supply in the absence of labour. Vinod K, a resident of a condominium in Sector 81 said, “Private tanker facilities are unable to deliver water frequently, so residential societies which have borewells are using them. We are aware that this is a risky proposition, but are left with no other choice. Water demand is going up because of coronavirus lockdown.”Meanwhile, sectors 73 to 80 and 100 to 115, which were to receive piped canal water by the year-end, will also likely have to wait at least till next summer. “The work to lay pipelines in these areas is more than 70% complete, but has been held up. It will resume when labour becomes available again,” an official in the GMDA’s infrastructure division, requesting anonymity, said.“The construction of a boosting station in Sector 72, which was to supply water to newer sectors, will also be delayed. We do not know by how long,” the official said.Despite the area’s real estate boom, which started around 2010, basic infrastructure, such as sewer lines, water supply and roads (which were transferred to the GMDA from the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran) are yet to be developed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/work-on-hold-newer-sectors-will-have-to-wait-for-piped-water/story-j06mDPidZQZCSiJ4x9DgaO.html
14-04-2020||Noida||Two discharged patients taken back to hospital after a test finds them positive again||Two coronavirus patients who were discharged from the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida on Friday were taken back to the hospital after a second round of tests—conducted after they reportedly recovered— found them positive for the infection again on Saturday. The hospital authorities said the patients had recovered from coronavirus disease(Covid-19) and their samples , sent to the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), had tested negative, and the report from a lab at Aligarh Muslim University that found them positive on Saturday could be a result of a technical glitch. The patients’ samples have been collected again for another round of testing.As a precautionary measure, the patients, a 53-year-old man from Sector 128, Noida and a daughter of Ceasefire employee who lives in 137, were brought back to GIMS right after the Aligarh reports came on Saturday morning, officials said. At least 54 cases of coronavirus are directly or indirectly linked to the fire solutions firm Ceasefire.“The reports from NCDC have found them negative, but the Aligarh lab reports are showing them positive for Covid-19. It is looks like a technical glitch, but we aren’t aware of it completely. We have got the patients back to the hospital as a precautionary measure. Our laboratory is ready, so we are conducting their tests here once again. We are expecting the reports to come negative and they should be sent back soon,” Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS said on Sunday.The patients were discharged on Friday the first round of tests, comprising two tests, found them negative for Covid-19. Both the samples, including one sent to NCDC, had tested negative. Before discharging Covid-19 patients after their recovery,two samples are sent for testing within a gap of 24 hours. However, as a precautionary step, a third sample was collected and sent to Aligarh lab for testing and the two were discharged. The third sample’s report came positive on Saturday after which the duo was called back to the hospital and there samples were collected. The samples will be tested at the newly developed Covid-19 lab at GIMS.For the past one week, test reports of patients suspected of Covid-19 were getting delayed causing much trouble to the district health department. The district magistrate had allotted ₹46.22 lakh to GIMS and ₹65 lakh to the Super Speciality Children Hospital in Sector 39 to develop Covid-19 laboratories, so that the delay in reports can be avoided.Most of the samples from Gautam Budh Nagar were going to Aligarh Muslim University or the Meerut laboratories, but since the number of tests have increased in the state, these labs have been overloaded with work. In another development, mother of the Sector 137 patient was also discharged from GIMS on Monday after two of her test reports were negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-discharged-patients-taken-back-to-hospital-after-a-test-finds-them-positive-again/story-knkKEjHjkKNuJyFxpxnnqK.html

14-04-2020||Pune||Pune collector may declare 22 more areas as containment zones||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plans to seal 22 more areas in Pune after more Covid-19 cases were reported from these areas. The proposal awaits district collector Naval Kishore Ram’s sanction. The district administration has already turned 17 localities in central Pune and Kondhwa into containment zones. The collector will decide to seal the new areas in phase-wise manner or not. Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “PMC has already sealed eastern parts of Pune which includes peth areas and Kondhwa. As cases have been reported from 22 other parts of the city, we are proposing to seal these localities too.”Gaikwad said that last time PMC had issued the order under Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, but the district collector issued the order under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that authorises the executive magistrate of any state or territory to issue an order to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area.For better coordination, the civic body proposes that the district administration should take care on these areas and monitor the places with assistance from police and civic administration.Once an area is defined as a containment zone, private vehicle movement will be banned and individuals who step outside their homes must wear masks. The containment, however, excludes vegetable vendors/agriculture-related transport, essentials including grocery and medical, institutional and government vehicles for scheduled period.

14-04-2020||Pune||Locked down in a city away from home, students struggle financially, but hostel, PG owners look to ease their pain||With the lockdown in the state now extended till April 30, students in the city who have been quarantined in hostels and rented accommodations, away from home, want to go back home. There are at least 10,000 students who are currently living in the city in private houses, flats, as paying guests (PG) and in hostels. Most of the students find it difficult to deal with every day expenses as their resources are limited and there is a shortage of money, even though flat and PG owners have waived off their rents for the time being. Ramesh Shinde, 19, a Bachelor of Arts student from Nanded, says, “I live in as a paying guest at a residence near Appa Balwant chowk. There were six students who lived along with me, but they left for their hometowns before the lockdown began. Now, I am only one left here and even though the owner of the accommodation is not asking for the rent, getting daily meals is a major challenge. I have an electric stove in the room and make instant noodles or rice sometimes. I even try to get food packets from the social groups distributing it around the city. My family is worried about me and my father had even started to come to Pune to pick me up, on a motorbike, but was sent back by the police officials from the district border.”Coming from the farmer family background, Vishal Dabhade, is also facing similar issues. Dabhade, who hails from Jalna district is enrolled at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and is currently living at a friend’s home in Model Colony. “When the lockdown was announced, we thought that it would be only till April 14 and later on, we would be able to go back to our hometowns, but now as it has been extended, it is getting difficult day by day to survive. It is more of a mental challenge for us as the situation is not good outside, my friend and I do not step out. My parents are worried about us, however, we communicate with them every day to assure them of our safety. We cook mostly rice and pulses and bring ready-made food packets. Our savings are being used up and getting financial help from my family is also difficult, as they too are struggling to survive as farmers during the lockdown.”The SPPU hostel and all hostels of colleges affiliated to the varsity, had shut down before the lockdown. However, there are still some foreign students at the SPPU International Students Centre hostel. One of the students who didn’t wanted her name to be disclosed, said, “We stay inside our rooms and get all the necessary facilities from the university. I am in regular touch with my family members and if needed, go out to buy fruits or vegetables to the hostel gate where some of the vendors come.”Suresh Joshi, one of the owners of a PG accommodation in Sadashiv peth, said, “There are 14 students living at our PG hostel and all of them have now gone back to their hometowns. We have not asked them to pay the rent for the next two months as we understand that it is a crisis and most of them belong to an economically weak background.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/locked-down-in-a-city-away-from-home-students-struggle-financially-but-hostel-pg-owners-look-to-ease-their-pain/story-Iq1GeOEYkp3zlJIptZlCyO.html

14-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab milk producers grapple with price drop, erratic payments amid lockdown||As the lockdown continues, milk producers in Punjab are struggling with low demand, price reduction and irregular payments by mass procurers.As consumption by small-scale milk processers, dairies and halwais these days is nearly negligible, the milk producers are dependent on state milk cooperative Milkfed and big private players like Amul and Nestle for procurement.Prior to the lockdown, 3.15 crore litres of milk were produced in the state daily, but the current figures are not known to us yet, said Milkfed managing director Kamaldeep Singh Sangha. “Around 60 lakh litres are procured by private milk processing brands. Of this, Milkfed is processes 27 lakh litres every day, while the other brands are collectively processing 30-35 lakh litres of milk,” said Sangha. Milkfed sells products under the Verka brand.Sukhwinder Singh a milk producer who also manages a collection centre for milk processors in his village Bhattian, Samrala, told HT that Milkfed and other brands have not paid dairy farmers for the last 20 days. After price revision, the procurement price of buffalo milk has been reduced to ₹47.25/litre and that of cow milk to ₹30-32/litre.Former Verka milk plant head Parminder Singh Chalaki seconded that due to lockdown the entire procurement burden was on the state cooperative and the big private firms. He asked the state government to support milk producers on the pattern of Haryana government which is giving ₹5/litre support over and above the prevailing prices.Reportedly, milk supplies from Punjab to Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi are almost nil, which used to be ₹5 lakh litres daily earlier. “We’re in the process of increasing the production of ultra-heat treatment (UHT) milk packs with shelf-life of six months. Nowadays, UHT is majorly bought by the army,” said Sangha.According to him, Milkfed is currently selling 11 lakh litres of milk daily, while 16 lakh litres go into production of milk powder and white butter. “Every day, the state cooperative procures milk worth ₹10 crore and to keep its operations going in the wake of dwindling sales, it has taken a credit of ₹100 crore and is seeking additional ₹150 crore,” said Sangha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-milk-producers-grapple-with-price-drop-erratic-payments-amid-lockdown/story-CuEKtINOtOlEoL1MLNBPOJ.html
14-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: 4,800 cops deployed at city borders, outside containment zones||The Gurugram Police on Friday said it has deployed over 4,800 personnel on city borders and outside the nine containment zones to check any kind of unnecessary movement.Gurugram commissioner of police Muhammad Akil said over sixty-four police pickets have been set up outside containment zones where a total of 1,342 personnel have been deployed.The nine containment zones saw tight security arrangements on Friday, especially in Pataudi and Raipur village Sohna, where at least 15 Covid-19 people have tested positive so far. “We have chalked out a micro-level plan, and police personnel have been deployed outside the nine containment zones and 20 borders connecting Gurugram to Delhi and other neighbouring areas like Faridabad, Nuh, Tauru, Sohna, and Rajasthan. The police are coordinating with the district administration and medical teams with the screening of residents and collection of samples in the identified areas,” said Akil. In a meeting on Friday afternoon, the commissioner of police assigned duties to station house officers of all police stations to monitor the law and order situation in the city. Gurugram Police has a total of 6,500 personnel.Starting Saturday, the police will not allow any residents living in containment zones will not be allowed to move out of their residential area unless in case of a medical emergency. “We have directed all the resident welfare associations (RWAs) to ensure all the shops of essential goods are open for the residents. Rest, all the deliveries will only be allowed till the entrance of the condominium,” said Akil adding all deliveries will be monitored by the police teams.Akil said the police have identified entry and exit points in each containment zones and have set up police pickets with at each spot. Maximum deployment is in areas with the most number of entry and exit points such as Sector 9, Nirvana Country, Pataudi, and Raipur village, the police said. The police personnel will work in eight-hour shifts for at least 10 days after which they will be replaced, police said. “All personnel were deployed after their medical tests were conducted and they were declared fit. They will be deployed in three shifts of eight hours each. We have provided three tents for the personnel deployed in each zone to ensure they can take rest and can sit unless they have to check the movement of the residents crossing the picket,” Akil said.The police have taken help from Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and Public Works Department to seal the areas under containment zones. Only health officials will be allowed to enter these containment zones to conduct door-to-door health checkups. An area spread over five-kilometre is cordoned off in the identified containment zone and an additional area of three kilometre is earmarked as a buffer zone as a precautionary measure. “This containment zone strategy can also help us prevent the transmission of the coronavirus disease to the other parts of the city. We will also monitor and ensure social distancing measures in these areas,” Akil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-4-800-cops-deployed-at-city-borders-outside-containment-zones/story-yhOs5U6dFOb0GIHXECJW8H.html

It is a battle that China cannot afford to lose is how the state media has described the race.The first vaccine, developed by a research team led by military doctor Chen Wei with the Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, was the first to be approved to enter clinical trial in March, official news agency, Xinhua reported Tuesday.The first phase of the clinical trial was completed at the end of March, and the second phase started on April 12, the report said.It is the first Covid-19 vaccine in the world that has entered the second phase of clinical trial, the Xinhua report quoted the World Health Organisation as saying.The news about three vaccines entering different clinical trial stages comes in the backdrop of a steady rise of imported Covid-19 cases in China.The Chinese national health commission (NHC) said Tuesday that it received reports of 89 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland on Monday, of which 86 were imported.Three new domestically transmitted cases were reported, all in the southern Guangdong province.As of Monday, the mainland had reported a total of 1,464 imported cases.The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 82,249 by Monday, including 1,170 patients who were still being treated, 77,738 people who had been discharged after recovery, and 3,341 people who died of the disease.Meanwhile, local reports said that medical resources were “strained and the local capacity to deal with the onslaught of imported Covid-19 cases has reached its limits in the Chinese city of Suifenhe, bordering Russia”.The NHC had dispatched to the border town to help local health authorities, and donations of medical equipment from across the country had arrived.According to the tabloid, Global Times, while recording 243 confirmed Covid-19 cases, the Suifenhe land port next to the Russia border has 1,479 people under collective quarantine, 15-20 percent of whom may be diagnosed and tested positive, local officials said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-experimental-vaccines-go-on-human-trial-imported-cases-keep-rising/story-g3Jm7liQhxksDtjc6U05oN.html
14-04-2020||World||Obama endorses Biden, slams politics of ‘meanness’||Former President Barak Obama on Tuesday endorsed his former vice-president Joe Biden for the 2020 White House race saying he has the character and experience to guide the country through “one of our darkest times” and heal it through its recovery.The former president also called for Americans to unite in a “great awakening” against current-day politics, which he said was characterized, among other things, by “just plain meanness”.Obama, who remains one of the most popular and revered Democrat in the country, had held off on his endorsement of his former deputy as be believed, his office said in a statement, that for Democrats to do well in November, Democratic voters should be allowed to pick their own nominee.That process formally ended in way Monday as Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed the former vice-president, following up the suspension of his own bid for the party nomination  earlier.“Choosing Joe to be my Vice President was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend,” former President Obama said in a video message. “And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a President right now.”The former president went on to list the high points of Biden’s role as his vice-president — led the recovery from the 2008 recession, helped him manage the H1N1 and Ebola outbreaks and restore American leadership in combating nuclear proliferations and climate change.“Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery,” Obama said.“Right now,” he added in a barely concealed swipe at President Donald Trump’s politics, “we need Americans of goodwill to unite in a great awakening against a politics that too often has been characterized by corruption, carelessness, self-dealing, disinformation, ignorance, and just plain meanness. And to change that, we need Americans of all political stripes to get involved in our politics and our public life like never before.”Obama will be campaigning for Biden and other Democrats up and down the ticket as he did in the 2018 elections when the party won back control of the House of the Representatives.The former president and his erstwhile deputy were friends indeed, as Obama noted in the endorsement. Even while in office, they were seen close, as were their families. Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Beau Biden, Biden’s eldest son who died of brain cancer in 2015.The two have remained close since, unlike others such as Former President Bill Clinton and his deputy Al Gore, who barely speak to each other; or Former President George W Bush and his vice-president Dick Cheney, who had worked closely while in office but, as Cheney said later, they were not friends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-endorses-biden-slams-politics-of-meanness/story-sykepejBGKyHqU4M4imfYL.html
14-04-2020||World||Barack Obama endorses Joe Biden, says former VP has ‘qualities we need’||Former President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden in a video on Tuesday, giving the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee a boost from the party’s biggest fundraiser and one of its most popular figures.“I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now,” Obama said in a nearly 12- minute video, touting him as a “close friend” and lauding him for his perseverance and compassion.Obama and Biden are close friends from their two terms in the White House, when Biden served as vice president. Biden leaned heavily on his affiliation with the former president throughout the Democratic primary, framing his pitch as an extension of Obama’s presidency. In recent weeks, he has told donors he’s been in touch with Obama about his vice-presidential pick.The endorsement marks Obama’s return to presidential politics more than three years after leaving the White House. He rarely talks directly about his successor, President Donald Trump, and avoided intervening in the Democratic primary. The field at one point spanned nearly two dozen candidates and Obama offered private counsel to anyone who asked it, but but made no efforts to bolster an individual campaign — including Biden’s.But Obama has been following the Democratic race closely from the sidelines and is eager to take a more active public role in the campaign. He’s expected to headline fundraisers for Biden and public events in key swing states, if those events can still be held given social distancing guidelines during the pandemic. An Obama adviser said the former president is taking his cues from Biden’s campaign on how he can be most useful as he eases back into a more overtly political role.The endorsement comes a day after Bernie Sanders also backed Biden. The former vice president now has the support of all of his former Democratic primary rivals except for Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts senator is expected to formally throw her support behind Biden soon, according to a person familiar with her plans.Two other prominent Democrats who have yet to formally endorse Biden are former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, the party’s 2016 nominee. Hillary Clinton has been in regular touch with Biden, including several times since Sanders dropped out of the race, according to an aide.Obama has been an obvious shadow throughout the 2020 Democratic primary. Biden coined the “Obama-Biden administration” moniker when he’d talk about various accomplishments.But he also tried to insist he was running as his own man, telling anyone who asked that he urged Obama not to endorse him out of the gate or even in the thick of the primary.Obama’s tenure became a sort of punching bag for some presidential hopefuls in a primary fight that early on was defined by a debate over the need for generational and systemic change versus a return to normalcy after the Trump era.Julian Castro, 45, pushed Biden repeatedly on whether he argued with Obama privately over deportations overseen by that administration. Pete Buttigieg, 38, and Beto O’Rourke, 47, subtly jabbed Biden – and by extension Obama -- by suggesting the party shouldn’t “return to the past.” Sanders and Warren suggested that the 2010 Affordable Care Act hadn’t gone far enough.But Biden was a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act and on the trail, often referred to himself as an “Obama-Biden Democrat.” The former vice president called it “bizarre” for Democrats, even faintly, to attack Obama’s record.The conversation around Obama’s presidency shifted as the primary wore on. By the time voting began, Buttigieg was almost explicitly comparing his youthful bid to Obama’s 2008 campaign and the progressives were framing their health-care proposals as a way to build on Obama’s legacy. Billionaire candidate Mike Bloomberg, meanwhile, featured Obama in his ubiquitous advertising effort, much to Biden’s chagrin.“You’d think Mike was Barack’s vice president,” Biden once quipped to donors.For his part, Biden leaned even more heavily into Obama as primary voting began. Aiming at Sanders, the self-described “democratic socialist,” and billionaire Bloomberg, who’d been elected New York City mayor as a Republican, Biden said in a Feb. 21 interview with The Associated Press that “they’re not bad folks. They’re just not Democrats.”Campaigning before increasingly diverse audiences in Nevada and South Carolina, Biden ramped up his recollections of when Obama tapped him for the ticket in 2008. Biden recalled Inauguration Day 2009, waiting for the train in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, “for a black man to pick me up … for the two of us to be sworn in as president and vice president of the United States.”Often drawing nods and vocal affirmation from his audiences, Biden said he had thought of that day as a national victory over institutional racism. Now, in the Trump era, Biden calls that conclusion a mistake.“I thought we could defeat hate,” he said, but, “it never goes away.“On Feb. 29, Biden took the stage in South Carolina to celebrate a nearly 30-point victory that would propel him past Sanders and everyone.He dusted off a line he’d used many times before: “I’m a proud Obama-Biden Democrat,” Biden said.Obama was watching. His sideline approach nearing its end, he called his former vice president that night to congratulate him on his victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-endorses-joe-biden-says-former-vp-has-qualities-we-need/story-wsibTkRZVir1wXdX9LpedM.html
14-04-2020||World||US nears COVID-19 peak, Donald Trump feuds with governors on reopening||A top government health official has sad the United States could be “nearing” the peak of its coronavirus outbreak this week and an acrimonious debate has broken out between President Donald Trump and some state governors on who will determine when to reopen the country, and by how much.“We are nearing the peak right now,” Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told NBC news Monday, echoing growing consensus among officials and public health experts. “You’ll know when you’re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before.The number of fatalities in the United States went up by 1,509 Monday over Sunday, which was marginally less the 1,514 the day before, but a lot less than 1,920 in the 24 hours ending Saturday. The death toll stood at 23,649 Monday, and confirmed cases at 582,634, up by 25,306.The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which has been widely cited by the White House, has projected April 16 as the peak day for the US outbreak.Experts of the White House coronavirus task force and other public officials have for some days expressing “cautious optimism” on the basis of signs that they interpret to indicate a peak was at head — such as the “flattening” in the number of new cases in hotspots metros .Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, has cited dropping hospitalization numbers to express optimism the state, which has has more cases than all of China and many other countries, may have turned around, or is close to it. “The worst is over” he told reporters Monday, adding for emphasis the need to not ease up.”, “if we continue to be smart going forward.”New York state had 196,146 confirmed cases Tuesday, which was way more than Spain or Italy or France, the three European nations hit the hardest until they were overtaken by the United States and now by one of its states. The state accounted for a little less than half of all US fatalities, at 10,058.New York City, the epicenter of the American epidemic, had 106,763 cases (alone more than China or the United Kingdom) and 7,249 deaths.The situation is improving as public health official and experts have stated giving rise to talk of reopening the country and removing social-distancing guidelines enforce since mid-March that had shut down businesses, forced wide-scale layoffs and inflicted grave economic hardship on millions of families.But the way forward has become mired in a bitter debate between the American president and state governors over, essentially, who will lead the reopening. Trump insists on leading it claiming complete powers on this issue of public health matters and police powers inside states. “When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,” he said at the daily briefing of the White House coronavirus task force.Constitutional experts and critics, joined even by some of the president’s Republican allies, have dispute that, citing the constitution.“If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn’t do it,” Governor Cuomo said of the president’s plans. Other governors, including some belonging to the Republican party, have disagreed with the president.Trump hit back singling the New York governor. “Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nears-covid-19-peak-donald-trump-feuds-with-governors-on-reopening/story-cpfiej2biKwbmRdteXzLZK.html

There has been no reduction in violence and the Taliban have done nothing to demonstrate that they will act against al-Qaeda in keeping with the agreement they signed with the US,” said a person familiar with developments who declined to be named.“The Taliban’s top leadership continues to be in Pakistan and there is little doubt that the group is acting at the behest of the Pakistani military to ensure India has little or no role in the current situation in Afghanistan,” the person said, adding similar concerns were prevalent among diplomats of several Western nations.The Indian government, which has pledged more than $3 billion for the development of Afghanistan, has said it backs an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process for peace and reconciliation that ensures a peaceful and stable Afghanistan free from “externally sponsored terrorism”.ToloNews reported the Taliban’s draft charter is seen by the Afghan government as suggesting that the group’s plans for their “future government” are not very different from policies of their former regime. According to the document, final decisions in all matters will be made by the “emir” or Taliban chief and free speech, human rights and civil rights will be implemented within the framework of Islamic teachings.The draft charter also suggests executive leaders will not be chosen through elections, as called for in the Afghan Constitution, but by the “Ahl al-hall wal-aqd” or a group qualified to appoint or remove a leader. Jalaluddin Shinwari, a former Taliban member who served as chief justice during the Taliban regime, said the group still wants an Islamic emirate. “So far this is their demand,” he said.Afghan rights activists said the charter could take the country back to where it was at the end of the Taliban regime in 2001. The head of Kabul-based Afghanistan Human Rights Organization, Lal Gul Lal, was quoted as saying that Afghans “should not start from the beginning once again”.Taliban’ spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, told ToloNews the draft charter did “not belong to the group”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-calls-for-islamic-emirate-in-afghanistan-drafts-a-charter-with-rules/story-uIeM27BHbUObbGgSn2h5wJ.html
14-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Donald Trump claims he has ‘total’ authority over reopening economy||President Donald Trump claimed the “total” authority to decide how and when to reopen the economy after weeks of tough social distancing guidelines aimed at fighting the new coronavirus. But governors from both parties were quick to push back, noting they have primary responsibility for ensuring public safety in their states and would decide when it’s safe to begin a return to normal operations.Trump would not offer specifics about the source of his asserted power, which he claimed, despite constitutional limitations, was absolute.“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said Monday at the White House. “The governors know that.”The comments came not long after Democratic leaders in the Northeast and along the West Coast announced separate state compacts to coordinate their efforts to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses on their own timetables.Anxious to put the crisis behind him, Trump has been discussing with senior aides how to roll back federal social distancing recommendations that expire at the end of the month.While Trump has issued national recommendations advising people stay home, it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing nonessential businesses. Some of those orders carry fines or other penalties, and in some jurisdictions they extend into the early summer.And governors made clear Monday they wouldn’t tolerate pressure to act before they deem it safe.“All of these executive orders are state executive orders and so therefore it would be up to the state and the governor to undo a lot of that,” New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said on CNN.“The government doesn’t get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level,” said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.Meanwhile, governors were banding together, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island agreeing to coordinate their actions. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar pact. While each state is building its own plan, the three West Coast states have agreed to a framework saying they will work together, put their residents’ health first and let science guide their decisions.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, stressed the efforts would take time.“The house is still on fire,” Murphy said on a conference call with reporters. “We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we’re going to need ... to make sure this doesn’t reignite.”Trump, however, insisted it was his decision to make.“The president of the United States calls the shots,” he said, promising to release a paper outlining his legal argument.Trump can use his bully pulpit to pressure states to act or threaten them with consequences, but the Constitution gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials.Though Trump abandoned his goal of beginning to roll back social distancing guidelines by Easter, he has been itching to reboot an economy that has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities. The closure has also undermined Trump’s reelection message, which hinged on a booming economy.Trump’s claim that he could force governors to reopen their states also represents a dramatic shift in tone. For weeks Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.While Trump can use his daily White House briefings and Twitter account to try to shape public opinion and pressure governors to bend to his will, “there are real limits on the president and the federal government when it comes to domestic affairs,” John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, said on a recent Federalist Society conference call.Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, a supporter of Trump, said the question of when to lift restrictions would be “a joint effort” between Washington and the states.Talk about how and when to reboot the nation’s economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was slow to respond to the virus and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.That frustration was amplified by comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, who told CNN on Sunday that, “obviously,” had the country “started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.”Trump responded by reposting a tweet that included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor. But at Monday’s briefing, Trump insisted Fauci’s job was safe after Fauci took the podium to try to explain his comments.Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations.But Trump has told aides that he knows blowback to removing Fauci would be fierce and that — at least for now — he is stuck with the doctor. On more than one occasion, however, he has urged that Fauci be left out of task force briefings or have his speaking role curtailed, according to the Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-donald-trump-claims-he-has-total-authority-over-reopening-economy/story-Ask27WIXCbIocATlyDe19H.html
14-04-2020||World||117 million children face measles risk from Covid-19 response: UN||Around 117 million children worldwide risk contracting measles because dozens of countries are curtailing their vaccination programmes as they battle COVID-19, the United Nations warned Tuesday. Currently 24 countries, including several already dealing with large measles outbreaks, have suspended widespread vaccinations, the World Health Organization and the UN’s children’s fund UNICEF said.An additional 13 countries have had their vaccination programmes interrupted due to COVID-19. In a joint statement, the Measles and Rubella Initiative (M&RI) said it was vital that immunisation capacity was retained during and after the current pandemic.“Together, more than 117 million children... could be impacted by the suspension of scheduled immunization activities,” it said.“The M&RI supports the need to protect communities and health workers from COVID-19 through a pause of mass campaigns, where risks of the disease are high.” “However, this should not mean that children permanently miss out.”Measles, a highly contagious disease, effects around 20 million people every year, the majority of whom are aged under five. Despite a cheap and readily available vaccine, measles cases have surged in recent years, largely in part to what the WHO terms “vaccine hesitancy”. In 2018, 140,000 measles deaths, mostly among children and babies, were recorded -- most were preventable, meaning that the countries they occurred in had a vaccination programme.Of the two dozen countries to have officially suspended measles vaccine programmes -- ostensibly to protect health workers and prioritise COVID-19 response -- several have seen worrying rises in measles cases in recent years.In particular, Bangladesh, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Nigeria, Ukraine and Kazakhstan are all battling large outbreaks.DR Congo alone has had 6,000 measles deaths in its current epidemic.The country last week also recorded a new case of Ebola -- just days before the UN was due to announce an end to that outbreak. ‘Catch-up’ Robin Nandy, UNICEF’s chief of immunisation, told AFP that COVID-19 was likely to place additional strain on already overburdened healthcare systems.“We have to be mindful of the impact of COVID-19, threatening outbreaks of measles, an extremely contagious and potentially lethal disease for which there already exists a safe and effective vaccine,” he said. “We are therefore urging countries to prepare and plan now for intensive catch-up vaccinations once physical distancing restrictions are lifted.”Billions of people around the world face weeks of lockdown as governments figure out their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts have warned since the start of the outbreak that response programmes to other infectious diseases -- from polio to tuberculosis -- are likely to suffer as health services triage workers to COVID-19 cases.And while COVID-19 is overwhelmingly more serious in older patients, many communicable diseases, including measles, inordinately target children.“Children younger than 12 months of age are more likely to die from measles complications, and if the circulation of measles virus is not stopped, their risk of exposure to measles will increase daily,” said the M&RI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/117-million-children-face-measles-risk-from-covid-19-response-un/story-YYE0wJZzwy0mFsC1kEStpI.html

It has referred to two notices published by Chinese universities where such restrictions have been mentioned.The notices quoted by CNN say that the universities have asked teachers to strictly manage the papers related to virus tracing. They also talk about adding an extra layer of vetting by a scientific research team.The pages carrying the notices have now been deleted, the CNN further reported.A Chinese reseacher quoted by the CNN said that it is a “coordinated effort” from the Chinese government “to control the narrative, and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China”. The researcher’s identity has not been revealed.One of the universities quoted by CNN is the Fudan University in Shanghai. The other university is China University of Geoscience in Wuhan, reported CNN.China is, meanwhile, fighting hard to stop a second wave of coronavirus infections.Though the northeast border remains China’s priority, state media reported late on Monday that more than 100 people had been arrested in March for illegally entering China through its southwestern border in Yunnan province.Russia has become China’s largest source of imported cases, with a total of 409 infections originating in the northern neighbour. Chinese people there should stay put and not return home, the state-owned Global Times said in an editorial Tuesday.China’s northeastern border province of Heilongjiang saw 79 new cases of imported coronavirus cases on Monday, all Chinese citizens travelling home from Russia, state media said. Mainland China reported 89 new cases.Heilongjiang’s provincial authority said on Tuesday that it had established a hotline to reward citizens as much as 5,000 yuan ($710) for handing over or reporting illegal immigrants. China has reported 82,249 coronavirus cases and 3,341 deaths.

So we are certainly not seeing the peak yet,” WHO spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris told a briefing in Geneva.In China, “the biggest threat is imported cases,” she said, referring to the latest data.“We shouldn’t really be expecting to see the vaccine for 12 months or longer,” Harris added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixed-picture-in-europe-covid-19-vaccine-at-least-12-months-off-who/story-ilIa9obQhpAJm8QHVeAF4M.html
14-04-2020||World||South Korea set to double supply of coronavirus tests to US||South Korea’s SolGent has secured an order to supply a U.S. government agency with an additional 7,500 kits which can each perform 100 coronavirus tests, the CEO of the biotech firm told Reuters.That will double the number of tests U.S. authorities can perform using kits sourced from South Korea to 1.5 million.SolGent has already sent kits for 150,000 tests while South Korean peers Osang HealthCare and SD BIOSENSOR are due to ship kits capable of performing 600,000 tests on Tuesday, company sources told Reuters.The kits are being sent to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after an appeal from U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump made a request for medical devices in a telephone call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on March 25.The U.S. death toll from COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the virus, topped 23,600 on Monday, the highest of any country.SolGent CEO You Jae-hyung told Reuters that the company is in talks on a long-term contract with FEMA and about building a factory in the United States to manufacture the testing kits, but that a decision has not been made.U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris said on Twitter Tuesday that testing kits had been loaded at Incheon Airport bound for the United States.He called the alliance between the two countries “ironclad” and thanked South Korea’s foreign ministry for its help.FEMA did not immediately respond to Reuters’ emailed inquiries. The foreign ministry declined to comment.The ministry had said that three companies had won preliminary approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to export kits, but did not identify the firms.After struggling with the first large outbreak of the virus outside of China, South Korea has largely managed to curb its spread without lockdown orders helped by a massive testing campaign and intensive contact tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-set-to-double-supply-of-coronavirus-tests-to-us/story-CDXsQg52MBHXre4WUOiQcP.html
14-04-2020||World||Saudi Arabia races to contain coronavirus in Islam’s holiest city||Saudi authorities are racing to contain an outbreak of coronavirus in the Islamic holy city of Mecca, where crowded slums and labor camps have accelerated the spread even with much of the country under a 24-hour curfew.The total number of coronavirus cases reported in Mecca, home to 2 million people, reached 1,050 on Monday compared to 1,422 in the capital of Riyadh, a city more than three times the size. Mecca’s large number of undocumented immigrants and cramped housing for migrant workers have made it more difficult to slow the infection rate.In late March, after five Mecca-based employees of Saudi Binladin Group, one of the kingdom’s biggest construction companies tested positive, authorities locked down housing for 8,000 laborers and suspended work on the expansion of the grand mosque, Islam’s holiest site, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Some workers were placed in hotel quarantine, the document showed. The company did not respond to a request for comment. It was unclear if the camp remained in lockdown.Shielding Mecca from a pandemic that’s overwhelmed countries like Italy and the United States is crucial for Saudi Arabia. That’s partly because of the city’s significance to the world’s Muslims, but also because the royal family grounds its rule in guardianship of the birthplace of Islam. Millions of Muslim pilgrims visit Mecca each year; King Salman’s official title is “custodian of the two holy mosques.”The government is conscious that the virus sweeping Mecca would “call into question its responsibility in the protection of those spaces, which is part of the legitimacy of the country itself,” said Yasmine Farouk, a visiting fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This is sensitive.”Role of foreignersOverall, Saudi Arabia has reported one of the lowest rates of infection in the region, with around 5,000 cases in a population of over 30 million. Mecca was one of the first Saudi cities to be placed under a full-day curfew, and authorities took unprecedented precautions, suspending religious tourism in February and closing mosques across the country in March.The outbreak underlines a nationwide issue of soaring cases among foreign residents. Foreigners make up about a third of the Saudi population but account for 70% to 80% of new cases recently, according to the health ministry -- a rate that’s sparked debate about their role in society.Some Saudis have attacked foreigners, accusing them of price-gouging, fear-mongering and deliberately spreading infection. Others say that the solution lies in better living conditions for the blue collar foreigners who underpin daily life, driving garbage trucks and cleaning streets. Saudi novelist Mohammed Alwan recently wrote on Twitter that he hopes authorities will create “humane requirements for workers’ housing” after the pandemic.Health minister Tawfiq Al-Rabiah acknowledged the problem in a televised address on Monday, saying a government committee had been formed to deal with the issue.The government has also promised free coronavirus treatment for foreign residents, including undocumented immigrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-races-to-contain-coronavirus-in-islam-s-holiest-city/story-icBfCP1lBWfxav1ChIvnAN.html
14-04-2020||World||North Korea has fired multiple suspected cruise missiles, says Seoul||North Korea on Tuesday fired several suspected cruise missiles towards the sea, the South’s military said.The “multiple projectiles” fired from Munchon in the east of the country were believed to be “short-range cruise missiles,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.The test comes a day before the nuclear-armed North marks the 108th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong Un.It also comes a day before the South holds parliamentary elections, and at a time when the world’s attention has been largely focussed on the coronavirus pandemic, which Pyongyang insists it has so far escaped.The North has repeatedly tested ballistic missiles in recent years, which climb high above the Earth, often into space, before being brought down towards their targets at high speed by the force of gravity.Its arsenal includes ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) that are capable of reaching the whole of the US mainland.In contrast cruise missiles travel at low altitudes -- sometimes just a few metres (feet) above the surface, making them hard to detect -- and are powered throughout their flight.Sometimes highly manoeuvrable, they need sophisticated guidance systems to bring them to their targets.Tuesday’s missiles travelled over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, before coming down in the water, the JCS said.“South Korea and US intelligence authorities are closely analysing related issues,” they added.The North is subject to multiple UN Security Council sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.It has carried out a series of weapons tests in recent months, often describing them as multiple launch rocket systems while others have called them ballistic missiles.Pyongyang has fired cruise missiles in the past.In June 2017 it hailed the successful test of a what it called a new type of surface-to-ship cruise missile designed to hit “any enemy group of battleships” that threatened North Korea.That launch hit targets in the Sea of Japan, it said, and took place the week after two US aircraft carriers, the USS Carl Vinson and USS Ronald Reagan, took part in naval manoeuvres in the area.Those missiles flew some 200 kilometres (120 miles), which analysts said was an improvement on a 2015 test that flew only 100 kilometres.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump traded mutual insults and threats of war during 2017, sending tensions soaring.The South’s President Moon Jae-in used the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in his country to broker a rapid diplomatic rapprochement and a series of summits followed.But talks between Pyongyang and Washington have been largely deadlocked since their Hanoi summit broke up in February last year amid disagreement on sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-has-fired-multiple-suspected-cruise-missiles-says-seoul/story-5bQWXuZFCkpNYLY85UlyzN.html

Seven people were reported to have been killed when tornadoes hit a mobile home park near the Georgia-Tennessee border.“There’s been loss of life, there’s been significant loss of property,” Tennessee Governor Bill Lee said Monday, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press. The National Weather Service in the state found damage caused by winds estimated to be up to 145 miles (235 kilometers) per hour.The Weather Channel reported one person in Arkansas was killed when a tree fell on a house, plus two other deaths in Alabama.- ‘Horrible, destructive power’ -US President Donald Trump offered his “warmest condolences” to those affected. “My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet,” he said, promising that the Federal Emergency Management Association was already offering assistance. “It’s a tough deal,” he said. “It was a bad grouping of tornadoes -- something incredible, the horrible, destructive power.”Over 1.3 million electricity customers were without power after the storms went through, reported PowerOutage.US.The governors of Mississippi and Louisiana declared states of emergency.“The damage is devastating,” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said on Twitter. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves tweeted that he had declared a state of emergency “to protect the health and safety of Mississippians in response to the severe tornadoes and storms hitting across the state.”“We are mobilizing all resources available to protect our people and their property,” Reeves said, telling residents “you are not alone.”Earlier on Sunday, Reeves urged residents to take the “severe storms very seriously.”“Please take precautions to keep your family safe.”He later retweeted a message from the state disaster agency reminding people to cover their noses and mouths and practice social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus if they had to go to public storm shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tornadoes-bring-death-destruction-in-southern-us/story-Chchnj4fOd2wfyc2tsywIM.html

I can only say that my heart goes out to you under such very difficult circumstances,” he said. Vaisakhi will not be marked with the customary large gatherings and melas in different parts of the UK this year as the community is urged to stay safe amid the coronavirus pandemic, with all events cancelled. London’s annual Vaisakhi on the Square held at Trafalgar Square, scheduled for next Saturday, was cancelled. A similar mega Vaisakhi event held at Handsworth Park in Birmingham, one of the cities with the UK’s largest Sikh population, stands cancelled amid the lockdown, with celebrations in Leicester, Southall and Gravesend also called off. The events at annual Vaisakhi events, including colourful street processions in the form of nagar kirtans, feeding the community with langars as well as cultural activities including the traditional Sikh martial art of Gatka, have been replaced by a focus on community service to help the vulnerable during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-prince-charles-praises-selfless-service-by-british-sikhs-in-vaisakhi-message/story-ZnYT1xN2A3YM5Qx1pfih7O.html

In his greeting to the community to mark the festival, Trudeau said, “In years past, families and friends would celebrate Vaisakhi by gathering at their local Gurdwaras to pray, read from the sacred scripture, and take part in vibrant parades and processions known as Nagar Kirtans. This year, as we continue to feel the impacts of the Covid-19 global pandemic, the Sikh community is celebrating differently, following the recommendations of our public health experts.”Earlier, Trudeau, during a regular media briefing, had also welcomed the service being provided by the community during the crisis, as he said, “Right now, when people need help most, you’re stepping up once again. In Regina, you’re delivering supplies to your neighbours, while in Mississauga you’re donating to the Seva Food Bank.”Among the major Vaisakhi events are those in Toronto and Vancouver. The latter staged by Canada’s most historic gurdwara, the Khalsa Diwan Society, was scheduled for April 18. However, the organisers cancelled the parade, which witnessed the participation of Trudeau last year, “keeping in mind public health and safety”. Similarly, the event in Toronto attracts nearly 50,000 people each year and this too has been cancelled, as the Ontario Sikhs and Gurdwaras Council, noted this was done keeping in mind the “best interest” of communities and “safety of people” which were of “utmost importance.”The premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, Doug Ford, also recognised the role the Indo-Canadians has played during the crisis. He thanked the Canada India Foundation and the Hindu Federation for “using their networks to bring together volunteers and resources to help the vulnerable and those most in need during Covid-19, whether its delivering groceries, donating cooked food, providing medical supplies, or transportation.”The BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, meanwhile, has donated 13,000 medical-grade protective face masks to hospitals in the country. These were originally acquired by BAPS Charities for their health drives and blood donation camps. But, Shirish Shah, President of BAPS Charities, Canada, said, “We feel that the healthcare professionals are vital to our community and with the level of risk they are undertaking, they need to be well protected. If they are safe, we are safer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-re-stepping-up-when-people-need-help-most-trudeau-hails-indo-canadians-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-MnW4OQISwZahhLUyZ7IgPI.html

14-04-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic surpasses worst-case scenario in Canada||The number of deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada has already surpassed the worst-case scenario presented by the government just last week in modelling of the spread of the disease till April 16.Federal health authorities released modelling for the impact of the pandemic last week and forecast total fatalities may range between 500 and 700. Critics said the estimate for the number of deaths could be understated since the country had already crossed 500 deaths on April 9. That appeared to be borne out as the total number of fatalities touched 780 by Monday evening, three days short of the end of the projection date of April 16.Through its duration, depending on different scenarios, the number of deaths in the country could range between 11,000 and 22,000, while the number of cases could touch 1.9 million, according to the models presented. They also forecast that the country could witness between 22,580 and 31,850 cases by April 16 and the number reported till Monday night, at nearly 26,000 are within that range.The reason behind the surge past the outlet limit projected is a series of mass casualties in long-term care establishments across the country, which have claimed dozens of lives of the most vulnerable segment, the elderly and those already afflicted with critical illnesses.Such deaths in concentrated numbers at facilities of that nature have been reported from the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec. Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam said that these cases were “driving the severe outcomes in Canada” and this had proved “absolutely a key feature of this epidemic.”The Quebec government on Monday said it was putting the safety and general conditions of the province’s 2,600 long-term care and nursing home facilities under the microscope following the deaths of 31 people in a single home for the elderly since March 13.Police and the coroner’s office are investigating the deaths at the Residence Herron, a 139-unit home in Montreal, which has been put under provincial control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-surpasses-worst-case-scenario-in-canada/story-kjuK3AW0EaEwQTMf0nMggK.html

The 566 new deaths reported by the civil protection service take Italy’s fatalities total to 20,465 - officially second in the world behind the US.The drop in patients in intensive care from a peak of 4,068 on April 3 to 3,260 on Monday confirmed a general improvement in Italy’s Covid-19 trends.The rise in new infections dropped to a new low of just 2%. But a top Italian infectious diseases expert said data were hard to read because new cases showing up now could have occurred up to three weeks ago, given the incubation period.The Mediterranean country last week extended its national lockdown until May 3.In contrast, Spain, one of the countries worst hit by the epidemic, on Monday started to ease tough lockdown restrictions that have kept people confined to their homes for more than a month and put a brake on economic activity.Spain’s cumulative death toll from the coronavirus rose to 17,489 on Monday, up 517 from 16,972 on Sunday, the health ministry said. Confirmed cases totalled 169,496, up from 166,019 the previous day.However, in a sign that the situation was taking a turn for the better, some businesses, including construction and manufacturing, were allowed to reopen.But most of the population are still confined to their homes, and shops, bars and public spaces will remain closed until April 26.People at main transport hubs were handed face masks as they went to work on Monday morning. “The health of workers must be guaranteed. If this is minimally affected, the activity cannot restart,” interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena Ser radio station.The lockdown has helped slow a spiralling death rate that reached its peak in early April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-us-italy-loses-20-000-lives-to-coronavirus/story-BZfN03ntUqJ4RDy0itgf0I.html

Jaishankar tweeted that he and Zarif discussed “respective responses to the #Coronavirus challenge” and “exchanged views on regional developments”. He did not give details or say whether the US sanctions on Iran had figured in the discussions.The Covid-19 crisis also figured in a telephone conversation on Monday between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc. This was the latest in a string of such conversations the Indian premier has had with world leaders to forge a common approach to the pandemic.“The leaders agreed on the potential for bilateral collaboration in fighting Covid-19, including for facilitating supplies of required medical equipment.

14-04-2020||World||US President Trump says it’s his call when to reopen economy after coronavirus, not governors’||President Donald Trump claimed the authority Monday to decide how and when to reopen the economy after weeks of tough social distancing guidelines aimed at fighting the new coronavirus. But governors from both parties were quick to push back, noting they have the primary constitutional responsibility for ensuring public safety in their states and would decide when it’s safe to begin a return to normal operations.Democratic leaders in the Northeast and along the West Coast announced separate state compacts to coordinate their efforts to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses on their own timetables, even as Trump tried to say it’s his call.“When somebody is president of the United States, the authority is total,” Trump said at Monday’s White House coronavirus briefing. “The governors know that.”But he would not offer specifics about the source of his authority, which governors asserted was a vast power grab, or his plan to reopen the economy.Anxious to put the twin public health and economic crises behind him, Trump has backed federal social distancing recommendations that expire at the end of the month. But it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and closing non-essential businesses.Taking to Twitter, Trump wrote that some are “saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect ... it is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.”Trump can use his bully pulpit to pressure states to act or threaten them with consequences, but the Constitution gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials.Meanwhile, the president’s guidelines have little force. Governors and local leaders have issued orders that carry fines or other penalties, and in some jurisdictions extend out into the early summer.“All of these executive orders are state executive orders and so therefore it would be up to the state and the governor to undo a lot of that,” New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said on CNN.Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said, “Seeing how we had the responsibility for closing the state down, I think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up.”Wolf joined governors in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island in agreeing to coordinate their actions. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar pact. While each state is building its own plan, the three West Coast states have agreed to a framework saying they will work together, put their residents’ health first and let science guide their decisions.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy stressed the efforts would take time.“The house is still on fire,” he said on a conference call with reporters. “We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we’re going to need ... to make sure this doesn’t reignite.”Though Trump abandoned his goal of rolling back social distancing guidelines by Sunday, he has been itching to reopen an economy that has dramatically contracted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities. The closure has also undermined Trump’s reelection message, which hinged on a booming economy.Trump’s claim that he could force governors to reopen their states represents a dramatic shift in tone. For weeks now, Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.While Trump can use his daily White House briefings and Twitter account to try to shape public opinion and pressure governors to bend to his will, “there are real limits on the president and the federal government when it comes to domestic affairs,” John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law school professor, said on a recent Federalist Society conference call.“The government doesn’t get opened up via Twitter. It gets opened up at the state level,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said.Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, a supporter of Trump, said the question of when to lift restrictions would be “a joint effort” between Washington and the states.Talk about how and when to reboot the nation’s economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was slow to respond to the virus and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.That frustration was amplified by comments made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s nation’s top infectious diseases expert. Asked Sunday on CNN if acting earlier could have saved lives, Fauci said that, “obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives.”Trump responded by reposting a tweet that referenced Fauci’s comments and included the line, “Time to #FireFauci,” raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to oust the 79-year-old doctor.Trump has complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president in interviews and from the briefing room stage, according to two Republicans close to the White House. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal conversations.But at Monday’s briefing, Trump said, “I’m not firing him.

14-04-2020||World||Covid-19 Update: Confirmed cases of coronavirus surpass 2 million worldwide||New York’s coronavirus death toll topped 10,000 even as the lack of fresh hot spots in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world yielded a ray of optimism and fueled discussions Monday about how some places might begin to reopen.The brunt of the disease has been felt most heavily in New York, Italy, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, but grim projections of a virus that would spread with equal ferocity to other corners of America and the world have not yet materialized after more than a month of measures meant to blunt its impact. Even so, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide surpassed 2 million on Monday.The death toll in populous states such as Florida and Pennsylvania was on par with some individual counties outside New York City. Houston, the nation’s fourth-largest city and a hub for immigrant communities and business travelers in the energy industry, has been largely spared compared to other parts of the U.S. As Colorado deaths surpassed 300 on Monday, Gov. Jared Polis compared that figure to New York’s thousands and called it “a tragic indication of our success in Colorado.”Officials around the world worried that halting quarantine and social-distancing measures could easily undo the hard-earned progress that those steps have achieved in slowing the spread.Still, there were signs countries were looking in that direction. Spain permitted some workers to return to their jobs, while a hard-hit region of Italy loosened its lockdown restrictions. Governors on both coasts of the U.S. announced that they would join forces to come up with a coordinated reopening at some point, setting the stage for a potential conflict with President Donald Trump, who asserted that he is the ultimate decision-maker for determining how and when to reopen.Trump continued those assertions during an afternoon White House briefing on Monday, pushing back against reporters’ questions about whether the president or governors have the authority to ease the restrictions. He said his administration has “a very good relationship” with the governors, but “the federal government has absolute power” in that decision-making process if it chooses to exercise it.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the briefing that he expects more than 80 million Americans will have tax rebates directly deposited into their bank accounts by Wednesday. Under the program, single filers will receive $1,200 and joint filers $2,400, though it phases out for higher incomes. The rebates are aimed at boosting the economy as the country responds to the coronavirus.New York saw a few positive signs Monday even as it reached another bleak milestone. It marked the first time in a week that the daily toll dipped below 700. Almost 2,000 people were newly hospitalized with the virus Sunday, though once discharges and deaths are accounted for, the number of people hospitalized has flattened to just under 19,000.“This virus is very good at what it does. It is a killer,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday.In the U.S., about half of the more than 22,000 deaths reported are in the New York metropolitan area. Meanwhile, tracking maps maintained by Johns Hopkins University showed a dense patchwork of coronavirus cases along the Northeast corridor, as well as significant outbreaks corresponding to other major metropolitan areas — though nothing on the scale of what New York has endured.Houston’s 18 total deaths since the start of the outbreak make up a tiny fraction of the one-day toll in New York City, prompting Mayor Sylvester Turner to say the city was achieving its goal of slowing “the progression of this virus so that our health care delivery system would not be overwhelmed.”Dr. Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said it appeared that COVID-19 had peaked in much of Europe, including France, Spain, Germany, Italy and the U.K. He was worried the virus might now start to take off in countries across Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia. There’s also concern about Russia.Hot spots may yet emerge as states lift stay-at-home orders, said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington institute that created widely cited projections of virus-related deaths. He pointed to states where the number of COVID-19 cases is still climbing: Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida.“Don’t consider relaxing social distancing in the near term,” Murray said he’d advise leaders in those states. “You need to stay the course.”To date, some U.S. infections have taken off like sparks starting fires, while others have sputtered out. Trevor Bedford, whose lab at Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has been tracking the pandemic using the virus’s genetic code, acknowledges it’s a “dice roll” that makes it hard to predict hot spots.And when restrictions are eased, people will not immediately dive back into their social connections, at least not without precautions, Bedford said.A study released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, relying on data from mobile devices in New Orleans, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle, suggested that social-distancing policies prompted more people to stay at home in March and might have curbed spread of the virus.Researchers say people increasingly left their devices, and themselves, at home as cities, states and the federal government adopted increasingly restrictive closures and social distancing policies.The report “provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVD-19,” the authors said.In Washington, the Trump administration sought to delay deadlines for the 2020 census because of the outbreak, a move that would push back timetables for releasing data used to draw congressional and legislative districts.The infection rate remains relatively low in areas of the developing world that have poor or nonexistent health care infrastructure. The rapid spread of the coronavirus beyond cities to more rural areas often depends on travel and social connections, said Dr. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief.But he noted that rural areas often have less sophisticated health surveillance systems to pick up potential disease clusters, prompting the question, “Is it that it’s not there or is it that we’re not detecting the disease when it is there?”In some European countries, officials pointed to positive signs as they began prepping for the reopening of largely shuttered economies and industries.Italian authorities announced on Monday that there were 3,153 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, approximately a 1.9 percent increase. That brings the country’s overall toll of known cases to nearly 160,000. The day-to-day death toll, 566, however, was up, from the 431 new deaths registered on Sunday.Italy’s day-to-day increase in infections was one of the lowest in weeks, bolstering a generally downward trend. Slightly eased restrictions were about to take effect in some sectors of the country, such as allowing stores selling necessities for newborns to reopen.The hard-hit Veneto region, which has been credited with a rapid response to the virus that has helped limit the number of fatalities. is entering a phase the governor, Luca Zaia, termed ‘’lockdown light.’’Zaia is allowing residents to go beyond 200 meters (219 yards) from home for physical fitness and permitting open-air markets, under a new ordinance taking effect Tuesday. The ordinance also makes masks or other face coverings mandatory everywhere outside the home.In hard-hit Spain, workers were permitted to return to some factory and construction jobs as the government looked to restart manufacturing. Retail stores and services were still required to stay closed, and the government required office workers to keep working from home.Some health experts and politicians argue that it’s premature to ease the lockdown in a nation that has suffered more than 17,750 deaths and reported more than 170,000 infections, second only to the United States’ nearly 683,000 infections.Health Minister Salvador Illa said Monday that he would proceed with “the utmost caution and prudence ... and always based on scientific evidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-surpass-2-million-worldwide/story-riL0vF0V1Gjm4M7ntu0Q2H.html
14-04-2020||World||Donald Trump says plan to re-open shuttered US economy to be completed soon||President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration was close to completing a plan to re-open the US economy, which has been largely shut down to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.In his daily news briefing, Trump noted that the number of deaths from the virus in the United States had begun to plateau, indicating that “social distancing” efforts had succeeded.State governors, meanwhile, appeared to be discussing plans to resume economic activity without seeking input from the Trump administration.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNine states on the US East and West coasts said on Monday they had begun planning for the slow reopening of their economies and lifting of strict stay-at-home orders.The virus has killed more than 22,000 people in the United States and shut down all but essential travel and businesses.Pressed on the question of whether governors or the federal government would make the decision to re-open schools and closed businesses, the president said that he had ultimate authority.“The president of the United States calls the shots,” Trump said. “That being said, we’re going to work with the states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-plan-to-re-open-shuttered-us-economy-to-be-completed-soon/story-GdLiJ416O324OaCow23sHL.html
14-04-2020||World||France extends lockdown as countries see hope of Covid-19 peak||France extended its nationwide lockdown on Monday for another month in a bid to halt the coronavirus pandemic, as other hard-hit countries considered easing their measures with hopes rising that death rates may soon plateau.More than half of humanity is now under confinement to contain the virus, which has killed more than 117,000 people and infected nearly 1.9 million since emerging in China late last year. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Most of the dead are in Europe, but the United States has also been hard hit -- particularly New York state where more than 10,000 have died, close to half of all fatalities in the country.Governments around the world are under pressure to save their economies from total collapse as a result of the mass shutdown of businesses and confinement of people, but officials are also trying to avoid a deadly second wave of the disease. While New York’s governor said the peak had passed on Monday, Spain started to ease lockdown orders on Monday and Austria readied to reopen some shops. But France did not follow suit, extending a lockdown in place since March 17 until May 11, after which schools and businesses are set to gradually reopen. President Emmanuel Macron said the epidemic was “beginning to steady... (and) hope is returning”, speaking in a televised address to the nation.“May 11 will be the start of a new phase. It will be progressive and the rules can be adapted according to our results,” he added. France reported a slight increase in hospital deaths on Monday -- though still below its record numbers of last week -- and a slight dip in intensive care patients for a fifth day running. The announcement came as the World Health Organization said lifting curbs too soon could unleash a second wave of cases and warned that only a vaccine would fully halt the spread of the COVID-19 disease.‘Path to normalcy’ But in some hotspots, there were slivers of hope that regular life may soon resume. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared that the “worst is over” in the state, saying he was working on a plan to gradually reopen the economy.“I believe we can now start on the path to normalcy,” he said. The impact on New York has been brutal, with unclaimed victims buried in unmarked mass graves and makeshift morgues set up for the dead.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to end the restrictions in place across much of the country as soon as possible to revive the hammered American economy. European governments were also keen to get their economies moving again.In Spain, where more than 17,000 have died, construction and factory workers were allowed back on the job on Monday and police handed out face masks at train stations to commuters.“It’s amazing that the government is doing this because either you can’t find them in shops or they’re very expensive,” said nurse Brenda Palacios, who took two masks.Austria said it would reopen small shops and hardware and gardening stores on Tuesday following a one-month lockdown, with coronavirus infections stabilising. And Italy will reopen some bookshops and laundries on a trial basis on Tuesday, although it has officially extended its national lockdown until May 3.Italy is the second worst-hit country after the United States and its death toll topped 20,000 on Monday -- however, the number of critically ill patients dropped for the 10th successive day.Meanwhile, German scientists recommended a gradual lifting of restrictions later this week with the rate of new infections falling and a death toll that remains far below other major European nations.WHO vaccine warning But the World Health Organization warned that even the most careful easing of lockdowns was no substitute for a vaccine -- a process that is likely to take at least a year. “Ultimately, the development and delivery of a safe and effective vaccine will be needed to fully interrupt transmission,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from Geneva.He added that coronavirus was 10 times deadlier than the 2009-10 swine flu outbreak.Similar warnings will weigh heavily on decisions being made in other countries. In Britain, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned its three-week lockdown would not be lifted this week as the virus has not yet peaked.Raab is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was released from hospital Sunday after being treated for coronavirus, thanking doctors who he said saved his life. Britain recorded 717 deaths on Monday, a slight drop from the day before, taking the toll to over 11,000. China infections rise In China, officials reported 108 new symptomatic cases Monday, the highest number of confirmed infections in a single day in over a month.Imported cases accounted for most of the total, officials said.Russia reported its highest daily rise in cases so far, as the capital Moscow began to issue digital travel permits.And in India, key industries warned of social unrest unless Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes concessions when he announces any extension Tuesday to a three-week lockdown of the country’s 1.3 billion people.It is not only humans under threat, with a major western Indian zoo bringing in social distancing for its big cats after a tiger in the United States caught the virus.“We have decided to isolate them to avoid any kind of infection,” superintendent Bharatsinh Vihol said at the Kamala Nehru Zoological Garden in Gujarat state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-extends-lockdown-as-countries-see-hope-of-covid-19-peak/story-ulbTAixQKTILiBZyOPRQJN.html
14-04-2020||World||Covid-19: ‘Worst is over’, says New York governor as coronavirus death toll tops 10,000||New York’s governor declared Monday that the “worst is over” for its coronavirus outbreak, despite deaths passing 10,000, as several states began devising a plan to reopen their shuttered economies.Andrew Cuomo said lower average hospitalization rates and intubations suggested a “plateauing” of infections in America’s coronavirus epicenter but warned the outbreak could worsen if restrictions are lifted too quickly.“The worst is over if we continue to be smart going forward. I believe we can now start on the path to normalcy,” Cuomo told reporters.The governor, a Democrat, said 671 people had died in New York in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in America’s hardest-hit state to 10,056.It was the lowest single-day toll in New York since April 5. The highest of 799 was reported on Thursday of last week.Cuomo, and the governors of neighboring New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island, later held a joint conference call where they announced a taskforce to come up with a reopening plan.On the West Coast, the governors of California, Oregon and the state of Washington also announced an agreement on a shared vision to reopen their economies and prevent the spread of the virus.Details about their plans were expected on Tuesday. Earlier, President Donald Trump tweeted that any decision to end shutdowns rested with him, even though it was individual governors who rolled out the lockdowns in the first place.America’s federal system of government delegates powers to the governors of the 50 states, but the president in theory can use his powers to oversee a coordinated national strategy.Cuomo said 18 officials, three from each of the six east coast states, would start work immediately on a “coordinated” proposal to get businesses and schools open again. “We didn’t start with a timetable but we’ll say to the group, ‘We want it ASAP but we want it smart,’“ Cuomo explained. He said at his earlier press conference that the reopening would be gradual, would involve easing isolation measures and could start with recalibrating who is an essential worker. ‘Delicate balance’ It would also require an increase in testing to monitor infection rates and would be based on data and the advice of health experts, not politicians.“This is a delicate balance,” Cuomo said. “It’s not going to be, we flip the switch, and everybody comes out of their house, gets in their car, waves and hugs each other, and the economy will start.”The governor described restarting New York’s shuttered economy as like “opening a valve,” and implored people to “do it carefully, do it slowly and do it intelligently.”“If you see that infection rates start ticking up, which would be undermining everything we have accomplished thus far, then you know you’ve opened the valve too fast,” he said.Cuomo encouraged New York’s 19.5 million inhabitants to continue to follow social distancing guidelines, saying “two or three days of reckless behavior” could set the fight against the pandemic back.New York state -- the epicenter of the US outbreak -- accounts for almost half of the country’s more than 23,070 deaths, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University.The virus has particularly spread among Latino and African-American communities living in deprived neighborhoods where many residents work in service sectors and often lack comprehensive health insurance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-worst-is-over-says-new-york-governor-as-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-10-000/story-RDmerNtK4RguhStMpBCBgN.html

Speaking to the BBC, Gates said several countries have failed on providing proper health care and there will be a “post mortem” when the disease is tackled. “We are in uncharted territory due to a lack of investment and preparation,” Gates said.Gates said his foundation is paying for the construction of facilities that will manufacture seven coronavirus vaccines and the best two vaccines would be picked up for final trials. Gates has also called upon donor governments to help low- and middle-income countries prepare for this pandemic, in addition to helping their own citizens respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-few-nations-will-get-a-grade-on-response-to-pandemic-bill-gates/story-4JMiPoAXOPLUz2Lr26rYTK.html

A total of 49 Chinese nationals who entered Heilongjiang province from Russia tested positive.On Monday, two people were reported dead in Hubei, pushing the toll to 3,341 while total cases stood at 82,160. As of Sunday, the mainland had reported a total of 1,378 imported cases.Chinese cities near the border with Russia are tightening controls and imposing quarantines in response to influx of infected patients from the country.No case occurred in November: ChinaChina on Monday rejected reports that the earliest case of Covid-19 in its territory occurred last November and that it had concealed the real situation regarding the pandemic, describing them as a distortion of facts.Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement: “Recently, certain Indian media ignored the facts that China had officially released and continued to blame China for concealing the real situation. These claims are fact-distorting and irresponsible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tightens-border-with-russia-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-UttR9oatiXztsHOMNAu9rJ.html

Biden and Sanders, a leading progressive, clashed throughout the primary over policy issues such as the “Medicare for All” universal health care plan.The endorsement stands in contrast to the extended 2016 fight between Sanders and Hillary Clinton, who became the nominee that year. Sanders endorsed Clinton, but only after the end of a drawn-out nominating fight and amid a bitter fight over the Democratic platform that extended to the summer convention.Sanders did not immediately address Monday whether he would continue to fight for delegates at state conventions around the country or whether he’d simply use his newfound alliance with Biden to influence the nominee and the policy slate that he will present voters.Appearing in a split screen with Biden, Sanders said there’s “no great secret out there that you and I have our differences.”But he cited ongoing work between the two camps on several policy matters as a reason for the endorsement. And he said the biggest priority was defeating Trump.“We’ve got to make Trump a one-term president,” Sanders said. “I will do all that I can to make that happen.” do all that I can to make that happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bernie-sanders-endorses-former-rival-joe-biden-for-president/story-ychl4r4ty2VGGHhwvSnhpN.html
14-04-2020||World||Imran Khan rushes back to UNSC over Kashmir, this time over domicile law||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has gone back to the United Nations Security Council over Jammu and Kashmir, this time over the new set of domicile rules notified by the home ministry last month. In a letter to the UNSC, Pakistan foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi accused India of taking advantage of global focus on coronavirus to change Kashmir’s demographics.Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s letter was sent on Sunday, barely three months after its last attempt to rake up the Kashmir issue with the backing of its all-weather ally Beijing was rejected. India’s foreign ministry hasn’t responded to Pakistan’s effort yet.One Indian official said New Delhi will respond to Pakistan’s “three-page rant” at an appropriate time. He, however, underlined that the letter to UNSC was sent on the same day Prime Minister Imran Khan sent out a video SOS to the international community for help to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.In his letter to Jose Singer, the Special Envoy of the Dominican Republic who holds the UNSC President’s post this month, Pakistan alleged that the government’s new domicile rules for Jammu and Kashmir were designed to change the “demographic structure” of Jammu and Kashmir.The Union home ministry had last month issued rules that reserve all government jobs in J&K for domiciled residents of the union territory. In this set of rules, the government had accepted demands from people who spent a lifetime in J&K that they should also be counted as residents. Accordingly, people who have lived in the UT for 15 years are being treated as domiciled residents.Pakistan said this “action and its possible consequences” had triggered fear among Kashmiris. “They are now threatened by “demographic flooding” by outsiders,” Qureshi said.“The timing of the Indian action, at this moment of global health crisis, is particularly reprehensible as it seeks to take advantage of the international community’s focus on the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and further advance the ruling BJP’s sinister, “Hindutva” agenda,” Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in his letter to the UNSC President.Qureshi also accused India of ceasefire violations along the border of the two countries.There has been a spike in firing along the Line of Control, the de facto border this year; both countries blame each other for starting it off.Qureshi said there had been 700 ceasefire violations by India since December 2019.India, on the other hand, has counted nearly 1,200 ceasefire violations between January and March; 411 of them last month when Covid-19 cases started to peak globally. The Indian Army sees a link between a spike in ceasefire violations by Pakistan and continuing efforts to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir. Intelligence agencies have reported that there were more than 200 Pakistan-trained terrorists waiting to cross over into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-rushes-back-to-unsc-over-kashmir-this-time-over-domicile-law/story-MdXpD19QXze2CCnimkQt7I.html
14-04-2020||India||Another IAS officer tests +ve in MP||Bhopal: Another Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer tested positive for Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday as the number of people diagnosed with the disease in the state rose to 741 and prompted the state government to constitute an advisory panel to deal with the seriousness of the situation.Officials said the officer is the fourth top bureaucrat to have tested positive and all of them are associated with the state health department. Over 70 officials and employees from the department have contracted the disease and the health department’s directorate is now one of the Covid-19 hotspots in the state. HT on Saturday reported that almost every senior member of the Madhya Pradesh state health department is in quarantine or in the hospital after two officers allegedly flouted social distancing norms and suppressed symptoms.The government had last week instituted an inquiry against the officers and expanded testing to arrest the spread of Covid-19 in the state. The state has one of the lowest rates of testing in the country. The health department reported its first case on April 2 when the managing director and an IAS officer in the National Health Mission tested positive. Two days later, another IAS officer contracted the virus. An additional director in the department, who returned from a foreign country, too, tested positive. On Saturday, the principal secretary in the department, who had allegedly not reported to the authorities about her son’s US trip, tested positive.HT reported the two IAS officers heading the department showed symptoms of cold and cough almost the same time but continued to attend meetings and were responsible for at least 50 infections.Madhya Pradesh is the fourth worst-hit state by the pandemic and has recorded 127 new Covid-19 cases since Monday, the highest jump in a day so far, the state health department said.The state government said the technical advisory committee will include doctors from Bhopal’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “Technical advisory committee is being constituted in view of seriousness of Covid-19 infection in the state. The committee will chalk out the action plan for control of Covid-19 and daily analyse the situation in the state,” the government said in a statementThe statement added health services director Sudam Khade will head the committee while additional director Santosh Shukla will be its coordinator.Additional chief secretary (health) Mohammad Suleman said of the 127 new cases reported since Monday, 98 were from Indore and 20 from Bhopal. He added those tested positive in Indore were under quarantine as they had come in contact with the patients identified earlier.Officials said a compounder, who died of Covid-19 in Indore last week, has become the first person to have contracted the disease in Tikamgarh district. He had returned to his native place on March 28 despite the lockdown restrictions. His sample was sent for testing on April 11 and is believed to have contracted the virus at the clinic of a doctor, who has tested positive for Covid-19 in Ujjain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-ias-officer-tests-ve-in-mp/story-szS3yWclrdxWuRX1RtHBEK.html

They were dispersed after a lathi charge by the police. Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray soon after the incident and said that events such as the protest weaken India’s fight against coronavirus disease and the administration needs to stay vigilant to avoid such incidents, according to ANI.In a live webcast later in the night, Thackeray assured migrant workers that they were not in a lockup and should therefore maintain discipline for the next two weeks after which arrangements will be made to have them sent home.The huge gathering at Bandra West despite a strict lockdown also raised fears of a spike in coronavirus cases in the state which already has the highest number of infections in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-orders-probe-into-rumours-that-fuelled-migrants-rush-at-bandra/story-MZDkLeoiGJQrAB8delSOCK.html
14-04-2020||India||Spike in Aarogya Setu app downloads after PM’s speech||New Delhi The Union government is planning a major push to make more people install Aarogya Setu, a mobile phone app that facilitates faster tracing of contacts of an infected person, by incorporating the curfew pass application process, the process of collecting samples of cases, and by offering incentives.Aarogya Setu is among several such tools being developed across the world for digital “contact tracing”, a practice of identifying potential infections that is crucial to contain any infectious disease. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday listed installing the application among seven specific things people should do. The PM has in the past suggested using the app – launched on April 2 -- to help people move during the lockdown.According to a government official involved in the development of Aarogya Setu, the app has notched up 47.1 million registrations, a big chunk of which took place immediately after Modi’s appeal. “There were 8 million downloads on Tuesday by evening, the sharpest single-day surge since launch. The PM’s announcement led to a spike of nearly 100,000 registrations per minute in the afternoon,” said Arnab Kumar, programme director of frontier technologies, Niti Aayog.A member of the empowered group for technology and data management, which will take the final call on how the application is upgraded, said an announcement will be made in a few days after technical arrangements are made to incorporate each of the state portals, which include websites for the curfew pass applications. The pass mechanism will be such that an infected person or someone told be in quarantine will not be given a pass. In addition to the curfew pass system, “sample collection is also a key function we are hoping to work on,” said the official, asking not to be named. According to Kumar, the application will also be upgraded to allow people to get medical consultations remotely and search for essential supplies nearby. Such tracing tools have triggered concerns about privacy and surveillance.Advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation in a statement on Tuesday flagged concerns, saying the data the application takes in is excessive and the software’s code as well as the policies governing its use are not transparent. “Protecting personal information is a priority and the data is only used for providing the Covid-19-related information and medical services necessary to protect people and stop the infection from spreading,” Union health minister Harshvardhan said on Tuesday amid the repeated criticism.According to experts, the app could address a critical handicap in contact tracing. “You need to have a way of focusing (contact tracing) as an asymptomatic person travels over various distances, over time. We need to find out who all were close to that person and warn the others after the person is identified as positive. This is what Aarogya Setu also does – it will find the symptomatic person and also identify all asymptomatic people around them in the past few days and advise them too,” said Dr K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor to the government of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-aarogya-setu-app-downloads-after-pm-s-speech/story-MxJZBtNCW87mtzDcCQ7doM.html

These warriors include doctors, health workers and NGOs,” Gandhi said.Sanitation workers, police personnel and government officers too are working hard and round the clock to control the deadly virus, she said.“This fight will weaken without your support, and we should not allow this to happen. At some place, I hear reports about ill-treatment meted out to doctors. This is wrong. Our culture and tradition does not allow this and we should support them,” the Congress chief said.She also sought to assure the people of her party’s support and expressed confidence that with a strong morale, the country will emerge victorious against the crisis very soon.Gandhi urged the people to stay indoors, be safe and observe the lockdown stipulations, saying it will not be possible to win this battle without everyone’s support.She also thanked people for maintaining peace and patience while staying indoors and adhering to the lockdown stipulations.“Today, when the country is fighting such a big battle, every Congress worker understands his responsibility and is always ready to help every warrior. Anyone can ask for our support and every Congress worker will support you,” Gandhi added.She reiterated her party’s support in fighting the anti-corona battle. “I assure you that whether the Congress party is in power or in opposition, we will stand by you in this battle. I am confident that with a high morale, we will emerge from this crisis very soon.”Gandhi also lauded the work done by some people at individual level in providing food, ration and sanitisers to the poor and the needy.“Every Indian is united in fighting this battle and fulfilling his or her duty. Today, your support in dealing with the crisis is no less patriotism. The country is able to fight this virus only because of your help and support. I do not have words to thank you,” she said.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda thanked Gandhi for urging the people to stay indoors and observe lockdown regulations. “Thank you Sonia ji, take care of your health,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-hails-front-line-workers-citizens/story-eXCaPFhTjie1tt3LlZaC2M.html
14-04-2020||India||‘No DTC or UP buses to take you home’: Kejriwal asks Delhi migrants to stay put||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday moved to pre-empt a repeat of migrant workers’ exodus from the national capital, seen last month at the beginning of the first phase of three-week-long national lockdown, by issuing a clarification in advance that it was impossible for anyone to take them home right now and that they should stay put in the national capital until May 3, when the second phase of the national lockdown-- announced today-- comes to an end.Kejriwal was forced to issue the clarification after a similar crisis erupted in Mumbai, where migrant labourers, said to be mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, gathered at a bus stop near the Bandra railway station demanding the resumption of transport services enabling their return home. They had to be lathicharged first followed by assurances that they will be provided food and taken care of in the migrant camps in the state till the duration of the lockdown.The scene was an instant reminder of the crisis that unfolded on Delhi streets and its borders with Uttar Pradesh last month when hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers gathered at the interstate bus stations near UP border in the false hope that they will be provided transport home. The incident had led to a political war of words between the UP and the Delhi government with the former alleging that the Delhi government conspired to drop the migrants at Anand Bihar Bus Terminal using Delhi Transport Corporation buses in violation of the lockdown norms. The incident also led to action against senior bureaucrats in the Delhi government. Kejriwal, on this instance, made it clear that the migrants should not believe even if told that there were DTC buses ready to ferry them to some other place.“People may try to spread rumours. Someone will say they can take you to your home if you pay them so much. No one can take you to your home or village right now. Someone might tell you DTC buses are standing somewhere. No DTC bus is taking you anywhere..,” Kejriwal said.He asked migrants from other states to show little bit more patience so that the gains made in the first phase of lockdown are not lost by showing impatience. “Several of you have come to Delhi from other states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or Haryana. Some of you are desperate to return to your home. I pray to you with folded hands to wait till May 3. Control your anxiety and desperation now, because chaos at this stage will create huge problems,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi chief minister added that his government had made more than sufficient arrangements for food in the national capital and no one needed to worry on that count.For Coronavirus Live Updates“We are arranging for medicine and food. If you want anything we will have it delivered at your home,” Kejriwal added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, told people this morning that the country needed to extend the lockdown by another couple of weeks if India was to not go the way of the European nations overwhelmed by the pandemic, and the resultant loss of thousands of lives.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-dtc-or-up-buses-to-take-you-home-kejriwal-asks-delhi-migrants-to-stay-put/story-qUPjl4CQGAYYpI9Fs1wxZK.html

Lockdown doesn’t mean lockup. It is our country,” Uddhav was reported as saying.Also read: Amit Shah dials Uddhav Thackeray after Bandra protest sets off political firestormHe reminded the migrant labourers who had gathered in huge numbers triggering fears of a repeat of the situation seen in Delhi’s Anand Vihar last month when several thousands of migrant workers lined up at the interstate bus terminus hoping to catch a ride home, that they were safe in Maharashtra.“You’re safe in my state, and don’t worry. The day when lockdown will be lifted, not only me, but Centre also will make arrangements for you,” Uddhav was quoted as saying by ANI.Watch | Mumbai: Wave of migrant workers swamp bus stand after lockdown extensionThe crowd of over 1,000 migrant workers had begun gathering within hours of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to extend the national lockdown till May 3 after the first phase of 21-day-long lockdown ended today.The crowd could be controlled late in the afternoon only after a mid lathicharge and use of force by the police. The migrants were insisting that arrangements be made to take them home since they were struggling to get food in the state.Also read: Centre, states in Catch-22 situation, says Aaditya Thackeray on Bandra clashPolice officials later assured them that they will be provided food, most of these migrant workers are said to be from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The incident led to a political blame game with Shiv Sena and BJP leaders blaming each other for the situation. Maharashtra minister and Uddhav’s son Aditya Thackeray initially blamed the centre for not letting the migrants go home at the initial stages of the lockdown. He, however, appeared to have struck a conciliatory note little later by claiming that the migrant situation presented a dilemma equally complex for both states and the centre to handle. ANI reported that Home minister Amit Shah had called up Uddhav and stressed on the need to not let the situation defeat the purpose of social distancing and other containment efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-tells-migrants-to-stay-put-prevents-a-repeat-of-anand-vihar/story-IVmaZc6FP1JPPrfNOQN3vL.html
14-04-2020||India||ICMR researchers detect coronaviruses in two bat species in India||Researchers of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have detected coronaviruses (CoVs) among two species of bats in the country, highlighting the need for continuous active surveillance in the mammal to identify the emerging strains of the viruses that can cause an epidemic.Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some can potentially infect humans. Many viruses have had their origin in bat species over the last two decades. Bats have been recognised as the natural reservoirs of a variety of pathogenic viruses such as Rabies, Hendra, Marburg, Nipah, and Ebola. Bats are known to harbour CoVs and serve as their reservoirs.In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats led to the Nipah virus disease outbreak in Kerala a couple of years ago. It is suspected that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), can also be traced to bats.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIndia has a diverse population of bats. Around 117 species of bats have been recorded in the country, with around 100 sub-species coming under 39 genera belonging to eight families of the mammal.“To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterisation of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative states in India collected during 2018 and 2019,” said the researchers in the paper published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research on April 13.The specimens were collected from Pteropus spp. bats from Kerala, Karnataka, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Puducherry, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, and Rousettus spp. bats from Kerala, Karnataka, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Odisha, Punjab, and Telangana between 2018 and 2019.Rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the seven states in the country, where bats are commonly found. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive to know the whole gene sequence. The match was found with coronaviruses between 93.69 and 96.9%. The researchers screened 21 of the 508 RSs from Pteropus spp. bats that tested positive for the BtCoV. These positive bats belonged to Kerala (n=12), Himachal Pradesh (n=2), Puducherry (n=6), and Tamil Nadu (n=1), where n stands for the number of the samples tested. Altogether, 25 bats from both the species were found positive.The BtCoV causing human infection belongs to α- and β-CoV genera of the coronaviridae family, according to the available information.β-CoV genus has five strains known to infect humans. The two human-infecting strains (NL63 and 229E) from α-CoV genus, which causes mild-to-moderate respiratory infections, are believed to have originated in bats.Two members of the β-CoV genus (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) are known to cause the common cold and lower respiratory tract infections. The other three are known to be pathogenic to humans (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 belong to L_B and MERS CoV belongs to L_C of β-CoV genus.“This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation among Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them.This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions. Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation,” the researchers said.SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be 96% identical to BtCoV at the whole genome level.Most of the human CoVs are either zoonotic --- a disease that normally exists in animals but that can infect humans --- in origin or circulate in animals. CoVs can cause a wide range of infections, including respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and encephalomyelitis in their respective hosts.In India, parts of the Western Ghats, particularly in Kerala, are reported to be the habitat of diverse bat populations. The reports of pathogenic human viruses from bat specimens demand enhanced methods to monitor the local population’s exposure to various bat species. Investigations in unexplored regions/states should be focused on gaining further insights into CoV diversity within Indian bat populations, according to the researchers.In the present scenario of changing demography and ecological manipulations, it is challenging to have checks on the encounters of bats with other animals and humans. Active and continuous surveillance remains crucial for outbreak alerts for bat-associated viral agents with epidemic potential, which would be helpful in timely interventions, they added.Experts said there is a need for proactive surveillance of zoonotic infections in bats. Detection and identifications of such causative agents will provide leads for the development of diagnostic along with preparedness and readiness to deal with such emergent viruses in a bid to quickly contain them from spreading.“This is something we have been asking for a long time. Bats and rodents harbour a number of pathogens that can cause possible harm to humans, and these also interact the most with humans. Bats, rodents, and primates are key targets for pathogens of human concern,” said Dr Abi Tamim Vanak, a wildlife scientist and senior fellow, Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, and fellow, department of biotechnology, Wellcome Trust India Alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-researchers-detect-coronaviruses-in-two-bat-species-in-india/story-G2P2tClRUTG9MsvX77Vt2K.html

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a new notification has said it recognises that there are immigration-related challenges as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic.The announcement comes at a time when countries around the world have closed their borders and all international passenger flights have been suspended globally.The travel restrictions have left a number of H-1B visa holders stranded in the US with their visa permits soon to expire. However, the DHS will shortly start accepting applications for the extension of expiring visas.“We recognise that non-immigrants may unexpectedly remain in the United States beyond their authorised period of stay due to COVID-19,” the DHS said.“We continue to carefully analyse these issues and to leverage our resources to effectively address these challenges within our existing authorities. The DHS also continues to take action to protect the American people and our communities, and is considering a number of policies and procedures to improve the employment opportunities of US workers during this pandemic,” it said.Generally, non-immigrants must depart the United States before their authorised period of admission expires, it said.Non-immigrants could apply for an extension of stay (EOS) or change of status (COS) permit. Without a visa extension, thousands of students and professionals in the US would have suffered.If applicants put in their forms within the specified time frame, their presence will not be taken as “unlawful” and where applicable, “employment authorization with the same employer, subject to the same terms and conditions of the prior approval, is automatically extended for up to 240 days …when an extension of stay request is filed on time,” the notification said.The US Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) added that it “reminds petitioners and applicants that it can consider delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic when deciding whether to excuse delays in filing documents based on extraordinary circumstances.” According to rules, if an employer terminates the contract of an H-1B holder, the employee needs to find new employment within 60 days, in order to retain the visa status. Indian IT workers have been seeking an extension of this 60 day grace period to 180 days.According to the USCIS, Indians are the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-us-allows-h-1b-visa-extension-relief-for-stranded-indians/story-a3N3TXRHUKRQTsqQFMGCUI.html

The PM also added that he was aware of the huge business losses due to the lockdown measure but there was no other way to overcome the situation. Several political parties have demanded that the government announce a larger fiscal stimulus equalling at least 5-6% of the GDP in addition to the first package worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore announce last month. A government release said Gadkari also informed them that the Reserve Bank of India has allowed rescheduling of term loans and working capital facilities to ease the liquidity pressure on businesses.Speaking about the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Gadkari said he was working to increase credit gaurantee to MSMEs to Rs Five lakh crore from the present level of about Rs one lakh crore wherein 75per cent of the advances granted by financial institutions are gauranteed under the Credit Gauranttee Scheme of the Govt. He assured that the issues raised by the industry especially by MSMEs will be taken up discussed with relevant Ministries and Departments.On construction of highways, Gadkari said it should increase pace by 2-3 times in the coming years to meet the growing needs of the infrastructure sector. He added that work is being done on a war footing to kick start the road construction projects at various locations while taking adequate measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.He promised cutting down on time taken to clear projects and other decisions to avoid delays. He said he has requested National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and its arbitration units to decide matters within 3 months.He added that around 280 matters had already been resolved within a short time. He added that the ministry had definitive plan to clear all legitimate claims for payments more or less within the next 3 months.He also asked the industry to work towards improving its export potential.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-extended-gadkari-asks-biz-to-be-prepared-to-restart-economy/story-GcKet5njobiCbBW2eWZxAO.html

Nearly 2,000 primary and secondary contacts of the doctor at Shillong’s Bethany Hospital have been traced and samples collected from 90 of them, almost half of the primary contacts. Results are expected later.Initial investigations suggest that the doctor, who doesn’t have a travel history outside the state, could have been infected by his son-in-law, a pilot with Air India who had returned from New York last month, but was asymptomatic for Covid-19.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.“Preliminary investigation suggest that one of the relatives of the concerned person had a travel history to one of the infected countries and he was back in Shillong before the 14-day quarantine period was over,” Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said on Tuesday in a video shared on Facebook by his office.According to a letter written by the Meghalaya health department to the union health ministry, the patient’s son-in-law travelled from New York to Delhi on March 16. He travelled from Delhi to Imphal on March 17 and returned to Delhi on March 20.On March 24 he travelled from Delhi to Shillong on March 24 and was placed under home quarantine from March 24 to April 7 after registering with the state government. The letter adds that surveillance team of heath department had visited him during the quarantine period.“Though the person took all precautions, but sometimes we see asymptomatic cases as well, who don’t show any signs but could be a carrier. Therefore there is a high chance that it could have been passed on from there. We are looking at all possibilities of how this could have happened,” Sangma said.The Meghalaya government has asked its Assam counterpart for support in the testing of the 2,000 contacts. The Shillong-based North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS) is the lone Covid-19 testing lab in Meghalaya.“Our basic strategy would be to identify, isolate and test all contacts for the first few days till we are able to zero down and close the loop of transmission,” Sangma said in Shillong after a cabinet meet.Both branches of the private hospital where the doctor worked have been shut and the staff placed under quarantine. The government has asked everyone who may have visited Bethany Hospital on or after March 22 to register themselves by calling 108 or getting in touch with the health department.Meghalaya’s capital Shillong has been placed under curfew for 48 hours beginning 6:00 am on Tuesday.Patient commits suicide at Bethany HospitalMeanwhile, a patient who was admitted to Bethany Hospital, the hospital where Meghalaya’s first Covid-19 patient works, committed suicide by jumping out of his room early on Tuesday—a day after the institution was sealed.“This case has nothing to do with coronavirus. This individual who committed suicide was a substance user (drug addict) and he was admitted for rehabilitation. He also had some psychiatric problems and in all likelihood the suicide may be result of withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric problems,” the chief minister told journalists in Shillong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-traces-2-000-contacts-of-state-s-first-covid-19-patient-to-locate-carrier/story-esUUanbOJeOENuljIG8riN.html
14-04-2020||India||Convert crisis into opportunity, accelerate infra projects during lockdown: Gadkari||India should convert the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity, accelerate infrastructure projects and win the war against the coronavirus to achieve economic growth, Union minister for road transport and MSMEs Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday. “Indian industry should look at the current situation as a blessing in disguise and aim towards improving its export potential,” Gadkari said in a discussion with members of FICCI via video conference.The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) minister also told industry officials to clear pending dues owed by them to units to ease distress in the sector and inject liquidity into the market.Ensuring liquidity in the market is key during the crisis and to ensure this, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started settling all pending claims and arbitration, he said.The ministry has a definitive plan to clear all legitimate claims within three months, he said. “Time taken in reaching decisions should be kept at the minimum possible to avoid delays. For this purpose, I have requested all chairmen of such bodies to work till 7 pm everyday instead of 5 pm at present,” he added. Referring to the importance of liquidity in markets, he said his ministry is striving to increase credit guarantee for MSMEs to Rs 5 lakh crore from Rs 1 lakh crore at present, wherein 75% of advances granted by financial institutions are under the government’s credit guarantee scheme. MSMEs contribute 29% of the country’s GDP, Gadkari noted. “The government’s endeavour was to protect MSMEs from the coronavirus-induced crisis. We have decided to raise (turnover) limits for MSMEs. I would like to request you, major industries also have huge outstanding dues of MSMEs,” he said.“We were earlier considering framing a law entailing stringent rules regarding such payments. However, now is not the right time for this. We do not wish to go down that road. An order to this effect should hopefully be out in eight to 10 days, which will naturally enhance their coverage,” he added. Gadkari informed the industry that RBI has allowed rescheduling of term loans and working capital facilities. He called on the industry sector to work in tandem with the government and banking sector. Construction of highways, which witnessed record growth during 2019-20, should increase pace by two to three times in the coming years to meet growing needs for infrastructure, Gadkari said. The ministry plans to go ahead with critical projects during the lockdown.“We have spoken to the Uttarakhand government for starting work on the Char Dham Expressway National Highway project. Necessary precautions of social distancing etc will be taken for the construction,” he said. To kick-start recovery for the road sector, the ministry is open to re-starting projects at different locations on the condition that adequate measures are put in place to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/convert-crisis-into-opportunity-accelerate-infra-projects-during-lockdown-gadkari/story-eoInCJPtqODkthKyDiUR9O.html

The Union home minister underscored that events such as the protest weaken India’s fight against coronavirus disease and the administration needs to stay vigilant to avoid such incidents. He also offered his full support to the Maharashtra government, according to news agency ANI.Watch | Mumbai: Wave of migrant workers swamp bus stand after lockdown extensionMaharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray had led the Sena attack at the Centre shortly after the police were able to disperse the crowds. He held the Centre responsible for the situation, contending that the railways should have run special trains to take the migrant workers to their hometown as demanded by Sena boss and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Aaditya Thackeray’s outburst prompted a sharp comeback from state BJP leaders.Ex-MP Kirit Somaiya asked the Uddhav Thackeray government to explain how a thousand people gathered at Bandra(West) near the station despite prohibitory orders.Somaiya asked the chief minister to explain what the intelligence agencies were doing and how a large number of people could gather when the police did not allow more than four people at one place. “How and why today,” he asked.The parting shot was seen as a reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcement earlier in the day, extending the national lockdown that had kicked in from March 25 to May 3.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh told a local news channel that the protest was a fallout of the manner in which lockdown has been extended.“People who were stuck in Mumbai were expecting that the lockdown would end and they’ll be allowed to go home but they were disappointed with PM’s address today and their anger burst out on streets of Bandra,” Deshmukh said, according to news agency ANI.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis blamed the state government for making inadequate arrangements for the labourers. “That is why we had to face such an embarrassing situation today that labourers in huge numberS came and said that either provide us food or let us go home. That too in Bandra, under the nose of the government,” Fadnavis said.Long before PM Modi made the announcement, Uddhav Thackeray had already declared that Maharashtra would remain under a lockdown till April 30; for longer if people don’t adhere to it.In his address to people later, Uddhav Thackeray made it clear that he and PM Modi were on the same page on the lockdown extension “I thank Prime Minister for it, as I had suggested the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-dials-uddhav-thackeray-after-bandra-protest-sets-off-political-firestorm/story-6p6P6yU8FM9iZ2bOuVaQoO.html

We understand the catch 22 situation centre and states face. I’m thankful to PM & HM for understanding the situation, while trying to ensure the safety of home states of migrants,” he tweeted.“The migrant labour issue persists everywhere. Even as we house more than 6 lakh migrant labour, with breakfast lunch and dinner, the Union and State Govts are coordinating on further relief for the same. We will continue to ensure the comfort of all migrant labour in our camps,” he said in another tweet.Watch | Mumbai: Wave of migrant workers swamp bus stand after lockdown extension The mass gathering in the middle of a lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus also threw social distancing out of the window. Union home minister Amit Shah had called Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and expressed concern over the Bandra gathering. Shah stressed that such events weaken India’s fight against coronavirus and the administration needs to stay vigilant to avoid such incidents. Before the “Catch-22” tweet, Aaditya Thackeray had blamed the Centre for the situation leading to the lathi charge and sought a “mutual road map” to help the workers reach home in different states.The trouble began hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an extension of the coronavirus-enforced lockdown till May 3. Hundreds of migrant workers, mostly daily wage earners, headed for the Bandra railway station in the afternoon demanding transport to return to their native places. “The current situation in Bandra, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the union government not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home migrant labour. They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home,” Thackeray had tweeted in one of his first reactions. He also said that the state government had raised the issue of enabling the workers to return home.“A mutual road map set by Union Govt will largely help migrant labour to reach home from one state to another safely and efficiently. Time and again this issue has been raised with the centre,” he said in another tweet.Thackeray said the feedback from all migrant labour camps indicate that these workers want to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-states-in-catch-22-situation-says-aaditya-thackeray-on-bandra-clash/story-2MErGUXPPXnVmQ7zZjaeJJ.html
14-04-2020||India||Coronavirus recoveries outpace new cases in Kerala as hope lingers in the air||The number of active coronavirus patients in Kerala continue to drop in a positive sign in the fight against the deadly contagion. While the state reported eight fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the total number of positive cases to 386, hope continued to float as the number of people discharged from hospitals, at 13, was significantly higher than the number of new cases, as per the state health ministry.While the recent numbers do show a trend of a declining number of active cases, which is seen by some as an early sign of a possible flattening of the Covid-19 curve in the near future, others have warned against early celebrations and urged the state to continue keeping a strict vigil.Out of a total of 386 positive cases registered in the state so far, 211 have been discharged and 175 are undergoing treatment. The number of people under observation has also come down to 17,775 from close to 2 lakh at one point.Among the eight new cases, Kannur in north Kerala reported 4 while Kozhikkode reported three and Kasaragod reported one case.With four districts in Tamil Nadu bordering Kerala-- Thiruvelveli, Theni, Kanyakumari and Coimbatore--- having been declared red zones, the state has heightened its vigil along the border.Kerala reported the first Covid-19 case in India in January and it was the worst-hit state till it was overtaken by Maharashtra in March. Eight states apart from Maharashtra have since reported more cases than Kerala. CM Vijayan asked his administration to remain vigilant while admitting that the statistics did show a favourable turn.

By paying between Rs 1800 and Rs 7000 a night, people can now isolate themselves at hotels and luxury resorts across West Bengal.Star hotels and luxury resorts in Kolkata, other towns and tourist destinations in the state are offering their rooms as Covid-19 quarantine facilities to those reluctant to complete their government-mandated isolation in state-run centres.The costliest hotel, charging Rs 7000 a night without GST, is located near NSCBI airport in Kolkata. Luxury resorts in popular tourist destinations such as Muktumanipur in Bankura district are also offering their rooms.“Apartment from the usual facilities such as satellite TV, wi-fi connection and coffee maker, our quarantined guests can use our gym one by one. The gym is sanitised after one uses it and then another person is allowed in,” said Rahul Saxena, general manager of a four-star hotel at Siliguri in north Bengal that charges Rs 4,500 without GST for a room.“They are not allowed to use the swimming pool though. There are recreational facilities, such as carrom and table tennis. One can also sing using karaoke for entertainment,” he said.The cheaper and budget hotels, whose tariffs start from Rs 1800 a night, will serve vegetarian fare for breakfast, lunch and dinner. One has to pay Rs 100 more to get non-vegetarian food.Sudesh Poddar, honorary secretary of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India, said the organisation has provided the state government a list of hotels in Kolkata, Siliguri and Durgapur with around 750 rooms that can be used for quarantine.“We will add more hotels and rooms in various other towns in almost all the districts of West Bengal,” he said.The idea is to create a pool of private quarantine facilities that can be used by people on a “pay and use” basis. The idea was lauded by chief minister Mamata Banerjee at a recent meeting with industry associations.Poddar said: “All one needs to do is to choose from the list of hotels once he or she is asked to stay in institutional quarantine by the state government. The hotel will allot the room on arrival but the person has to show the letter of the state government.”West Bengal has around 580 institutional quarantine centres, where more than 11,000 people are currently under observation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hotels-luxury-resorts-offer-quarantine-deals-in-west-bengal/story-8zCFQmvvSQ3irWdIeHN4YO.html

The lockdown has been enforced since March 25 and on Tuesday further extended till May 3 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Abdullah said that he and his father, former three-time J&K CM Farooq Abdullah, have been flooded with calls and messages from Kashmiris stuck in various parts of the country, especially north India.“The stranded people include labourers, shawl traders, businessmen and also other walks of life who have been repatriated to India and have completed their quarantine. It’s been frustrating to not do as much, as one would have liked for them,” Omar tweeted.“Now, that the Modi government is planning an extension to this lockdown something will have to be done for the people stuck in other states. A lot of them don’t have much money and can’t access anymore. There is no work available for them to earn,” he added.Omar warned the Centre that the stranded Kashmiris would die of starvation rather than the viral outbreak if they are made to stay away from home till May 3.“A common sentiment expressed by most of them had been ‘long before corona gets us we will die of hunger’. The government will have to work out some way of bringing these people home and pending that needs to do a better job helping them with food and emergency funds,” he said.Omar suggested that the UT administration use its nine-seater Beechcraft aircraft to bring back some of the stranded Kashmiris home. He made the suggestion after Iltija Mufti, the daughter of another ex-J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti, had tweeted about 14 Kashmiri girls stuck in Amritsar because of the lockdown restrictions.“J&K has a nine-seater Beechcraft aircraft that isn’t doing much these days. Why can’t this plane make two sorties to Amritsar to fly these girls back home? The whole exercise will be completed in a matter of a few hours with support from @capt_amarinder Sahib,” he said, tagging Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.In a separate demand on Sunday, the elected representatives of Kargil, including the chairman of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC), Kargil, Feroz Ahmad Khan, threatened mass resignation if pilgrims and students of the Union Territory of Ladakh are not evacuated from Iran and other parts of the country within a week.All elected representatives of Kargil, including the chairman and members of LAHDC, Kargil, district panchayat coordination committee (DPCC) and municipal committee Kargil (MCK) passed a three-point resolution and sent their charter of demand to Radha Krishna Mathur, the lieutenant governor of Ladakh.The demands include the evacuation of pilgrims from Kargil who have completed their quarantine in Iran and students and other people from the UT stranded in other parts of the country. Besides, permission must be granted to move within Ladakh for stranded passengers and ensure unrestricted supply of essential commodities via the Zojilla Pass, as there have been traffic restrictions on national highways because of the ongoing nationwide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-j-k-residents-stranded-in-different-parts-of-india-back-omar-to-centre/story-yMDq2IJzQI2eemASdoDAuK.html

The rapid spread of the disease has made people wary of coming in contact with each other, and hence, they have stopped travelling unless absolutely necessary.The scenario was highlighted by Deep Kalra, founder and executive chairman of online travel compay MakeMyTrip.“Travel is hit as bad as any business, and will take the longest time to recover. That’s the nature of the travel business. Non-discretionary travel might come back a little earlier, but it looks like a distant thing, you know, to think about people getting on to planes, or trains, or staying in a hotel unless absolutely necessary,” he said on HT Dialogues on Tuesday. He added that the spirit of Gurgaon has come out very well in this difficult time.“We are bracing up for the worst. Because of the nature of the beast out there. It is unknown, and no country has been able to tackle it,” added Kalra.HT Dialogues was organised with top officials of Haryana government and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority to deliberate and discuss what the state government has done in tackling Covid-19, and what is the way forward. The participants also included industry representatives and members of the resident welfare associations.The virtual event took place on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced extension of the nationwide lockdown for another 19 days to check the spread of Covid-19. Kalra welcomed the decision.“There is no other way but to keep on extending lockdown in a smart way. The prioroty is to survive, to ride this time out and conserve cash as much as possible. We can thrive later,” he said.The business man also suggested developing more automated solutions to prepare for such scenarios and ensure that businesses take the minimum hit.The death toll due to coronavirus infection in the country rose to 339 while the number of cases soared to 10,363 on Tuesday, said the Union Health Ministry.While the number of active Covid-19 cases stood at 8,988, as many as 1,035 people have been cured and discharged and one had migrated, it said.The total number of cases include 72 foreign nationals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-dialogues-deep-kalra-on-covid-19-impact-on-travel-sector-and-spirit-of-gurugram/story-WUKSXAOjCzW2b0Fjn6nXRM.html

The Mumbai Police stopped the workers, who were desperate to return home in different parts of the country, from entering the station premises. “The labourers were protesting against extension of the lockdown, saying they do not have access to food and other essentials,” a Western Railway official, who was present outside the Bandra station, said. “The city police tried to convince the workers to move away from the area. The crowd dispersed after a lathi charge,” this official, who did not want to be named, said. Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of extending restrictions --- a three-week lockdown was first imposed on March 25 --- the government suspended all domestic and international flights, and passenger trains till May 3. These services, according to an earlier order, were banned till the midnight of April 14. Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted about the incident. He said migrant workers are desperate to return and many are refusing to eat and stay in camps opened for them. “The current situation at Bandra Station, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the Union Government not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home for migrant labour. They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home.” Thackeray posted, referring to an incident in Gujarat’s Surat where migrant workers resorted to violence last week fearing the extension of lockdown.“A mutual road map set by the union government will largely help migrant labour to reach home from one state to another safely and efficiently. Time and again this issue has been raised with the centre. The law and order situation in Surat, Gujarat, largely has been seen as a similar situation and the feedback from all migrant labour camps is similar. Many are refusing to eat or stay in. Currently more than 6 lakh people are housed in various shelter camps across Maharashtra,” he tweeted.After the lockdown was announced in March, the plight of migrant labourers walking hundreds of kilometers to reach their villages hit the headlines. Finally, states opened shelters to house them and feed them during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-gather-near-bandra-station-demand-ride-back-home/story-m8aAm4Qjt0Qjky2GtF5iOO.html

We don’t need just praises, but more funds. When we approach banks they charge high interest rates. Most of the states have limited borrowing capacities. We are forced to cut salaries and halt other developmental activities,” he said. Follow coronavirus latest updates here.He sought an immediate video conference of finance ministers of all states with the Centre to address some of the pressing financial problems.“The rural economy is in bad shape. People will starve if the situation continues like this. We need more money. The Centre should borrow money from the Reserve Bank and give to the states,” he said adding the state cabinet on Wednesday will decide how to go about extending the lockdown till May 3.“We agree lockdown is the only way to prevent the rapid spread of the virus. Though it is under control in the state many others are still struggling with it. We need more testing also. Mere lockdown will not be effective if it is without extensive testing,” he cautioned. Kerala has reported 386 cases of coronavirus and three casualties so far.“Without income support it will be difficult to rein in migrant workers. Livelihood will collapse if people under job- guarantee programmes are not supported,” he said adding norms can be relaxed in districts where there is a considerable reduction in the number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-funds-for-covid-19-not-praises-kerala-minister-criticises-pm-modi/story-2i96CENnqX3y9YH3rhlJPJ.html

Villagers now tell us that they don’t even realise when an elephant passes through a corridor without any disturbance to human settlements,” said Ansari.He added that behavioural changes are being noticed in elephants since the lockdown was imposed.“Earlier while an elephant would cross through a corridor, there would be heavy traffic with some people trying to come close to the animal, which would irritate it and eventually lead to conflict; that has significantly reduced now and we can see behavioural changes in them,” added Ansari.Parag Madhukar Dhakate, Uttarakahand’s chief conservator of forests (CCF) for the western circle in the state also said that the reduced anthropological pressures have helped in the reduction of conflict.“Due to reduced anthropological pressures, elephants are moving freely without any disturbance which is why they are also not disturbing humans. We are also continuously monitoring the whole landscape to see for changes in the behaviour of animals in pre and post-lockdown period,” said Dhakate.The official said that the data is being collected with camera traps at different locations on the national highway that cuts through the Corbett landscape to study conflict cases pre and post-lockdown.He said that the camera traps are also helping the forest department to keep an eye on anti-social elements trying to enter the forests during the lockdown.“Along with continuously monitoring the health status of animals, like any animal being injured which gets captured in the cameras, they also act as a psychological deterrent for anti-social elements who might try to enter the forests despite the lockdown for illegal activities,” said Dhakate.Last November, a wild elephant killed a 52-year-old man after pulling him out of a bus near Corbett Tiger Reserve in Mandal forest range in Nainital district. The bus was going to Bageshwar from Ramnagar.The Corbett landscape is estimated to have over 1,400, say forest officials.The elephants regularly create commotion around the highway which they have to cross to reach the Kosi river. The crossings often bring them in conflict with human beings and lead to elephants attacking vehicles. There have been several instances when tourists have fled from their vehicles to save their lives.Elephants sometimes also attack vehicles for food items on the 25-km road stretch in Ramnagar area near the Corbett Tiger Reserve. The forest department had forbidden vehicles laden with food items to stop on this stretch of the road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-elephant-conflict-falls-sharply-around-corbett-as-covid-19-lockdown-stops-traffic/story-6KGtIXi5SVW1BsKFpWK8CK.html

The law was invoked against several politicians after the Union government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status last year.The decision to revoke the application of PSA against the prisoners, most of them from different parts of the Kashmir Valley, was made after the Centre gave its nod to a proposal from the Jammu and Kashmir government. The order for the revocation was then issued by the union territory’s home affairs department, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Leaders of mainstream political parties and civil society groups have made several appeals to the Central government to release detained people, especially those held ahead of the revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution last August.The director general (prisons), VK Singh, said the release of the prisoners is an ongoing process. “The prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir and jails outside are being released, it a continuous process,” he said.Hindustan Times has reviewed more than a dozen PSA revocation orders for people from several districts of Kashmir. The orders were issued in the past two days for many people currently held in jails outside the Union Territory.The Jammu and Kashmir government is making arrangements to bring the released prisoners back to the Kashmir Valley, especially after the nationwide lockdown was extended till May 3 on Tuesday. The people said the released prisoners are expected to be either given special passes for travel or provided vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-government-revokes-psa-for-70-prisoners-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-yDBLSg35Cj8w6MLTFDMH6J.html

The April 2 order was explicit that the liquor shops would open the after prohibition was lifted from April 8 onwards, he added.The HC has urged the petitioner to move the court afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-district-wise-details-of-jamaat-attendees-chhattisgah-hc-to-govt/story-6eeutDWpAtKbBW9Fsj1x8K.html

But at the fag end of my life, I am being charged with heinous crimes under the draconian UAPA (unlawful activities prevention act)”.Gautam Navlakha said in a statement: “My hope rests on a speedy and fair trial for myself and all fellow co-accused. This alone will enable me to clear my name, and walk free, having also used the time in jail to rid myself of acquired habits”.Navlakha and Teltumbde were directed by SC to surrender within three weeks but he had moved a plea last week seeking an extension the coronavirus outbreak.

Also, the Defence Research and Development Organisation has come up with a Covid sample collection kiosk.The OFB’s protective suits, which are vital for the safety and well being of healthcare professionals at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, conform to ISO Class 3 exposure standards.“The manufacture of an initial order of 1.10 lakh units from HLL is in full swing. This order will be completed in 40 days,” the statement said.The OFB is the country’s main producer of military arsenal and controls 41 ordnance factories engaged in the production of artillery guns, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, bombs, rockets, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes and small arms.The board is ramping up its efforts to help fight the coronavirus. It has already developed and begun supplying special tents that can be used for medical emergency, screening and quarantine. The DRDO has also developed a bio-suit to protect healthcare professionals at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19.In its latest contribution to the fight against the pandemic, the DRDO has designed and developed a Covid sample collection kiosk (COVSACK).This has been developed by the Defence Research and Development Laboratory, Hyderabad, in consultation with the doctors of Employees’ State Insurance Corporation.It will reduce the requirement of personal protection equipment (PPE) change by healthcare workers, said another government statement.“The kiosk is automatically disinfected without the need for human involvement, making the process free of infection spread.

We’ve made the criteria more stringent now. Earlier an area used to be declared a ‘Red Zone’ if 10 or more positive cases were found there. Now, if 3 cases are found in an area it’ll be declared a Red Zone and contained,” ANI quoted Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain as saying on Tuesday.“An area where one or two positive cases are found is considered an ‘Orange Zone’. It is monitored and declared a ‘Red Zone’ if more cases are found there,”” he said.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.Under its Operation SHIELD, the Delhi government seals off a locality once it is declared a Red Zone to prevent any possible transmission of the disease.Jain said the government is also waiting for rapid testing kits to increase the scale of tests.Also read: Metro services to remain suspended till May 3, announces govt“We haven’t received the rapid testing kits yet.

But then the question is if it was meaningful. If it is true, then it should be told how the country got its first corona case,” asked the Samajwadi party president.India’s first three cases of coronavirus were reported in Kerala on January 30, February 2 and 3 respectively. The first case was of a female student in Thrissur district who had returned from China’s Wuhan, the first epicenter of the disease. The second and third cases were also of students studying in China who had returned home on vacation.Earlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi credited the early measures taken by his government including the screening of international passengers and the national lockdown for the partial success in the containment of Covid-19 outbreak in the country.“India had started screening visitors from Corona-infected countries even when we had zero cases of Corona. India had made 14 days of isolation necessary for every foreign visitor even before we had reached 100 patients,” PM Modi had said this morning, while announcing a 19-day extension of the national lockdown.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The prime minister added that the lockdown was announced even when the total number of positive cases hadn’t gone beyond 550 in a demonstration of the proactive attitude needed to address the problem before it exploded in our faces.“Had India not adopted a holistic approach, an integrated approach and not taken quick decisions, then India’s situation would have been very different (worse) today. But the experience of the past few days makes it clear that we are on the correct path,” said the Prime Minister.The health ministry on Tuesday said that the total number of positive cases in the country had reached 10,363, including 1,211 cases detected since yesterday. It added that the total casualties had reached 339, including 31 deaths registered since yesterday. A total of 1,036 people have been cured of Covid-19 including 179 people who have been declared cured in the last 24 hours.For Coronavirus Live Updates||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-has-a-question-for-modi-govt-on-coronavirus-entry-in-india/story-yYPZ2B9k8pYYEp0avnJPZL.html
14-04-2020||India||HT Dialogues: Haryana lockdown exit plan almost ready, says top official||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday extended the three-week nationwide lockdown till May 3. It is in this backdrop that Hindustan Times brings you HT Dialogues: Gurugram Covid Response. The event has top officials of Haryana government and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority deliberating and answering questions as to how the administration went about checking the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus disease.The speakers included Rajesh Khullar, Principal Secretary to the Haryana chief minister, and Varinder Singh Kundu, Additional Chief Secretary of Haryana and CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority.On April 10, the Haryana government made wearing of masks compulsory for all who are out in public spaces even if they are inside their vehicles.The order also said that any person or officer will attend any meeting or go to the workplace wearing the facemasks and any violation of the order will attract punishment under the IPC.Here are the top points:*We are the only district to have 7 private testing labs. Since the SC order has been amended, we can expect more testing in the coming days: Varinder Singh Kundu, additional chief secretary of Haryana, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority.Kundu pointed out that the testing percentage in Gurugram has been one of the highest in Haryana. “We have tested 1,884 cases till now. We happen to be the only district which has seven private testing facilities. Since the Supreme Court has amended its order, we can expect more testing in the coming days.”*Exit plan for lockdown is almost ready in Haryana, said Kundu.*District boundaries have been sealed for containment of Covid-19. Passes have been issued, said Kundu. *Rajesh Khullar, the Principal Secretary to the Haryana chief minister, said these are very uncertain times, but that the government is on top of things in terms of containment. It has, the officer added, kept the supply chains running making sure nobody sleeps hungry in the night.*“Tomorrow the government will come out with a plan on easing relaxation. Gurugram is likely to end up in the red zone, so relaxations are not expected. We have 16 active patients so far so we are likely to end in orange zone. Gurugram may not see relaxations for a week, even for a week after that,” said Khullar.*Looking at Haryana’s numbers, we can say we are lucky. Our death rate is at 5 per cent, said Khullar. *From government, the instruction is very clear that one is not supposed to leave one’s house, unless it is an essential activity or a medical emergency. The parks inside RWAs are not as monitored as villages and the clusters of low-paid workers. RWAs on their own have come up with set of rules with respect to taking morning-evening walks,” said Varinder Singh Kundu, additional chief secretary, Haryana.“The way people have come out - irrespective of their status - and have helpd everyone, has been heart-warming experience,” said Kundu. “I am not talking about corporates, individuals have put in their hard work.”*The blip in economy will be felt by the government as well. That is why the government employees have chipped in by taking a salary cut, said Kundu.*“We have a set of dos and don’ts for the industries on how to reopen businesses. To bring the workers in, we can facilitate for operating from home or in small batches. We will ensure lockdown is not compromised and social distancing is maintained,” said Kundu.*“Hope this situation ends fast, children love to play in the field and share their learning. It is a different kind of learning for children and they will value it more. It has kept the children occupied.”: Arti Chopra, Principal, Amity International School.*“Travel is hit as bad as any business, and will take the longest time to recover. That’s the nature of the travel business. Non-discretionary travel might come back a little earlier, but it looks like a distant thing, you know, to think about people getting on to planes, or trains, or staying in a hotel unless absolutely necessary,” Deep Kalra, founder and executive chairman of online travel compay MakeMyTrip.*“We are bracing up for the worst. Because of the nature of the beast out there. It is unknown, and no country has been able to tackle it,” added Kalra.*“There is no other way but to keep on extending lockdown in a smart way. The priority is to survive, to ride this time out and conserve cash as much as possible. We can thrive later,” Kalra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-dialogues-top-officials-answer-questions-on-gurugram-s-covid-19-response/story-55bsDQMnILCvuiCd0vSVvK.html

Chewing tobacco products, paan masala and areca nut increases the production of saliva followed by a very strong urge to spit, said a report by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the health department.“Consumption and use of tobacco poses threat to public health….. Spitting can cause serious diseases like Corona, Encephalitis, tuberculosis, swine flu, etc. Under Section 268 and 269 of IPC, and at the times of pandemic whosoever violates the provisions of the law, will undergo six months of imprisonment or Rs 200 penalty,” said an order issued by principal secretary (Health) Sanjay Kumar.The order bans use of all forms of tobacco including cigarettes in all government, semi-government office and their premises, all health institutions, police stations, etc.The order issued by the government has asked all district magistrates and Superintendents of Police to ensure proper implementation of ban.Bihar has so far recorded 66 Covid-19 positive cases.“Implementation of this order will be a big challenge for Bihar because 25.9% people use tobacco in the state, of which 23.5% take smokeless tobacco, including khaini. The police will have to play the lead role in it,” said Deepak Mishra, executive director of the Socio-Economic and Educational Development Society, an NGO, which supports the state government in implementation of the tobacco control programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-in-bihar-spitting-in-public-places-will-cost-6-months-in-jail/story-sdBM0dMz77V2bSuQkn5a6L.html

Agarwal said that when it came to testing protocol to gauge the scale of coronavirus, it is important to test those who need to be tested.Raman R Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) who also spoke at the briefing, brushed aside concerns about the number of testing kits required to check the spread of coronavirus.“Yesterday we said that we have kits that could last for 6 weeks. We have received another instalment for RT-PCR kits which are far more sufficient in numbers, which would essentially mean that we would be able to cover ourselves for a long period of time.”He said 37 lakh rapid test kits are expected to reach any time.“Additionally, we are ordering close to about 33 lakh kits for RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) and 37 lakh rapid kits are expected to come at any point in time,” Gangakhedkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-infections-climb-to-10-363-number-of-recoveries-cross-1-000/story-g7ngfubaZZBthAUvdqgCnI.html

The group wants to spread cheer and lift up spirits in a unique way of not only their patients but the entire nation dealing with stress and anxiety amid the nationwide lockdown, which was on Tuesday extended till May 3. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Sargam, a group of medical professionals in Mumbai, is going the digital way and will launch their first “Sing From Home Concert” on Tuesday evening. The group will go live on Facebook at 6:30 pm to use music therapy as a remedy to keep hope afloat in the times of coronavirus. “The current lockdown has been a challenging task for individuals across all age groups and is affecting the psychological and emotional well-being of many,” Dr Bipin Pandit, member of the Sargam group told hindustantimes.com.At a time when social media has become the go-to medium, the doctor says the initiative will help people ease their stress and bring cheer in homes during the time of isolation, self-quarantine and of course work-from-home. “There’s evidence that music helps the human body mentally, physically and most importantly emotionally,” says Priyanka Trithapti, an NCR-based therapist and counsellor. “Especially coming from doctors, who have a credibility associated with them, the initiative sends out a strong message and will help people understand the significance of music in dealing with challenging situations,” she added.

14-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Govt set to launch 24*7 call centre to manage movement of goods||The Centre is set to launch a 24x7 countrywide call centre on April 15 to manage intersectoral movement of goods, from farming and agro-processing to household necessities in order to iron out supply hurdles during the coronavirus lockdown, by far a key challenge.Restoring supply chains emanating from the agriculture sector is quite urgent as farmers are poised to wind up winter harvests during April-May and prepare for summer sowing. The farm sector isn’t just a supplier of food, it serves as a provider of primary and intermediate raw materials for a wide range of industrial goods, from textiles to pharmaceuticals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced that the current lockdown will be extended till May 3. Movement of primary articles, such as grains and vegetables, as well as other essential goods have continued to stumble. The Union government is still grappling with lack of compliance of its advisories in a country where ground-level decisions are taken by local administrators. In a letter to all states, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on April 12 reiterated federal guidelines on freeing restrictions in the agriculture and transport sectors, which are not being implemented in “letter and spirit”, he said. Trucks carrying essential and non-essential goods “are being detained”, workers are “not getting authorizations” and operations of “cold storages and warehouses are not being allowed”, Bhalla’s letter stated.Without access to warehouses and cold chains, farm goods can rot. Farmers are already dumping produce for want of buyers. “The lockdown and limited movement of goods because of absence of labour, trucks and activity in wholesale markets have led to a sharp decline in supplies of commodities such as foodgrains, horticulture and sugar,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings.The Centre hopes to smoothen bottlenecks through realtime updates in its call centre, an official said, requesting anonymity. Truck drivers, traders, retailers, transporters or any other stakeholders who are facing problems in inter-state movement of essential commodities can seek help by calling at the call centre and executives will forward the vehicle and consignment details along with the help needed to state officials for resolution, the official said.The troubleshooting hub, to be anchored in the farm ministry, will be called the all-India agri-transport call centre. It will help to coordinate supplies between states for inter-state movement of perishables, inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilizer. The call centre number, 18001804200 and 14488 (not yet functional), can be accessed from any mobile or landline. As the country heads into summer-sown kharif farm season, the Centre will provide subsidized seeds to states under National Food Security Mission, the official said. The subsidy under the scheme shall be for varieties less than 10 years, which means farmers can access higher-yielding varieties cheaply. Retail inflation eased to four-month low of 5.91% in March, according to official data released on Monday. However, food prices have gone up sharply in April, Sabnavis said. There appears to be three main supply-side constraints that have driven up food prices not yet captured officially. One, arrivals (of farm commodities) in APMC markets have plunged sharply. Two, land transportation costs have risen sharply and, three, restrictions and quarantine measures have resulted in crippling labour shortages. Yet, higher prices at the retail end stand in sharp contrast to poor prices for farmers, said Vidhi Agarwal, an economist with commodities trading firm, Comtrade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-set-to-launch-24-7-call-centre-to-manage-movement-of-goods/story-qEbXspATDTqNQkplaKhzPM.html

The home minister also lauded the coordination between the states and the Centre over the implementation of measures to contain coronavirus disease.Shah’s assurance follows an acknowledgement by the prime minister of the challenges faced in maintaining a smooth supply of essential items. PM Modi, too, during his televised address on Tuesday morning, had extended an assurance that the bottlenecks in the supply chain of essential items were being cleared gradually.Prime Minister Modi had also added that there was no dearth of essential items including food material. Shah also reiterated the point while advising residents not to panic.“Sufficient reserves of food, medicines and other daily essentials in the country, no need for any citizen to panic,” Shah’s statement released by PIB said.Shah’s ministry is coordinating the response to Covid-19 through the disaster management act, which has been invoked to deal with this global pandemic. Shah said the coordination between the states and the Centre was praiseworthy.“Commendable coordination seen between Centre and States to fight COVID-19,” Shah said adding that it needed to be intensified so that all citizens follow the lockdown properly and no one faces any problem to access things of their everyday needs.The PM earlier today said there was near unanimity among the states over the extension of the lockdown and as many as eight states had independently announced an extension to the restrictions till April 30, even before the centre made the decision on the matter.Shah also said that the decision to extend the national lockdown till May 3 was taken to protect the lives of people threatened by the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.Prime Minister Modi, too, had emphasized on the need to protect people’s lives when he first announced the national lockdown on March 23. A few days ago, he said the motto of the government had progressed over the two weeks of lockdown to ‘Jaan bhi, Jahaan bhi’ meaning the need to protect both lives and livelihoods.The country is suffering a huge economic setback due to disruption of business activities and the daily wagers who are employed in the unorganized sector or in the construction and manufacturing sector are said to be the hardest hit.The Prime Minister earlier today, said that alleviating the suffering of the poor, the labourers and the farmers was his government’s top priority. He added that the new guidelines to enforce the lockdown to be released tomorrow have taken utmost care of their interests. The government had earlier released a 1.71 lakh crore relief package for industries, businesses, salaried class and the poor people including the daily wagers. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesShah also lauded the people for their cooperation and claimed that the Indian citizens, under the leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have set an example for the whole world when it came to a united response to the disease.

The comments by the former Congress president came after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Monday that the rapid testing kits, which were supposed to be in the country on April 5 and then April 10, will now reach by April 15.These kits are being seen as the next phase of India’s strategy to combat the coronavirus disease with widespread and rapid testing not just in hot spots and containment zones but also areas relatively free of the virus.Rapid Test Kits, or RTKs, are blood tests that search for antibodies in the sample of those tested. A positive test means the person is or has been infected by the virus. “With just 149 tests per million Indians, we are now in the company of Laos (157), Niger (182) & Honduras (162). Mass testing is the key to fighting the virus. At present we are nowhere in the game,” Rahul Gandhi tweeted.The Congress leader’s tweet also came on a day India recorded 10,363 coronavirus cases and 339 deaths. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced the extension of the 21-day lockdown from March 25 till May 3 to arrest the spread of the infection.Also read: ‘Arrest virus, revive economy’: PM Modi has a double-barrel lockdown exit planCountries around the world are looking to use these tests to determine who has immunity to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 apart from being a fast way to identify the extent of infections in clusters.RTKs give out results in 30 minutes unlike the RT-PCR tests currently in use, which take up to five hours to throw up a result. However, ICMR’s protocol requires a confirmatory RT-PCR test to back up a negative RTK result.ICMR raised a tender on April 11 for 4.5 million more rapid testing kits to be delivered in batches apart from the order for 500,000 kits that has already been placed. The plan is to have the first batch in by May 1 and the final batch latest by May 31.Also read: Congress backs lockdown extension but asks PM Modi to spell out strategy to fightIndia had ordered 500,000 kits from Chinese suppliers on March 30.

14-04-2020||India||US to consider requests for visa extensions due to Covid-19 crisis||The US department of homeland security has said it will consider requests for visa extensions for travellers and holders of other visas affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, a move expected to benefit hundreds of Indians stranded in that country.The US citizenship and immigration services (USCIS), which is part of the department of homeland security, said in a notification posted on its website on Monday that it will process applications for extension of stay on a case-by-case basis.The move comes in the wake of the Indian government’s request to the US last week to extend the validity of visas, including H-1B and other types of visas, held by Indian nationals who have been hit by Covid-19-related economic slump.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had taken up the matter during his telephone conversation with US deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun on April 8, when the two sides also discussed ways to enhance cooperation to counter the pandemic and ensure the availability of essential medicines and equipment.“This will provide some assurance to Indian nationals stranded in the US in case their visas are about to expire,” said a person who declined to be named.“India had requested for a wholesale extension of all visas, while the US has agreed to consider applications made for such extension in view of the pandemic,” the person added.The department of homeland security acknowledged immigration-related challenges as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and said while it continues to take action to protect the American people, it also recognises that “non-immigrants may unexpectedly remain in the United States beyond their authorised period of stay due to Covid-19”.“Most non-immigrants can mitigate the immigration consequences of Covid-19 by timely filing an application for extension of stay (EOS) or change in status (COS),” the notification said.“USCIS reminds petitioners and applicants that it can consider delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic when deciding whether to excuse delays in filing documents based on extraordinary circumstances,” it added. If an applicant files an extension of stay request “after the authorised period of admission expires”, USCIS “may excuse the failure to file on time if it was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond their control, such as those that may be caused by Covid-19”.The applicant “must submit credible evidence to support their request, which USCIS will evaluate on a case-by-case basis”, the notification said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-to-consider-requests-for-visa-extensions-due-to-covid-19-crisis/story-MzyxJgDyt3uwUXtGsu5mbJ.html

14-04-2020||India||‘Arrest virus, revive economy’: PM Modi has a double-barrel lockdown exit plan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on the national lockdown was driven by the assessment of states that they were not ready or prepared to exit the Covid-19 lockdown, people familiar with the development said. PM Modi also accounted for the fact that except for some pockets, the states had not been able to hit the brakes on the spread of the disease. It is for this reason, they said, PM Modi invoked the shared responsibility with the state as health and law and order are state subjects.PM Modi extended the lockdown to May 3 but made it clear to people and the states that they should start work on a calibrated revival of the economy after the April 20 review. The prime minister called the next week an agni pariksha, a trial by fire, and nudged states to carry out a granular assessment of neighbourhoods to identify localities that had been free of the disease and allow some essential activities.Government functionaries who have been part of the consultations at the Prime Minister’s Office said the extension of the lockdown to 3 May and a April 20 review for some areas was part of the prime minister’s double-barreled response to arrest the spread of the virus and revive the economy.“The strength of the problem (virus) is the spread of the problem. We have to hunt it down from states and districts right down to towns and villages. At a time when the virus is making a comeback in China, India cannot afford to fritter away its gains…. We are in the middle of a war,” a senior minister told Hindustan Times.In this blueprint, a senior government official said, April 20 will be an important date. It is designed to give the government at the Centre and the states time to rapidly ramp up the hospital and health infrastructure before taking the steps that could lead to the first green shoots of economic recovery.“In this interregnum, the testing committee under Environment Secretary CK Mishra has been strengthened with induction of two additional secretary-rank officers from the PMO, Bharat Lal and Debashree Mukherjee, so that testing for virus infection is taken to a different level. The fourth aspect to be completed is the accelerated deployment of the Aarogya mobile application so that a bridge is formed between the citizens and the government,” said a senior official.The rapid testing kits that are expected to land in India by April 15 are going to be central to this strategy. These kits can be used for widespread testing in hot spots and containment zones as well as areas relatively free of the virus. It essentially looks for protective antibodies in a prick of blood and gives out test results in 30 minutes or so., The Indian Council of Medical Research has already placed orders for 500,000 kits. Last week, it also raised a fresh tender for 4.5 million more rapid testing kits for deliveries starting May 1.The consignment from China, which was originally supposed to reach India by April 5, has been delayed due to multiple reasons including international politics.According to a government official, Beijing has instituted stricter inspections and controls after these kits failed in European countries. The other reason for delay is the return of the virus to China due to people coming in from Russia carrying the infection. So Beijing wants to keep adequate supply for itself before exporting the kits and lastly, because the product is in high demand.While health advisors want the testing to be ramped up, the sensitivity of the test is directly linked to the population and prevalence.“ For example, if in an area where there are more coronavirus positive cases, an individual tests negative in rapid tests, then the person may not be tested again. However, in an area with few cases, a person testing positive will be tested again. This sensitivity must be kept in mind,” said a Covid-19 committee member.While the Centre will throw all it can at the virus to stop the disease from spreading in the country, particularly the rural areas, the period after one week will be critical as the government intends to restore the supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrest-virus-revive-economy-pm-modi-has-a-double-barrel-lockdown-exit-plan/story-yDd5g1Cnr5yMUall54pvhM.html

Will it be limited to hotspots or will there be community-level screening as it has happened in Bhilwara?” Tewari asked.“What the PM has not spoken about and made for most horrifying images when the lockdown was first implemented, is about the plight of migrant workers. They are in camps spread out across the country. Is there any plan to ensure that they go to their homes,” the Congress leader said.“Essentially, if someone has gone through the mandatory quarantine period and is not showing any symptoms, is it not the government’s responsibility to facilitate their return. That’s what we wanted to hear. Are you allowing them to go back to their homes?” he questioned.Tewari said that the Congress understands the inevitability of the lockdown and consequently supported its extension besides the Centre and all states have agreed on this.“What is the government’s roadmap for harvesting? Are you going to allow the farmers to carry out the harvest? How will it then be collected and taken to procurement centres? How will procurement be facilitated? Will the government pay a bonus over the MSP (minimum support price)?” he asked.Tewari said the PM also did not talk about the frontline workers battling the pandemic and the status of procurement of PPE units for them.Earlier, party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala asked about the country’s roadmap to fight the pandemic.He said the leadership does not mean making the people realise their responsibilities but to fulfill the government’s duty of accountability towards the country.“A lot of talk has taken place. But, where is the roadmap to fight corona?,” Surjewala asked.His senior party colleague P Chidambaram tweeted, “The poor have been left to fend for themselves for 21+19 days, including practically soliciting food. There is money, there is food, but the government will not release either money or food. Cry, my beloved country.”Welcoming the lockdown extension, Chidambaram said the chief ministers’ demand for money elicited no response. “Not a rupee has been added to the miserly package of March 25, 2020. From Raghuram Rajan to Jean Dreze, from Prabhat Patnaik to Abhijit Banerji, their advice has fallen on deaf ears,” the former finance minister said.Another Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the PM’s address was like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.“Amazing PM address. Exhortation, rhetoric, inspiration.....yet hollow on specifics! No financial package, no details, no concrete item. Neither for poor nor middle class nor industry nor businesses. Lockdown is good but cannot be an end in itself! Where is a single livelihood issue?” he tweeted.Singhvi assured that all stakeholders will do their duties and will strictly observe the lockdown restrictions.“After this: should we pray? We want concrete palliatives for these deprived classes and even for middle India and MSMEs,” he tweeted.“PM address without single specific and without guidelines is like Hamlet without Prince of Denmark. Like PM without details! We want to increase GDP allocation; specific targeted monetary injections; Keynesian spending; loosen FMRB etc. not a single word!” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-lot-of-talk-but-no-road-map-congress-on-modi-s-address/story-sYnST26yAFQAJOFX89MUWJ.html

According to the study, published in the journal International Forum of Allergy and Rhinology, people with influenza-like symptoms, and a dysfunction of smell and taste, are strongly associated with Covid-19 infection.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “Based on our study, if you have smell and taste loss, you are more than 10 times more likely to have Covid-19 infection than other causes of infection,” said Carol Yan, an otolaryngologist and study co-author from the University of California San Diego in the US. While the most common first sign of a Covid-19 infection remains fever, Yan said, fatigue and loss of smell and taste follow as other very common initial symptoms. “We know Covid-19 is an extremely contagious virus. This study supports the need to be aware of smell and taste loss as early signs of Covid-19,” she added.The researchers surveyed 1,480 patients with flu-like symptoms and concerns regarding potential Covid-19 infection who underwent testing at UC San Diego Health from March 3 through March 29, 2020. Of the patients surveyed, 102 tested positive for the virus and 1,378 tested negative. According to the study, there is a high prevalence and unique presentation of certain sensory impairments in patients positive with Covid-19. Of those who reported loss of smell and taste, the scientists said, the loss was typically profound, not mild. But they added that the rate of recovery of smell and taste was high and occurred usually within two to four weeks of infection. “Our study not only showed that the high incidence of smell and taste is specific to Covid-19 infection, but we fortunately also found that for the majority of people sensory recovery was generally rapid,” Yan said. “Among the Covid-19 patients with smell loss, more than 70 per cent had reported improvement of smell at the time of survey and of those who hadn’t reported improvement, many had only been diagnosed recently,” she added. The researchers also found that persons who reported experiencing a sore throat more often tested negative for Covid-19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Based on the findings, UC San Diego Health has included loss of smell and taste as a screening requirement for visitors and staff, as well as a marker for testing patients who may be positive for the virus. Respondents in the study were most often persons with milder forms of Covid-19 infection who did not require hospitalization or intubation. According to the scientists, other known symptoms of Covid-19 include fever, fatigue, cough, and difficulty breathing.The findings, Yan said, underline the importance of identifying early or subtle symptoms of Covid-19 infection in people who may be at risk of transmitting the disease as they recover within the community. “It is our hope that with these findings other institutions will follow suit and not only list smell and taste loss as a symptom of Covid-19, but use it as a screening measure for the virus across the world,” she added.

14-04-2020||India||Animals reclaim lost territory, courtesy Covid-19 lockdown||The lockdown to contain coronavirus pandemic has sent humans scurrying indoors but has widened the artificial boundaries for wild animals in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, spread over 1200 square kilometre in Bahraich and Lakhimpur Kheri districts of Uttar Pradesh. Wildlife enthusiasts and foresters in the area say that since there is no movement of vehicles on the connecting roads, the animals venturing out in human territories can be spotted easily.Some wildlife experts termed it as a behavioural change, saying curiosity was driving animals out of the jungle. “The lockdown has impacted the forest area as well because there is no human movement on roads passing through it. Only a week ago I saw a flock of about 35 elephants on Gauri Panta road that passes through the core forest area and ends at Nepal border,” said Sanjay Narain, a wild life enthusiast, who owns a farm on the periphery of Dudhwa forest.Narain said Gauri Panta Road was usually quite busy, with movement of more than 200 heavy and light vehicles every day. “But during lockdown, there is no traffic on the road and the animals venture out as if they are trying to re-claim their lost territories,” said Narain.On the same day, he said he also saw a tiger on the main road, which was a rare sight.Sanjay Pathak, director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, said the lockdown was a big change for animals. “Now since they do not hear hearing any honking, or engine roars along the road, they can be seen moving freely on the roads through the forest area. This is certainly a big change in the behaviour of wild animals,” said Pathak.Recollecting an incident, he said, “I was on the way to Pilibhit via Kishanpur road in the evening when I noticed a leopard sitting along the roadside. I asked my driver to stop the vehicle and wait until it disappeared into the forest. But the leopard seemed in no hurry. After waiting for 15 minutes I asked my driver to proceed. Leopard is a shy animal, so this kind of behaviour is quite strange.”He said that before lockdown, more than 300 vehicles moved on this road on a daily basis.The scene is no different in other parts of the forest reserve. Anil Patel, DFO North Kheri, said spotting animals had become common during lockdown. “Perhaps the animals are moving out due to curiosity. Initially, the animals ventured out on roads only at night when there was little or no traffic. But now since the roads are deserted even during the day, the animals are moving freely and also in human habitats,” said Patel. The forester said wild boar, spotted deer and elephants were commonly seen on Dhira Kukra Road and Pilibhit-Basti Road in Mailani range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/animal-reclaim-lost-territory-courtesy-covid-19-lockdown/story-klprFiCm8DKPTj6bzPx9FP.html

14-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Flight, train services to remain suspended till May 3||The Centre has extended the suspension on all domestic, international flights and passenger trains till May 3, shortly after the announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to prolong the three-week nationwide lockdown by another 19 days. The flight and train operations have been in suspension since March 22, the day “janta curfew” was announced. The government has allowed the movement of both cargo flights and freight trains during the lockdown period in a bid to keep supplies of essential commodities running. “In continuation of the measures taken in the wake of Covid-19 lockdown, it has been decided that all passenger train services on Indian Railways including premium trains, Mail/Express trains, Passenger trains, Suburban Trains, Kolkata Metro Rail, Konkan Railway etc shall continue to remain cancel till May 3. “To ensure the essential supplies in various parts of the country, movement of goods and parcel trains will continue,” the ministry of railways said Tuesday. The national carrier has also cancelled all passenger ticket bookings. “All counters for booking of rail journey tickets for reserved/unreserved travel at railway stations and outside railway station premises shall remain closed till May 3,” the ministry said. Hindustan Times had reported on April 11 that suspension of commercial flights and railway travel may be extended till month-end as all indications point towards an extension of the nationwide lockdown, which was scheduled to end on April 14. “All domestic and international scheduled airlines operations shall remain suspended till 11.59 pm of 3rd May 2020,” the civil aviation ministry said. To be clear, India at present, is also not allowing flights to rescue stranded Indian citizens abroad.While both the civil aviation ministry and the railway ministry have prepared plans on enabling movement once the travel restrictions are lifted, officials aware of the developments had said the government is likely to resume transport only after reviewing the number of cases after 15 days. “We will impose more stringent measures in the next week. Till April 20, we will evaluate how different states are dealing with the pandemic. States which will not let hotspots increase, they could be allowed to let some important activities resume, but with certain conditions,” PM Modi said in his video address.Hindustan Times on Friday had reported the government is considering dividing the country into a red zone in which no transport will immediately be allowed, a yellow zone where restricted services will resume and a green zone where transport will be allowed free movement.Once restrictions are lifted, the national carrier is planning to ensure strict social distancing norms in trains, which includes mandatory thermal screening and no allotment of middle berth in sleeper class. India’s airport sector has also prepared a ‘business continuity plan’ for probable opening of commercial flight operations post lockdown. In a letter written to the civil aviation ministry, which has been reviewed by the Hindustan Times, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has asked for extra security measures to be implemented for the safety of its personnel.The CISF has prepared a ‘Business Continuity Plan’ for opening of commercial aircraft operations from the security perspective of aircraft operators, airline operators and CISF personnel, once restrictions are lifted. The plan includes setting up of separate earmarked, isolated security checking facilities across airports for carrying out security checks of passengers, crew and others, who have undergone home quarantine or hospital quarantine during the last one month. It also proposes airlines should spread out the flight timings, to avoid a large number of passengers. Reporting time for passengers at the airport should be increased up to 120 minutes, so that passengers may smoothly pass through all the channels like access control, random screening, check-in, Immigration (in case of International passengers) by maintaining appropriate distance, according to the plan. Aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is also preparing a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure social distancing among passengers and reducing contact with staff on board. This includes measures like leaving the middle seats empty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-flight-train-services-to-remain-suspended-till-may-3/story-snOAkrnj13NbuRLU9OexdP.html

Nine people have so far died due to the disease, including a doctor who had treated a member of Tablighi Jamaat.According to latest bulletin from the state medical and health department on Tuesday, the 56-year-old doctor from Nellore got admitted in local government hospital on April 3 with symptoms of high fever and vomiting and later tested positive for Covid-19.“He was already suffering from diabetes and hypertension. On the request of his family members, the doctor was shifted to Apollo Hospitals, Vanagaram in Chennai on April 6. He succumbed to the disease on Monday,” the bulletin said, adding that the doctor was a primary contact of another Covid-19 patient having travel history to Delhi.An official in the health department in Nellore said the doctor, an orthopaedic surgeon, had treated a patient who returned from Tablighi Jamaat congregation held at Nizamuddin in Delhi in the second week of March. “He was a private doctor who had recently opened a clinic, where he treated the Jamaat returnee,” the official said.Another person, a 55-year-old from Vijayawada, died of the disease in the last 12 hours, said authorities.

14-04-2020||India||Govt allows paperless customs clearance from Wednesday||The government will allow paperless customs clearances and permit electronic submission of documents starting on Wednesday to speed up imports, particularly of raw materials like active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in manufacturing medicines, to help domestic industry as it battles the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“The aforementioned reforms combine to expedite customs clearances and reduce the transaction cost,” said a circular issued on April 13 by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), an arm of the finance ministry. A copy of the circular was reviewed by Hindustan Times.These steps complement the “turant” (instant) scheme including answers to online queries, eSanchit (paperless processing, uploading of supporting documents), web-based goods registration, electronic processing of licenses, machine -based release of imported goods based on customs compliance verification, and electronic transmission of PDF-based first copy of bill of entry (BoE) to customs brokers and registered importers, it said.Turant is an ongoing exercise of the CBIC to expedite its systems and processes. It was introduced in February last year as a next generation reform to push up India’s position in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EODB) Index wherein “trading across borders” is a critical component of the evaluation of a country’s performance, according to a February 28, 2019 CBIC circular.The steps are “in line with the ease of doing business measures undertaken by India in terms of reduction of dwell time and move towards faceless assessment which seeks to reduce physical interface between customs and trade. Hence, it is one more positive step towards India’s commitment to the trade facilitation agreement,” said Rahul Shukla, executive director--indirect tax, PwC India.Explaining the rationale behind the launch of the paperless system such as electronic documents and eGatepass, the circular said the specific measures to reduce interface between the customs authorities and exporters or importers are “especially relevant in these challenging times” in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.“This electronic communication would reduce interface between the Customs authorities and the importers/customs brokers and also do away with the requirement of taking bulky printouts from the Service Centre or maintenance of voluminous physical dockets in the Customs Houses,” the circular said.As of now, physical signing of the final Out of Charge (OoC) copy of bill of entry (BoE) is insisted on at many customs locations. This necessitates the importer or customs broker to take a paper printout from the service centre to be produced before the customs officer. “It has now been decided to do away with the paper printout,” the circular said. Instead, the systems will immediately email a PDF version of the documents, digitally signed and with encrypted QR codes that can be scanned to verify their authenticity.The new system will also generate an electronic gate pass. Currently, such documents are physically signed and verified by a Gate Officer as well as a Custodian before allowing the actual movement of the imported goods out of the customs premises. “This physical printout is now being replaced by the PDF eGatepass generated and electronically communicated to the importer/customs brokers,” the circular said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-allows-paperless-customs-clearance-from-wednesday/story-kAzz0pU3oTMLcWk8knz3PI.html

Initially, international flights were suspended for a week from March 22 but later extended until April 15 coinciding with the lockdown. Domestic flights were suspended from the day the lockdown started on March 25.On April 11, Hindustan Times reported that suspension of commercial flights and railway travel may be extended till month-end.India’s airport sector has prepared a ‘business continuity plan’ for probable opening of commercial flight operations post lockdown. In a letter written to the civil aviation ministry, which has been reviewed by the Hindustan Times, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has asked for extra security measures to be implemented for the safety of its personnel.The CISF has prepared a ‘Business Continuity Plan’ for opening of commercial aircraft operations from the security perspective of aircraft operators, airline operators and CISF personnel, once restrictions are lifted. The plan includes setting up of separate earmarked, isolated security checking facilities across airports for carrying out security checks of passengers, crew and others, who have undergone home quarantine or hospital quarantine during the last one month. It also proposes airlines should spread out the flight timings, to avoid a large number of passengers. Reporting time for passengers at the airport should be increased up to 120 minutes, so that passengers may smoothly pass through all the channels like access control, random screening, check-in, Immigration (in case of International passengers) by maintaining appropriate distance, according to the plan. Aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is also preparing a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure social distancing among passengers and reducing contact with staff on board. This includes measures like leaving the middle seats empty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-all-domestic-international-flight-ops-to-remain-suspended-till-may-3/story-OACwuYszaQA9sGhSn9JiMJ.html

The anti-ship missiles and the torpedoes would be integrated with the P-8I aircraft, also called the “submarine killer”.The 10 AGM-84L Harpoon Block II air launched missiles that have a range of about 124 km is estimated to cost $ 92 million. The 16 MK 54 All Up Round Lightweight Torpedoes and three MK 54 Exercise Torpedoes are expected to cost $ 63 million, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in two separate notifications to the Congress.According to the Pentagon, the Harpoon missile system will be integrated into the P-8I aircraft to conduct anti-surface warfare missions in defence of critical sea lanes while enhancing interoperability with the United States and other allied forces.“India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. India will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces,” the Pentagon said.The proposed sale, it said, will improve India’s capability to meet current and future threats from enemy weapon systems.The Harpoon missiles will be manufactured by Boeing and will be integrated into the P-8I aircraft, the Indian variant of Boeing’s P-8s. This is a multi-mission aircraft designed for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission.The 3.84 metre long missile has a 500-pound penetration, high-explosive blast warhead that gives it enough firepower to destroy coastal defence and surface-to-air missile sites, industrial installations and docked ships.According to the Pentagon, this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-India strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its manmade islands in the past few years, which it says it has the right to defend, according to news agency PTI.China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims. In the East China Sea, Beijing has territorial disputes with Japan.The South China Sea and the East China Sea are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources. They are also vital to global trade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-approves-sale-of-anti-ship-missiles-torpedoes-worth-usd-155-million-to-india/story-7wO8HPefjYWt2uIA5FFaLN.html

Or, which are the entry and exit points of a containment zone, where police personnel can be deployed?These are the key questions that can be answered by a map -- created by the Survey of India in collaboration with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) -- to help officials working in Covid-19 war rooms.“We have an existing map of the entire Indian topography. When we collect information, we also collect certain secondary information such as locations of hospitals and automated teller machines (ATMs) in an area that can be overlaid on the map. Besides, there’re various other public databases, which can be integrated with this map to help the personnel working in Covid-19 war rooms to plan their responses better,” said Pankaj Mishra, deputy surveyor-general, Survey of India.The map comes with a mobile application SAHYOG, which can come in handy to add more geospatial data to provide localised delivery of healthcare services. “We’ve looked at the guidelines of the health department to put together all the information that is needed for effective delivery of health services. More parameters can be added in line with the health department’s requirements. For example, if they require information on the number of hotels and banquet halls in an area, the public databases already have around 70% of this data and our officers can do location tagging for the rest. The revised map will be available to the war room personnel within eight to 10 hours,” said Mishra. “It can also help the war room officials demarcate containment zones effectively and check what are the resources available within these areas and where the entry and exit points are,” he said.The integrated geospatial information can help take quicker spatial information-based decisions.“Integration of demographic information with geospatial data is essential for decision making, governance and development,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, DST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-war-rooms-officials-tap-survey-of-india-to-plan-responses-better/story-QI2uVGYY9HPYv8PXQMEvvL.html

14-04-2020||India||From one Covid-19 testing lab in January, India now has 220: PM Modi||India is well prepared against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and has been able to minimise the threat posed by the pandemic to a large extent due to proactive and pre-emptive steps, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his address to the nation on Tuesday, while announcing the extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 3. “On the health infrastructure front, we are moving ahead very fast. In January, there was one lab functional for Covid-19 testing (National Institute of Virology, or NIV, Pune), but now we have at least 220 labs doing the tests,” he said.According to protocols, there’s a need for 1,500-1,600 beds for every 10,000 Covid-19 cases, Modi said, adding that India has arranged at least 100,000 hospital beds for the same number of cases.“There are at least 600 hospitals that are working dedicatedly to treat Covid-19 cases. We are constantly upgrading the existing facilities to add more. I urge everyone to contribute in this effort,” Modi said.He said authorities moved swiftly to take precautionary steps, highlighting how the country launched screening at airports in mid-January, when India was yet to report any Covid-19 case. “…Before it reached 100 [cases], we started 14-day isolation for those coming from abroad. All public places, malls, gyms etc were closed down. When the cases reached 550, then we announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown. We did not wait for the problem to worsen, but took early steps to nip it in the bud,” he said.The Prime Minister advocated using masks and suggested following the AYUSH ministry’s guidelines to boost immunity. He also appealed to young scientists to come forward to help the country fight the pandemic,“India has limited resources today. I have a special request for India’s young scientists: come forward and take a lead in creating a vaccine for coronavirus --- for the welfare of the world, for the welfare of the human race,” he said.Concluding his speech, Modi appealed to citizens to take care of the elderly, especially those with existing health conditions. “…they need to be saved from any kind of risk that can lead to them contracting the infection,” Modi said.India has reported 10,363 cases of the virus infection and 339 deaths so far, according to the Union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-one-covid-19-testing-lab-in-jan-india-now-has-220-modi/story-orhYonkaDpMJf692uKEhTJ.html
14-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown extended till May 3: PM Modi||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said the nationwide lockdown, which was to end on Tuesday, will be extended till May 3 to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and a new set of guidelines will be issued on Wednesday.Though India had taken timely steps to control the virus, there is an urgent need to scale up efforts to ensure no new hotspots emerge and the casualty figures does not rise, he said during a televised address.In view of suggestions from state governments and the people at large, it was decided to extend the lockdown, he said. “I request all Indians to not allow this virus to spread at any cost to newer areas. If even one new case emerges, or anyone succumbs to it, that will be a cause for worry,” he added.Following recommendations from different ministries, state governments and sectoral experts that restrictions should be eased in areas where the virus isn’t prevalent, Modi said there will be relaxations for some activities. However, there will be extensive monitoring of hotspots and areas likely to turn into hotspots, he added.“Till April 20, how much work has been done, will be evaluated. All those areas that emerge successful in this trial by fire, and not allow hotspots to emerge, in those areas we will allow relaxations in some activities,” he said.“But there will be preconditions. If lockdown guidelines are broken, then all permissions will be revoked. We cannot be irresponsible nor allow anyone to be so,” he said.India has reported 10,363 cases of the virus infection and 339 deaths so far, according to the Union health ministry.Modi said his priority is to lessen the problems of the poor. While efforts have been made though schemes such as the PM Garib Kalyan Yojna, more needs to done to address their problems, he said.“The rabi crop is ready and efforts are being made to ensure farmers do not face problems. We have plenty of stocks of rations and drugs, and supply chain problems are being solved,” he said.He assured the people that India is equipped to fight the pandemic, as it has 100,000 hospital beds and more than 600 exclusive hospitals ready for Covid-19 cases. But he urged younger scientists to help develop a vaccine for the virus.Modi said it was clear India had chosen the right way to fight the global pandemic.“Social distancing and lockdown has benefited the country, only from an economic point of view we’ve paid a price, but it is worth the lives saved. With limited resources, what we have achieved is a talking point globally,” he said.Modi appreciated efforts by people to abide by the guidelines of the initial lockdown from March 25 and social distancing. He said these efforts had strengthened India’s fight against the Coronavirus.“The sacrifices made by people have helped keep the losses to a minimum. People withstood problems to save the country. Some are away from their family, some faced problems in getting food. But like a disciplined solider, everyone has fulfilled their duty. I bow before the people,” he said.He said the collective resolve and discipline shown by people is the power that the Constitution speaks of when it refers to “We the people of India”. This public display of collective resolve is the real homage to Bhimrao Ambedkar, he said.“Festivals are being celebrated in different parts of the country, yet amid the lockdown bindings, people have in an inspirational way stayed home,” he said.Modi said the people are partners, and witness to how India has been compared to other countries in fighting the global pandemic.“…Before it reached 100 [cases], we started 14-day isolation for those coming from abroad. All public places, malls, gyms etc were closed down. When the cases reached 550, then we announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown. We did not wait for the problem to worsen, but took early steps to nip it in the bud,” he said.Referring to efforts made so far in battling this challenge, Modi said that though it is not advisable to compare India with others, yet the fact cannot be dismissed that the country is in a better position than some bigger, powerful nations where the death toll is higher.“A month and a half ago, many countries were at par with India. Today those countries have much more cases, more than 25% to 30% compared to us, thousands have died. Had we not taken a holistic, integrated approach and timely steps, we cannot even imagine where we would have been, it sends a shiver down the spine,” he said.While appreciating the role of state governments and others who have worked responsibly, Modi urged the people to follow seven steps to control the spread of the Coronavirus.These include taking special care of the elderly and the unwell within the existing health conditions, observing social distancing and lockdown guidelines, using masks made at home, following AYUSH guidelines for increasing immunity, helping stop the spread of the virus by downloading the Arogya Setu Aap, helping as many poor families as possible, showing empathy to co-workers and not sacking people, and showing respect to the “corona warriors” who are on the frontline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-extended-till-may-3-pm-modi/story-y39oWFyVkqfOELcgFyil6L.html

14-04-2020||India||Favourable monsoon could give farmers some hope: Scientists||Indian farmers may be suffering because of the nationwide lockdown imposed since March 25 to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak that has disrupted supply chains. But global weather models may have something to lift their spirits, as they are suggesting that the monsoon will be normal this year and may set in a day or two early.India Meteorological Department (IMD) is expected to issue its monsoon forecast later this week.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually begins in June before starting to retreat by September. The monsoon rainfall is crucial to rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds cultivation in the country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy and employs over half of its people.Global weather models are numerical weather prediction models run by various agencies. The seasonal forecasting of the southwest monsoon is done with the help of statistical and dynamical models.IBM’s The Weather Company, a private weather forecasting company, has said that the monsoon is likely to set in slightly earlier than normal on May 31 as against June 1 and the above normal rain at 105% of the long-period average (LPA) is likely. “Uncalibrated climate model forecasts suggest an unusually wet monsoon season this year although our calibrated and bias-corrected model suggests a lesser degree of dryness. We’re expecting a transition from weak El Niño conditions towards La Nina conditions as we progress through the monsoon season, which will favour a large-scale atmospheric pattern that will become increasingly conducive to heavier rainfall later in the season,” the company said in a statement.La Nina is associated with a strong monsoon and above-average rains in India while El Niño is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Niño years in India are linked to below-normal monsoon rains and higher than normal frequency of heatwaves. Last year, weak El Niño conditions prevailed and led to a delayed onset of the monsoon.“Our observations suggest more rains in south-western parts of the country and lower rains in northwestern India,” said Himanshu Goyal, India business leader, The Weather Company.Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said global agencies unanimously indicate normal monsoon rains for June to September, which is good news. “This is largely based on the favourable conditions in the Pacific as there is no coherent sign of an El Niño developing during the early stage of the monsoon. El Niño, if present, can weaken the moisture carrying monsoon winds and reduce the rainfall received.”The rain in the pre-monsoon period has also been above average, which experts say will help improve and retain soil moisture and help with sowing in some parts of the country. From March 1 to April 12, central India received 165% and north-western parts 52% excess rain even as eastern and the north-eastern parts are 44% deficient, according to IMD.Ocean temperatures in the equatorial Indian Ocean are forecasted to be warmer than normal, which has the potential to reduce monsoon rains. “Our analysis has shown that such conditions can have an adverse impact on monsoon rains over central-north India. The significance of the Indian Ocean is increasing year by year as it is warming rapidly due to increasing carbon emissions. Forecast models do not generally pick this link between the warm Indian Ocean and the monsoon rains,” Koll said, clarifying that his analysis is not a forecast.The warm Indian Ocean could also trigger cyclones during the onset of monsoon.Air pollution levels have reduced in India and across the world due to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions and this is also likely to impact the monsoon. There have been scientific studies that show high air pollution levels have led to a decline in monsoon rains over the past decades.“I don’t know if the models are factoring in this new scenario with less pollution,” Koll said.M Rajeevan, secretary, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, said there is no El Niño influence this year and the government will share full details of the onset and monsoon performance in their forecast later this week.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate and meteorology at Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said there is some warming in the eastern pacific but as the monsoon progresses, there will be a likely movement towards La Nina or low sea surface temperatures across the east-central Equatorial Pacific.“The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is also negative. High temperatures are already being recorded in central and western India. Rain in the pre-monsoon period has also been good. All these factors indicate that it is likely to be normal or slightly above normal monsoon.”IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean; positive IOD conditions are associated with normal monsoon.Skymet Weather will not issue a monsoon forecast this year because its services have been impacted by the ongoing lockdown restrictions. “Our modelling teams haven’t able to run these models from home. Also, last year, none of the weather agencies got the monsoon forecast right. We also plan to reflect on what’s going wrong with monsoon forecasts,” Palawat said.After a delayed onset of the south-west monsoon on June 8 last year and very little rain in June due to presence of a weak El Niño, there were fears among meteorologists that it would be a drought year. June ended with a deficit of 33% but July, August and September received 105%, 115% and 152% of their LPA, respectively.The IMD announced monsoon withdrawal on September 30 last year with cumulative rainfall of 110% of the LPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/favourable-monsoon-could-give-farmers-some-hope-scientists/story-C5MxWDET3IxDGV1S7nwIDJ.html

14-04-2020||India||Lockdown extended: New guidelines to be issued on Wednesday for way forward, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that a news set of guidelines will be issued tomorrow, as he announced the extension of lockdown till May 3.“While making new guidelines, we have kept in mind the interests of the poor and daily wage workers. Harvesting of Rabi crops is also underway. Central government and state governments are working together to ensure that farmers face minimal problems,” the Prime Minister said in his third address to the nation.“The daily wage labourers are my extended family. It is my priority to reduce the difficulties faced by these people.

14-04-2020||India||‘Can we be so selfish?’ Shivraj Chouhan’s comeback on Opposition’s ‘one-man show’ barb||Under fire from the Opposition for running a ‘one-man show’ without a cabinet, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the decision was taken by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Chouhan further said that he would consult the party in this regard after the first phase of lockdown is over on Tuesday.“When I took over as the CM, corona was the biggest challenge. Hence, the party decided against formation of the cabinet,” he said in a video clipping released to the media on Monday evening. Chouhan took oath as the chief minister on March 23.Notably, former chief minister Kamal Nath and Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha in the past couple of days questioned the propriety behind the CM not forming his cabinet for such a long time and ‘running a one-man show’.In a letter to President of India on Saturday, Tankha even demanded imposition of President’s Rule in the state if the chief minister is unable to form his cabinet.Tankha said in the letter, “Alternatively, if the chief minister is unable to form his cabinet because of issues beyond his control, then a case of breakdown of constitutional machinery will be self-evident in the state of Madhya Pradesh, warranting the Union to consider the imposition of President’s Rule in the state.” On his part, while citing the reason behind not forming his cabinet, Chouhan attacked former chief minister Kamal Nath for “doing nothing” on his part to fight coronavirus.Chouhan said, “Kamal Nath in his press conference said Rahul Gandhi had warned the government against the threat of corona on February 12. Kamal Nath remained the chief minister till March 23 but he did nothing.”Chouhan asked, “Can we be so selfish to stop work right now if there is no chance of continuation in the chair of CM after some time?”“The fact remains,” he said, “No preparation was done in time. The problem was overlooked. The necessary arrangements were not made. There was no concern over safety of people. It was all because there was no compassion for people.”The CM said, “I called up Kamal Nath between February 20 and 23 and requested him to take necessary steps as pandemic of Covid-19 was looming large. But the then government did nothing. Who is responsible for the situation in Indore and Bhopal?”Chouhan said, “When I took over only 7 tests were being conducted in a laboratory but today the number of laboratories has gone up to 7. We are conducting 1080 tests in our labs. But we are not dependent on only our labs. We are getting tests done in other labs in the country too. Then, the number of testing kits and PPE kits was insignificant. Now, we are manufacturing 5,000 PPE kits daily on our own and we have 63,000 PPE kits right now. There was no facility for isolation in hospitals but today there are 23 hospitals only for Covid-19 patients. There are 4,000 beds for these patients.”Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja, meanwhile, said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should also tell people as to what he and the central government were doing when Covid-19 was spreading in the country. Is it not true that the Central government was waiting for toppling of the elected Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and this was the reason even parliament session was not adjourned? The moment BJP toppled the Congress government lockdown restrictions were imposed in the entire country.”Saluja said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should come out with all the facts and documents as to when he issued ordered for PPE and testing kits and what are the measures he undertook and also when to protect the state and also Indore and Bhopal. He should also make it clear as to why Madhya Pradesh under his leadership became one of five worst affected states in the country and why Indore became one of the worst affected cities in the country as far as Covid-19 positive cases and death of such patients are concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-we-be-so-selfish-shivraj-chouhan-s-comeback-on-opposition-s-one-man-show-barb/story-kRD9JSdweb7L3B5Pjv4gmI.html

The symptomatic ones, who came between March 15 and 17, were also tested,” said chief secretary Deepak Kumar.The testing helped detect around 20-30 positive cases, said officials.Bihar went for 100 per cent screening of foreign passengers, when the Centre’s guideline was to test only the symptomatic ones. It identified around 3,556 international travelers between March 15 and 23 and samples of 2,254 people, who were within the 14-day incubation period, were taken for tests.Bihar was also quick to decide on containment zones and impose a strong lockdown, where people have not been allowed to move out of their homes and essential supplies delivered to them at their doorstep, said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health.“We have been keeping a watch on activities of villagers, especially in sensitive areas and those under containment zone, through drones,” added Kumar.Panjwar village of Siwan district, where 23 of the 29 cases in the district were accounted to a superspreader, was the first to be put under the ‘red zone’ and complete barricading of the village was done at 200 metres, 500 metres, 1 kilometre, 2 kilometre and 3 kilometre.Kadirabad in Begusarai district was also put under containment zone. Eight Indonesians of Tablighi Jamaat who were here in mid-March, are believed to have infected young boys, said top government sources, requesting anonymity.Begusarai and Nawada have accounted for at least 10 Covid-19 cases, which were tracked to those having come either in contact with members of the Tablighi Jamaat or returnees from the Nizamuddin Markaz.The government has also drawn up containment plan for Bahadurpur village in Nawada where a Tablighi Jamaat member, who returned from the Nizamuddin Markaz had tested positive. Later, a 45-year-old mason and a 16-year-old girl, who came in contact with the 38-year-old male, tested positive for the virus on Saturday.The state has already sanitised two mosques in Nawada and seven in Begusari and is keeping close tabs on them, said officials.The ICMR has approved four laboratories in Bihar for conducting real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of nose and throat swab, a confirmatory test for Covid-19. So far 7,611 samples had been collected of which 7,199 tested, at an average 103 tests per day. Of them, 65 were positive. Twenty-six people had so far recovered and discharged from hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-fight-100-screening-of-foreigners-gives-bihar-the-edge/story-gPLHo8BOWyVdUZnrzfo0mJ.html

The 21-day lockdown period is ending on April 14 amid a strong possibility that this will be extended further. “In a calibrated manner, we will have to open our economic activity,” he said. In a word of caution, he said people must ensure that social behaviour and lifestyle changes for the good. “By strengthening our healthcare , we have to make sure that we are ready for potential healthcare challenges in the future,” Paul said adding that India needs to make sure it loses a minimum number of lives. He also revealed that four Indian laboratories are working on developing a vaccine for the coronavirus. “We know that whoever discovers the vaccine, even if it is outside India, we will be the manufacturing hub,” he said. Also participating in the session, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that India has opened up mobile manufacturing and manufacturing of APIs in the country. “In a similar way, we should look at five to six sectors for manufacturing in India,” Kant said. According to Kant, individual discipline will be the key to our success in controlling the spread of COVID-19. “Companies have to be vigilant and forthcoming to ensure workers function in multiple shifts, maintain social distance and observe high level of hygiene at the workplace,” he said. The Niti Aayog CEO admitted that when first lockdown was imposed, the government  did not have much time to prepare, therefore there was some issue of supply chain. “Now we have to ensures efficient supply chain of consumer goods,” Kant said. He informed that about  four crore people have already downloaded  AarogyaSetu app. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 10 am on Tuesday, the last day of 21-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown, amid indications that the shutdown could be extended by another two weeks with certain relaxations to boost economic activities. According to the Health Ministry, 796 new Covid-19 cases and 35 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 9,152 and deaths 308.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-mortality-rate-in-india-not-severe-says-niti-aayog-member/story-8IP6664Yzx1WYT0ikx7ttL.html
14-04-2020||India||‘No greater patriotism than persistence’: Sonia Gandhi thanks Covid-19 warriors||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday thanked and praised all those who are fighting against the coronavirus pandemic from the frontline as she urged people to follow rules during the lockdown and adhere to social distancing norms.In her video message, which came hours ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, Gandhi spoke about doctors, health and sanitation workers, policemen, non-profit organisations who are helping others without thinking about their personal safety.“I hope that you are staying safe at your homes during this hour of the coronavirus pandemic. At the very beginning, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all the citizens for maintaining peace and keeping patience and resolve during this tough time,” she said in the nearly six-minute video. There is no greater patriotism than the persistence of these warriors during the time of coronavirus crisis, the Congress president said in her message. “We will defeat corona with a sense of unity, discipline and self-confidence,” she said.“I can never forget the sacrifice of your family members, wife, husbands, children. Despite the dangers, it is only because of your cooperation and support that we are able to fight this war. I do not have words to thank them,”.“Dear citizens, these warriors are helping us win this war despite the lack of personal security. Our doctors, health workers and non-government organisations are treating people despite the lack of personal protection equipment,” she said. Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePolice personnel and soldiers are making sure that people are following the norms of lockdown. Sanitation workers, she said, are working without the safety gears to stop the infection from spreading. Government officials are also working hard to make sure essential services reach people.“But if we don’t support them they won’t be able to do their jobs. We have to honour them,” she said.She mentioned reports of people misbehaving with doctors. “This is quite wrong because this is against our culture. We have to help and support them.”She thanked all those who are working on their personal level—feeding the poor, giving away sanitisers, mask and dry ration to those who need them—to extend help in any way they can.“Every Indian has come together and fulfilled their responsibility to fight this war against corona. All of you must be thanked,” she said.The Congress party and its workers are always ready to do their bit to help anyone who needs it.“When the country is fighting such a big war, very Congress worker understands their responsibility too and will be there to help all the warriors. You can contact our central control room or those in the states for help or in time of any need. Congress’ soldier will help in any way they can,” she said.“I want to assure you that we are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this war either we are in power or in the opposition. I am sure that we will come out of this danger soon with our resolve,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-greater-patriotism-congress-president-sonia-gandhi-thanks-covid-19-warriors-people/story-8Woppqd7udoxNw8H3YvoNI.html

The sole objective of this work of fiction is to pass on a message of awareness and in no way aims to create panic,” the film says at the very beginning. It starts on September 9, 2020, with the voice of the legendary broadcaster and playwright Birendra Krishna Bhadra playing on a radio and marking the beginning of the Durga Puja festival while the protagonist coughs in the background. “The radio will stop once it runs out of battery. There is no electricity. Mobile services were blocked to stop mass hysteria and a few candles are all I have. Copses are lying all around the city. The radio told me 10 days ago that a helicopter will drop some food on our roofs,” says the protagonist.

14-04-2020||India||Ahead of PM Modi’s address, Odisha announces relaxation of lockdown for livelihood generation||Odisha, the first state in the country to extend the lockdown to April 30, on Monday, announced several measures to ensure generation of jobs under a flagship scheme and Swachh Bharat.It will also allow e-commerce platforms like Amazon to deliver goods at homes.Till Monday, Odisha had reported 55 Covid-19 cases of whom a 72-year old man died and 18 have recovered so far. Only two of the remaining 41 patients are critical. The relaxation order came a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the nation on the possible extension of the nation-wide lockdown, as the number of Covid-19 positive patients in the country raced to 10,000, with more than 300 deaths in less than a month.Last week, the state government had announced that during the extended lockdown period beginning April 15, farmers in the state will be allowed to undertake farming operations for the Rabi season and also prepare for the Kharif season, on the condition that they ensure social distancing. According to the order issued by chief secretary Asit Tripathy, marketing and transportation of agricultural inputs, agricultural and horticultural products to markets both intra- and inter-state by retailers and transporters will be permitted without any restrictions. Also read: What you need to know todayFarmers will be allowed to resume all agricultural activities, including harvesting, selling their Rabi crops and other activities to prepare their fields for the coming Kharif season. Shops and establishments selling agricultural implements, cattle feed and fish feed and food processing and packaging units will also be allowed to remain open.The order said that activities relating to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme, construction of individual toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission and individual houses under rural housing schemes will go on. The panchayati raj department will also facilitate construction and repair of drinking water facilities. Farmers can also dig farm ponds and purchase agricultural implements. Cooperatives banks and other such institutions will disburse loans to farmers during the lockdown period. The procurement of the Rabi crop will resume and all cold storages and godowns allowed to carry out their activities, conditional to social distancing.People engaged in fishing, floriculture, tendu leaf plucking and collection of non-timber forest produce can also carry out their work. The forest department will be allowed to execute plantation and take up construction and repair of water bodies for wild animals across the state. Also read: Covid-19 cases in India double to 10,000 in six daysState Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) Pradeep Jena said that social distancing norms would be strictly followed while facilitating activities that were related to livelihoods of the people.The relaxation in agriculture and pisciculture came following reports that distressed farmers of Rabi crops like vegetables, were forced to sell their harvest. In several districts, farmers had to either throw away vegetables, a highly perishable commodity or, sell them at very low rates. Though Rabi crops such paddy, maize and millet have not been damaged, procurement during lockdown had become an uphill task.Farmer leader Ashok Pradhan of Sambalpur Zilla Krushak Surakhya Sangathan said that the relaxation of lockdown measures was all fine, but that the order needed to be passed down to the lower police functionaries on the ground, as they would be implementing the lockdown.However, Pradhan said the relaxation would not solve the problem of shortage of farm labourers in districts like Bargarh and Sambalpur, where agricultural labourers from Chhattisgarh come to work.“As long as the lockdown is in place, there is little scope of people coming from Chhattisgarh. Further, there is no clarity on whether farmers will be allowed to transport their produce to mandis in vehicles,” said Pradhan.Also read: Areas without containment zones on a war footing to avoid clustersBesides, e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Big Basket etc will be allowed to deliver goods across Odisha. Companies engaged in home delivery of goods and services will be allowed to operate without any hindrance. Restaurants, too, will be allowed to carry out home delivery but cannot allow people to dine at their premises. Similarly, roadside eateries will remain open and people can fetch their food to eat outside.Meanwhile, Odisha police have proposed to hire around 2400 retired policemen of state and central forces as special police officers for deployment in different districts. They will help maintain proper law and order in different containment zones, as well as trace Covid-19 suspects.The police force has requested the home department to fill 2394 vacancies of the rank of inspector, sub-inspector, assistant sub-inspector and constables in different districts for a period of at least six months. Uninterrupted round-the-clock deployment on roads and containment zones is adversely affecting the sensitiveness and morale of the existing manpower, a senior police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-pm-modi-s-address-odisha-announces-relaxation-of-lockdown-for-livelihood-generation/story-sOKoMyU2QHzwFtVlesJilM.html

The petition, filed by a Jammu-based lawyer Supriya Pandita, questioned the role of the Centre, the Delhi government and the Delhi Police for risking the health of millions of citizens by allowing the huge congregation comprising foreign delegates. The matter will be taken up by the court after two weeks.The petition came up for hearing before a bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices LN Rao and MM Shantanagouder. The court directed a copy of the petition to be served to the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the Central government.The Court also heard a related petition filed by Jamiat Ulama i-Hind which demanded an end to demonizing of Muslims following the Tablighi event. The petition raised objections to news reports naming the members of Tablighi Jamaat who were infected. Advocate Ejaz Maqbool argued that the petition had led to violence against members of the Muslim community in Karnataka.The bench told Maqbool that the remedy for defamation against media organizations cannot be in a writ petition. Also, it questioned why the petition did not make Press Council of India (PCI) a party. Not inclined to pass any interim orders gagging the media, the court allowed the petition to join PCI as a party and posted it for hearing along with Pandita’s petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-laxity-behind-event-sc-to-govt/story-OCBtzh709z9eIQ6sz26rBJ.html

14-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Phones may hold key to catching up with the pandemic||Tools such as cellphone-based contact tracing are becoming increasingly important in the fight to contain Covid-19, a disease spreading too quickly and silently for conventional disease control measures to contain it, according to experts and researchers who say this could fundamentally involve some compromises on personal privacy.The problem stems from the insidious nature of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19: it can be spread by a person who does not show symptoms (thus probably unaware of the illness), and merely breathing, coughing and sneezing could pass it on to anyone close by. Tracing contacts through conventional methods, therefore, may be ineffective, require too much manpower, and take too much time for effective containment.“To defeat this virus, you either need a vaccine or testing, contact-tracing, quarantine, which is the hallmark of epidemiological containment. The issue is that normally viruses don’t spread as fast. Most that kill or are serious are infectious at a stage when someone gets very sick,” said Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, who was one of the first prominent public health officials to raise an alarm about the virus in January when it spread mostly within China.“Contact tracing only works if you trace far enough and people remember well enough. And it needs a huge manpower. In Wuhan alone, they deployed almost 10,000 people,” added Ding during an interview over video. With a mobile phone-based tool, “you don’t need the manpower and it is instantaneous – the speed is the most crucial aspect. Problems in recalling who an infected person met or where they were too get taken care of,” he said. Ding led efforts to create one of the first such mobile applications back in 2014 called Germ Theory. “During the Ebola crisis, we realised contact tracing is a tedious effort and people have terrible recall,” he said.The idea was also floated by researchers from Oxford University in a paper published on March 31 in which they said, “a mobile phone app implementing instantaneous contact tracing could reduce transmission enough for sustained epidemic suppression, stopping the virus from spreading further.”On April 2, the Indian government launched its own contact-tracing mobile application and roughly a week later, Apple and Google – who together dominate the cellphone software platform market almost entirely – announced they are working on similar mechanism for iPhone and Android-based phones.The apps work on a simple premise: a phone will exchange details – converted into a random, unique alphanumeric – with another phone if the two are in the range of their Bluetooth radios. Bluetooth is a short-distance radio wave, which is picked up only when someone is close enough to, say, be in the same flat or office.The data will be shared with health authorities in the event that either of the device’s users test positive for an infection, triggering an alert to all other devices that may have been in the contact chain, according to the workings disclosed by India’s Aarogya Setu (health bridge) app and the proposed Google, Apple mechanism. Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal, during the daily briefing on Covid-19, said the Aarogya Setu application was downloaded by 35 million people till Monday.PRIVACY WORRIESThe approach, however, has drawn questions about privacy violations. “People will wonder: who profiteers from these apps? Will there by government intrusion?” said Ding.India’s Aarogya Setu has drawn criticism by privacy advocacy groups such as the Internet Freedom Foundation, which says the programme has “a systemic lack of auditability and transparency”. “[There] appears to be a much wider collection and possible sharing [of data] outside of the device, than envisioned under other apps,” said a working paper by IFF, which analysed a similar application used in Singapore and one developed by researchers at MIT.Technology lawyer Rahul Matthan, who advised the Indian government in the development of the Aarogya Setu app, said the features in the application need to be looked at in the context of the circumstances of the epidemic. “If we agree we need some sort of a technological solution to carry out contact tracing, we know that the only way to do that is fundamentally privacy invasive,” said Matthan, a partner-lawyer at Trilegal. “Our approach in designing the privacy features have been to look at what basic privacy principles are around the world,” he said, adding that he supported calls for the programme code to be made public if there was a trust deficit between users and the government. Matthan said the Aarogya Setu app seeks details needed to create demographic profiles since it is crucial to understand the scale of the disease in India. “Age and gender data is relevant because we know the disease stratifies by age. Location data is used to create heat maps – this is crucial because in India, we are a densely populated country and not a lot of people have smart phones. If you contact only those with phones, you leave out a lot of others,” he said. Matthan said the app is distinct from an operating system-level solution that Google and Apple are working on because it involves health officials.“Putting too much trust in algorithmic solution is dangerous. They cannot take into account several factors that can influence the probability of contracting an infection. They may also give people a false sense of hope,” he said, adding that health officials ultimately determine which people identified by the Aarogya Setu must be tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tech-surveillance-only-way-forward-for-contact-tracing-experts/story-JxbOgDxEPwJXnyjN6gNyFN.html
14-04-2020||India||Rapid test kit shipment delayed again amid urgent requirement||The rapid testing kits, which were supposed to be here on April 5, and then April 10, will now be here by April 15, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Monday, commenting on what could well be the lynchpin of the next phase of India’s strategy to combat the coronavirus disease -- widespread (and rapid) testing, not just in hot spots and containment zones but also areas relatively free of the virus. Called Rapid Test Kits, or RTKs, these are blood tests that search for antibodies in the sample of those tested — a positive test means the person is or has been infected by the virus. Apart from being a fast way to identify the extent of infections in clusters, countries around the world are looking to use these tests to determine who has immunity to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.As such, they are in demand everywhere. Unlike the RT-PCR tests currently in use, which take up to five hours to throw up a result, RTKs give out results in 30 minutes. However, ICMR’s protocol requires a confirmatory RT-PCR test to back up a negative RTK result.“We cannot comment on whether our Chinese consignment of rapid testing kits got diverted to the US or somewhere else because we neither maintain commercial data nor are we manufacturers who would know where our supplies are going. Kits are coming from China, and we have been told some of the kits should reach us by April 15,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, division of epidemiology and communicable disease, ICMR. An ICMR official who asked not to be named said that after many kits failed quality tests, the Chinese regulator, National Medical Products Administration, restricted exports, allowing only five to six companies to sell them. “Quality control is important as there is no point in getting a product and then realising it is of no use. The products from China have to be cleared by their local regulator and we will also conduct tests on batches to check their accuracy on a random basis,” added this person.In addition to the order for 500,000 kits that has already been placed, ICMR raised a tender on April 11 for 4.5 million more rapid testing kits to be delivered in batches. The plan is to have the first batch in by May 1 and the final batch latest by May 31.India ordered 500,000 kits from Chinese suppliers on March 30, and in anticipation of the arrival of the kits first on April 5, India issued an advisory on starting rapid antibody testing on April 4, and revised the testing guidelines on April 9 to include rapid testing of all symptomatic individuals in hot spot areas with symptoms at least a week old.In addition, several Indian states have also placed orders for RTKs. Tamil Nadu, for instance, awaits 400,000 RTKs from China in order to scale up testing across the state“The consignment which was to come to India is not for Tamil Nadu alone. Reports from the vendor’s side suggest seven lakh kits (700,000) were supposed to be shipped out, of which five lakh was for the government of India, one lakh for Tamil Nadu and another one lakh for other states. Unfortunately, due to some issues, these never made it out of China,” a state government official said on condition of anonymity. Tamil Nadu health secretary Beela Rajesh said on Monday that the kits were expected to reach the state within two days, but Tamil Nadu has already expanded its testing pool using existing RT-PCR tests. “We have ordered rapid test kits that will serve as a screening and surveillance tool. We have already ordered four lakh kits, and they will reach us in a day or two. But we are not waiting for that [to scale up screening]. The confirmatory test is our PCR test and that is now deployed as part of a large-scale massive testing.” On Saturday, Tamil Nadu chief secretary K Shanmugam told reporters that China had diverted kits meant for India to the US.HLL Lifecare Limited, a public sector company whose rapid antibody testing kit is approved by ICMR, will start manufacturing kits this week and may be able to deliver some to the government for large-scale testing in the community by the end of the week.But other domestic manufacturers are dependent on China for some components to manufacture these kits, and constrained by an embargo on exports of these components.On April 10, the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, said eight antibody-based rapid tests have been validated and found satisfactory by the facility. Some of those test kits are made by Indian manufacturers. “HLL got a clearance from Indian Council of Medical Research, National Institute of Virology, Pune to manufacture rapid antibody testing kits but we were awaiting a license from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) which we have received today. Manufacturing is likely to start in the next three to four days in our Manesar plant. In the initial phase, we plan to manufacture two million kits till May 30,” said an HLL executive who asked not to be named.A member of the Association of Diagnostics Manufacturers of India (ADMI), a body representing testing kit manufacturers, said some of the important components for the kits are imported from China. “China has an embargo on exports now. This has slowed down manufacturing of these kits in India. The process takes time, if your order hasn’t been delivered by a vendor, you will have to then look for other vendors. Logistics are not at their best now.”Dr Tarun Bhatnagar, epidemiologist, ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, said: “Antibody testing will not tell us who is currently infected. It will tell us who has been infected in the past. Generally, antibodies are developed five to seven days after contracting the infection. If people test positive, it tells us that they were exposed to the virus sometime in the past and developed no symptoms or very mild symptoms. Firstly, such testing tells us how widespread the infection is in the community and how large is the proportion of asymptomatic patients because infection spreads more from a person who is symptomatic. It tells us what is more common, mild symptoms or severe. Antibody tests are required to understand the virus. It is a surveillance tool and is cheaper than RT-PCR (which detects active infection).”Veena Kohli, CEO of Vanguard Diagnostics Limited, which has also been validated for manufacturing of these kits and president of ADMI, said: “The Indian diagnostics manufacturers are working earnestly towards making the detection kits available for the screening of Covid-19 infection. Depending on the assay design of the manufacturer’s product, each kit has some imported and some indigenous components. A majority of these components including antibodies and antigens are imported from China. As we are given to understand, the Chinese government has slowed down the process of export. The Indian manufacturers are also developing alternative sources of raw materials and components to tide over the current situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-test-kit-shipment-delayed-again-amid-urgent-requirement/story-nUL3PtACQNvFfV3ouPaDcJ.html
14-04-2020||India||PM Modi to spell out plan on coronavirus lockdown at 10am||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 10am on Tuesday, the last day of the three-week lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) , amid expectations he will extend the emergency protocol until at least the end of April and move, in a limited way, to restart the economy by selectively easing curbs on industry.The Prime Minister’s Office announced Modi’s address in a post on the microblogging site Twitter on Monday. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 10am on 14th April 2020,” the PMO tweeted on a day the number of Covid-19 infections rose by 1,253 to 10,444 cases, and deaths increased 29 to 355.It will be the PM’s third televised address to the nation in less than a month. On March 19, Modi said he would seek the “coming few weeks” of Indian citizens, asked them to stay determined and patient in the fight against the global pandemic, senior citizens to remain indoors and called for a “people’s curfew” on March 22 to demonstrate their unity and resolve.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayOn March 24 came the announcement of a nationwide, three-week lockdown -- the world’s biggest -- that has halted commercial flights and train journeys,taken public transport off the streets, closed schools and colleges and shut industrial production, as the government tried to break the chain of infections.A day ahead of the address, Modi held in-depth talks with the principal scientific adviser Prof K VijayRaghavan apart from holding his regular meetings with principal secretary PK Mishra and cabinet secretary RK Gauba. The talks with Vijay Raghavan focussed on how the Aarogya app is contributing to tracking the spread of Covid-19, HT has learnt.Shops that sell food, groceries, fruits and vegetables and dairy products, pharmacists, banks and automated teller machines, and petrol pumps have been exempted from the lockdown. Establishments that have been kept out of the purview of the lockdown also include utilities, sanitation, municipal bodies,the police, home guards and civil defence, hospitals, veterinary clinics and pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution units.A majority of India’s states have backed an extension of the lockdown so as not to fritter away the benefits that may have accrued from the strict social distancing norms put in place to keep the highly infectious virus at bay, but some sought an easing of the lockdown in areas outside the so-called red zones that include Covid-19 hot spots and containment zones.At least seven states -- Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana -- have already announced an extension of the lockdown until April 30.Some ministries have suggested reopening production units and restarting work in the agricultural sector provided all the mandatory guidelines for sanitation and social distancing are followed.Prime Minister Modi indicated his thinking at the meeting by video conference with state chief ministers.“While announcing the lockdown, I had said ‘jaan hai to jahan hai’ (health is wealth)... Most people in the country understood it and discharged their responsibilities by remaining indoors. And now it is imperative to focus on both aspects, ‘Jaan bhi, jahan bhi’ ((lives as well as livelihoods), for India’s bright future, and prosperous and healthy India,” Modi said.On Monday, members of the Union council of ministers returned to work at their offices for the first time since the lockdown began. The government, in an order last week, also asked all officers of the joint secretary level and above to be present in the ministries along with one-third of the essential staff from Monday.The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), which has been issuing guidelines to be followed by all sectors, reaffirmed that all offices except those in the defence, central armed police forces, essential services such as power and postal services will remain closed.The ministry also directed all States and Union territories to implement lockdown guidelines in letter and spirit and also to ensure smooth movement of inter and intra-state cargo, trucks, workers and functioning of warehouse and cold storages, Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary in the MHA ,said on Monday.“Vehicles carrying essential and non-essential items should be permitted to avoid the shortage of commodities,” Srivastava told reporters.“Warehouses of companies should also be allowed to operate. Railways, airports, seaports, and customs authorities have already been authorised to issue passes for their staff and contractual labour,” she added.The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) recommended to the home ministry that certain identified industries and services be allowed to resume limited activity with “reasonable safeguards” to restart economic activity and put money in the hands of people.It said industries engaged in manufacturing telecom equipment and components including optical fibre cable; compressor and condenser units; steel and ferrous alloy mills; spinning and ginning mills, power looms; defence; cement plants; pulp and paper units; fertiliser plants; paints; plastic; automotive units; gems and jewellery; and all units in special economic zones (SEZs) and export oriented units (EOUs) be allowed to open limited operations.The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) welcomed the suggestion. “Opening of all export industries, large as well as MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) including SEZs and EOUs , will help the exporters execute whatever little orders remain with them after huge cancellations in the last two months,” FIEO president Sharad Kumar Saraf said in a statement. It will also send a signal to overseas buyers that the situation in India is returning to normal, and encourage them to place more orders, he said.The Federation of Retailer Association of India (FRAI) urged the government to let small shops open immediately, as the daily cash flow of small retailers has stopped completely since the lockdown came into force.Covid-19 is expected to take a heavy toll on Asia’s third largest economy, which was already in the midst of a slowdown when the virus hit. The World Bank said on Sunday that India’s economy is expected to grow 1.5% to 2.8% in 2020-21 in a baseline scenario, the slowest pace since India in 1991 embarked on a path of reform that reversed four decades of semi-socialist insulation. Centrum Institutional Research said the country again stares at the possibility of low single-digit growth in the year to March 2021.“Nationwide complete lockdown is likely to shave off at least ~7-8 trillion,” it said.On Monday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister in which she emphasised the humanitarian aspect of the pandemic ,demanding the provision of 10kg of foodgrains free for six months to the poor who don’t hold ration cards.“The current crisis has pushed many relatively food secure families into food insecurity and poverty,” she wrote in the letter. “In our fight against the pandemic we must ensure that no one faces hunger.”(PTI and ANI contributed to this story)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-spell-out-plan-on-lockdown-at-10am-today/story-svsPJbST1VtJ9sAcSEnKgN.html
14-04-2020||India||Covid-19 cases in India double to 10,000 in six days||India went past a bleak milestone on Monday as the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases crossed 10,000, with the infections doubling over six days and the government expanding containment efforts and ramping up testing in an attempt to curb the highly contagious pathogen from sweeping across the country.On Monday, 1,253 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in the country. Delhi recorded its biggest daily spike with 356 cases. The national capital has recorded 1,510 cases so far, becoming the city with the most number of infections.Four people died of Covid-19 on Monday, taking the Capital’s death toll to 28.Until March 24, there were 536 Covid-19 cases in India. The number rose to 2,520 by April 2; 5,305 by April 7; and the latest tally stood at 10,444, according to HT’s dashboard. Of these, 355 people have died of the disease that rages uncontrolled across several nations and has left at least 117,000 dead across the world.The tally of Covid-19 cases first jumped in India after the detection of hundreds of patients who attended gatherings of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group, in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month. Once the cluster – the largest single source so far in the country – was identified and isolated on March 30, daily cases have surged.Also read: India’s 5 most populous states adopt distinct Covid strategiesThe number of cases in Delhi increased from 72 on March 29 to 1,510 so far -- most of the 356 cases reported on Monday appeared to be linked to the Nizamuddin gathering. The Capital reported its first case on March 2, when a 45-year-old who travelled from Italy tested positive. According to officials in the Delhi government, about 1,050 of the total cases are attendees of the Nizamuddin event or their contacts. With the mass identification and isolation of such cases across the country, however, the focus has now shifted to how well the government can contain and localise the infections. “The home secretary and the ministry of health communicate regularly through video conferencing with states and we tell them our containment strategies and they are working in coordination,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Union health ministry, said at a news briefing on Monday.Also read: Enough HCQ to meet domestic, export demand, says CentreExperts say that the impact of India’s 21-day national lockdown -- imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from March 25 -- which appears to have relatively slowed the spread, could be undermined if disease clusters are not contained effectively, and people are not tested widely and aggressively. The next few weeks will likely determine the country’s trajectory in managing the outbreak and in preventing the health care infrastructure from being overrun by infections.Modi will address the nation on Tuesday morning at 10am, and is likely to announce an extension of the nationwide lockdown, possibly with some exemptions to get the wheels of the economy turning again. In about 100 days this year – the first case of the new disease was reported in China’s Wuhan late last year – Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, has infected nearly 1.9 million people. The pathogen has spread across at least 200 countries, as even developed nations’ hospitals are overwhelmed, with many dying because of a shortage of medical equipment.The Union health ministry said that 25 districts across 15 states that reported cases earlier had not detected fresh infections over the last two weeks, an optimistic statistic that stood in contrast to some states that have alarmingly turned into big Covid-19 hot spots.The number of cases in Maharashtra surpassed 2,000 as it remained the state with the most Covid-19 patients across the country. Three-hundred-and-fifty-two tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, taking the state tally to 2,334, according to the state’s health bulletin. Among the new cases, 59 were reported from Mumbai.The Uddhav Thackeray-led government issued an official notification extending the lockdown in the state till April 30 after a previous announcement to this effect. “Since there has been no reduction in the number of Covid-19 cases... the lockdown was extended till April 30,” an official said.Tamil Nadu, meanwhile, is the third state other than Maharashtra and Delhi to report more than 1,000 cases. The government in the state also announced the extension of the lockdown till April 30.Eight doctors have contracted Covid-19 in the state, which said it was focusing on “aggressive testing” now in coordination with the private sector. The death toll from the virus in Tamil Nadu now stands at 11. While the state has scaled up its infrastructure to trace and treat patients, there have been other states that present worrying trends.Rajasthan reported its highest single-day addition of Covid-19 cases on Saturday, with 65 of these being identified in Ramganj, Jaipur, which has become a hot spot for the infection. On March 29, the number of cases in Jaipur was 10. By March 30, the count doubled to 20. By April 6, Jaipur recorded 100 cases. As of Monday night, the case count was 897 across Rajasthan.Madhya Pradesh has reported the highest death rate of Covid-19 patients in India, with almost the entire health department either in quarantine or in hospitals. Public health experts say the high deaths and spurt in cases indicate poor state response to the deadly virus.Indore, the state’s industrial hub, has been one of the worst affected in the country. A 42-year old man died of the disease in Indore on Monday, taking the toll in the Madhya Pradesh city to 33.While the government has created more than 1,200 containment zones across the country, much more needs to be done on the testing front to guard against the disease spreading undetected, they say.Other than swab tests to diagnose the disease, the government is waiting to launch rapid testing kits that can check for antibodies and indicate if a person was ever infected with Sars-CoV-2, and if they have now developed an immunity to it. The rapid kits, however, are still to arrive from suppliers in China amid untraceable delays since April 8. “The first consignment of some rapid test kits is likely to reach from China on April 15,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), at a news briefing. The government also said that 200,000 tests have been conducted so far and there are enough swab kits to carry out diagnoses for the next six weeks.An official said on condition of anonymity that ICMR is also considering “pool testing” to ramp up testing speed – under the procedure, labs pool samples collected from an area and test for the disease; if nobody tests positive, they move on, and only when infections are detected do they test individually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-double-to-10-000-in-six-days/story-O9N0XrmeGZMQvfAK5WHdBJ.html
14-04-2020||India||SC backs MP guv’s order for floor test by Kamal Nath govt||New Delhi: The law must be strengthened to curb the increasing trend of the breakdown in the composition and allegiances of the political parties due to private allurements as opposed to public policy considerations, the Supreme Court said on Monday while upholding Madhya Pradesh governor Lalji Tandon’s direction in March for holding a floor test in the state assembly.Kamal Nath resigned as Madhya Pradesh chief minister on March 20 two hours before a floor test in the state assembly on the directions of the Supreme Court that his government looked set to lose following the rebellion of 22 Congress lawmakers.Tandon had earlier written to Nath on March 14 directing that a floor test be held on March 16. When the House was convened on March 16, the speaker adjourned it till March 26 citing the coronavirus threat without holding the floor test. The Bharatiya Janata Pary then moved the apex court submitting Nath government had lost majority in the assembly. The Congress, in a counter-petition, said the floor test can happen only when all the elected lawmakers are present in the assembly. It argued that a governor can order a floor test only when the House is not in session. If the House is in session, the only remedy is to seek a motion of no confidence, the Congress said.The top court on Monday turned down this argument saying a governor can exercise his power and direct a floor test even if the House is in session. “The governor is not denuded of the power to order a floor test where on the basis of the material available to the governor it becomes evident that the issue as to whether the government commands the confidence of the house requires to be assessed on the basis of a floor test,” the court said in its order. It added such a decision is subject to judicial review.The top court’s observation related to the composition of political parties came in relation to the submissions made by the Congress alleging that the 22 of its lawmakers were taken away to Bengaluru and that it faced resistance when it tried to contact them. “The law may have to evolve to address these burgeoning evils,” it said.The court referred to the spectacle of rival political parties whisking away their political flock to safe destinations and added it is best that courts maintain an arm‘s length from the “sordid tales of political life”. It added it must be conscious of the position on the ground and an effort has to be made to the extent possible to ensure that democratic values prevail. “It is an unfortunate reflection on the confidence which political parties hold in their own constituents and a reflection of what happens in the real world of politics…Poaching is an expression which was bandied about on both sides of the debate in the present case,”The top court had on March 19 ordered that a floor test should be held but had not given any reasons for that order.Its Monday’s order explained in detail the rationale behind the top court’s order of March 19. The court ruled a governor of a state is empowered to order a floor test if he/she has reasons to believe that the council of ministers headed by the chief minister has lost the confidence of the house.This power can be exercised by a governor at any time during a “running assembly”, that is when the House is in session, a bench of justices DY Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta held, reaffirming its order passed on March 19 asking Nath to prove his majority. “The governor in calling for a floor test cannot be construed to have acted beyond the bounds of constitutional authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-backs-mp-guv-s-order-for-floor-test-by-kamal-nath-govt/story-1lULKeDS7Yuvambfl9iSTJ.html
14-04-2020||India||Centre sends revised Parliament building plan to environment ministry||The Centre has submitted a revised application to the environment ministry for the new Parliament building of the Central Vista redevelopment project after an expert appraisal committee (EAC) on infrastructure deferred its environment clearance last month. A new Parliament building with enhanced technology and a capacity to seat several hundred more parliamentarians in both the Upper and Lower houses was to be built as part of a Rs 20,000 crore redevelopment project in Lutyens’ Delhi planned out in a phased manner over the next four years. The new Parliament complex was expected to be ready by 2022.In its application which has been reviewed by the Hindustan Times, the union ministry of housing and urban affairs’ construction arm, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has stated that the project cost for the new Parliament building has been increased from Rs 776 crore to Rs 922 crore instead “due to changes in specifications which have been approved after the application submission.” The EAC is scheduled to hear the matter on April 22.Addressing concerns raised over the project in the application stated that “there will be no adverse impact due to construction activities on existing structures and suitable precautions will be accordingly made… There are several ASI regulated archaeological sites present within the study area. However none of them will be impacted due to the project activities. Since their regulated boundaries are outside the project site.” “Transportation of raw material will cause impacts for the short-term only. Barricading will be provided all around the construction site. Air pollution will be minimized by water sprinklers and by covering the vehicles during transport. The trucks used for transport will be thoroughly checked for emission parameters and will be properly maintained. The raw materials transport will be avoided during the peak hours to reduce traffic load,” the application stated.The new two-storied Parliament building is to come up on a triangular plot close to the existing Parliament. It has been designed to seat at least 1300 parliamentarians. Both the Rajya and Lok Sabha have been designed to have up to date audio-visual features, improved acoustic technology, as well as better seating design to ensure efficiency and productivity while the houses are in session. The new building will also have an open to sky courtyard, meeting halls, cafeterias and MP’s offices.The existing Parliament building which is almost 90 years old has faced deterioration over the years due to environmental conditions, and the project aimed to preserve the building by retrofitting to make it compliant to current safety standards.The new application clarified the renovation of the existing Parliament building would include a condition survey to assess the structure, strengthen and renovate its interiors and utilities. Hindustan Times on March 9 had reported Centre’s application seeking environmental clearance for the construction of a new Parliament complex has been deferred by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC). EAC had citied pending court cases related to the project as one of the reasons for deferring the application. It had also noted that the project would provide a “larger Parliament building for the nation for better functioning of the legislature” but also added that CPWD needed to meet a slew of conditions before the proposal can be reconsidered.However, the plan could face delays due to the lockdown as the project was scheduled to be tendered in April. This also comes at a time when nearly all opposition parties have urged the government to shelve the project and spend the money instead on advancing the fight against Covid-19.The Centre had in March notified the land use change of over 86-acre area in Lutyens’ Delhi to expedite completion of the redevelopment project, which was to include a new Central Secretariat, and other new government office buildings on either side of the Central Vista, among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sends-revised-parliament-building-plan/story-TSzrwF8vAvtfWxo25G4mqL.html
14-04-2020||India||Mild quake hits Delhi, 2nd in two days||New Delhi: A mild 2.7 magnitude earthquake hit Delhi for the second time in two days on Monday. The tremor at 1:30 pm had its epicentre at the depth of 5 km in northeast Delhi’s Sonia Vihar. The 3.5 magnitude earthquake on Sunday had its epicentre at the same location at the depth of 8 km. “These earthquakes were well recorded by seismological network maintained by the National Center for Seismology (NCS),” the NCS said in a statement.AP Pandey, an NCS seismologist, said normally such small earthquakes are followed by more tremors. “If the next event occurs close to the epicentre as is the case this time, then it shows that the movement is settling back. Delhi and surrounding regions have lots of faults. There may be other earthquakes but we cannot say when,” he said.According to the NCS statement, Delhi experienced last perceptible earthquake of magnitude 3.5 on April 24, 2018. Prior to that, a magnitude 3.8 earthquake occurred on September 7, 2011, near the Delhi-Haryana border. Delhi also recorded low magnitude earthquake with the epicentre within Delhi in 2007. Another earthquake was recorded in Delhi on April 28, 2001, of 3.4 magnitude. Officials said the people perhaps felt the latest earthquakes strongly than usual since most are at home and the “ambient vibrations” road traffic causes have died down because of the Covid-19 lockdown.“These are called tremors and very small earthquakes have been recorded in the past in the Jhajjar and Rohtak areas. We are in seismic zone 4 [severe earthquake intensity zone]. We are close to the Himalayas where even magnitude 8 earthquakes can be recorded. The local soil quality also plays a role. Thick sediment soil in Delhi also amplifies the impact. The area where the epicentre is has newer alluvium soil which can record more tremors. It is close to the Yamuna belt,” said Pandey. He added that less noise from traffic or other sources has made the recording on seismometer very accurate and intense experience for the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mild-quake-hits-delhi-2nd-in-two-days/story-nwjQ1TOrYlb5aZS5m5AbDI.html
14-04-2020||India||Ashok Desai: A legal luminary, a multifaceted scholar||Ashok Desai, India’s former attorney general and one of the country’s most distinguished lawyers, passed away on Monday. It was deeply distressing and saddening news. I was privileged to know him over decades and every interaction with him was always enlightening. He also had a wit and sense of humour even while pursuing the somewhat sombre profession of an attorney. He was a product of the London School of Economics (LSE) and thereafter of the Lincoln Inn, London. He was the chairman of the Committee on Administrative Law of International Law Association, and worked with the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva as well as represented India at the World Trade Organisation Appellate body. Understandably, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan having served both as Solicitor and Attorney General of India.Having worked with him closely on some matters, here are a few instances I would like to recall.First, he played a critical role in drafting an affidavit on behalf of the central government, which brought the famous Hawala case to a final closure. The case had, in many ways, altered the political milieu since many important politicians and others had suffered when their names had figured in the Jain Hawala diary. At a certain stage, when I became the revenue secretary, the repetitive hearings and adjournments by the Supreme Court was becoming exhausting for the government. It was Ashok — the then attorney general — who felt that we should expeditiously bring this matter to a closure.The then Prime Minister I K Gujral had constituted a committee under the chairmanship of NN Vohra, former principal secretary to PM for drafting an affidavit. I was a member of the committee. The affidavit drafted by him, and which was finally accepted by the Supreme Court, made important changes by way of guaranteeing the security of tenure, the adherence to the selection procedures and the autonomy to be given to the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. Later, the Central Vigilance Commissioner became the supervisory entity as an overarching watchdog. Ashok’s drafting of the affidavit, which was in line with the psychology of the court, led to the ultimate closure of the case. It was a relief to all the concerned stakeholders.Second, much later, we were both members of the India Advisory Board of the London School of Economics, which was co-chaired by Lord Nicholas Stern and myself. As a member of the Advisory Board, given his past LSE connections, he always had creative ideas on what could be done to enhance the academic reach of this prestigious institution in India. Fostering interchange of students, faculty members and joint research projects were some of the ideas which he had put forward persuasively.Third, on a somewhat a lighter side, being an exceedingly sophisticated individual, and given his interest in art and culture, his fondness for classical music, both western and Indian, was indeed awesome. I once recall that on a visit to Vienna, for a meeting of the Narcotics Control Board of the United Nations, we together witnessed an opera called Madame Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini. The opera was entertaining, although somewhat heavy and needed prior experience to be fully appreciated. I was stunned during the recital that he had remembered every aria (an elaborate melody sung solo) by-heart, and before the aria could even get started, to my amazement, he would fully recite the arias himself. Much later, when we were in London for a conference, we had gone to witness a popular opera by Giuseppe Verdi called La Traviata and, characteristic to his style, he repeated the same feat of reciting the operas by-heart as if he knew them inside out. He was equally conscious of British habits, and at the commencement of the play, reminded me that in case I wanted a drink, the right time to order was at the beginning of the performance to obviate any unseeming rush during the short interval. Perhaps few could recite the contents of all Shakespeare play with such velocity. I also recall that during the private recitals of Pandit Jasraj or Kishori Amonkar at my house, he would invariably occupy a seat in the front and savour and enjoy every bit of the classical recital. He was a man of great equanimity, cultivated manners and scholastic understanding of a wide range of subjects. He was a towering personality in the legal fraternity.India has lost one of its finest legal minds. I have lost a personal friend whose presence I will greatly miss. Without hesitation, it can be said that he was clearly a cut above the others, and by today’s standards, a class apart.(NK Singh is the chairperson of the 15th Finance Commission and a former Member of Parliament.

14-04-2020||India||Bihar, Odisha may resume MGNREGS||Bihar and Odisha will soon allow resumption of works under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employee Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the world’s biggest rural social security scheme, in an effort to provide relief to the rural poor hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid) and consequent lockdown.The nationwide, three-week lockdown ends on Tuesday, April 14, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to address the nation at 10 a.m.to outline immediate future plans to combat the pandemic and prevent its spread.On Monday, most state governments submitted their plans for the post-lockdown phase with a majority suggesting that the emergency measure continue with exemptions for agriculture and allied services and more measures to provide relief to the poor. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar told divisional commissioners and zonal inspectors general of police on Monday that a comprehensive plan was being prepared to generate employment opportunities for people.The biggest concern of the state government has been the lack of work for large number of people, including migrant workers who have returned from different states after the lockdown came into force on March 25. The state government also wants to complete flood management work before the onset of the monsoon.Officials said the second phase of the lockdown after April 14 would be different, with the government planning to allow work under MGNREGS to resume or the conservation of traditional water sources, soil conservation, environment-specific crop cycles, organic farming, drip irrigation, rain water harvesting and use of solar energy.Kumar said that all precautions must be taken to ensure the safety of labourers and farmers. “After harvesting, employment generation in rural areas will be the main focus, there is no reason to be complacent at any stage in view of the Covid-19 outbreak,” he added.So far, Bihar has done well to restrict the spread of Covid-19, with 27 districts still untouched by it and most of the 64 reported positive cases tracked.In Odisha, which has already announced extension of the lockdown until April 30, the government on Monday announced that work under MGNREGS and construction under Swachh Bharat (Clean India) scheme will be allowed, apart from all agricultural activities.The state government also plans to hire retired state and central police officers to enforce social distancing norms for the next six months, the police said. Odisha police have proposed to hire around 2,400 retired policemen of state and central forces as special police officers for deployment in different districts. They will help maintain law and order in different containment zones, as well as trace Covid-19 suspects, officials said.According to the order issued by chief secretary Asit Tripathy, shops and establishments selling agricultural implements, cattle feed and fish feed, and food processing and packaging units will also be allowed to remain open during the extended lockdown.The order said that activities relating to MGNREGS and construction of toilets under Swachh Bharat mission and individual houses under the rural housing scheme would be allowed.The works related to water conservation and supply of drinking water would continue, apart from procurement of rabi, or winter-sown, crops. “People engaged in fishing, floriculture, tendu leaf plucking and collection of non-timber forest produce can also carry out their work,” the order said, adding that e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Big Basket will be allowed to deliver goods across Odisha. State special relief commissioner (SRC) Pradeep Jena said social distancing norms would be strictly followed while facilitating activities that were related to the people’s livelihoods.Till Monday, Odisha had reported 55 positive cases, one death and 13 recoveries. Only 2 of the remaining 41 patients are critical, said a state government statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-odisha-may-resume-mgnregs/story-DmFL5QZ8NpjmXL7g7GK2RK.html
14-04-2020||India||Maha crosses 2K-mark with biggest 24-hr jump||Maharashtra doubled its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases to 2,000 in six days, recording its biggest 24-hour jump on Monday, as 11 more deaths in the state vaulted the number of fatalities in the pandemic to 160, prompting the Uddhav Thackeray government to extend the lockdown until the end of April.The state said 352 more people tested positive for Covid-19, taking the number of patients confirmed to have the infection to 2,334. Of Monday’s cases, Mumbai, the Indian city worst hit by the disease, alone recorded 242, taking its Covid-19 count to 1,540. Of the 11 deaths in Maharashtra, nine were reported by Mumbai and one each by Pune and Mira-Bhayander.Thirty-nine cases were recorded in Pune; 14 in Malegaon; 11 in Nagpur; nine in Thane; seven in Mira-Bhayander; six in Pimpri-Chinchwad; five in Vasai-Virar; four each in Aurangabad, Buldhana and Kalyan-Dombivli; one each in Ahmednagar, Dhule, Nashik, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Raigad and Yavatmal.The Thackeray government on Monday extended the lockdown, which was to end at midnight on April 14, until April 30, even as it looks at allowing micro-, small- and medium- enterprises (MSMEs) to start operations in districts that are not affected, or relatively less affected, by the outbreak. A proposal for allowing industries to reopen is being prepared by the state industries department.“It was necessary to extend the lockdown period as the state has been the worst-hit by the pandemic and more than a hundred cases are coming per day for more than a week. The spread can be arrested only with the help of a lockdown,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.On the lockdown extension, a notification issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Monday read: “It is expedient to take measures further to contain the spread of coronavirus; therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 2 of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 the state government directs that the lockdown orders shall now be extended up to and inclusive of April 30, 2020.”Maharashtra took 30 days to cross the 1,000-case mark on April 7 and exceeded the 2,000 tally in just six days. The state health department isn’t perturbed because it is still in stage two or the local transmission phase, where the spread of the disease is limited to those with a travel history or are in contact with infected people, and not entered stage 3 or community transmission in which the source of the infection cannot be traced.State health commissioner Anup Kumar Yadav said the coronavirus spread was not “exponential” and under control. “We are still in stage two of transmission. The spread is now in clusters, but it is not exponential. Our cluster containment plans are showing results and it is not going out of control. Any infectious disease has a growth pattern. One is the way it is growing now, and the other is it is growing exponentially, which is seen in some other countries. We are confident that the measures we have taken at an early stage are well-placed; it is responding well. So it should not go out of control,” Yadav said.According to Yadav, the state is conducting an average of 3,000 coronavirus tests daily, and he attributed the increasing number of cases to aggressive testing. The state government, he said, was now awaiting antibody test kits from the Centre to carry out “rapid testing”. “We are waiting for the kits. They would be first used by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). We do not plan to use it elsewhere in the state. Besides, we are also awaiting the Centre’s nod for pool testing permission, which the state had sought,” he said.Malegaon in Nashik district has seen a surge in the number of coronavirus cases. On Monday, 14 cases were reported from the neighbourhood, taking the tally to 29. It is being looked at as another cluster where the spread has spiked. District authorities and the municipal council are looking at demarcating containment areas in Malegaon.The Maharashtra government is considering allowing industrial operations across the state except in Mumbai and Pune. State industries minister Subhash Desai held a review meeting on Monday and directed the department to submit a proposal on where MSMEs and other industries can be reopened.“Excluding the areas of Mumbai and Pune, which has a high number of Covid-19 cases, a proposal should be prepared to allow industries to start their operations with certain restrictions in the rest of the districts of the state,” Desai said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-crosses-2k-mark-with-biggest-24-hr-jump/story-Hio2NaypZJUw7eoFZkUZjM.html
14-04-2020||India||Agra registers its biggest 24-hr spike with 35 new cases||Agra recorded the biggest spike in Covid-19 cases in a day on Monday as 35 people tested positive for the disease and took the district’s tally to 138 even as officials attributed the sharp rise to aggressive testing and contact tracing as part of a containment model that the Centre has asked states to emulate.The Centre on Saturday cited the model while instructing states to learn from it. Officials say the Agra Model has involved a proactive approach in identifying cases, conducting intensive testing, door-to-door surveys and implementing strict quarantine measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19Officials said the 35 new cases include eight that are linked to the congregation at the headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi that last month emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot. They added of the total 138, 60 are liked to the congregation.“We are witnessing a sharp rise in the number of patients but soon it will start decreasing. The institutional quarantine is the only solution to such types of cases,” said district magistrate Prabhu N Singh. He added they have been shifting those who come in contact with Covid positive cases to quarantine centres before collecting their samples. Singh said they will continue with their model based on massive sampling, social distancing and institutional quarantine.Officials said the virus has spread to a rural area of Fatehpur Sikri where a person infected 14 members of his family. They added these cases tested positive in a day. The other hotspots include a hospital in Agra where the staff and their contacts alone account for 20 Covid-19 patients.Chief medical officer Dr Mukesh Kumar Vats said some patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital and no new admissions of patients will be allowed there.The other coronavirus hotspot is Ghatia Azam Khan area, where a private practitioner first tested positive and is later believed to have infected at least five people.“One should not go by numbers at present because it is the outcome of our surveillance and proactive sampling with 2,264 samples having been tested in Agra till date. The cases coming positive are those whose origins are known to us and is part of Agra containment plan,” said Vats.“Till date, only one death has taken place that too of an aged lady who already had asthma. Other patients testing positive are kept under isolation and are getting cured.” He added they are handling the challenge posed by major hotspots including the hospital. “We are aggressively getting their contacts tested.”Vats said the hotspot in Fatehpur Sikri has been sealed. “The in charge of a community health centre has been made the nodal officer for measures to be taken there for containment.”Dr Satish Verma, the chief medical superintendent of Agra’s district hospital, said this month samples of 150 suspected Covid-19 patients have been tested daily on an average.The Agra Model kicked in early in the Covid-19 outbreak cycle when six patients tested positive on March 3. At the time, the entire country had only 30-odd cases. Authorities drew up a list of people with foreign travel and identified their families and close contacts. The neighbourhood where patients lived were declared hotspots, with a three-km radius around them acting like containment zones and a five-km radius areas as the buffer zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agra-registers-its-biggest-24-hr-spike-with-35-new-cases/story-h13wFfoAOCFmonPcgnn84I.html
14-04-2020||India||India’s 5 most populous states adopt distinct Covid strategies||As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to spread, India’s most populated states have adopted both common, and distinct, strategies to deal with the pandemic.Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal account for one-third of total 10,444 Covid-19 cases in India and about 40% of the country’s 1.21 billion population in 2011. Being densely populated, the probability of rapid spread of Covid-19 in these states was and remains higher than in less populated southern and Himalayan states. They are also more vulnerable because they house about 60% of 1.3 million migrant labourers in shelters across India.While providing food to all, including about 20 million poor citizens in these states, was a challenge, the state governments adhered to health ministry’s guideline of testing and strong Covid-19 cluster management. They also launched apps to track hundreds of patients and put thousands of people in quarantine. But they also opted for state specific models that helped in containing the spread. Maharashtra opted for aggressive testing (42,000 so far) and created the most number of containment zones in cities; Uttar Pradesh ensured that the virus is restricted to 41 of the 75 districts; Bihar focused more on isolating migrant workers and screening of all foreigners; Madhya Pradesh came across as lax initially before ramping up screening and testing efforts; and West Bengal termed its plan as containment with “humane face”.Here is what each state did over the past month: Maharashtra: The state’s approach to Covid-19 infection and management has been distinct. It got most of the initial Covid-19 patients from foreign travelers, unlike other populated states, where the infection came primarily from secondary sources or attendees of Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin Delhi in mid-March.After a rapid rise in the cases with an average of more than 150 positive cases and 12 deaths a day over last ten days , the state government shifted focus on the containment zones in Mumbai, adjacent areas, and other cities such as Pune that accounted for 90 % of the total positive patients and 91 % of total deaths.The state has more than 400 containment zones, including 381 in Mumbai alone, highest for any city in India. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has divided these containment zones in three categories — red with more than 5-6 patients, yellow up to six patients and green with no cases.“We have decided to concentrate on the most affected areas of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune by strictly implementing the lockdown. There are hotspots identified, in the containment zones, with the highest positive cases and they will be strictly monitored,” said state home minister Rajesh Tope.As on Monday, 2334 people had tested positive and 149 had died due to Covid-19 in Maharashtra. Around 70% of these cases were reported in last ten days. MMR, which comprises of 9 municipal corporation and 20% of the state population has 1520 patients.Uttar Pradesh: The state focused on 41 districts, from where Covid-19 cases were reported and adopted a multi-pronged strategy of aggressive identification of hotspots, intensification of restrictions and creation of new health facilities combined with relief to people.UP chief secretary RK Tiwari said that the UP model of “aggressive action to identify and act” has been appreciated by the Centre and others states have been asked to follow. When the Covid-19 pandemic first broke out, there was not even a single testing lab in the state. Now, the state has 10 labs and more are come up, he said. The spurt in Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh has been substantially attributed to the Tablighi Markaz in Delhi in last week of March. Additional chief secretary, Home, Avnish Awasthi said 50% of the cases in the state are linked to Tablighi Jamaat and the administration got them quarantined as soon as they were identified.According to officials, 11 committees were set up to oversee the situation following lockdown announcement and suggest measures to provide relief to people. UP was the first state to announce financial relief of ₹1000 to half a million workers, daily wagers and vendors and is set to implement free distribution of food grains to nearly 30.54 million labourers.UP so far has 550 Covid-19 cases with nearly 190 hotspots in 41 out of 75 districts. Five persons have died, 47 have recovered while about 11,855 tests have been carried out so far.Madhya Pradesh: With a full Cabinet not yet in place after the formation of the new government, and 72 health department officials tested as Covid-19 positive, containing the disease has proved to be a challenge for chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan.The data provided by the state government shows that Covid-19 has primarily been restricted to Indore and Bhopal, even though cases have been reported from 21 of the 52 districts in the state. Of the 562 Covid-19 positive cases, Indore with 311 patients accounted for 55.33% and Bhopal, with 134, 26.22% of total cases. Overall, Madhya Pradesh has 7.29% death rate while in Indore the death rate of 9.64%, higher than the national average of 3.4. Of the 41 deaths, 30 were from Indore.Additional chief secretary, health, Mohd Suleman, appointed head of department a week back after the incumbent officer reported Covid-19 positive, said, “Our strategy has four components — Identification, Isolation, Test and Treatment (IITT).” He said any area visited by a foreigner or known for ILI (Influenza like illness) or respiratory problems, is declared a containment zone. Door to door survey is done to list people with different categories of diseases and they are marked as high or low risk. “The test is then either done of high risk persons eat home or at a testing centre,” he said, adding that fourth component is treating people tested positive.The state has 282 containment areas with about half of them in Indore. The affected 21 districts have curfew restrictions while borders of Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain have been sealed to prohibit entry or exit of any person. Indore, the worst affected city, has been divided into five sectors, with a senior officer in-charge of each sector.Bihar: With 65 cases in the state of 100 million people, the Bihar government has now opened its outpatient facilities for all, the first big state to do so, in an indication of the state’s confidence that the situation was under control. Experts however believe the state may not have tested aggressively enough. Less than 8000 tests have been carried out so far. State chief secretary Deepak Kumar, however, said the state tested all international passengers who came between March 18 and 23 and all symptomatic cases, who came between March 15 and 17, were also tested. It identified around 3,556 international travelers between March 15 and 23 and samples of 2,254 people, who were within the 14-day incubation period, were taken for tests.Bihar also followed the model of containment zones, where people have not been allowed to move out of their homes and essential supplies delivered to them at their doorstep, said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health. For instance, Panjwar village of Siwan district, where 23 of the 29 cases in the district were reported, was declared ‘red zone’ and complete barricading of the village was done at 200 metres, 500 metres, 1km, 2km and 3km.Places visited by Tablighi Jamaat attendees were sanitised and mosques, where they were staying were sealed.West Bengal: The state, with 95 Covid positive cases and seven deaths, has been warned by the home ministry for not enforcing lockdown norms strictly. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, however, had said they had opted for “lockdown with humane face” and imposed complete clampdown in Covid-19 hotspots.“Some areas where people have tested positive for Covid-19, and there is a threat of the disease spreading, have been totally sealed,” said a health department official, on the condition of anonymity.The state has formed an advisory body roping in international experts (such as Nobel laureate economist Abhijit Banerjee) and has also formed three task forces and a few other committees to guide the state in tackle coronavirus.“We are prepared. The state now has seven testing laboratories, 64 hospitals are earmarked for Covid-19 patients and there are more than 580 quarantine centres,” said a second official of the health department.The state government has been criticized for opaque information system on Covid with the health bulletins providing information only on active cases. Officials, however, explained that the information was being provided only after vetting by experts, who had termed most deaths because of co-morbidity.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-5-most-populous-states-adopt-distinct-covid-strategies/story-fMNDYruaoWX41CFjZej1OK.html
14-04-2020||India||Punjab man, his mother say faith kept them strong during recovery||Harpal Singh’s worst fears came true when his mother, Pritam Kaur, 72, tested positive for Covid-19 four days after he was diagnosed with the disease on March 22. He was more worried about his mother since she is diabetic and more vulnerable. But luckily for them, the two were admitted to the same isolation ward at Civil Hospital in Punjab’s Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. This helped them at least to keep each other’s morale high. Harpal Singh, 48, has since recovered but he continues to stay back at the hospital to look after his mother, who doctors say is stable and likely to be discharged after she is retested this week. He said it is their faith that helped them stay strong. They would listen to religious hymns on their phones and talk to their family over video calls. “Initially, I was worried because I had heard that people suffering from chronic diseases [like diabetes] and those aged may not survive [if infected by coronavirus],” Singh said. Harpal Singh, whose Pathlawa village was on March 22 declared Punjab’s first Covid-19 containment zone, was one of the 27 people infected by super-spreader preacher Baldev Singh. The preacher died on March 18 and was tested positive for the disease a day later. Baldev Singh, 70, had returned from Germany via Italy on March 7. He visited several places before his death that triggered a scramble for identifying all the people he had come in contact with. At least 14 members of his family were infected along with four in Jalandhar and five in Hoshiarpur. In Pathlawa, 19 people contracted the disease and 14 in nearby villages of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district, which were sealed within days. Harpal Singh is among the 13 people from his village to have been recovered. At least 10 of them have been discharged. As of Monday, Punjab had 176 Covid-19 cases. The state has reported 12 deaths related to the pandemic while 23 patients have recovered.Harpal Singh said he is grateful to the doctors and medical staff at the civil hospital for providing them moral support and counselling as well as the best possible treatment. Singh said given his mother was in the isolation ward with him gave him much solace and would not leave the hospital without her. Dr Harwinder Singh, the Civil Hospital’s senior medical officer, said Harpal Singh has been asked to remain under home quarantine for two more weeks after his discharge. He added they are taking extra care of Kaur because of her age. “We focused on their counselling so that patients should be mentally strong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-man-his-mother-say-faith-kept-them-strong-during-recovery/story-z4QUiquESWYGY2i86W4H5O.html
14-04-2020||India||Battling losses in lockdown, K’taka puts vacant govt sites on sale||Admitting that the state is in “financial trouble”, Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Monday announced measures to help in resource mobilisation, including by authorising the auctioning of 12,000 corner sites in the state capital. The Bangalore Development Authority intends to raise Rs 14,000 to Rs 15,000 crore from the auctioning. Apart from this, corner and vacant sites in all urban development authorities across the state would be auctioned for additional resource mobilisation. Yediyurappa made it clear that the auction of government-owned sites would be done only if they fetch a “good price”.“The possible situation once the [Covid-19] lockdown is ended was widely discussed in the meeting. Discussion was also held about the financial situation of the state government and how to mobilise resources. Many suggestions were given and it was decided to implement those suggestions,” Yediyurappa said after a meeting with officials of various departments.According to officials aware of developments, the state government has lost nearly Rs 2,500 crore in revenue from just the stoppage of liquor sales since March 24 when the 21-day lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19 was announced. The lockdown is expected to be extended on Tuesday.The officials said the government is likely to take a call on Tuesday whether liquor stores could be opened in the state. They added the state has also decided to use the Rs 1,000 crore available for upgrading medical college hospitals. To help dairy farmers as well as poor people, the state would continue to distribute free milk among the poor living in slums, the officials said.Yediyurappa also announced Rs 45 crore compensation for farmers of Raichur and Koppa, who have lost their paddy crop due to hailstorm. While appealing sugar factory owners to clear pending payments to the tune of Rs 2,834 crore due to farmers across 11 districts, the chief minister warned of strict action in case they failed to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battling-losses-in-lockdown-k-taka-puts-vacant-govt-sites-on-sale/story-pd5aWvOl3RJSwNdGVFkRQK.html

The secretary assured all measures for an uninterrupted supply of medicines and medical devices in all parts of the country, he said.The secretary said the government is in constant touch with the industry, states and the other departments through email, Whatsapp groups, control room set up in the department of pharmaceuticals and the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to address any issue expeditiously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sufficient-medicines-medical-devices-including-hcq-available-in-india-centre/story-wHVOD8WeATwBNFxljBptPJ.html
14-04-2020||India||Dip in electricity usage a slowdown indicator: Experts||Economists and environmental experts at the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago (Epic) have started documenting the initial signs of a massive economic slowdown resulting from the coronavirus disease pandemic -- closure of industries, shops and restaurants and a dip in power consumption, and an unintended benefit -- a decline in pollution Historically, electricity consumption has proven to be a “reliable, early indicator” of broader economic trends, the team at Epic said. This time, too, the institution’s data tracker shows a 3.37% dip in electricity consumption in the US, European Union, China and India combined on February 29 relative to the average electricity consumption in December 2019. On January 1, the dip was 7.99%. The data tracker updates both electricity consumption and PM levels every day from government and non-government sources and documents the number of Covid-19 deaths in these countries. The graphs on the dashboard are interactive.“The Covid-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to impose tough restrictions on daily life to prevent the spread of the virus. With these restrictions, roads and airports are nearly empty, shops and restaurants are closed, and industrial activities are largely at a halt. In this environment, real-time information about economic activity is at a premium, but often hard to acquire,” Epic said in a statement on Monday.An unintended benefit of the dip in electricity consumption is a 6% dip in particulate matter (PM) pollution on April 1 compared to December 2019 in these countries, the data tracker launched on Monday indicated.“Declining and increasing consumption has historically preceded economic recessions and recovery. The Covid tracker is an indicator of the health of the economy at a higher temporal resolution (updated daily) than anything else that is available. Most other measures of economic health will only be available every quarter so tracking this information is critical,” Anant Sudarshan, South Asia director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, said by email.The dip in both electricity consumption and PM pollution is significant in India as per EPIC’s data analysis. India recorded a dip of 18.72% in electricity consumption on April 3 compared to December 2019 and a 6.8% in PM pollution on April 1. The PM pollution had dipped by 36.72% on January 18.The dashboard shows that PM levels started declining in India in January much before covid 19 cases increased and lockdown was imposed. “There is no robust evidence in India that PM level has gone down in pre-COVID era due to economic slowdown. Unless trends in source specific PM2.5 concentrations are estimated, it is not possible to conclude that way,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi.The scientists have used daily electricity data for India from Power System Operation Corporation Limited’s daily reports and PM 2.5 data from OpenAQ, a website that aggregates particulate matter readings from monitoring stations around the world.In contrast, China has recorded no change in electricity consumption compared to December and a 10.17% dip in PM pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dip-in-electricity-usage-a-slowdown-indicator-experts/story-NX7FuCbybwsMary80A682M.html
14-04-2020||India||For now, doctors bank on HCQ, antibiotic||Indian doctors are depending on a combination of a tried and tested antimalarial drug and an antibiotic to treat people hospitalised in isolation wards and intensive care units in the absence of a specific treatment for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “It is not a miracle therapy, but this is all we have. All patients in isolation wards are given a combination of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) twice a day and azithromycin once a day for five days, and it has been tolerated well. No adverse reactions have been reported,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Medanta-the Medicity, where 15 Covid-19 patients are currently being treated, of whom three are in ICU.Medanta also treated 14 Italians infected with the disease; 13 were discharged last month, and one, a 78-year-old woman died. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions for over a century. Both drugs are undergoing clinical trials for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis of Sars-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes Covid-19, and treatment of patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of Covid-19.“Hydroxychloroquine is not mean to be taken by healthy people as a prophylaxis to prevent infection, only Covid-19 patients are being given a combination of this drug along with the antibiotic azithromycin for treatment. Antivirals have been withdrawn by ICMR as they didn’t show much benefit,” said Dr RR Gangakhedkar, chief, epidemiology, ICMR. The majority of Covid-19 patients have mild to moderate illness, with symptoms of cough, fever and tiredness, with around 5% developing severe pneumonia and acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS), which is marked by worsening respiratory symptoms within one week of known clinical infection.In India, around 2% of Covid-19 cases are in ICU, according to ICMR, with a little more than 100 being on ventilator support across India to treat ARDS, which makes it difficult for a patient to breathe without oxygenation. “All patients with ARDS are monitored closely for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure and sepsis, and apply supportive care interventions immediately,” said Dr Mehta.The signs of ARDS include worsening respiratory symptoms within one week of known clinical infection and chest imaging, including X-rays, CT scan or lung ultrasound, showing bilateral opacities, not fully explained by effusions, lung collapse, or nodules.Intensive management is needed if the patient is a smoker or has cardiovascular disease and lung diseases, like asthma and chronic obstructive respiratory disease, which puts them at a higher risk of severe disease and complications. “In patients with chronic diseases, prescription medication is continued,” said Dr Mehta.With some hospitals in the US and Italy reporting unusually high death rates of 65% to 80% of Covid-19 patients despite ventilator support, compared to 40-50% for other severe acute respiratory infections, there’s a global debate on whether ventilating patients could be doing certain patients more harm than good.“Covid-19 causes death by respiratory failure and cardiac arrest, just like other severe pneumonias, the difference is lack of immunity, greater severity of disease and relatively less lung damage. These are lungs not difficult to ventilate but there is relatively more hypoxia. A possibility is clots in blood supply to lung, but no one is fully sure,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.“If you see the published data of good quality - mostly Italian – you see two subtypes of patients. The first present with typical ARDS needing high PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure is the pressure in the lung), and second with normal mechanics and increased dead space. The second group may have micro-thromboembolism (clots obstructing blood flow), but nobody is sure yet as there are not enough autopsies being done for obvious reasons,” added Dr Agrawal.Some clinicians are recommending oxygenating patients through nose tubes or other devices, while some are adding nitric oxide to improve oxygen and blood flow to the least damaged parts of the lungs. “What does one do? You have to oxygenate. Our experience in treating Covid-19 patients found non-invasive ventilation wasn’t very effective and HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) didn’t work as well as mechanical ventilation,” said Dr Mehta.Some hope came from the Indian Council of Medical Research on Sunday announcing protocols for convalescent plasma therapy trials in the country. “Convalescent plasma is an experimental procedure for Covid-19 patients. Hospitals and institutions planning to provide this modality of treatment should do so in a clinical trial with protocols, which are cleared by the institutional ethics committee,” the ICMR said in a statement on Sunday.Convalescent therapy involves drawing blood packed with antibodies against Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, from people who have recovered. Platelets that carry antibodies are separated from other blood components like red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets, and given to Covid-19 patients to reinforce their immunity to fight infection.While studies from China have shown it raised lymphocyte counts, improved liver and lung function, and reduced inflammation, lung lesions and other severe symptoms within a week, clinical trials to study the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy on Indian patients is still needed before it’s approved for treatment.“The disease is four months old and till we have a vaccine or treatment specifically targeting the Sars-CoV2 virus, we have to use all the tools we have on hand to save lives,” said Dr Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-now-doctors-bank-on-hcq-antibiotic/story-vWIgAbiKPt295qbytnrHyH.html
14-04-2020||India||Centre Covid relief: 323 mn poor get cash aid under scheme||The Union government has disbursed Rs 29,352 crore in the bank accounts of 323.2 million beneficiaries since the March 26 launch by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman of a Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare scheme aimed at protecting the poor from the impact of national lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to an official statement on Monday.The welfare package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) has already covered financial support to 198.6 million women under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), the finance ministry statement said, adding that this covering 97% of PMJDY’s women account-holders and amounted to Rs 9,930 crore.PMJDY is a national mission for financial inclusion, launched in August 2014, to provide universal access to banking facilities to the poor. According to the PMJDY website, there were nearly 381 million accounts under the scheme with total deposits of Rs 1,19,707 crore as on April 1, 2020.The finance minister last month announced financial assistance of Rs 500 per month to 200 million women Jan Dhan account-holders for three months to help tide over household expenditure needs without disruption.The 21-day national lockdown, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, came into effect on March 25.“The robust digital payment infrastructure has enabled the prompt transfer of cash payment under the PMGKY. About 93% of the 8 crore (80 million) farmers have already received Rs 14,846 crore cash assistance under the PM-KISAN,” a finance ministry spokesperson said, citing the latest figures.While launching the Rs 1.7 lakh crore package, Sitharaman announced that the Rs 2,000 installment of PM-KISAN would be “front-loaded” and given immediately. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, launched in December 2018, provides cash support of Rs 6,000 per year to all farmer families across the country in three equal instalments.The spokesperson said the government has transferred Rs 1,405 crore in the bank accounts of 28.2 million widows, senior citizens and persons with disability as on April 13, 2020. The welfare package had promised a Rs 1,000 ex-gratia amount to economically backward widows, citizens above the age of 60, and the physically challenged, under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). The amount is to be given in two instalments. NSAP is centrally sponsored scheme that provides financial assistance to the elderly, widows and persons with disabilities in the form of social pensions.The government has so far disbursed financial support to 21.7 million building and other construction workers, amounting to Rs 3,071 crore, the spokesperson added.Sitharaman said last month that a Rs 31,000 crore fund for the welfare of construction and other workers already existed, and that 35 million workers were registered under it. “We have given directions to state governments to utilise the funds to provide assistance to construction workers to protect them,” she said.Vijay Kumar Gupta, former Central Council Member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) said, “Direct financial assistance to millions of poor people in this hour of crisis is appreciable and it could be possible because of the government’s financial inclusion [Jan-Dhan] mission, else middlemen would have siphoned off most of the money mid-way. But, this is not enough for a country of India’s size and the government must offer more such packages to ensure sustenance of all poor, particularly daily wagers and migrant workers who are jobless.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-covid-relief-323-mn-poor-get-cash-aid-under-scheme/story-F9uQG7DgpLPPuGCukts7uM.html
14-04-2020||India||Infections among frontline medical staff minuscule: Health ministry||Healthcare professionals who have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India are mainly medical staffers with a recent travel history or had come in contact with people carrying the virus and they outnumber those infected in the line of duty, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said on Monday.“There are two categories of infection largely seen among healthcare professionals: one is of those cases that had a travel history or contact history with a positive case and infected their colleagues through regular interaction. The number of this category of cases is higher as opposed to those healthcare workers who were infected in the line of duty,” he said.“The number of healthcare workers who got infected in the line of duty is a very miniscule percentage; even though our effort from day one has been that our healthcare professionals on the ground follow all infection control practices properly to avoid contracting the infection,” he added.Meanwhile, several research efforts are underway on Covid-19, and health, and science & technology minister Harsh Vardhan is looking at the work of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research labs that are working in close partnership with the private sector and other ministries.The research projects are divided into five verticals: digital and molecular surveillance, rapid and diagnostic, new drugs/ repurposing of drugs and associated production processes, hospital assistive devices and personal protection equipment, and supply chain and logistics support systems.“… using cutting edge technology at all levels for timely response at district administration level to Covid-19. Live case tracking, case management and implementation of containment plans are also being done through technology. GIS {geographic information system} mapping of positive confirmed cases, identification of active interventions areas, use of heat mapping and predictive data analysis are being used for monitoring implementation of containment plans,” said Agarwal.The implementation of the technology-based action plan has contributed to no more positive cases in 25 districts across 15 states for the past fortnight.“These districts have no case reported since the last 14 days and constant vigil is being maintained to ensure that no new cases may occur in future,” said Agarwal.These districts are Gondia (Maharashtra), Raj Nandgaon, Durg, Bilaspur (Chattisgarh), Davangiri, Kodagu, Tumkuru, Udupi (Karnataka), South Goa (Goa), Wayanad and Kottayam (Kerala) ,West Imphal (Manipur), Rajouri (J&K), Aizwal West (Mizoram), Mahe (Puducherry), SBS Nagar (Punjab), Patna, Nalanda and Munger (Bihar), Pratapgarh (Rajasthan), Panipat, Rohtak, Sirsa (Haryana), Pauri Garhwal (Uttrakhand), and Bhadradari Kothagudem (Telangana).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infections-among-frontline-medical-staff-minuscule-health-ministry/story-A42GOH5Tm9Zc0xqyzmcgrL.html
14-04-2020||India||Covid spread, curbs delay procurement||Farmers of Punjab trooped to the mandis, or agricultural markets, to sell their produce on Baisakhi, the spring harvest festival, on Monday, holding invitations sent by the state government. The government of chief minister Capt. Amarinder Singh is trying to limit crowds at the mandis and maintain social distancing norms to avoid the spread of the coronavirus disease and has restricted the entry into markets to invitees. “To ensure smooth procurement and also follow the instructions in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, no farmer can enter a mandi without the invitation of the Punjab Mandi Board through the {agricultural produce} market committee,” Punjab agriculture secretary KS Pannu said. Each day, a limited number of farmers will be sent coupons with holograms and more coupons will only be issued after the produce that is already in the market is lifted. The sale of wheat of up to 50 quintals of per farmer started on Monday.The procurement by invitation is an innovation adopted by the Punjab government n the backdrop of Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown that have already delayed procurement of foodgrains by state agencies by a fortnight in the northern state, neighbouring Haryana and in Madhya Pradesh. The nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 had pushed states like Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh to delay the procurement from farmers by a fortnight. Many states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana have already relaxed lockdown norms allowing work in agriculture fields for harvest.Punjab’s food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said that to spread out the procurement, 1,897 rice shelling mills with large open spaces have been converted into procurement centres, in addition to 1,864 markets and procurement centres. Gloves, masks and sanitisers are being provided at all procurement centres, said additional chief secretary (development) Viswajeet Khanna.India is expecting a 7% increase in rabi, or winter-sown, crop production this year, the highest in a decade, because of a wetter-than-usual winter, which prompted farmers to increase acreage by 15-20%. The Centre has announced an increase in the minimum support price ranging from 4.5% to 7.5% for rabi crops this season.Punjab alone is expecting an output of 13.5 million tonnes of wheat worth Rs 26,000 crore. Haryana’s production is estimated at 12 million tonnes, Uttar Pradesh 10 million tonnes and Madhya Pradesh about 6 million tonnes.In Haryana, procurement will start at 140 purchase centres from Tuesday, April 14, of harvested mustard seeds. The real test will begin on April 20 when wheat will arrive in about 2,000 procurement centres.“Until last year most of the procurement operations used to be over in 25 days, now we will stagger the procurement operations up to two months. The procurement will continue till June 20,” Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said.The farmers will be allowed to visit Mandi in two time slots from 8am to 2pm and from 2:30 pm to 6pm and there will be one procurement center for three villages. Every possible covered space, like sheds owned by the Dera Sacha Sauda, empty grounds of rice millers and school premises will be used for procurement, Haryana officials said.In Uttar Pradesh, despite the lockdown, 34% of the wheat crop has been harvested. “Of the total wheat coverage 9.88 million hectares, 33.89 hectares was harvested by April 12 and this is 34% of the total wheat sown in UP,” said UP’s director (agriculture) Soraj Singh said.“The rabi harvesting is going as smoothly as earlier and the coronavirus lockdown has had no impact on agricultural activities although people are taking precaution against the disease,” said Ram Saran Verma of Barabanki, a Padam Shri awardee progressive farmer.Soraj Singh said inter-district movement of farm workers and equipment had not been restricted and farm equipment from other states too can come in, provided the local district magistrates issue passes. The government has also extended the period of payment of short-term farm loans. In Madhya Pradesh, the procurement of rabi crops including wheat, pulses and mustard will start on Tuesday except in the Covid-19 hotspots of Indore, Ujjain and Bhopal. Farmers would be given specific time slots to bring their produce to 1,241 markets and not more than 10 farmers will be invited in a particular time frame.Farmers have been advised to sell produce to traders through letter of sale, MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said. The MP government has told farmers to make that before bringing their crops to markets, the grains should are cleaned and dried. The biggest hurdle in the staggered procurement is a shortage of labour. “We plan to use workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for procurement,” said Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. States such as Punjab and Uttar Pradesh also intend to employ migrant workers for procurement, officials said.Another issue the states are facing is a shortage of jute bags to pack the wheat in because of the closure of mills in West Bengal, whose chief minister Mamata Banerjee has refused to allow the mills to function on grounds that it would violate lockdown norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-spread-curbs-delay-procurement/story-Nh43RMM8PLntYheqVzkPcN.html
14-04-2020||India||SC modifies order, says free private testing only for poor||Free testing for Covid-19 in private laboratories will be available only to people covered by the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme and to economically weaker sections of society notified by the government as eligible for such free tests, the Supreme Court ordered on Monday, modifying its April 8 order, which forced private laboratories to offer free tests to everyone.Private laboratories, the apex court said, can continue to charge people who can afford the testing fee as fixed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at Rs 4500.“Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare may issue necessary guidelines for reimbursement of cost of free testing of Covid-19 undertaken by private Labs”, the bench of justice Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat clarified.The order was passed after the ICMR, private laboratories and a Delhi based doctor approached the top court seeking modification of its earlier order.The apex court also gave liberty to the central government to decide whether any other categories of the weaker sections of the society like workers belonging to low income groups in the informal sectors or beneficiaries of Direct Benefit Transfer should also be eligible for free testing.The Supreme Court, on April 8, ordered that tests for Covid-19 across government and private laboratories should be free of cost and no person should be deprived of Covid-19 tests because he was unable to afford it. Up until that order was passed, private laboratories were allowed to charge up to Rs. 4,500 for conducting Covid-19 tests.The petitioner, advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, approached the top court, submitting that government hospitals are packed to capacity, making it difficult for people to get themselves tested in government labs.With no alternative in sight, people are forced to pay money to get the tests done at private labs, the petitioner said, adding that saddling ordinary citizens with such a financial burden effectively deprives them of their accessibility to medical facilities and is violative of right to life guaranteed under article 21 of the Constitution.He, therefore, prayed that Covid-19 tests should be free even in private laboratories.After the court allowed Sudhi’s plea on April 8, Dr. Mishra, who is a senior orthopedic surgeon, formerly at AIIMS, and currently at the super speciality Primus Hospital in Chanakyapuri, moved the top court submitting that several citizens have now been admitted and confined to hospitals and other facilities as potentially infected with Covid-19, but their test results remain pending for long periods, putting a strain on the system.It was his plea that in such a scenario, casting the additional burden of offering tests for free could lead to private labs stopping their functioning altogether.Further, private laboratories, through senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, told the court on Monday that if they are not allowed to charge any fee for the tests, it will be impossible for them to carry on the tests due to financial constraint and other relevant factors. They also pointed out that the kits which are utilised in the test are imported kits, which involve substantial expenses.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, referring to the affidavit submitted by ICMR, argued that about 107 million poor and vulnerable families (500 million beneficiaries) are covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme and they can avail of the benefit of free Covid-19 tests even in the private labs.“Free testing for Covid-19 shall be available to persons eligible under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana as already implemented by the Government of India, and any other category of economically weaker sections of the society as notified by the government for free testing for Covid-19, hereinafter... Private labs can continue to charge the payment for testing of Covid-19 from persons who are able to make payment of testing fee as fixed by ICMR,” the court directed after hearing the plea for modification.The court also clarified that the order of April 8 was meant to help economically weak sections of society. “We further clarify that the order never intended to make testing free for those who can afford the payment of testing fee fixed by the ICMR for Covid-19,” the top court said. Private labs welcomed the modified SC order. Ameera Shah, the promoter and managing director of Metropolis Healthcare Ltd, which has been approved by ICMR for Covid-19 testing, said, “We stand by the decision of the honourable Supreme Court. The Government of India’s stand of allowing the free tests of the people covered under the Ayushman Bharat Scheme is a welcome move.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-modifies-order-says-free-private-testing-only-for-poor/story-VVQxyMbJZFPznboha8vOAO.html
14-04-2020||India||Shortage of workers, choked ports disrupt supply chains||At least 50,000 shipping containers have been lying orphaned at container freight stations and private container terminals at three large ports in Tamil Nadu with no trucks available to transport them. Most Indian ports have declared a so-called force majeure -- declared when unprecedented events overtake them and prevent them from doing their job . At ports across India, cargo terminals are operating at capacities less than 30%. On April 3, in a video conference with Union minister of shipping Mansukh Mandaviya, port operators, importers, and shipping companies raised some of these issues, including the unavailability of trucks (and drivers), the shortage of workers in ports and cargo terminals, and choked ports . The 21-day lockdown enforced by India on March 25 -- it ends midnight April 14; the Prime Minister is to address the nation on Tuesday morning on whether it will be extended and if so, fully or in part; several states have already extended it till the end of the month -- has hit the handling of cargo across Indian ports, choking shipping lines. There has been a shortage of workers to handle cargo and a dearth of truck drivers to ferry the cargo to factories leading to a huge inventory pile up at ports. The Centre’s move to waive demurrage charges during the lockdown is acting as a disincentive for importers to figure out ways to move cargo. The closure of factories has also left cargo grounded (or in ships in anchorage) . India’s 7,516.6 km long coastline caters to more than 90% of India’s trading by volume. The statistics are worrying because a snag in the supply chain could stoke distress.Cargo volumes at the Indian ports were already witnessing some slowdown in FY2020 on the back of various factors such as the US-China trade war and the ongoing economic slowdown, according to credit rating agency ICRA. Bottlenecks in the shipping and logistics part of the supply chain, which are critical for timely movement and evacuation from ports, could be an aggravating factor, the firm noted.Manufacturers whose companies aren’t producing anything “aren’t taking deliveries” of imports, said FIEO director general Ajay Sahai. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations is India’s apex export promotion body. “The ports are choking with imports. There is no place to put the containers. There is no unloading happening at factories. The entire import and export trade is a chain activity and even if link is missing, the entire chain gets disrupted,” he added. Sahai listed the problems: courier companies that are not working during the lockdown; factories that are unoperational; customs and ports that are working but a fraction of capacity . “You can’t force people to come to work. Supply chain disruption will continue once factories start even in a limited way,” Sahai said. In a letter written to the home ministry on Sunday, the commerce ministry proposed allowing companies operating large factories making textiles, automobiles, electronics, cement, and fertilisers to restart operations with proper sanitation and distancing norms in place. It suggested restricting their capacities to 20-25% in a single shift to start with. “Commerce ministry has sent the government recommendation on allowing certain industries. The Industry also does not have liquidity to pay for duties. There is a huge mismatch of imports and exports right now. Exports have gone down, there are no containers for exports and labour left for loading. The key is to allow some industrial activity, then also ease liquidity as well to the industry. At present there are no incentives to clear the consignment.” Sahai explained.Earlier this month, the ministry advised major ports to invoke force majeure. This means, for existing and operational projects, the Major Ports can permit waiver of all penal consequences on a case-to-case basis along with deferment of certain performance obligations under the relevant provisions of a concession agreement.The Centre has issued several orders to states asking them to allow movement of all transport vehicles. Centre on Sunday has again asked states to ensure smooth transportation of all inter-state and intra-state goods movement amid concerns of shortage of supply.Tens of thousands of trucks have been left stranded across state borders since the lockdown took effect on March 25. The government has issued several advisories to state chief secretaries that movement of both essential and non-essential goods be allowed, seeking to avoid shortages.To address the snag, ports are also encouraging transportation of goods by railways. The national carrier has been operating freight trains since the suspension of passenger trains during the lockdown.“ As of now we are operating at 70% of our capacity. On the shipping side cargo operations are running on the normal side, down by about 20% there are some challenges in movement to container and where to store the goods and organise labour. The issues is factories have also closed right now. We are hoping it will get better slowly as factories are allowed to open. There is substantial movement happening through rail right now ,” said Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) chairman Vinit Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shortage-of-workers-choked-ports-disrupt-supply-chains/story-dNSpOr8UAXzXHKSSU8dqNK.html
14-04-2020||India||Bringing citizens back could pose risk to population here: Govt tells SC||The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that evacuation of Indian students and expatriates stuck abroad amid the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease could pose a risk to India’s domestic population. Echoing the Centre’s concerns, the bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices LN Rao and MM Shantanagouder said, “Stay where you are”.The Centre made the submission in response to a batch of petitions seeking return of Indian students stranded in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the U.K alone, there are close to 4 lakh Indian expatriates including 50,000 students.Several petitions were filed in the apex court seeking the court’s intervention for evacuation of Indian migrants stranded in the Middle East, Indian fishermen in Iran and students from the US and the UK. The petitioners criticized the travel ban on return of citizens at a time when other countries were making arrangements to get evacuate their citizens from India. The Centre, in its status report said that the country had evacuated citizens from China, Iran, Japan and Italy when the condition in India was not as grim. “However, given the present situation of the corona virus outbreak in India and the available limited resources, it is not feasible to selectively evacuate Indian citizens from abroad when a large number of them from a number of countries want to return back due to various reasons,” the report by the Centre said.The Centre’s status report said that passengers from these countries are at higher risk of infection. “Travel back of such passengers to different regions of India poses a grave risk to the country of a population of over 1.3 billion.”The bench also noted the logistical constraints in arranging quarantine facilities for all returnees. It was for this reason, the Centre proposed to the Court, “The approach of the Government has, therefore, been to advise the Indian nationals to stay put where they are in line with Government’s approach to contain the further spread of the virus within India and allowing health machinery to focus on domestic containment effectively.”The government informed the court that the Indian High Commission in London is making all arrangements to ensure the well-being and safety of stranded Indian students. The Centre’s status report did not make specific averment about extension of visas of Indian students stuck in the US. The court will hear a petition for these Indian students stranded in the US, filed by senior advocate Vibha Dutta Makhija next Monday. The court will also hear a petition seeking the return of some 860 Indian fishermen stranded on the shores of Bandar-e-Moqam and Lavan Island in Hormozgan province of Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bringing-citizens-back-could-pose-risk-to-population-here-govt-tells-sc/story-ZlfVKMZjNIBKJSegWxEivJ.html
14-04-2020||India||Govt plans pool testing in areas with no Covid-19 cases||As the number of cases of coronavirus disease in India crossed 10,000 , the health ministry is considering pooled testing of people with symptoms in areas from where no Sars-Cov-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) infections have been reported, a health ministry official said on condition of anonymity. There are around 450 districts (out of a total of around 730) which have not reported any Covid-19 cases. The plan is to test people with symptoms (cough, fever) using both RT-PCR, or Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, and rapid antibody testing.Pooling of samples involves testing them in batches. When a pooled sample tests positive, then individual samples are assessed. Research shows that this method can be used to do up to three times as many tests with the same number of kits — an important consideration given India’s population. The regions will be selected on the basis of data available through the integrated disease surveillance programme network, and also the new mobile application, Arogya Setu, which has started generating relevant data on the disease pattern, the health ministry official added.“Pooled testing is a good surveillance tool and can be used to test symptomatic people in non-Covid areas to confirm if the areas are actually Covid-19-free. It has not happened yet but is being considered as one of the options to get an idea on the disease spread. The idea is already there, testing will only confirm it,” this person said. India is yet to get the rapid test kits it ordered from China, so the plan will be put into effect with RT-PCR tests. Once the rapid test kits arrive -- these antibody test results are available in 30 minutes as opposed to the RT-PCR tests which take about five hours -- they will be used. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday said people should not worry about testing as India had enough stock of the kits.“We currently have enough stocks to do be able to do testing for at least six more weeks. There is no need to fear,” said Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, . Experts in the field say the ICMR is already late. “They should have started at least a month ago; even if they didn’t have rapid test kits; they should have gone ahead with the RT-PCR tests. We had to test more to know better,” said a senior epidemiologist, who asked not to be identified.Meanwhile, ICMR is also working on increasing the number of laboratories that can test, and is in the process of upgrading laboratories of both private and government medical colleges so that these can also be utilised for Covid-19 testing. It is currently in the process of identifying college laboratories that can be upgraded with the help of some mentoring by advanced labs already doing Covid-19 testing.“ICMR has taken cognizance of the need to expeditiously expand Covid-19 testing facilities in all parts of the country… efforts are being made for proactive search of potential laboratories which could be enabled for Covid-19 testing…,” says an ICMR document seen by HT.ICMR has identified 14 institutes of national eminence, such as All India Institutes of Medical Sciences; Armed Forces Medical College, Pune; National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru; the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research in Puducherry; King George Medical University, Lucknow; and Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad to mentor colleges.The mentor labs will form teams to conduct a comprehensive review of the college laboratories. The mentors will see what facilities these laboratories have and what they need to be able to do Covid-19 testing. At least 400 such laboratories have been identified by the government for assessment. “It is a good idea as there are some states with good infrastructure, and their labs can be taken up almost immediately. For those states that don’t have good medical colleges, the government can help set up/upgrade lab based on Covid-19 testing requirement. The good thing is labs can be created or upgraded in a short span of time, so we can increase the capabilities of the testing labs,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, community medicine expert, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-pool-testing-in-areas-with-no-cases/story-7W9Yu1PmCtvLvjLAMZIUVO.html
14-04-2020||India||India issues 2 back-to-back demarche to Pak for violations. But first a phone call||India on Monday lodged protests with Pakistan for the killing of a woman and 2 minors in firing by Pakistani forces in Jammu and Kashmir in unprovoked cross-border firing and shelling by Pakistani forces on Sunday.A second demarche was issued soon after over Pakistani maritime security forces firing at Indian fishermen in two fishing vessels off the Gujarat coast. One fisherman was injured in this firing that New Delhi described as “a deliberate attack” at its nationals.The two demarches, or formal diplomatic representation, were sent electronically.The standard diplomatic practice has been to summon foreign envoys to the External Affairs Ministry, convey the government’s displeasure at the events concerned and hand over the demarche, or the formal diplomatic note. Since it was not possible to summon the Pakistan envoy to the foreign ministry due to the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, a phone call from the external affairs ministry to Pakistan Deputy High Commissioner Syed Haider Shah preceded the demarche, a top government official told Hindustan Times.Also read: Imran Khan rushes back to UNSC over Kashmir, this time over domicile lawIn the demarche over the Jammu and Kashmir violation, India condemned in the strongest possible terms the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians that had led to the killing of Shamima Begum, 35, and Javid Ahmad Khan, 17, residents of Reddi Chokibal and 8-year-old Zeeshan Bashir of Kupwara’s Tumna village.The demarche, people familiar with the developments said, underlined that Pakistani forces continue to resort to unprovoked firing and ceasefire violations and asked Islamabad to probe such heinous crimes against civilians.In the second demarche, officials said, New Delhi lodged its strong protest at the deliberate attack and firing on Indian fishermen on board two Indian fishing boats ‘Omkar’ and ‘Mahasagar’ by Pakistan Maritime Security Agency vessel on 12 April. In this incident, one Indian fisherman was injured.Also read: Spike in ceasefire violations by Pakistan amid Covid outbreakIslamabad had, earlier in the day, summoned India’s charge d’affaires Gaurav Ahluwalia to the Foreign Office to register Pakistan’s protest over what it called were ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC) in several sectors on Sunday.To be sure, both countries have blamed each other for violating the 2003 ceasefire pact. Pakistan accuses the Indian Army for 708 ceasefire violations in 2020. The Indian Army has counted 1,144 ceasefire violations by Pakistan Army between January and March, with the highest number of violations (411) being recorded in March.Terrorists often sneak into Jammu & Kashmir under cover fire from the Pakistani army. This task of coordinating the launch of terrorists is reported to be overseen by Pakistan Army Brigadier Faisal Qaadeer. Counter-terror operatives said there was information that he had died due to a heart attack on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-issues-2-back-to-back-demarche-to-pak-for-violations-but-first-a-phone-call/story-pND5bCl9C54VnIMdC9ufuK.html
14-04-2020||India||India’s ‘strong demarche’ to Pakistan over death of 3 civilians in shelling||India on Monday lodged a strong protest with Pakistan over the killing of three civilians  in unprovoked cross-border shelling by Pakistani troops and a “deliberate attack” on two fishing boats that injured a fisherman, people familiar with developments said.An eight-year-old boy and a woman were among the three people killed when Pakistani troops shelled several civilian areas in Kupwara district of Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday. The Indian Army said it responded to the ceasefire violations by targeting terror launch pads and ammunition dumps on the Pakistani side.The people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a fisherman was injured when Pakistan’s Maritime Maritime Security Agency (MSA) made a “deliberate attack” and fired on the fishing boats Omkar and Mahasagar on Sunday. The incident occurred in waters off the coast of Gujarat state, the people said.Strong “demarches” or formal diplomatic representations were made to the Pakistani side to protest the shelling in Kashmir and the attack on the fishing boats, the people said.“A strong demarche was made to the Pakistani side on the killing of three innocent Indian civilians in unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistan forces on April 12,” said one of the people, speaking on condition of anonymity.A second person said: “India strongly condemned the deplorable and unprofessional act by Pakistan’s Maritime Security Agency of firing at Indian fishing vessels and causing bodily harm to Indian fishermen. India called on the Pakistani authorities to instruct its forces to desist from such heinous acts.”The people said India had protested against the deliberate targeting of civilians in cross-border shelling by Pakistani forces in Kashmir. The killing of the civilians went against humanitarian norms and professional military conduct, they said.The Indian side also called on Pakistan to adhere to the 2003 ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and international border in Kashmir.Earlier, India’s charge d’affaires in Islamabad, Gaurav Ahluwalia, was summoned to the Foreign Office to register Pakistan’s protest over what it said were ceasefire violations in several sectors along the LoC on Sunday that resulted in the death of a child and injuries to four civilians.New Delhi has already rejected Islamabad’s accusation, saying its troops only responded to shelling by Pakistani forces.Pakistan’s Foreign Office, in a statement, accused Indian troops of committing 749 ceasefire violations this year along the LoC and the international border.Both sides have accused each other of violating the 2003 ceasefire in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-strong-demarche-to-pakistan-over-death-of-3-civilians-in-shelling/story-UdtTedOsXZOKqbuw4txbaO.html
14-04-2020||India||PM Modi meetings on Covid-19 lockdown in last lap, decision at 10 am||The Prime Minister’s Office, which has been in the middle of the decision-making process during the Covid-19 lockdown, is holding one of the last rounds of meetings to finalise the modalities for the second phase of the graded lockdown that will be announced by PM Narendra Modi at 10 am tomorrow.The 21-day national lockdown announced by PM Modi on March 24 evening ends on Tuesday midnight. PM Modi has told chief ministers that the focus of the second phase would be not only to save lives of people from the disease but also their livelihood.The PMO is working with top government officials to draw up the blueprint of how this plan would be implemented. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to sign off on the plan later in the day.A top government official told Hindustan Times that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on the broad steps to follow, Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla will issue a detailed note on the mechanics. “A meeting on the next steps to be taken is currently on at Raisina Hill,” the official said. The Raisina Hill is the seat of power of the central government and comprises the PMO and ministries of finance, home and defence.Also Read: Ministries pitch plan to balance lives, livelihood in Covid-19 lockdown 2.0The broad focus of this blueprint would be to gradually resume economic activity in the 160-odd districts that do not have a single case of coronavirus safe but take all steps to ensure that the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen that causes Covid-19 does not reach there.The second set with limited economic activity will be districts with below 500 coronavirus positive cases along with revival of the self-contained public sector and private industrial units.Within these states too, the government is looking at the proposal of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade to reopen industrial units that are able to accommodate workers at its premises or bring them in special vehicles from safe zones. The department had proposed a list 12 big industries that could be allowed in a graded manner.The third set will include states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where the number of corona positive cases are high even though those areas have been demarcated as containment zones.Even in these red zones, officials said organised activity will be allowed. Unorganised economic activity may be allowed within monitored areas. For instance, officials said, they were looking at the possibility of using, say a hall in a school, for selling vegetables for a few hours, say 6am to 11 am, fruits for another set of hours and if need be, other essentials later.The idea is to give unorganised trade a means for sustenance without risking spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-meetings-on-covid-19-lockdown-in-last-lap-decision-at-10-am-tomorrow/story-gAC8ZHsWGSh6lmt4KJCRWL.html

This time, too, the institution’s data tracker shows a 3.37% dip in electricity consumption in the US, European Union, China and India combined on February 29 relative to the average electricity consumption in December 2019. On January 1, the dip was 7.99%. The data tracker updates both electricity consumption and PM levels every day from government and non-government sources and documents the number of Covid-19 deaths in these countries. The graphs on the dashboard are interactive.“The Covid-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to impose tough restrictions on daily life to prevent the spread of the virus. With these restrictions, roads and airports are nearly empty, shops and restaurants are closed, and industrial activities are largely at a halt. In this environment, real-time information about economic activity is at a premium, but often hard to acquire,” Epic said in a statement on Monday.An unintended benefit of the dip in electricity consumption is a 6% dip in particulate matter (PM) pollution on April 1 compared to December 2019 in these countries, the data tracker launched on Monday indicated.“Declining and increasing consumption has historically preceded economic recessions and recovery. The Covid tracker is an indicator of the health of the economy at a higher temporal resolution (updated daily) than anything else that is available. Most other measures of economic health will only be available every quarter so tracking this information is critical,” Anant Sudarshan, South Asia director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, said by email.The dip in both electricity consumption and PM pollution is significant in India as per EPIC’s data analysis. India recorded a dip of 18.72% in electricity consumption on April 3 compared to December 2019 and a 6.8% in PM pollution on April 1. The PM pollution had dipped by 36.72% on January 18.The dashboard shows that PM levels started declining in India in January much before covid 19 cases increased and lockdown was imposed. “There is no robust evidence in India that PM level has gone down in pre-COVID era due to economic slowdown. Unless trends in source specific PM2.5 concentrations are estimated, it is not possible to conclude that way,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi.The scientists have used daily electricity data for India from Power System Operation Corporation Limited’s daily reports and PM 2.5 data from OpenAQ, a website that aggregates particulate matter readings from monitoring stations around the world.In contrast, China has recorded no change in electricity consumption compared to December and a 10.17% dip in PM pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fall-in-pollution-power-consumption-indicate-major-economic-slump-experts/story-Qax1u3ENTP4y7q2JErxXqI.html
14-04-2020||India||HT Salutes: ‘Didn’t go to his village, for the sake of the city’||Vegetable vendor Dhananjay Gupta has started noticing a new respect in the eyes of customers when he enters the lanes of the residential neighbourhood of Green Park in south Delhi these days to hawk his wares. People peep out their windows and greet him from the balconies when he arrives, loudly announcing what the has for sale.“Before the lockdown,most people here relied on home delivery services for their daily vegetables, but with those being shut, I have finally found some customers in this area,” Gupta, 36, says.As Gupta pushes his cart through the gated colonies of the upscale area, residents wait patiently for their turn. Because of a shortage of vehicles bringing in vegetables from wholesale markets, Gupta has to leave his house at 4am every day to collect his daily stock from the distributor. The vehicle carrying vegetables drives up to Chirag Dilli at 4.30 am. After pushing his cart full of fresh vegetables for nearly three kilometres, he reaches home to wash and sort them before setting out, wearing his face mask and gloves.“People like me generally have no relevance in this society, but this epidemic has given me a purpose. I feel like a soldier these days. My wife was insisting that we go back to our village, but I felt that I needed to stay back for the sake of this city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-didn-t-go-to-his-village-for-the-sake-of-the-city/story-oV6rIWQdQplmr3zWpw1wDO.html
14-04-2020||Editorials||PM Modi’s speech: A mixed bag | HT Editorial||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of the national lockdown for 19 more days, till May 3. This means India will have a lockdown of 40 days — the longest any country, especially of India’s size, population and complexity, has had in the world so far. To be sure, there is a caveat. Depending on the spread of the disease over the next week, there will be relaxations, starting April 20, for necessary activities in states, districts, or subregions which have not witnessed cases, have brought it under control, or have succeeded in the controlling the situation in hotspots — clusters with a high number of cases.The PM is right about the lockdown. Till there are medical remedies to deal with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), social distancing remains the most effective tool to prevent the transmission of this highly contagious virus. India, with its weak health infrastructure, does not have the capacity to deal with a high number of cases. The hope remains, just as it was when the lockdown was originally announced on March 24, that this period will help India “flatten the curve”; it will also give time and space to the government to enhance testing, focus on containment zones, provide personal protective equipment to health workers, embark on antibody testing, and gradually prepare the country for a return to economic life. But this can only be one part of the story. The public health strategy has enormous economic costs. It is true lives have to be saved. But along with the lockdown, India should have announced a comprehensive stimulus for the economy just as other countries have. Around the world, countries have unveiled economic relief packages for everyone — individuals, businesses, and provinces. Just as India has led on the lockdown front, it has lagged on this. India should have, by now, outlined specific measures for businesses which are becoming increasingly unviable; workers who stare at long-term unemployment; the poor who are already confronting the possibility of starvation and hunger; and states, which are at the frontlines of the battle but are fiscally constrained and have been seeking support. It was not enough for the PM to acknowledge that he was aware of these difficulties; it was time to show, in detail, how the Centre plans to help specific sectors, vulnerable citizens, and state governments in this battle. This must be the next step in the government’s plan — and the PM should take personal ownership and announce it himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/pm-modi-s-speech-a-mixed-bag-ht-editorial/story-BhZudOX2TAQDujyiaQ0KXL.html
14-04-2020||Editorials||There is an oil deal. But India need not worry| HT Editorial||Russia, Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers have agreed to reduce oil production. Combined with other measures, the amount of oil sold in global markets will fall by nearly 15 million barrels a day. The entire price drama has led oil prices to rise about 2% a barrel, but they remain half of the $60 to $70 spread they enjoyed just a few months ago. The main consequence of the present agreement is an end to the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. The enormous drop in oil demand that followed the pandemic outbreak has rendered the price war meaningless. Even with Moscow and Riyadh patching up, the resulting production cuts will make up just half the drop in global demand. India, along with other major oil importers, will remain overall beneficiaries of historically low oil prices.Even if the pandemic comes to a grinding halt, the future of oil prices remains bleak. A supply-demand mismatch will remain. Oil producers will immediately open up their spigots. The United States shale industry will come back to life. Also, Saudi-Russian rivalry will continue in some form or another to some extent — India will benefit as a consequence. Saudi Arabia has offset the oil price increase by offering Asian buyers a discount of over $4 a barrel while increasing its demand price for Europe and North America. This reflects a determination to hold and increase market share in Asia at the expense of other producers such as Russia and the United States. In the meantime, India can continue to expect low oil prices as well as a useful period of price stability in the coming several months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/there-is-an-oil-deal-but-india-need-not-worry-ht-editorial/story-Qd0OiJOEYYv1NJe9f6fhNI.html
