09-04-2020||News||Covid-19: India has done well till now, but lifting the lockdown is not advisable||The Chinese government alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) of several cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on December 31, 2019, and reported the first death on January 11. India discovered its first case a month later (January 30) and had its first death two months later (March 11). It is clear that Covid-19 has largely been driven by human-to-human transmission, forcing public health officials to announce social distancing as an effective way to drive down the virus’s reproductive numbers (known as R0, and pronounced as R naught), meaning the average number of new infections generated by each infected person.For the epidemic to begin to end, the reproduction rate has to drop below one. Based on a mathematical model, a multi-author paper published in the March 16 issue of Science cautioned that undocumented infections are responsible for nearly 80% of the total documented cases in China, and that this single factor could facilitate rapid dissemination of the coronavirus. Those with undocumented infections often experience mild to no symptoms and can go unrecognised by the health system, thereby increasing the risk of the virus’ spread.During the first half of January, before China imposed a complete lockdown in the affected province, the R0 of the virus had risen to 2.38, indicating a high capacity for sustained transmission. China was quick to announce a complete lockdown on January 23. Subsequently, the R0 plummeted below one, suggesting containment of the epidemic with only a marginal increase, if any, in new infections, and new deaths for weeks on end. This is the basis of a lockdown. What is not clear, however, is the length of the period for these measures to remain in force to keep the infection R0 below one for a reasonable period, and to prevent a possible rebound after the control measures are relaxed. Do regional and population-specific factors play a role in this?India imposed a similar lockdown on March 22, exactly two months after Wuhan, first as a people’s curfew on an experimental basis, followed quickly by a nationwide lockdown from March 25. Two questions are being asked now: First, did India succeed in containing the disease as effectively as China? Second, India has a prevalence of tuberculosis, and persistent BCG vaccination has helped boost robust innate (pre-existing) as well as adaptive immunity in the Indian population. So will this broad-based immunity help India weather Covid-19?An analysis of data, till April 8, reveals interesting trends. With over 120,000 tests done, the rate of positive cases in India with densely-populated regions is 4.5-5.0%, as compared to much higher figures in hotspot European nations and the United States. India is yet to start testing clusters with high rates of Covid-19. However, based on the expanded testing standards, the low positivity rate is encouraging. What is even more remarkable is the almost near lack of severe and critical cases and limited mortality.But then India is not China or Europe where most infections and deaths are concentrated in ageing populations. The ministry of health and family welfare has put forward a set of interesting figures. Consistent with global patterns, 73% of Covid-19 patients in India are male and around 40% are in the 20-40 years age group. But only about 17% of the patients are senior citizens (60-80 years), though there is a higher proportion of deaths among them. These are the documented figures and perhaps community surveillance through rapid antibody tests will throw further light on as-yet-undocumented figures and defy the trends observed so far.How does a host immune system recognise the virus as an enemy and proceed to eliminate it? Once the lymphocytes recognise the virus as foreign, the foot soldiers in this fight (cytokines) are mobilised. They set off a cascade of signals to killer T-cells to marshal an effective response. Usually, the stronger this immune response, the quicker the chances of thwarting an infection. This is why younger people remain less vulnerable to the coronavirus. Once the enemy is defeated, the immune system returns to normal and generates “Memory T-cells” that are ready to attack more quickly, should the same infection re-enter the body.In most cases, that is what happens. However, in some Covid-19 cases (here the exact figures could vary among populations), age notwithstanding, the immune system continues to remain in an agitated state, even if the virus no longer remains a threat. It continues to release cytokines, almost like a storm, which instead of doing any good to the body, attacks multiple organs, leading to death. The immune system in the elderly is in a state of immune senescence, and thus they must remain indoors and not interact with the young since many of the latter could be asymptomatic carriers. This is also the case with those (age no bar) who have diabetes, lung or kidney disease or are immune-compromised.India has done exceedingly well so far. The challenge is now to sustain the benefits of the lockdown and the added immunity that the population enjoys due to the microbial load. The next few weeks are crucial; lifting the lockdown, even temporarily, is not advisable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-india-has-done-well-till-now-but-lifting-the-lockdown-is-not-advisable/story-uTkGnkKVmEbuC45y1SqjIN.html
09-04-2020||News||India needs a common minimum relief plan. Here is a road map||The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), and the challenges that it has presented, have made it clear that any comprehensive and effective response must be based on the three pillars of prevention, testing and economic fortification. While the first two can be contained through uniform international practices, the third requires a solution that addresses India’s unique and diverse economic terrain. It is for this reason that the Congress has been pushing the Centre to come out with a roadmap that reassures the most vulnerable that their concerns are paramount.In this piece, we provide the government with a ready catalogue for those at risk. These are the key stakeholders in the development, publication and execution of, what we call, a “Common Minimum Relief Programme”. Those at the bottom must be at the top in the order of priority. This includes daily-wage earners, labourers and migrant workers. The last few weeks have attested to the fact that they are the most affected in terms of economic and social insecurity. We have witnessed the scale of economic upheaval and displacement, with millions of migrants trudging across states to get home. There is no longer any alternative but to prepare a targeted social security programme for these individuals and their families.These concerns were brought out by eight major national trade unions in a letter to the central government last week. Their suggestions provide an insight into the real cost paid by these workers who face evictions, food shortages and lack of access to basic facilities. The government must use these recommendations as a template to identify key areas to tackle. This must be done on a war-footing, given that the overwhelming majority of our population is currently employed and engaged in the unorganised sector.This brings us to India’s “annadatas” (food providers). Sixty per cent of India is engaged and occupied, in some form or the other, with the agricultural sector. For farmers, this year has had a greater-than-normal set of challenges. First, they were impeded by unseasonal rains and inclement weather. Now, given the absence of agricultural labour and transportation facilities, how can they harvest the standing crop? Make no mistake, a shortage of wheat and other rabi crops will have adverse consequences for every citizen. Clarity, information and guarantees must be provided by the Centre on procurement and prices.The next in this sequence, and right in the eye of the storm, is the middle class. The longer economic activity remains dormant, the greater the erosion of the middle class. Employers in the private sector have begun slashing salaries, and will continue to do so. Large numbers of mid-level and blue-collar jobs have been lost. Every single index suggests that this trend will intensify in the near future.The government’s response has been to offer delayed payment of EMIs, disingenuously enough, without interest subvention. This, in turn, leads to a greater cost in the long-run. At the same time, it has lowered the rate of interest on all small savings schemes. This has directly hit senior citizens, pensioners, farmers and women especially hard. This is a catch-22 situation in which the cost of the obligations go up in the long-term, while the value of the savings goes down sharply. How is this in the interest of the middle class, which is already seeing its savings ravaged by the high cost of petrol, diesel and gas? These are the same people who gave up their subsidies when Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked, without a second thought or hesitation. It is now time for the government to reciprocate and secure their interest.Not so long ago, medium and small-scale enterprises (MSMEs) were recognised by the government as the “backbone of the economy”. This is a fact, given that MSMEs contribute close to 30% (~61 lakh crore) to the GDP. The same government is yet to provide a plan that bails out these 42.5 million entities that employ several times as many citizens. Unless there is a plan for protection, followed by a strategy for revival and growth, this sector will be irreparably diminished. This will devastate the spirit of entrepreneurs, who, in the words of the prime minister, are the growth ambassadors of the economy. Governments and the people that elect them are judged by their response to crises and catastrophes. Indians have demonstrated unshakeable resolve, patience, optimism and fortitude in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. For the Modi government, the litmus test starts now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-needs-a-common-minimum-relief-plan-here-is-a-road-map/story-qK8ZHbPTIOSt4kVypz5yyL.html
09-04-2020||News||The mystery behind India’s stance on HCQ||On April 7, the official spokesperson of the external affairs ministry (MEA) “discouraged”speculation or politicisation, inter alia, of the government’s decision to allow the exports of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and paracetamol through licenses. Specifically, he said, “With regard to paracetamol and Hydroxychloroquine, they will be kept in a licensed category and their demand position will be continuously monitored. However, their stock position could allow our companies to meet the export commitments that they had contracted.”The spokesperson also clarified that “temporary restrictions on the exports of a number of pharmaceutical products” were placed to ensure that there were “adequate stocks” of these products “for the requirement of our own people.” Following these restrictions, a “comprehensive assessment was made of all possible requirements under different scenarios.” The spokesperson emphasised that the decision of the export of drugs was made “after having confirmed the availability of medicines for all possible contingencies…”.This statement is reassuring, but it would have been more so if it was backed with statistics of current and projected HCQ requirement, availability, proposed export, production capacity, and if active ingredients for it are needed from China. This is particularly because of apprehensions that India made the decision under pressure from the United States (US). Currently, HCQ is allowed to be used in India as a prophylactic for frontline health workers in the fight against Covid-19 and household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.Ill-informed criticism of government’s decisions should always be avoided, particularly so in these difficult times. However, an examination of the HCQ’s decision’s timing can neither be speculative nor its politicisation. Government documents are revealing in respect of HCQ decisions.On March 25, the Director-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) prohibited the export of HCQ through a formal notification. However, despite the prohibition, under the notification, Indian pharmaceutical companies were permitted to fulfil their existing export HCQ contracts. Exports could also be made on “humanitarian grounds, on case to case basis, on the recommendation of the Ministry of External Affairs”.On April 4, the DGFT issued another notification on HCQ exports in which it withdrew the exceptions made to the prohibition on export of HCQ in its March 25 notification. Clarifying the effect of this step, the April 4 notification stated, “The export of Hydroxychloroquine and formulations made from Hydroxychloroquine, therefore, shall remain prohibited, without any exception”. On April 4, US President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On the same day, at a press briefing, after the call, Trump said “I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning. They make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine…And I said they — had a hold…And I said I’d appreciate it if they would release the amounts that we had ordered. And they are giving it serious consideration”. The External Affairs Ministry statement of the Modi-Trump telephone conversation did not mention Trump’s request. It did, though, note, “Stressing the special relationship between the two countries, the Prime Minister reiterated India’s solidarity with the USA in overcoming this global crisis together. The two leaders agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to resolutely and effectively combat Covid-19”.At a press briefing on April 6, Jonathan Karl, the White House correspondent of ABC News asked Trump “Are you worried about retaliation to your ban of medical goods like Indian Prime Minister Modi’s decision to not export hydroxychloroquine to the United States and other country (sic)?” The question was asked in the context of Trump’s decision of April 3 to disallow US companies from exporting personal protective equipment required by health care workers attending to Covid-19 afflicted patients. Canada was particularly enraged with the decision.In a rambling response, Trump made several points some of which require interpretation — that he did not like India’s decision to ban HCQ exports to the US; that he had not heard that Modi had personally taken the decision for the US; that he knew Modi had stopped it for other countries; that he had a good talk with Modi (comment: but he got wrong the day of the talk by mentioning Sunday, though the conversation happened on Saturday); that he would be surprised if Modi did not accept his request, for India has for many years taken advantage of the US on trade. At the conclusion of his remarks, he said there may be retaliation. This is obviously an indication that other countries may retaliate to his medical goods export ban.On April 6, the Indian government decided to set aside its April 4 HCQ decision, and to revert to some aspects of the March 25 notification. The real issue is the basis on which government changed its mind. Did the concerned authorities not look at the HCQ situation fully before taking the April 4 decision? If they did, then why did the government take a different view on April 6? The external affairs ministry needs to clarify to prevent speculation that India came under Trump’s pressure when he has banned export of essential medical goods himself.Vivek Katju is a retired diplomat.

09-04-2020||Lucknow||Reading is taking all my time in quarantine: Maanvi||Last seen in films like ‘Shubh Managal Zyada Savdhaan’ and ‘Ujda Chamman,’ actor Maanvi Gagroo has been posting videos and asking all to follow government instructions. “I don’t understand why people don’t see the crucial aspect of the lock down and keep complaining,” she says.SMZS was shot extensively in Varanasi.The actor is happy with the great response her last two films as well as her web show ‘Four More Shots Please’. “I started as a kid on TV way back in 2007 and today I am doing films as well as OTT shows. So, you can say, I have come a long way. My both web series including ‘FMSP’ and ‘Made in Heaven’ gave me something I always wanted — a well-written character from start to end. Actually, this is only possible on OTT as makers and writers have plenty of time to work on each and every character as the web is not time-bound like films,” says the young actor.She is now looking forward to the success of the second season of her web show.Talking about tasting success very early in life she says, “I had started very early in life and saw success too. But, real success is when your audience recognises you even in small part of any film or show. That’s what I am enjoying currently as audience appreciate me in whatever project I am taking up.”Gagroo says that staying indoors has made her an avid reader, “Earlier, I was all busy with work and outdoor life but as of now things have taken a 360-degree turn. Here, I am doing all household work and getting time to spend on things I always wanted to do. Reading is taking all my time in quarantine. And I have no qualms about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/reading-is-taking-all-my-time-in-quarantine-maanvi/story-IQaVprjVryjgIzBjpW1uRO.html
09-04-2020||Mumbai||Highest one-day jump as Maharashtra reports 229 cases, 25 deaths||Maharashtra’s coronavirus case count and toll on Thursday went up to 1,364 and 97 with the addition of 229 cases and 25 deaths, the highest 24-hour jump for both, according to state data.Thursday was also the sixth consecutive day the state saw more than 100 cases, even as Mumbai recorded 162 new cases. Of the 25 deaths, 14 are in Pune, nine in Mumbai and one each in Malegaon and Ratnagiri.As of April 9, Mumbai has 876 cases and 54 deaths, which has forced the government to take further stringent measures to prevent the state from slipping in to phase three — community spread — of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.State health officials indicated that cases will continue to rise for a few more days before coming under control. “Going by the trend in other countries, the rise in cases was expected. It is likely to increase for a few more days and then the graph will gradually come down. Our preparations have started much in advance and we are ready to face any situation,” said a senior health official, on condition of anonymity. The state has tested 30,766 people and has kept 4,731 in government quarantine facilities, while 36,533 are quarantined at home, said health officials.The state cabinet has decided to impose strict implementation of lockdown rules in 381 containment zones — where at least one person from the area has tested positive for the virus — across Mumbai. It has also decided to deploy the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) in Mumbai and use drones to monitor crowd movement.Mumbai’s red zonesThe civic body has identified more than 200 hotspots or red zones (areas with higher concentration of Covid-19 cases), where there will be curfew-like restrictions. “In these red zones, there will be no movement in or out, enforced with police help and ward assistance, to prevent further spread,” said municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi.Aslam Shaikh, textile minister and guardian minister of the island city, said they are imposing curfew in 21 hotspots in the island city with immediate effect. “The supply of essential services will be taken care of by the state administration, compelling the residents to stay home during this period,” he said.School education minister and Dharavi member of legislative Assembly (MLA) Varsha Gaikwad said, “Barring medical shops, everything else will be shut in the hotspots identified in Mumbai. It will not be possible to contain the spread in areas like Dharavi without imposing stricter restrictions as the next eight days are crucial,” she said.SRPF to be roped inState health minister Rajesh Tope said the rising number of cases in Mumbai is worrisome. “To curb the spread in Mumbai, we have decided on stricter implementation of the lockdown. Mumbai police are doing a great job, but we have decided to rope in SRPF for the effective implementation of the lockdown. Besides, we have also decided to use technology to ensure social distancing. CCTV and drones in containment zones will be used for monitoring to ensure there is no crowding in these zones,” he said.Tope said that they have been emphasising on sanitisation in densely populated areas such as Dharavi. “We have decided to sanitise public toilets there every hour with the help of power jets used by the fire brigade and also to sanitise congested slums through drones,” he said.The daily spike in cases has become a cause of concern for the state. Ministers, during the cabinet meeting on Thursday, demanded mass rapid testing and strict implementation of lockdown, especially in Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).“We keep people in quarantine facilities, but don’t test them. In case they are tested, the reports come after three to four days, which delays the entire process. If we come to know about the cases in advance, then prevention can be done more effectively,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.Demanding strict implementation of the lockdown, a minister said the army should be called in as the numbers are rising rapidly and they need to be contained. Another minister demanded sanitisation of slums and public toilets wherever patients are found.Tope said authorities have decided to conduct rapid tests on the frontline staff, including health workers, police personnel and sanitisation workers. He said the tests will begin in a couple of days once they receive the one lakh test kits that have been ordered.To regulate vegetable marketsThe state cabinet also deliberated on regulation of vegetable markets, where people are seen to be crowding. The state administration has been asked to find alternative arrangements for the supply of vegetables. The government may ask local administrations to shut down large markets and restrict the selling of vegetables at stand-alone shops. “In fact, people should make up their minds to give up on vegetables for the next few days. Farmers have made up their minds to not grow vegetables,” said revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.Meanwhile, traders of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) market, a wholesale market that supplies food essentials to Mumbai and surrounding areas, has decided to shut shops from April 11 till further orders. The market administration has asked APMC to ensure that Mumbai will not face shortage of essentials by selling them directly to wholesale traders in the city.Health insurance coverThe state rural development department has decided to provide health insurance cover of ₹25 lakh for three months to all gramsevaks, rural development officers (local officer at village level), and computer operators working at ‘Aaple Sarkar’ centres formed to provide notified services to the citizens under the Maharashtra Right to Public Services Act. The decision was declared by rural development minister Hasan Mushrif. On March 31, the department has declared to provide insurance cover of ₹25 lakh to anganwadi workers, accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers, helpers and gram panchayat employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/highest-one-day-jump-as-maharashtra-reports-229-cases-25-deaths/story-OwmLqyZrPdAnPxRYOd8MPN.html

The Bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Siddhartha Varma took suo moto cognizance of difficulties faced by lawyers and their clerks during the nationwide lock-down. The court observed, “judicial working in the entire country has reduced its pace and is taking up matters of utmost urgency alone. The slowdown has adversely affected the livelihood of lakhs of people, whose survival depends upon the working of the judiciary. An enormous effect is apparently visible on the profession of advocates and the registered advocate clerks working with them.”The Bench, while issuing notice to lawyer welfare bodies, observed, “This court does not have any funds to allocate for survival of needy advocates and registered advocate clerks and the court at the moment is also not in a position to restore its complete functioning.” “Under the Advocates Act, 1961 it is the responsibility of the Bar Council of India as well as the State Bar Councils to ensure welfare of advocate fraternity and also to assist the needy advocates. In every court, the associations of advocates are also operational and such court attached Bar Associations are also necessarily required to take care of their members.”, added the bench.The court has fixed April 15 as the next date of hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/allahabad-hc-to-bar-assns-explain-steps-taken-to-ensure-lawyers-welfare/story-81zUvjn5H871pVoQaDbPwO.html

The decision would apply to the subordinate courts in the national capital also.The high court was scheduled to close for the summer break from 1 June to 30 June. The lower courts were to close on 8 June and reopen along with the high court on 30 June. During this period, only a few vacation benches of the high court assemble to hear important matters.The high court had earlier declared the duration of the ongoing lockdown as a vacation for the court.In a full court reference, the Delhi High Court judges said that they are mindful and cognisant of the difficulties faced by litigants on the account of lockdown and consequent suspension of functioning of the courts. “Since during the period of suspension of work, the hearing is limited to the matters of extremely urgent nature or urgent nature, there is negligible fresh filing of cases, lesser disposal and corresponding escalation in arrears, resulting in extreme hardship to litigants. “In view of the severe hardship faced by the litigants due to the prevailing pandemic of Covid-19 that has impaired the functioning of the courts, it has been unanimously resolved by the full court that to make up for the loss of court working hours and to ensure restoration of normalcy in the functioning of the courts at the earliest......, declaring the period of the Summer vacations for this Court and the Courts subordinate thereto in the month of June 2020, this Court and courts subordinate thereto shall continue functioning during the entire month of June i.e. from June 1 to June 30,” the resolution read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-judges-will-make-up-for-covid-19-lockdown-work-through-their-summer-vacation/story-0B9XUPafOci41i3CNYMeWL.html
09-04-2020||City||Coronavirus could upset growth momentum of affordable housing: Report||Gurugram: The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to upset the growth momentum of affordable housing in 2020. This segment is likely to be among the worst affected as income growth and job security are going to be hit across most sectors due to the coronavirus pandemic, says a report by a private consultancy released Wednesday. According to the report, there are 6.1 lakh affordable residential units under construction in top seven cities of the country, of which 59% are in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) alone, the report by consultancy firm Anarock says. The rules of the central government state that an affordable house is one which is up to 90 square metre (sqm) in size in non-metropolitan cities and 60 sqm in metropolitan cities, having a value of not more than Rs 45 lakh.The report added that NCR and MMR alone account for nearly 59% - or 3.59 lakh - such units and these were primarily launched between 2013 and 2019. Both regions together also have a 57% share (approximately 1.34 lakh units) of the overall unsold stock of 2.34 lakh units in the budget homes category, which is another burden.“This segment will be severely impacted by the Sars-Cov-2 outbreak. The target audience typically has limited income and unemployment fears currently loom large. This could result in deferred property purchase decisions in 2020 and ultimately derail the segments’ growth momentum. As a result, unsold affordable stock can rise by 1-2% on a year-on-year basis,” said Anuj Puri, chairman Anarock property consultant.Despite the findings of the report, developers and real estate consultants in Gurugram say the affordable segment in the city is not likely to see much upheaval as a majority of the projects in the city are either under Rs 30 lakh per unit or the price is beyond Rs 70 lakh per unit. “The affordable projects this report mentions are those priced between Rs 30-40 lakh and Gurugram has very few of such projects,” said Pankaj Tomar, a real estate broker, adding that affordable housing in Haryana was controlled by the Department of Town and Country Planning and were limited in Gurugram because such projects were more in other cities.They admitted that Covid-19 will no doubt impact the entire real estate sector but housing projects under affordable housing policy are not likely to be impacted much in the city. “As far as Haryana is concerned, it would not be right to say that Covid-19 will derail the affordable housing growth in 2020. We are working as per the Haryana Affordable Housing Policy and the demand for these houses is a lot here. In fact, the supply has not met the demand as yet. There are around 75 projects in this segment with 55,659 units and the price per unit is under Rs 30 lakh. However, the post-Covid-19 period will be a challenging one wherein affordable housing would need a push from the government,” Pradeep Agarwal, chairman, Signature Global, a city-based developer. A city-based developer engaged in affordable projects said that unlike other areas, the DTCP had ensured that labourers at construction sites do not migrate from the sites. “We are taking care of this labour force and in hindsight this cost is going to be beneficial for us mobilise labour again would have considerably delayed projects,” said a senior executive, who preferred anonymity. As per the details shared by the report, NCR has the maximum under-construction affordable housing stock with more than 1.87 lakh units. MMR has 1.72 lakh affordable units under construction, Pune has 1.31 lakh such units, Kolkata has 55,300 such units, Bangalore has 32,300 units, Chennai has 19,500 affordable units, while Hyderabad has 11,000 affordable units that are under construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-could-upset-growth-momentum-of-affordable-housing-report/story-A5w4eTdfjrTHzDhQdCjmRJ.html
09-04-2020||Lucknow||66 companies preparing sanitisers in UP||The Uttar Pradesh government has stepped up production of sanitisers in its fight against coronavirus.In a bid to bridge demand and supply gap of sanitisers, the government has eased licensing procedure for setting up sanitiser units. As a result, 66 companies are preparing sanitisers in the state.At present, these companies are preparing 1,45,860 litres of sanitiser per day in the state. In coming days the production is likely to go up.According to state government officials, 23 sugar mills, 10 distilleries, 26 sanitisers companies and seven other companies are preparing sanitisers across the state.Highlights66 companies manufacturing sanitiser in Uttar Pradesh.1,45,860 litres of sanitiser is being manufactured per day in UP.23 sugar mills, 10 distilleries, 26 sanitiser companies and seven other companies are preparing sanitisers.Ethanol, isopropyl alcohol are used for preparing sanitisers.After the outbreak of coronavirus, around 3,99,350 litres of sanitiser has been sold in the state.The need to start production of sanitisers in Uttar Pradesh was necessitated by the fact that most of the sanitiser companies are based in Gujarat from where the state was getting its supply.“The government is all out to promote sanitiser industry in the state. We will extend all possible help in setting up sanitiser manufacturing units,” said Satish Mahana, industrial development minister.After the lock-down is lifted the government is expecting more companies to apply for license for manufacturing sanitisers. Ethanol, which is used for preparing sanitiser is available in abundance in the state. Apart from ethanol, isopropyl alcohol is also used to prepare sanitisers.The Uttar Pradesh Drug Manufacturers Association has apprised chief minister Yogi Adityanath about problems being faced by industrialists in preparing sanitisers.“Ethanol is available in abundance in the state. But its availability depends on excise officials. This has led to artificial crisis of ethanol across the state,” said Prashant Bhatia, president, UP Drug Manufacturers Association. “We have requested the government to direct the excise department to make ethanol easily available to manufacturers of sanitisers on priority basis,” added Bhatia. The industrialists have also requested the state government to cut down 18 percent GST on ethanol and isopropyl alcohol and 12 percent GST on sanitisers. It may be pointed out that the state government has started giving licenses to sugar mills for manufacturing sanitisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/66-companies-preparing-sanitisers-in-up/story-2uNQil450oRWl9OmL5bleP.html
09-04-2020||City||Non-Covid patients at Civil Hospital to be transferred to ESI||To protect patients from the highly contagious novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the administration on Thursday ordered that all non-Covid cases at the Civil Hospital at Field Gunj be shifted to ESI Hospital near Bharat Nagar Chowk by Friday. Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal ordered that the OPD and emergency services be shifted to ESI. As per his directions, all arrangements, including the shifting the patients and acquiring the requisite infrastructure should be completed by April 10. The civil surgeon and the ESI medical superintendent have been told to streamline health services and ensure smooth functioning of the hospital. AS part of containment efforts, the civil hospital in Field Gunj will exclusively look after the patients suffering from Covid-19. The need for a separate Covid-19 wing was felt in order to attend to the rising number of suspected patients. On April 5, principal secretary health and family welfare Anurag Aggarwal had visited the Civil Hospital to inspect the newly set-up 120 bedded Covid unit. Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Ravi Datt said, “Before the decision to shift the Civil Hospital was taken, we had shifted the emergency towards the de-addiction ward of the hospital. But there was always the risk of a Covid-19 positive patient visiting other wings of the hospital.” He said a dedicated Covid unit was the need of the hour to negate the possibility of spreading the virus in other wings of the hospital. “It is highly contagious virus and our objective is that any patent exhibiting flu-like symptoms should be rushed to the unit so that the risk of spread can be minimised,” said Dr Datt. He said that a dedicated team of doctors and nurses had been deployed at the Covid unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/non-covid-patients-at-civil-hospital-to-be-transferred-to-esi/story-S7BD1IUPhagGoYBMgMCWSK.html
09-04-2020||City||At Palwal war room, it is round-the-clock alert||Palwal: Telephones were constantly buzzing on each of the four tables placed a metre apart with operators wearing masks. They were pacifying people on the other end, many of them who reported cough and cold, and gave instructions on what needs to be done. This is in the war room set up at Palwal Civil Hospital, where a dedicated round the clock facility has been put in place to check the spread of Covid-19 in the district where 28 cases have been reported so far.On April 4, the Palwal district administration had declared 15 villages as under “containment” and 36 as buffer zones — banning the entry and exit of people in these villages — after 28 Tablighi Jamaat attendees tested Covid-19 positive in Palwal. The administration adopted the Bhilwara model as a containment strategy.Dr. Brahmdeep Sindhu, the hospital’s chief medical officer, said that they had set up the war room on March 20, following information from The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) that a few members of the Tablighi Jamaat had visited the district. A team of doctors and nurses operate the war room, take quick decisions and rush in case of an emergency. “We have two helpline numbers which are attended by our two staff members. They are working in two shifts of 12 hours each and attending more than 200 calls a day. The war room is also taking care of three main facilities – flu clinic, isolation ward, and quarantine centre,” he said.The medical staff first identifies people with symptoms of Covid-19 and those who who had come in contact with infected person. They are all sent to quarantine centres till their report is out. If a patient tests positive, they are shifted to Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College, Nalhar in Nuh, immediately for isloation and those who are found negative are asked to keep themselves under home quarantine for the next 14 days.The war room is located on the first floor of the hospital. There are senior clinical psychologists and four junior psychologists who also attend calls. Sindhu said they hold meet thrice a day to discuss plans of action and to check progress of cases. “We need to discuss the ongoing preparation and check the data compiled by those who return from the field in the evening. We all are connected through WhatsApp and also keep a check on the movement of doctors and staff,” he said.The hospital has a quarantine ward with 49 patients and isolation ward with 60 patients and 707 people are under surveillance who are home quarantined.The samples of patients are sent to Gurugram, said CMO, adding that it takes at least 24 hours to receive the report and they are getting it collected by hand to ensure no delay in the process.On Wednesday night, ESIC Medical College and hospital in Faridabad was also converted into Covid-19 hospital. “They have converted 120 beds for coronavirus patients and also have set up an isolation ward too. The hospital is also taking care of normal patients visiting them. Now we have two facilities for the patients who test positive and we will be sending the patients to the hospital which will be closer to their residence location,” said Sindhu.Naresh Narwal, deputy commissioner of Palwal, said they are taking initiatives at the micro level to stop the spread of coronavirus and have formed teams for surveys. “We have sent 154 samples so far out of which 110 have found negative and samples of 16 are awaited. The teams are screening and scanning each house in the containment and buffer zone and data has been collected from majorly all areas where the cases tested positive had visited,” he said.Narwal said they prepared a micro plan for containing local transmission in three epicentre – Hathin, Lakhnaka and Rupraka. In each of these epicenters, villages have been identified and four to six teams have been deployed to conduct screening.The district administration has formed teams consisting of police personnel, medical staff, and administration staff who are following with the 36 rescue camps set up across districts to actively trace the symptomatic cases.Deepak Gehlawat, superintendent of police, Palwal said that the city is divided as per police station and teams are formed and one back up team each to ensure their work is seamless and well-coordinated. “Our teams are visiting all the villages and helping the medical teams in their survey and collection of samples. We have identified all the people who had attended Jamaat and their close contact. We are also getting the police personnel regularly checked to ensure they are not fit and can perform their duty without any health hazard,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-palwal-war-room-it-is-round-the-clock-alert/story-iiKHqpHzwgPSUxZcYz0A5N.html

09-04-2020||Gurugram||Devinder Vihar stands in solidarity with its staff working amid lockdown||Almost three weeks after the country observed Janata Curfew on March 22 and came together to honour and show support for frontline workers on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s request, residents of Devinder Vihar in Sector 56 have continued with the practice. Every evening at 5pm, residents of the complex — one of the oldest residences in the city— come out in their balconies and clap for the sanitation workers and maintenance staff of the condominium who are working amid the ongoing lockdown announced to contain the spread of coronavirus disease.“It started off as a one-day exercise with the Janta Curfew, but has now become a routine practice. Residents come out in their balconies on their own at 5pm and start clapping for the sanitation workers and other workers,” Colonel(retired) TS Raghav, president Devinder Vihar Army Officers’ Welfare Association (DVAOWA), said. The routine, Col(retd) Raghav said, was the residents’ way of expressing gratitude to those who were working and providing essential services amid the unprecedented circumstances.The condominium has also paid incentives to all its working staff members. Further, it has also waived off the monthly rent for shops within the complex that are shut due to the lockdown. “We have paid an additional incentive to all staffers as a token of our gratitude towards them. All workers are provided tea and biscuits twice a day,” he said.In view of the lockdown, the apartment has cut down the strength of its non-essential staff and provided all staff members accommodation within the condominium to cut exposure with the outside world. “ Only those staff members who have their families outside go out, and we ensure that they are thoroughly sanitised when they return to the complex. Gloves and masks have been handed over to all members of the staff,” Col(retd) Raghav said.The condominium has appointed representatives for all 18 towers to help out residents in need. These tower representatives are responsible for the overall welfare of residents and keep a special tab on elderly citizens. The condominium has a Kendriya Bhandar (a government-run consumer cooperative society), two grocery and vegetable shops, and a chemist shop within the complex which cater to the daily needs of residents. While there was a shortage of supplies in the initial days of the lockdown, the situation has improved now and the complex is geared up in case the lockdown is extended. “Initially, people had started hoarding and items would run out in the stores. The shops were stocked again and shopkeepers were asked to ensure that they don’t let the same family buy too many units of any essential item. There would be no shortage of any kind, even if the lockdown were to continue for extra week or two,” said Raghav.The floor around the society’s shopping complex been marked to facilitate social distancing. “We have made circled markings on the floor at two-metres part from each other so that social distancing can be maintained while people wait in queues,” he added.The entry of food and courier delivery agents has been restricted to the gates. All persons entering the building go through thermal scanning and are required to use hand sanitizers. Soap and water us also placed at the gates for people to wash their hands. A poster with the dos and don’ts has been displayed at the entrance gate of the complex. The entire complex is sanitised with a chemical solution every day. The lifts are disinfected four times a day.The RWA is strictly ensuring that everyone abides by the lockdown rules and doesn’t venture out unnecessarily. “We are in touch with the district administration and the police. Police officers, in fact, came to the complex and reminded people to abide by the rules since some people were not following them with sincerity. We also regularly make announcements via loudspeakers and remind people to abide by the lockdown rules,” Colonel(retired) PK Katyal, vice-president of the RWA, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/devinder-vihar-stands-in-solidarity-with-its-staff-working-amid-lockdown/story-6wvdOYaSkbbsrgVHByKZ6O.html
09-04-2020||Gurugram||Wildlife department to step up anti-poaching surveillance during lockdown||The state wildlife department has instructed all districts, particularly those with sensitive wildlife habitats, to increase anti-poaching surveillance in wake of the nationwide lockdown announced to halt the spread of Covid-19. In light of the recent reports of surge in poaching activities in some states such as Karnataka and Uttarakhand, the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) in a video conference on Tuesday issued directions to chief conservators and wildlife officers of all districts to step up vigilance in their respective zones.While so far no case of poaching have been reported in Haryana since the lockdown came into effect on March 25 —as opposed to Karnataka, where at least 12 such cases have been reported in the same period—wildlife department officials said they would deploy field officers who would go patrolling every day for increased surveillance. With extremely limited public movement and government agencies being focused on ensuring lockdown is followed strictly, illegal wildlife trade might go unchecked, said Mahender Singh Malik, chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Gurugram.“We will definitely step up anti-poaching activities. District wildlife officers and inspectors have been instructed accordingly to deploy all available field staff for frequent patrolling. We are not anticipating anything untoward, but it is necessary to remain vigilant,” Malik said on Wednesday. Parts of Haryana, particularly near Kalesar National Park in the north and the Aravalli hills in the south, are home to at least nine significant species of wildlife, including civets, porcupines, and golden jackals, with leopards being the state’s apex predator.Rajinder Dangi, district wildlife officer, Gurugram, said, “Compared to other states, the threat of poaching in Haryana has always been much lower, but we do not want to let our guard down and create an opportunity for poachers to enter the forest.” He also drew attention to countries such as Nepal and South Africa, which have also seen an uptick in illegal poaching during lockdowns.In Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand, too, fresh incidents of poaching have been reported since March 25. In Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, for example, wildlife officials arrested a group of men suspected to have killed a blackbuck just a few hours after the lockdown was announced. In Uttarakhand, porcupine and pangolin meat samples were seized from suspected poachers just three days after the lockdown. Pangolin, a commonly trafficked species, is also found in the South Haryana Aravalli region.Interestingly, a study published in the international science journal, Cell, suggests that pangolins are natural carriers of coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19.In addition to increased surveillance, the wildlife department has been asked to keep a close eye on the health and behaviour of captive animals, particularly apex carnivores, after a tiger in New York’s Bronx Zoo tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Our zoos and conservation centers in Rohtak, Peepli, and Bhiwani are being disinfected regularly, and the animals are being observed,” Malik said. Orders to this effect were also issued by the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI), the apex body for all zoos in India, on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/wildlife-department-to-step-up-anti-poaching-surveillance-during-lockdown/story-cX27qo9Lmwb81cVdbjh4AJ.html
09-04-2020||City||Lessons over WhatsApp for government school students but challenges remain||Gurugram: For over a week now, Piyush Rajput, a class 10 student of a government school in Gurugram’s Civil Lines, has been spending several hours a day working on assignments or readings that he receives via a class Whatsapp group formed recently. With schools across the city closing their doors in the wake of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, teachers are now sending study material and assignments via Whatsapp to ensure that the learning process is not interrupted.“When the new session was postponed due to the lockdown, our teachers asked us to add our classmates to a Whatsapp group, where teachers could share learning resources with us. Our class strength is 44 and we were able to reach out to at least 30 students who were added to the group. Teachers have been sharing videos, tutorials, and PDF files of books with us through this group. We are even asked to send pictures of the homework we do and demonstrate whether we are keeping up with the lessons,” says Piyush. He added that while most teachers share notes and resources, some others share their recorded lectures.“Teachers who can’t record videos themselves are sharing videos already available in the public domain. We share our doubts regarding the lessons and assignments between 3-4pm,” said Piyush, who also attended a webinar for his computer class this week via video conferencing platform Zoom.Not everyone is as lucky as Piyush, though, as some of his classmates are unable to receive these resources and thereby stay in tune with the rest of the class since they don’t possess a smartphone or are unable to get it recharged. “Many students come from impoverished backgrounds and can’t afford to have a smartphone. As of now, students who are able to access their parents’ mobile phones are able to benefit from these classes. Most students are studying via mobile phones and only a few students would have access to laptops,” says Piyush.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said classes are taking place remotely via Whatsapp for students who recently got promoted from class 9 to 10, and 11 to 12. She added that classes for all students would start soon as per the class schedule shared by the Department of Education on Wednesday. “Teachers create a summary of the lesson in simple language, click a picture of the same, and share it on the class’ group on Whatsapp. Students are then asked to answer questions based on the shared summary and the teacher responds with feedback over chat,” says Sharma.The experience is new not just for students but for teachers too, who are adapting themselves to the situation and learning the ropes of technology as they go. Manjubala, an English teacher at the Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, has recorded and uploaded two lectures on YouTube until now. Sharing her experience with technology, she says, “I had been reading about private schools starting online classes and was wondering if something similar could be done for our students to ensure that they don’t lag behind. I started putting together a video and shared it for my students on April 1. Simultaneously, the state government too came up with guidelines asking us to share class resources via available modes.”Recording and uploading the lectures was no easy task, says Manjubala, who goes by her first name. “There was no professional setup or resources. I used my mobile phone to record a video and learnt to upload the video via the web. After an initial struggle, I managed to record, upload and share some videos,” she said. While the videos were not as comprehensive as a real-life lecture, she says it was the least that could be done. “Our students aren’t very polished in the English language. Recorded lectures based on their competencies can serve a better purpose in sharing the lessons. Covering the whole lecture in a video, like it’s done in school, is not possible, but I try to share whatever little can be done, even if the videos are short. Questions are later discussed on WhatsApp groups,” said Manjubala, whose phone crashed under the weight of the videos and has been in disrepair ever since. “I am not well versed with mobile technology and while uploading one of the videos, my phone stopped working. I can’t get it repaired because of the lockdown,” she said. Out of a total strength of 60, 50 students are able to attend her class, she adds.Vidushi Kataria, a computer teacher at the Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, saw her son attend classes via Zoom and taking cue from the same, she started taking computer classes for students of class 12 via Zoom. “I had seen my son attending classes via Zoom and thought of trying it out with my students. There are seven-eight students who attend class regularly and two-three others are able to make it if they are able to access mobile phone data. For a subject like programming, we need to share the screen and simply reading out notes doesn’t help,” said Kataria.She, however, adds that using a platform such as Zoom was challenging since not all children had access to smart devices. “Children in government schools come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Most students don’t have access to laptops, and everyone might not have a smartphone either. We try to share whatever resources we can via Whatsapp,” said Kataria.District education officer Indu Boken said that a timetable had been created wherein classes of all subjects were scheduled. “Classes will be taken from 9:30am to 12:30pm every day. Teachers are also taking tests of the students in the evening. We have already shared videos for all subjects for all classes with teachers,” said Boken.She added that even some of those children, who had moved out during the exodus following the lockdown imposition, have also been connected to the groups now. “As of now, we don’t have practical solutions for students without a smartphone. The Internet is required for sharing resources and managing classes without that would be difficult,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lessons-over-whatsapp-for-government-school-students-but-challenges-remain/story-gDFw6mllDBEkTysBltkN2L.html
09-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Illegal sale of liquor online, fake promises of doorstep delivery annoy vend owners, residents||The Gurugram excise and taxation department has received several complaints from liquor vend owners stating that people are using the name of their outlets to sell liquor online and are offering free home delivery. The police said several residents have also been cheated online by con men after paying money through e-wallets, the police said. Excise officials said that some people in upscale areas managed to get scotch and wine delivered at home but there were others who had paid in advance and were duped. Several residents of DLF Phase 1, South City, Sohna Road and Golf Course Road fell into the trap of “liquor home delivery” and lost nearly ₹4,000 in each case, the police said. Officials said they want to request people not to buy liquor through unreliable sources as it might be spurious and cause damage to health. The Haryana government, on March 26, had decided to temporarily shut down all liquor vends across the state till further orders as part of its preventive measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).At least four liquor vend owners had complained to the excise department on Tuesday that suppliers were misusing their shop’s name and offering liquor at a discounted price at the customer’s doorstep, in violation of the current lockdown as they are not allowed to operate. Sale of liquor online is prohibited.HC Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that since the lockdown began, they formed teams to keep a check on all the 249 liquor vends across the district to ensure there was no black marketing. “Some people have created pages on social media and are advertising the sale of liquor and offering free home delivery. We have got these pages checked by the police and no retailer is involved. Their names have been used by some con men who are accepting orders online and taking advance payments for the delivery,” he said.Excise officials said since the lockdown began, bootleggers have been trying to take advantage of the situation. The officials reached out to at least two such sellers on Tuesday night and their pages had been deleted by Wednesday, Dahiya said.“There were two online sellers active on social media. We wrote on their page that legal action would be taken against them for trading liquor online and even contacted them on the mobile phone numbers mentioned on the pages. Within a few hours, they deleted their pages and all the numbers have been switched off since then. I have also written to Facebook and Twitter,” Dahiya said, adding that the police are yet to identify the culprits.Rajan Gandhi, director of Lake Forest wines, said they were shocked to see their brand name on the Facebook and Twitter pages. “None of the numbers belonged to us or any of our employees. Someone is cheating residents with our name so we approached the police and complained against the creator of the page,” he said.Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said they would take immediate action against such con men duping people during the lockdown. They are posting advertisements offering home delivery of alcohol. “These men, after accepting money through e-wallets, do not answer their calls and in some cases, have delivered liquor a couple of times to gain the trust of people. We will get the locations and IP addresses used to create these pages. It takes at least five days to receive a reply from these social media platforms. Our teams are working on the complaint and the culprits will soon be arrested,” he said.The police said residents should not call any such phone numbers and never proceed with financial transactions with the details or links provided by them, through online transfer or UPI platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-illegal-sale-of-liquor-online-fake-promises-of-doorstep-delivery-annoy-vend-owners-residents/story-ug068TlpQrhv4oP39BrS3L.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 patients feel very anxious, says Ludhiana nurse||Besides checking the vitals of Covid-19 positive and suspected patients, they need to be given medicines and injections on time and be assured that they will soon get cured so that they can meet their loved ones, said Prabhjot Kaur, 35, in charge of the nursing staff deputed at the isolation ward for coronavirus patients at Ludhiana civil hospital. Kaur added that as Covid-19 positive and suspected patients are kept in isolation, they experience a lot of anxiety. “First, they are not allowed to meet their families. Then, they are kept isolated from others and get treated by the medical staff who wear protective kits. All this adds to their anxiety and they fear about their lives. But we try our best to keep them motivated. It’s a difficult emotional journey for them,” she said. At present, three coronavirus positive and 22 suspected patients are kept in isolation at the civil hospital. “Earlier, I had also been on duty in the isolation ward formed for swine flu. It is important to take all preventive steps while treating the patients. We have been on duty in the isolation ward for about a month now. Since then, we have been wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). The entire staff was screened on April 7,” said Kaur, who was earlier posted in Samana, Patiala. Once I return from work, I sanitise myself before meeting my daughters–Sukhpal Kaur, 10, and Navleen Kaur, 4–and doing the chores, she added. “First, I take a bath on reaching home, and then, I wear a new set of clothes. I also keep aside all articles that I carry along with me to the hospital. Only then do I meet my daughters,” Prabhjot said. Kaur’s husband, Parminder Singh, is in charge at the dialysis centre of Shri Rama Charitable Hospital. “While I have to be present at the hospital every day, my husband goes for work only when he is called for duty. But we take all preventive steps to ensure that our daughters are safe. I request everyone to stay at home and step outside only if it’s urgent. That is the only to win this battle,”she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-patients-feel-very-anxious-says-ludhiana-nurse/story-47oLvtLPTJOaDOgPaLWbnI.html

The act of the ruling party MP was shameful and should be condemned.”“Instead of spending his time in jail, MP is roaming freely, the Dalit employees are angry over the inaction of the state government. Chief minister should take strict action against the MP so that he does not repeat the act again”, she said.A state government officer said that a case had been registered against BJP MP Pathak and 25 unidentified men on the charge of assaulting the tehsildar, Arviind Kumar. The police have also seized around half a dozen vehicles from the spot.

Apart from the hectic shifts followed by loneliness in their accommodation, the team members would also undergo a 28-day ‘exile’, comprising 14-day mandatory active quarantine at the hospital during their duty tenure and another 14-day passive quarantine in a hotel before they return home, inform district health officials.At the end of their 14-day active quarantine, they would be replaced by another team of 25 doctors and paramedics (‘Team-B’) and later it would also also undergo the same process.“Our team of 25 professionals is taking care of the patients day and night. Besides medicines, breakfast and meals are also being provided to them with adequate precautions,” said Dr VK Mishra, nodal officer of Kotwa Hospital.The team comprises six doctors, six staff nurses, six safaikarmis, two pharmacists and two lab technicians as well as three ward boys. “The pharmacists and lab technicians have a 12 -hour shift while the remaining staff is on an 8-hour shift,” he said.The entire medical team has to adhere to strict quarantine norms. After work at this 30-bed hospital, they do not return home. Instead, they stay in a temporary accommodation made available by the administration.“For the entire staff, barring the nurses, a guest house at ‘Habusa Mode’ has been acquired and reserved. The nurses are staying at another establishment 400 metres from the hospital. Each member of the team has been given a separate room where they have their meals. There is also a hall where they can have their food but here too proper social distancing is ensured,” explained Dr Mishra, adding that no socializing was allowed to limit chances of the virus spreading.The nurses said they were well aware of the danger and battled inner fear to perform their duty. “However, we know that our work is valuable in the battle against the virus. The morale of nurses as well as the entire medical team is high,” said Anita Singh, a staff nurse working here as part of the first team.“Once our schedule of 14 days is over, we will have undergo a 14-day passive quarantine at a hostel acquired at Andawa crossing. During this period also we will not meet or interact with anyone. Once this period gets completed, we will all be tested and if our results are negative, we will be able to return to our families,” said another nurse.Officials said that once Team-A and team-B completed their duty cycles, Team-C would take charge at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/frontline-soldiers-medical-team-wages-battle-against-covid-19-amid-loneliness/story-oudNCVPLwv3B5crYpsZkWK.html
09-04-2020||Mumbai||State to ask Maharashtra Governor to appoint chief minister to legislative Council||The Maharashtra cabinet, in a meeting headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday, decided to recommend Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to appoint chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray as a member of the state legislative Council to avoid a constitutional crisis in the state. “As elections cannot be conducted owing to the Covid-19 crisis, and two of the seats for the legislative Council under the Governor-appointed quota are vacant at present, the state cabinet decided to recommend the Governor to appoint Uddhav Thackeray as the member of legislative Council on one of the seats,” said a statement released by the CM’s office.Thackeray, who was sworn-in as CM on November 28 last year has to get elected to one of the two houses of the state legislature within six months (the period ends on May 28), failing which he would have to resign. If such a situation was to prevail, the entire cabinet also would have to tender resignation. Though they can be sworn-in again, such a situation would be an embarrassment for the state government and could lead to constitutional crisis. Thackeray had planned to contest a by-election to the legislative Council but the polls have been postponed owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.Of the total 78 seats in the legislative Council, the Governor has powers to appoint 12 of them belonging to different walks of life such as arts, culture, literature and social service. The recommendations are made by the state government. In recent instances, several politicians have been nominated from this quota.According to Article 164 (4) of the Constitution, “A minister, who for any period of six consecutive months, is not a member of the legislature shall at the expiration of that period cease to be a minister”.“This is an unprecedented situation. Elections cannot be held due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, we don’t want any constitutional crisis while fighting Covid-19, and thus the cabinet decided to recommend the Governor to appoint Uddhav Thackeray as member of the legislative Council from [the two seats] under his quota,” said a senior minister, wishing not to be named.This is not the first instance in which the head of the government will be appointed from the upper house. “This is not unusual as in the past, there have been cases when a minister has been appointed from the upper House. Even former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a member of the Rajya Sabha. However, in case the governor doesn’t accept the recommendation, then Thackeray will have to resign and by-election would have to be conducted. Holding elections in this situation is difficult but not impossible,” said Shreehari Aney, former advocate general of the state.Experts have opined that the recommendations made by the state cabinet are binding on the Governor though the Governor can object to any name.“The recommendation made by the cabinet is binding on the Governor and President in parliamentary form of the government,” said Anant Kalse former principal secretary, state legislature. He also said that the state cabinet will recommend Uddhav Thackeray’s name to the Governor as an individual and not as the chief minister.However, in the past similar recommendation made by the state cabinet was not accepted by the Governor. Koshyari ,who was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Uttarakhand, is not exactly on cordial terms with three-party coalition government in the state.In December last year, the state cabinet had recommended to appoint Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders — Shivajirao Garje and Aditi Nalawade — as members of the legislative Council but the Governor did not take any decision on it. Both the seats got vacant after NCP leaders — Rahul Narvekar and Ramrao Wadkute — left the party in the run up to the state Assembly pollsShiv Sena leaders however, are positive about getting Koshyari’s nod to appoint Thackeray to the upper house of the state legislature.A Sena minister said that the party had two options: either to get him elected on one of the nine seats that fall vacant on April 24 or to get Thackeray nominated from Governor’s quota. “We did not want the recommendation to go through Shiv Sena group leader for Uddhav ji’s nomination as he had not cleared the two names recommended by the NCP group leader. Instead, it was decided that the recommendation should go through the cabinet. The Governor may dilly-dally, but we expect him to clear it. Criticism [of Governor] aside, Maharashtra is facing an unprecedented situation and the people should not suffer because of politics,” the Sena minister said, requesting anonymity.The recommendation from the Cabinet also comes a day after Sena leader Sanjay Raut raised Koshyari’s alleged interference in the state’s administrative work. Raut was backed by NCP chief Sharad Pawar when he raised the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday during an online conference with group leaders of political parties.The state has also pushed back local body elections and the Election Commission of India (ECI) has deferred the Rajya Sabha polls that were scheduled in March this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-to-ask-maharashtra-governor-to-appoint-chief-minister-to-legislative-council/story-8o7WbSgbeXirVMxjTs5KII.html

09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Postal department starts door-to-door pension distribution amid lockdown in Ludhiana||To ensure that pensioners are not inconvenienced during the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, the department of posts in Ludhiana has initiated door-to-door distribution of pensions in the district.There are around 2.13 lakh pension beneficiaries in the district. Pensions are being distributed under different government schemes such as old-age pension for men over the age of 65 and women over the age of 58, financial assistance to destitute women and children, and disabled persons. Notably, only 770 of the beneficiaries have an account with the India Post Payment Bank.The department is using an Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) to carry out the pension distribution process. The postmen and Gramin Dak Sevaks have been provided with a biometric system, which will help them verify the authenticity of a beneficiary’s claim. The beneficiaries will be handed the pension in hand. However, only the beneficiaries who got their Aaadhar linked to their bank account will be able to avail this facility. The beneficiaries will be getting a pension for the months of January and February, which will amount to ₹1,500. Last week, the administration had asked for the department of posts help in distributing pensions to beneficiaries door-to-door as many of them were facing financial difficulties. Normally, the postal department only distributes the pensions of its own department’s pensioners, railway staff and BSNL employees. Ludhiana senior superintendent of post offices Amanpeet Singh said the department had started the process of distributing pensions to 29,000 beneficiaries. “The administration had on Tuesday shared details of pensioners. We have compiled a list of 29,000 pensioners whose particulars including Aadhaar were complete,” Singh said. He said though the department was distributing pensions door-to-door, pensioners can also draw their pension through the AePS. In order to cover all pensioners, the postal department has increased the redistribution of the area and expanded the beat of each postman. At present, the department has 170 postmen against 220 posts in Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/postal-department-starts-door-to-door-pension-distribution-amid-lockdown-in-ludhiana/story-egTOYhFOhLenPWzstydxeI.html

09-04-2020||Mumbai||30% pay cut for Maharashtra’s legislators this year; 2 panels to help revive state’s economy||Even as the state stares at an unprecedented revenue drop owing to the coronavirus outbreak and the lock down, the Maharashtra government set up two committees to look into the measures to revive the economy. On Thursday, the state cabinet cleared a proposal to appoint two high-level committees to deliberate on the measures to be taken in the coming months. The cabinet also decided to cut the salaries of Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and Legislative Council by 30% beginning this month till March 2021 in the light of the brunt borne by the state’s economy owing to the coronavirus crisis.“In the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis, the state cabinet has decided to form two committees for economic revival. One committee will consist of ministers, while other will have finance department officials, former bureaucrats, economists, and financial experts, who present their recommendations to the government,” said Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and state finance minister. Apart from Pawar himself, the ministers’ panel will also include senior ministers Jayant Patil, Balasaheb Thorat, Chhagan Bhujbal, Anil Parab, Eknath Shinde and Ashok Chavan.Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance, said the expert committee will recommend measures that can be taken by the government to bring the state’s economy and finances back on the track. “Today, only the approval to form the committees was given. In a day or two, the members on the non-ministerial expert committee will be decided. We will now have to take a multi-pronged approach. First of all, we will have to reopen our economy [as and when possible], then we will have to increase liquidity, etc… The load on citizens [in terms of taxes/duties/cess] will not be put unless absolutely necessary,” Saunik said.According to senior officials, Maharashtra has taken a severe hit due to the lockdown, with the state’s revenue witnessing a drastic plunge. Saunik said the state’s March revenue dipped by ₹30,000 crore from what it had earned in February. A finance department official added that apart from the dip in the revenue, the state’s has also incurred huge expenses while combating the coronavirus outbreak in Maharashtra. The government is now banking on the Goods and Services Tax compensation, worth ₹16,000 crore, as well as funds from the Centre, to relieve the strain on its coffers.Meanwhile, the state government is expected to save around ₹31 crore annually by the 30% pay cut for its legislators in 2020-21. The state government has also decided to request the urban and rural local bodies to bring a similar proposal and initiate pay cuts for their elected members.The state’s decision to cut the legislator’ salaries came two days after the Union cabinet announced that Members of the Parliament (MPs) will undergo a pay cut this year. “The decision is more of a gesture to send out a message to the public. The savings from such cuts is hardly anything against the total revenue receipts of the state,” said a senior cabinet minister.The state government had last week decided to defer 60% of the March salaries of the elected representatives after the drastic drop in the revenue receipts in the last month of the financial year 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-pay-cut-for-maharashtra-s-legislators-this-year-2-panels-to-help-revive-state-s-economy/story-Sjfc5pey9kUwAM7iXJEwzH.html

Maharashtra’s mortality rate – 6.34% – is the third highest in the country after Gujarat (179 cases, 16 deaths, 8.94% mortality rate) and Punjab (101 cases, 8 deaths, 7.92% mortality rate), according to data released on Thursday by the Maharashtra Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD), the agency chosen by the state government to analyse data to help formulate policy.The analysis had not taken into account the positive infections and deaths reported on Thursday evening.Apart from Maharashtra, the states that have the most number of positive cases are Delhi (738), Tamil Nadu (669), Telangana (427), Rajasthan (381), Uttar Pradesh (361), Andhra Pradesh (348) and Kerala (345). However, their mortality rates are respectively 1.34%, 1.08%, 1.63%, 0.78%, 1.1%, 1.14% and 0.57%. According to data released by World Health Organisation, the global mortality rate is 5.85%, making Maharashtra’s rate higher than the world average. In fact, India’s average mortality rate is 2.89%, making Maharashtra’s rate more than double that of the rest of India. Mumbai has been the worst affected among all Indian cities, with 857 cases and 45 deaths, followed by Pune with 192 cases and 10 deaths. MEDD data indicated that people between the age group of 61-80 years are the most vulnerable to the infection, in addition to morbidity rate being the highest. Patients in the age group of 61-70 have a death rate of 23.15%, according the MEDD data, while those between 71 and 80 years are even higher at 23.53%.Civic officials said on Thursday that the state has been able attribute deaths to Covid-19 on account of better screening and higher testing. As on April 8, Maharashtra had conducted 27,090 tests, which is slightly lower than four southern Indian states combined. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka accounted for 29,149 tests. Telangana has not released its test numbers. Rajasthan has conducted 16,782 tests. “We are conducting highest number of tests in the country, and this has to be accounted for when we consider the mortality rate,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, Mumbai. “If we had not conducted extensive tests, these deaths would go unnoticed.” According to state health department officials, close to 90% of the deceased patients have co-morbid ailments such respiratory issues, cardiac ailments, diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis and HIV. “This is why we have isolated high-risk patients with co-morbid health issues,” Dr Shah added. “In places such as Dharavi (India’s biggest slum with a population of 8.5 lakh and a population density of 66,000) where home quarantining is not feasible, we are keeping senior citizens at chosen vacant places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-6-34-maharashtra-s-mortality-rate-is-third-highest-in-india-state-agency-data/story-ca8UycdxYH7ws4C3KMikOL.html

09-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra has conducted 30,766 tests till Thursday||According to official information on Covid-19 tests, Maharashtra conducted 30,766 tests, home quarantined 36,533 persons, and placed 4,731 persons in institutional quarantine till Thursday. Among these, 28,865 persons tested negative, 1,364 persons tested positive, and 125 persons have been cured. For Mumbai alone, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has conducted 15,500 tests so far.As of Monday, Mumbai had conducted 12,000 odd tests, surpassing figures for tests done in many other Indian states, such as Kerala which conducted 10,716 tests, Delhi which conducted 6,567 tests, and Tamil Nadu which conducted 5,015 tests. Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi told HT on Tuesday, “We are aggressively testing and need to continue to do so, for early detection of Covid-19 cases. Testing is happening even in the fever clinics at a war footing.” Presently, Mumbai sees 884 test per million, much more than Kerala, that sees approximately 319 cases per million, Tamil Nadu that sees 150 cases per million, and Delhi, that sees 196 cases per million, according to BMC data on April 6. A senior civic official said, “Rigorous testing is the only way forward.”There are 13 laboratories in Mumbai which conduct Covid-19 tests, of these eight are private laboratories and five are civic-owned. While presently, Mumbai’s capacity is to conduct 2,000 tests per day in these 13 laboratories, the capacity is likely to be scaled up to 3,000 tests per day by next week, as the civic body plans to open two new testing laboratories at Haffkine near KEM in Parel, and at Sion Hospital respectively.Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani, in charge of BMC’s health department, said, “Within the next seven to 15 days, both these laboratories will become functional, and Mumbai will have total testing capacity of 3,000 tests per day. While the one at Haffkine is almost ready, the one at Sion will take around 15 days, with setting up equipment, and making lab technicians available.”To scale its testing capacity further, BMC has planned to purchase rapid testing kits as well. Rapid tests work differently from swab tests that are being done in a laboratory at present. Rapid tests take a blood sample and produce results within 15 minutes, versus a swab test, which in Mumbai has a cycle of 12 hours before results are concluded.Pardeshi said on Tuesday, “Rapid tests are going to be very useful in eliminating persons who are not susceptible to Covid-19, and hence reducing the burden on laboratories. These will be used on our frontline staff on priority, to determine who is safe to do fieldwork and who is not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-has-conducted-30-766-tests-till-thursday/story-KBw8fKZG0YEeyWgYWe0BtM.html

09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Govt enhances mustard procurement limit, number of centres||In a significant development, the Union agriculture ministry on Thursday enhanced the daily procurement limit for mustard and gram from 25 quintal to 40 quintal per farmer. The mustard procurement will begin from April 15 at 248 centres across Haryana.The central government’s decision is crucial in terms of maintaining social distance as the enhanced daily procurement would mean lesser visits to mandis by the farmers.Granting a relaxation in the price support scheme (PSS) guidelines following a request by the Haryana government on Wednesday, the central ministry in a communication said that this will be a one-time measure in view of the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 outbreak.While there is no daily limit on the quantity of purchase of wheat from a farmer in a day, there is a cap on purchase of mustard (only 25 quintal per day) and gram (only 20 quintal per day) from one farmer.The state government has also sought an increase in the quantity of mustard and gram procured by NAFED from 25% to 40%.The procurement of mustard and gram is done under the PSS. The PSS comes into operation when the prices in open market fall below minimum support price (MSP). As per the existing norms, only 25% of the mustard and gram crop can be bought under the PSS by the procurement agencies at the minimum support price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-enhances-mustard-procurement-limit-number-of-centres/story-266uyqldlXSzJzZW3SN7UN.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Shelter homes in Ludhiana just have 1% occupancy||Despite having a capacity to house thousands of people, the shelter homes setup by the administration to aid migrant workers across the district wear a deserted look. Most migrant workers have opted to return to their one-room rented accommodations instead of the shelters. Ludhiana, the financial capital of the state and hub of cycle, hosiery, sewing machine and small-scale cycle parts industries, is home to 20 lakh migrant workers. Most workers stay at Focal Point, Giaspura, Dholewal Chowk, Vijay Nagar, Barewal Road and Mundian. After the lockdown was imposed, the administration had announced that at least 50 shelter homes will be created with a capacity to house 35,000 people. Later, the administration confirmed that 57 shelters had been established. However, the shelters only have 1% occupancy. The Radha Soami Satsang Beas had also opened doors to its Satsang Bhawans across the city after curfew was imposed. There are 10 Satsang Bhawans but migrant workers are availing only three of its bhawans at Kadian village, Kailash Nagar, Bajra Road and Tibba Road. At present, the three bhawans are sheltering, 97, 174 and 95 migrants, respectively. The staff managing the Satsang Bhawans said police officials drop migrant workers at the bhawan, following which they take care of their shelter and food and ensure that social distancing is being observed. A number of migrant workers have also taken shelter at gurdwaras. A visit to the night shelters setup by the municipal corporation near the clock tower and Vishwakarma Chowk on Wednesday showed that no one had sought refuge there.Labourers say police not allowing them to go to shelters However, a group of eight labourers, on their way to Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, was seen moving crossing the Jagraon Bridge on Wednesday. The labourers said they could not go anywhere as they had no means of transportation and the police were not allowing them to go from one place to the other as they suspected that they may start moving to their home towns on foot. One the migrant workers, Manu, was stranded in Ludhiana while he was en route to West Bengal from Solan.He has been seeking refuge at a gurdwara in the interim. “I worked as a cook at a hotel in Solan. I reached Ludhiana a day before the railways suspended its operations and now I have no place to stay,” said Manu. Another labourer, Prince, who works at a restaurant near Subhani Building, said the owner had just shown the workers the door when the government imposed curfew. “We are unable to go to shelters established by the administration as the police are not allowing us to move at all, fearing that we may try to go to our native places on foot. They stop us at every check post and beat us up for being out amid curfew,” he said. Most labourers are confined to labour quarters as the police had earlier directed the industry to provide them with subsistence allowance so that they could fulfil their daily needs. The administration had also directed the owners of labour quarters to not ask labourers for rent for a month. Ration and food is also being distributed among the needy by the administration and different NGOs.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said the inflow of migrants to the homes was much more last week but their number had considerably reduced now as they had reportedly gone back to their quarters.“We have created the facility but the number of migrants staying there is low as they prefer staying in their homes or quarters. With strict curfew restrictions, we have successfully managed to confine them and have also been sensitising them to stay indoors and maintain social distancing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shelter-homes-in-ludhiana-just-have-1-occupancy/story-cU9ukvFYc23eM0wJXP7TbM.html

09-04-2020||Delhi||Doctors harassed, assaulted by man at fruit shop in Gulmohar Enclave||A 42-year-old interior designer was arrested on Wednesday night for allegedly molesting, assaulting and threatening two women doctors of a government hospital, due to an altercation over social distancing at a fruit shop in south Delhi’s Gulmohar Enclave, the police said.The police said that the man, a south Delhi resident, was fearful that the two women could get affected and spread the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease if they did not practise social distancing. He ended up abusing and harassing them, the police said.A case of wrongful restrain, voluntarily causing hurt, molestation, criminal intimidation, and sexual harassment was registered under sections 341, 323, 354, 506 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code at the Hauz Khas police station, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.Thakur said the two doctors, siblings, were off duty and had gone to buy fruits at the shop, close to their rented accommodation, when the incident took place. One of them, who is 29 years old, alleged that the man asked them to maintain social distancing even as they tried telling him that they are doctors and aware of the guidelines.HT is withholding the names of the hospital and doctors as sexual harassment charges have been added to the case. “As the women tried to leave, the man blocked their way, assaulted them and touched them inappropriately. He then left the place. The women approached the police and got themselves medically examined. A case was registered and the suspect was arrested,” a senior police officer, who requested anonymity, said.Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said on Thursday said that legal action will be taken against those who discriminate against doctors, paramedics and healthcare workers.There have been several reports from across the country of people misbehaving with healthcare workers and doctors over apprehensions that these front-line workers could be contagious and infect others.Delhi Police spokesperson, Mandeep Singh Randhawa, said, “We are all aware that doctors and other health staffers are the front-line warriors in the fight against Covid-19. I, on behalf of the Delhi Police, want to assure all medical staff that we are always available for their safety and protection. They should immediately call us whenever they are in need or distress. Any kind of misbehaviour or harassment of medical staff will not be tolerated and strict action would be taken against those found guilty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/doctors-harassed-assaulted-by-man-at-fruit-shop-in-gulmohar-enclave/story-qOq73CE5i1keFxUK1PsfPJ.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Minorities commission asks Delhi health dept to drop mention of Tablighi Jamaat from its bulletins||The Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) on Thursday wrote to the Delhi government’s health department to refrain from mentioning the Tablighi Jamaat and giving religious undertones to its daily bulletins on the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city. The commission’s chairperson Zafarul-Islam Khan in a letter to the department said that the health bulletins being released by the government had a separate column under the category ‘Markaz Masjid’, which was being misused by some divisive elements as a “handle to attack the community”. “This kind of categorisation by the government is not only unnecessary but is also leading to attacks on people from the community in various areas across the country and hence must be dropped. The government must give out only the number of cases. Any Muslim is now being taken as a Tablighi while calls are being made for their social boycott,” said Khan. He said there had been incidents of a young man being beaten up in north-west Delhi and others wherein people had been attacked. “This is a crucial aspect, which must be kept in mind before releasing the bulletin,” he said. The Tablighi Jamaat outfit held a congregational event at its Nizamuddin Markaz headquarters in Delhi last month, which was attended by a large number of foreigners and Indians, many of who have tested positive for Covid-19. The DMC letter said, “The World Health Organization (WHO) has taken cognisance of this phenomenon, unique to India. The organization’s emergency programme director Mike Ryan had on April 6 said that countries should not profile Covid-19 cases in terms of religion or any other criteria. Also, he asked governments not to politicise the issue and stop profiling people on a religious basis.” However, a senior Delhi government official said they haven’t received the letter yet, but the categorisation is to prevent panic among people on the rise in the number of cases. “The reason the case count linked to the Tablighi Jamaat is given separately is to assure the public at large that the rise in the city’s total number of cases is attributable to the one event, which means they need not worry about community transmission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/minorities-commission-asks-delhi-health-dept-to-drop-mention-of-tablighi-jamaat-from-its-bulletins/story-gPT0SedGIAneLCkLymuetI.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Italian tourist succumbs to corona in Gurugram||An Italian tourist, infected with coronavirus, died on Thursday after over 40 days of treatment at Gurugram’s Medanta hospital. The deceased was part of a tourist group comprising 14 persons and all of them were found infected with coronavirus. They were admitted in a hospital in Gurugram after recommendation of the Central government. Hospital sources said three of the tourists are still admitted in the isolation ward of the hospital. The rest are recuperating well.VS Kundu, additional chief secretary and nodal officer of Gurugram’s Covid-19 team, confirmed the death of the tourist. “We are waiting for detailed reports from the hospital. As she was infected with Covid 19, we assume that she died due to it,” Kundu said.Meanwhile, with three fresh cases either having direct or indirect link to Tablighi Jamaat, the Covid-19 positive patients’ count in Haryana jumped to 156 on Thursday. State’s health department officials said a nine-year-old boy from Kaithal and two men from Panchkula, who had attended a Tablighi Jamaat event in Rajasthan’s Sikar last month, have tested positive. The boy, a madarsa student, was in contact with the first Covid-19 patient of Kaithal, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin. As per the health officials, there were 22 students and three teachers at Madni madarsa on Kaithal’s Sirta Road. While 24 people have tested negative, the boy is currently admitted to the isolation ward of the local civil hospital. The boy is the third child who tested positive for the infection; others are two Sirsa siblings who contracted the virus from their mother. The Panchkula men, aged 18 and 80, were traced on April 1 and moved to the quarantine facility at Nada Sahib gurdwara in Panchkula along with other persons who had attended the jamaat events in different states. With these two cases, the total count of positive patients in Panchkula is four now. Of the total 156 cases reported so far, Nuh had cumulative number of 38 cases, highest in state to this date, followed by Gurugram (32), Palwal and Faridabad (28 each), Karnal (5), Panipat and Panchkula (4 each), Ambala and Sirsa (3 each), Bhiwani, Kaithal and Sonepat (2 each), Fatehabad, Jind, Charkhi Dadri, Rohtak and Hisar (1 each).As per the health bulletin, 18 people in the state have so far been cured and discharged. People concealing Tablighi history to booked for murder bid: VijHaryana home minister Anil Vij on Thursday said anyone who had returned from the Markaz event at Delhi’s Nizamuddin and was still in hiding in Haryana would be booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Vij, who also holds the health portfolio, said that more than 1,500 people who returned from the Delhi congregation had been identified and put under surveillance. He said of all traced people with Tablighi link, 105 were found to be infected.

09-04-2020||City||Punjab’s crop diversification plan faces stiff challenge||Chandigarh Even as Punjab has planned wheat harvesting in phases due to covid-19, the state’s plans to ramp up diversification of crops by replacing the water-guzzling paddy with water conserving cotton and maize faces challenges. These are timely arrangement of seeds and to ensure farmers can sow these crops within the optimum time frame. Seeds for these crops are to be bought and transported from southern states. For cotton, sowing begins immediately after wheat harvest, expected to be from April 20 to May 31. Maize is sown in June. Paddy comes later and the state allows its transplantation from June 20. Increase in area under the two crops means fall in area under traditional paddy crop.Sources in the state agriculture department said arrangement and distribution of seeds to farmers during lockdown is a tough task. “If we miss sowing cotton, there’s no option but to shift to paddy,” said Satwinder Singh, a Mansa farmer. Baldev Singh, a farmer form Bajak village in Bathinda district, told HT that the next few days were critical for cotton growers because all arrangements such as seeds, fertilisers and pesticides needed to be made in advance. “I am not blaming the government, but as of now things seem out of control,” he said, adding the earlier the cotton is sown, the better it was. Cotton is grown in Bathinda, Mansa, Faridkot, Muktsar, Abohar and Fazilka districts. Maize is grown in Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Ropar and Amritsar.“For diversification, the area under cotton is to be increased to 5 lakh hectare this year (from last season’s 3.9 lakh hectare); maize to 3.25 lakh hectare (from last season’s 1.6 lakh hectare). We are focusing our work on ensuring that there is no shortage of seeds,” says state agriculture secretary, Kahan Singh Pannu.For the area planned to be cultivated this year, 27 lakh packets of cotton seeds (which come in 200 grams packing) and 3.2 lakh kilogram maize seed is needed. “We are in touch with companies in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat that supply BT seeds for cotton and companies in Tamil Nadu and down south for maize seeds,” said Pannu, adding that the government gives 50% subsidy on seeds.Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor BS Dhillon said the varsity advocated that cotton sowing should begin from April 1, but crop sown till April 15 was also within the ideal time frame. “Further delay in sowing leads to challenges for farmers,” he said. “I am sure maize sowing would be easy, because, hopefully, by then the covid-19 situation would ease out,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-crop-diversification-plan-faces-stiff-challenge/story-gLWHzyeSyJYTNEHQGt4pmJ.html

09-04-2020||City||Temporal needs: Offerings at Golden Temple dip from Rs 23 lakh to Rs 15,000 a day||Amritsar: The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) is in a fix and will find it tough to manage its finances as it has seen a massive dip in offerings from devotees at the Golden Temple, the largest gurdwara in the world, due to the curfew imposed to check the spread of covid-19. From an average collection of offerings of Rs 23 lakh a day (Rs 85 crore for the year, including those received online) in 2019-20, its collection for the two weeks since the curfew was imposed has dipped to between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 a day, said an SGPC official, who did not want to be quoted. Besides management of gurdwaras, which entails offering langar, the SGPC also runs educational and medical institutes for social service. It has also been offering langar to the needy across north India amid the lockdown. The situation, in terms of offerings, is similar in all gurdwaras, with a prolonged lockdown likely to further dent its finances. The Golden Temple sees an average daily footfall of 1 lakh; this has now dipped to around 1,000 a day, with devotees mostly coming in from areas near the shrine, said another SGPC official.“Online offerings have also dipped considerably. These come from other states and NRI devotees. With every country battling covid-19, their collective economy and individual savings have been hit. Banks are also not operational in many areas and this, too, has impacted offerings,” said an SGPC official, adding that the Golden Temple employed around 25% (2,800) of the gurdwara body’s 11,000 employees. He added that the monthly salary bill of the SGPC was also in crores. Its annual budget for 2018-19 was Rs 1,205 crore. At Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib, Anandpur Sahib, the second-largest gurdwara under the SGPC, there was dip in offerings by around Rs 70 lakh in the Holla Mohalla festival this year in March, over the corresponding period last year. To inspire devotees, Golden Temple head granthi Giani Jagtar Singh has given Rs 51,000 as offering to Sri Guru Ram Das Langar Ghar, the langar centre of the temple itself. SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh and former Golden Temple granthi Giani Jaswant Singh have also offered 21,000 each for langar services. Roop Singh added stand-alone contributions continued to come in, with US-based NRI Amrik Singh Giljian offering Rs 5 lakh and another city resident, Gurdip Singh, offering Rs 50,000. SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said those capable of contributing must do their bit, even though the online medium. He maintained that there was no shortage of people wanting to contribute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/temporal-needs-offerings-at-golden-temple-dip-from-rs-23-lakh-to-rs-15-000-a-day/story-4ZRwDbW6UuSzkL292eo7rK.html
09-04-2020||City||Software glitches delay salaries, govt draws flak from SAD, AAP||Chandigarh: The Punjab government has repeatedly announced to give full pay to all its employees, but many of them are still to get salaries for the month of March, with the release delayed by “technical glitches” in a new software.The state government had introduced an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) from April 1 for approval of financial bills, including those related to salaries, and release of payments, after its contract with a private IT firm ended. National Informatics Centre (NIC) is operating the new IFMS. Seeking immediate measures to resolve the problem, Punjab civil secretariat staff association president Sukhchain Singh Khehra claimed that a large segment of employees who were going out of their homes and performing their duty to contain the spread of coronavirus had been waiting for their salaries, even after nine days.A finance department official said the government was releasing salaries, but the process was taking extra time due to technical snags in the new system. “Our people and those of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are working day and night to remove the glitches and make payments. On Thursday, we released Rs 150 crore for salaries. Banks and government offices did not function for several days this month, due to the financial closing at the start, and then we had some holidays,” he added. Unlike several other states which have deferred salaries, Punjab has decided to pay full salaries to all its employees, including contractual and outsourcing ones, for the curfew period.The opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), however, flayed the state government for the delay, accusing it of adopting a “callous” attitude towards police personnel, healthcare workers and other frontline workers, fighters against covid-19. “It is unfortunate that in this difficult time, our protectors are not being paid on time by the state government,” former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said, asking chief minister Amarinder Singh to intervene and ensure all frontline workers were paid their salaries immediately. Leader of opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema also urged the CM to ensure that brave hearts fighting coronavirus from the frontlines do not face any difficulty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/software-glitches-delay-salaries-govt-draws-flak-from-sad-aap/story-SAqI4l2jWDE5bVYkBBwP3N.html

The helpline response capacity has also been doubled.Gupta also said that 381 FIRs were been registered, 568 persons arrested, 186 vehicles impounded and 1,499 persons taken to open jails for curfew violations.

A probe in the matter is underway.The incident was reported from Dostpur Mangrauli village. According to the owner of the dog, the suspect, Chandra Pal Sharma, had tried to harm the animal on an earlier occasion as well.“The dog was friendly with children. But Sharma has young children and he was always scared of the dog. He has tried to hit him earlier as well. On Wednesday, around 8pm, Sharma dragged the dog away from our home. The dog’s neck got stuck in the gate after which he hit our dog with a rod repeatedly,” pet owner and complainant Raj Kumar said.Kumar said later, Sharma dragged the dog for almost two kilometers after tying the animal to his motorcycle and refused to listen to anyone who tried to intervene. The family suspects that rumours of dogs spreading coronavirus may be why the paramedic killed the dog.The family informed the Gautam Budh Nagar unit of People for Animals about the incident after which a case was filed at the Expressway police station against the suspect under sections 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.Sharma has denied the charges.“The family has several dogs that are left in the open. On three occasions, my daughter was bit. The animals rummage through our garbage. On Wednesday night, I saw two dogs going through our dustbin and I tried to shoo them away. One of them ran away, however, I accidentally hit the other with a stick. I had no intention of harming it but the dog collapsed. After that, I asked a person I know to take the animal for treatment on my bike,” he said.Police said a probe in the matter is underway. “No arrest has been made as yet. We will take necessary legal action after a thorough investigation,” Yogesh Malik, station house officer, Expressway police station, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/physiotherapist-booked-for-killing-dog/story-8w3ccSz6TkouLwBdQ9ffqM.html

Mirtuza, a Byculla resident, told the police that he had bought the masks in bulk and stored them in his godown and wanted to sell them later. He has been supplying face masks to medical stores and others from more than five years without any license. The officers have seized 64,000 N-95 masks worth ₹1.28 crore and 31,000 3-ply masks worth ₹7.75 lakh,” said senior inspector Ashok Khot of unit 3. After the lockdown was declared on March 23, the crime branch has seized around 32.58 lakh masks worth ₹17.30 crore from different parts of the city. Of these, 10.30 lakh were N-95 masks worth around ₹12.45 crore, while the remaining were 3-ply masks worth ₹4.85 crore, joint commissioner of police Santosh Rastogi of the Mumbai crime branch said.The government has declared face masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities upto June 30 to insure that there is no scarcity of these two items and they are priced correctly. Under the EC Act, the government has declared that investigating agencies can carry out operations against those involved in the black marketing of masks and hand sanitisers.“We started a crackdown against those storing the masks illegally and are selling them at a higher price. We have arrested around 20 people from across the city under the EC Act until now selling these products in black market,” said Rastogi. “If any person stores masks in a truck or a godown without a valid licence, then the police informs the collector’s office and following the collector’s order, the masks are handed over to government authorities. Until now, we have handed over around 9.20 lakh seized masks to the civic body and Haffkine Institute as per the collector’s orders. The others too will be handed over soon after the orders are received,” a crime branch officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/95k-masks-worth-1-36cr-seized-from-sobo-godown-trader-arrested/story-g4GwbhZwN04rpbAM3KlBEK.html

The officials of the district health department said that the facility has been shut for now as the process can cause cross-contamination. Further, the officials are awaiting a standard operating procedure (SOP) for sample collection.The officials, on March 7, had inaugurated the sampling booth with the help of an NGO called, Arambh Ek Pahal. The facility resembles a glass cabin with a pair of gloves hanging out. On the outside of the glass cabin, patients are supposed to arrive and their samples are to be taken by the healthcare professional sitting inside the cabin.“The process of sampling at the booth has been stopped as it can lead to cross contamination among patients who arrive for sampling. The glass cabin will provide protection to the person taking the samples from inside. But the patients standing outside may get infected as the gloves hanging outside the glass cabin would need to be disinfected time and again,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).The officials during the inauguration had touted the facility as the first in UP and the first of its kind in the whole of National Capital Region(NCR). CMO Gupta said that a team of health department officials had also visited the booth to take note of the issues with the facility. During a spot visit by the HT team on March 8, the facility was found to be vacant.“For now, we have stopped the operation and no samples are being taken. A report will be sent to the district magistrate once the team finishes inspection. The cabin will be opened for sampling only when a standard operating procedure (SOP) has been defined. Till then it will remain closed. The idea behind installing the cabin was to protect the healthcare worker from getting infected and to also reduce the number of personal protection kits. However, we realised that the patients themselves were at the risk of getting contaminated from the gloves hanging outside the cabin,” Dr Gupta added.The officials said that the facility is not for general public, but only for patients who get a prescription from a government doctor for taking up Covid-19 sampling.Pallavi, the chairperson of Arambh Ek Pahal, told HT on March 8 that 31 samples were taken from patients on Tuesday. She, however, was not available for comments on Thursday. The initiative was taken up by chief development officer Asmita Lal. She, however, did not take calls on Wednesday and Thursday. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls either.“The operation has been stopped due to technical issues and we are holding discussion with officials who have come from Lucknow. Once they give a go-ahead, the facility will resume operation. The gloves will get sanitised after each sampling by one person who will stand outside the cabin. This will be done in order to avoid any chance of cross-contamination. This is the SOP,” said Shantanu Sharma, member of the NGO and technical head, looking after the facility.“The rubber we are using is completely safe and provides virus protection to person inside taking the samples. But how will it react for a person standing outside needs to be seen,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/newly-opened-sample-collection-booth-in-gzb-shuts-down-over-fears-of-cross-contamination/story-MVRrsOggObjeTp01zlNFqN.html

The officials said that the teams will visit each of the houses in the 13 hot spots and collect micro-level details.This activity is in addition to the ongoing containment activity in areas, from where cases of Covid-19 have been reported. Several teams comprising about 200 persons are already working as a part of the containment exercise.“Apart from the containment exercise, we have roped in about 500 teams, comprising three members each, for the 13 hot spot areas. They will visit about 50 houses per day in these areas, unlike 100 houses taken up by the containment teams. This surveillance will be more intensive. As a part of a prescribed format, the teams will note down replies about any resident having foreign history in past the 15 days. The teams will also note down details of any flu-like cases prevalent in family and the contacts of Covid-19 positive patients,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer(CMO). He added that the newly initiated surveillance activity and the ongoing containment activity will go on simultaneously.The surveillance teams will also make residents aware about the importance of hand washing and social distancing.“The team members are all trained. In their report, cases falling under the category of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) will be referred to the nearest government healthcare facility. This surveillance exercise will be more intensive than what is done by teams under the containment exercise,” Dr Gupta added.Under the containment exercise, which was initiated since Covid-19 cases started to emerge in Ghaziabad, the officials have so far catered to a population of about 5.46 lakh persons in the 13 identified hot spots.The teams are also involved in putting up stickers outside the homes of persons under home quarantine and also revisiting them, once the home isolation is complete.The newly formed surveillance teams will now revisit and intensify activities in 13 hot spot areas since the intensive lockdown was announced on April 8.As per official figures, the Ghaziabad district till the evening of April 9 has 25 Covid-19 positive cases, while three of them have already been discharged from hospitals.According to the officials of the state health department, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the state stood at 410 till the evening of April 9 and 221 of them were linked to Tablighi Jamaat. They added that 31 patients were discharged from hospitals while four deaths have taken so far in the state.“The chief minister has given directions on Thursday for a review of the door-step delivery measures and also of various quarantine facilities. He has also asked for an audit of the ventilator facilities. The hot spots have been identified in order to reduce the impact of Covid-19,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/500-teams-start-surveillance-drive-in-13-ghaziabad-hot-spots/story-aExX3ECXupGQiOK8AUO1BI.html

The Uttar Pradesh government, in an announcement made on Wednesday, had directed the complete sealing of 13 hot spots in Ghaziabad to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the district, which has so far witnessed 25 positive cases.“The shops inside and outside our society were shut on Tuesday night. Residents faced massive problems in getting milk and vegetables. The milk van finally arrived at around 4pm on Thursday. Even drinking water was scarce, especially for residents who buy bottled water from outside. No vendors were allowed in today. There is no clarity as to how the residents will get access to food,” said Mukesh Kumar, a resident of Oxy Homes Highrise near Tila Mor.The highrise, which is located behind Hindon airbase near Loni, has around 1,300 families and a population of around 6,000 living in it. The entire apartment complex was sealed after Wednesday’s orders as one of the residents was declared positive for Covid-19 by the district health department on April 8.“Both husband and wife work in a hospital and the man tested positive for the virus on Wednesday, while his wife and kids tested negative. While the man has been hospitalised, his family has been put in home quarantine. For essential food supplies, we tried to call up one officer deputed for our highrise. But he did not take calls. So we called up another officer at 9.30am and he told us to wait until they arranged supplies. Residents were not able to get vegetables till Thursday evening,” he added.The 13 hot spots sealed by the administration are Nandgram near mosque; KDP Grand Savana, Raj Nagar Extension; Savoir Park society, Mohan Nagar; B-77/G-5, Shalimar Garden Extension 2; Pasonda; Oxy Homez highrise, Bhopura; Vasundhara sector-2B; Sector-6, Vaishali; Girnar society, Kaushambi; Naipura, Loni; Masuri; Khatu Shyam Colony, Duhai and Covid-1 level hospital, Muradnagar.“Our highrise has been under lockdown since March 28 after a couple tested positive for the virus and 93 of their contacts from the society were identified. After the sealing of hot spots was announced on Wednesday, the entry/exit was further restricted and residents who returned late night from work were asked to stay outside. They were allowed in late at night after proper checks. Guards of our highrise were also not allowed to move out, but after intervention of senior officials they were allowed to leave,” said Sandeep Sharma, resident of Savior Park highrise at Mohan Nagar.According to health officials, the woman who tested positive in Savior Park is an employee of Noida-based company, Ceasefire. The highrise has around 800 flats, which is occupied by at least 2500 people.“At 8.30am on Thursday, the only shop in the highrise closed. Even the garbage and milk vans were not allowed to enter. The milk van guy went to the backside and handed over some packets to the residents. During the initial sealing on March 28, we had liberty to move out to fetch daily items. Now, that too has been completely banned,” he added.On late Wednesday night the district administration rolled out a list of all hotpspot with mobile numbers of different officers who were attached to look after the door step delivery of essentials for residents living there.One of the biggest hot spots is Masuri near NH-9, which is officially estimated to house a population of about 50,000 people living in 5,000 houses.“Our locality in Masuri was sealed last week after 10 people — who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz at Delhi’s Nizamuddin — were found to be living here. My son had also gone with the group and is presently lodged in a government quarantine centre. We are under home quarantine ever since and have not moved out. We have no milk, vegetables and are just surviving on ration left at home,” a resident of Nalipada locality in Masuri, said.Another hotspot that was identified is a highrise in Kaushambi where a doctor — who returned from France — tested positive for Covid-19. He later recovered and was discharged from a hospital in Delhi.“The residents in Kaushambi area better placed and are getting online delivery of food items. However, the administration should concentrate more in areas like Masuri, where people are poor and are not used to ordering groceries online,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments’ RWA (KARWA).District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to repeated calls and messages over the issue. Shalindera Singh, additional district magistrate (city), also did not take calls.City magistrate Shiv Prakash Shukl however responded and said that there may be some difficulties on Day 1but efforts were on to streamline the services.“The doorstep delivery will be in case we get calls from residents. Even RWAs have been asked to prepare list of bulk orders, which will be supplied. In the meantime we are also planning to set up stalls of vegetables and milk in hot spots from where residents can purchase whatever they need. In other areas, where people are not aware about online delivery, we have pasted lists of our contacts and they can call us,” he added.The district administration on Thursday evening rolled out another list in which service providers of milk, medicines and fruits/vegetables were assigned to each 13 hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-supply-of-essentials-drinking-water-scarce-say-gzb-residents-on-day-1-of-intensive-lockdown/story-0jKlCewQSVF5ru0yHUsocJ.html

The platform will also map Covid-19 cases across India, including hotspots, disseminate accurate information and rectify misinformation about the disease on social media. “We have already developed a system for natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. For Covid-19, we are ready with basic algorithms, but they need to be added to new data that is being generated on the disease,” said Pushpak Bhattacharya, director, IIT-Patna and principal investigator. Their work is an extension of a Ministry of Human Resource Development(MHRD) project the institute bagged in 2018 which involved creating a cross-lingual and multi-lingual event monitoring system in three domains – health, natural disasters and financial disasters - in Indian languages such as English, Hindi, Marathi, Bangla and Tamil.“We are now designing information extraction techniques to collect Covid-19 data on the number of infected, casualty, hotpots from social media tweets, newspapers or any written documents, and information such as symptoms, potential drug names and chemical compounds from existing scientific literature,” said Asif Ekbal, associate professor, department of computer science and engineering, IIT-Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/online-system-to-connect-policy-makers-with-locals/story-eM45zGwJch2xuFZ4IpOyAK.html

The society has had its social distancing measures in place since March 15.Parshavadeep co-operative housing society in Gundavli, with 80 residents, has enforced strict guidelines for social isolation as part of its efforts to contain the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. Residents who step out of their homes are monitored on closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. No outsiders, including help, vendors or even relatives, are allowed into the building. Daily groceries are delivered to the building’s main gate and one person from each floor goes down to collect these after each item is sanitised. Each floor has its own ‘shift’ to collect deliveries. Residents stay in touch using a common social media platform, and so far, not one resident has violated any guideline.“We had implemented these rules from March 15 itself, much before the national lockdown was announced. The idea is to protect each resident and ensure there is no inconvenience during this difficult period,” said Devang Ambavi, treasurer of the society. “Essentials including medicines to senior citizens have been provided regularly, and so far nobody over the age of 55 or anyone younger than 16 has needed to step outside.”Resident Avni Shah said, “To keep children engaged at home, residents are using a social media platform for community dance practice every other day.”While security staff has been provided residential facilities within the complex, residents have also developed a roster system to provide food and beverages to them daily. Since the lockdown was implemented, all common areas, including stairs, doors, parking spaces etc. in the society, are sanitised twice daily, using the sodium hypochlorite solution mandated by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-1-person-allowed-in-common-areas-of-andheri-society-at-a-time/story-Y3tQvCjKgrkl0eklULNTWL.html

09-04-2020||Lucknow||Replicate intensified lockdown in hotspots of 25 more districts: Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said the exercise of intensifying the lockdown by sealing hotspots in 15 districts should be replicated in the remaining 25 districts, where coronavirus positive cases have been found in Uttar Pradesh. However, the state government has not issued any written orders in this regard. Rather, district administration officials have been asked to take suitable steps at their own level.All hotspots in 15 districts were sealed on Wednesday/Thursday night till April 15 morning.Barring medical teams, sanitisation workers and those deployed for home delivery, no one is being allowed to move about in these areas.“We have identified hotspots in 15 districts where six or more coronavirus positive cases have been reported. The district administration there has been asked to allow only the teams of medical and health, sanitization and doorstep delivery. Now, 410 Corona positive cases have been reported in 40 districts. All these districts, where even one corona positive case has been found, should cordon off the hotspot and implement the restrictions,” the chief minister said. He was addressing district magistrates and district police chiefs in a video conference on Thursday.“No one should be under any doubt. We have to check the spread of the coronavirus. I have surveyed some areas and got some survey reports from 15 districts, where intensified lockdown was ordered on Wednesday. Officers have been found careless in some districts….This carelessness can be dangerous for you and people in your districts. You need to implement the restrictions in every district, where even a single case has been found,” the chief minister said.Earlier, while reviewing the situation, Adityanath asked officers to ramp up surveillance in hotspots by deploying a magistrate for each sector there. “Do not allow any movement other than those of medical, sanitisation, and home delivery teams,” he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his office. “Increase surveillance in the sealed areas,” he said.Among the 15 districts, Agra has 22 hotspots, Ghaziabad 13, Gautam Buddha Nagar 12, Kanpur 12, Varanasi 4, Shamli 4, Meerut 7, Bareilly 1, Bulandshahr 3, Basti 3, Firozabad 3, Saharanpur 4, Maharajganj 4, Sitapur 1 and Lucknow 12.Adityanath also said: “Establish contact with each quarantined person in the state, using the 1076 helpline and ask about their health and well-being.” Talking to top officers engaged in Covid-19 management, he also asked them to ensure that no one stepped out without a face-mask or face cover, and at the same time encourage people to download ‘Arogya’ app on their smartphones to help them keep safe from Covid-19.The chief minister also asked officers to do an audit of ventilators at government hospitals and medical colleges. “Get an audit of the ventilators done, keep them functional. Ensure availability of PPE (personal protection equipment) kit, infrared thermometers, isolation beds, quarantine beds, sanitisers, N-95 masks and triple-layer masks at these hospitals,” he said.The chief minister sought cleanliness drives in cities and villages. He asked for updates on the status of manufacturing of PPE kits, ventilators and masks in the state. Chief secretary RK Tiwari; infrastructure and industry development commissioner Alok Tandon, additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (Finance) Sanjeev Mittal and several other officers attended the meeting.Additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said the chief minister asked officials to prepare details of the population, as well as all the houses located in the 105 hotspots. Health and police teams would prepare a list of coronavirus positive and suspicious people residing in the hotspots, he said.The state government has called upon Tabligi Jamaat members to voluntarily come out of the houses in which they have taken shelter. People in whose houses the Jamaatis are staying should inform the administration, the senior bureaucrat said. The Tabligi Jammat members will be sent to quarantine centres, Awasthi said. The chief minister also directed the DGP and the home department to prepare a list of magistrates and policemen deployed in hotspots.

The villagers would list essential items required in the group and the officials would deliver them at their doorsteps. Six patrolling teams kept a strict vigil across the village round the clock. “We sanitised the 15 villagers three times and also provided chemicals to the villagers to sanitise their houses.

Here’s what goes on inside the containment zones of Arumbakkam, Purasawalkam, Santhome, Virugambakkam, Saidapet, West Mambalam, Porur, Alandur and Kotturpuram. 1.Mass surveillance: Nearly 2,500 houses in the containment clusters or those adjoining that of any Covid-19 positive individual are monitored for symptoms on a daily basis by Chennai Corporation’s workers, like anganwadi workers. If one is found with symptoms (dry cough, fever, difficulty breathing), a medical team is rushed to the spot and based on the person’s symptom type and clinical and contact history, a decision is made whether to isolate them at home or take them to the hospital. All health workers, including those newly recruited from self-help groups, carry identification cards on them at all times.2. Perimeter control: The containment clusters are pretty much sealed off. People can’t come in or go out; all essential supplies are door delivered.3. Passive Surveillance: According to Alby John Varghese, regional deputy commissioner (south), Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), there is constant communication through mobile public address systems on preventive measures inside containment zones.Medical camps too have been set up in the containment zones.4.Disinfection: Mass disinfection is carried out everyday in containment zones and clusters. 5.

09-04-2020||Chandigarh||PMGK Scheme: 70,000 poor families in Chandigarh to get food grains, pulses from this week||Nearly 70,000 financially challenged families in the city will get food grains and pulses delivered home from this week as part of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan (PMGK) scheme even as the UT administration started lifting stocks allocated to it by the Central government from Tuesday. Each family will get 15 kg wheat per head and 1 kg pulses per family per month, an additional 5 kg, as part of the scheme for which food quotas were doubled for April, May and June following the India-wide lockdown after the Covid-19 outbreak.Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said, “A list of families who are now getting direct ration money through direct bank transfer (DBT) scheme will get these wheat and pulses in addition to money.”About 156 families under Antyodaya (AAY) and 63,457 priority households (PHH) here get food grains and pulses every month. More than 2.75 lakh persons are likely to benefit from the scheme.For others, the administration will supply ration and food according to arrangements made during the curfew.Door-to-door deliveryIn Chandigarh the ration depots, traditionally used across the country for distribution of food grains to families under the public distribution system, were discontinued around five years ago. Instead, money was transferred directly to the bank accounts of the targeted beneficiaries.“We will ensure door-to-door delivery of food grains and pulses with the recently introduced delivery system in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Our sanitised vehicles and staff will carry a list of beneficiaries and deliver it to their homes. Food grains and pulses will be cleaned and packed in five kg packs to be distributed,” Parida said.To distribute the food stock the administration plans to use the door-to-door delivery system it put in place in the colonies and peripheral areas after the curfew.Delay in lifting food grains“The food grains and pulses were allotted four days back and we have started lifting these. To avoid delay due to the tendering process, we have given the job to National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation of India Ltd (NCCF). Unlike other states we do not have a network of fair price shops. We give ration money directly to banks and do not follow the usual PDS system as in the rest of the country. Hence while others may use existing infrastructure we have to create one,” Parida said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pmgk-scheme-70-000-poor-families-in-chandigarh-to-get-food-grains-pulses-from-this-week/story-EQpUHEb9U8g7at5shzwxBJ.html
09-04-2020||Mumbai||HC grants relief to law student rusticated for smoking cannabis on campus||In a relief to a first-year law student from a Vile Parle college who was rusticated in March for allegedly smoking cannabis in college campus, the Bombay high court (HC) has allowed her to appear for internal exams till regular court resumes post the Covid-19 lockdown. The court also stayed her rustication on the grounds that the college could not have based its decision to rusticate her on the basis of Instagram posts as the veracity of the posts were not confirmed.While hearing the student’s petition, the bench of justice Gautam Patel who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, was informed by advocate Mohit Bhardwaj that the college had taken an arbitrary and disproportionate action in the form of rustication on the basis of suspicion without giving her an opportunity to represent herself. Bhardwaj further submitted that the petitioner and another student were rusticated by the college last month and another 18 students were suspended temporarily. The action by the college, Bhardwaj argued, was unwarranted as it neither provided her any reason nor gave her an opportunity to defend herself.However, advocate Manorama Mohanty, representing the college -- Kirit P Mehta School of Law run by Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS), argued that even though the exact reason has not been specified in the response to the students’ plea, the college had relied upon some posts on a social media site which showed the students consuming prohibited material inside the campus. Mohanty submitted that the college had confronted the students with the same before the action was initiated against them, however, she was unable to place the photographs and documents before the court due to the lockdown.After hearing submissions, justice Patel observed that since the material pertaining to social media posts and other documents could not be accessed by the college at the moment, it cannot pass an order on merits of the plea and in the meantime, the petitioner should be granted ad-interim relief. He added that the relief would be active until further hearing takes place. The court also allowed a request made by student to appear for internal exams until further orders. Patel, however, warned that if the action by the college was justified the student would have to face the consequence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-grants-relief-to-law-student-rusticated-for-smoking-cannabis-on-campus/story-aQ98AMS6bJy530cO9QFeDI.html

Calling the move unfair to consumers, the agency said it was not right to allow advance bookings without making a decision on lifting the lockdown and working out the structure of the transition post the lockdown. It said the civil aviation ministry should allow bookings as and when lockdown is lifted. It also suggested that bookings should be allowed only on the sectors operated by Indian airlines during transition and not the entire network. Airlines declined to comment on CAPA’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/capa-urges-govt-to-review-decision-on-advance-bookings-for-domestic-flights/story-yiGxPB1cLf7MeVaOM1f9XK.html

His samples were sent for Covid-19 tests on April 7. On Wednesday he reported positive,” Dr Choudhary said.Among the three people who travelled with the principal, one has tested negative for Covid-19 and the results of the other two are awaited, he said.The man was kept in isolation at the Barmer government hospital on April 6; he was referred to the Jodhpur government hospital on Thursday early morning, Dr Choudhary said.The man travelled in a private vehicle from Jaipur via Jalore, raising questions how he travelled 700 kilometers and entered Barmer when district borders have been sealed during lockdown.Screening teams removed from check postBarmer health department has removed medical teams at Gandhav check post through which the corona-positive man entered in Barmer.Three medical teams were deployed at the checkpoint for screening of people entering Barmer.

In a circular issued recently, the DVET asked institutes to impart online education and report the details of the same to the regulatory body daily. The DVET has made online teaching content available on its learning management information system. The topics available are engineering drawing, employability skills and fitter, turner, among others. The regulatory body has also uploaded many video lectures on its YouTube channel. Meanwhile, DVET has asked managements and faculty of institutes to come up with innovative teaching techniques during the lockdown. Teachers have also been asked to conduct online classes, allot assignments, take online tests and complete assessment of students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vocational-education-institutes-to-give-two-hour-online-classes-to-students/story-YnjJ00sHj8Q1w4M16rsEZM.html
09-04-2020||Mumbai||HC refuses to interfere with BCI’s rules for legal education||The Bombay high court (HC) has refused to interfere with the legal education rules, framed by the Bar Council of India (BCI) in September 2008, which requires law colleges to obtain fresh approval every five years.The division bench of justice AS Chandurkar and justice Amit Borkar on Wednesday dismissed a petition filed by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Law College of Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University challenging clause 2(xxiv) of the rules which restricts validity of permanent approvals to five years. The law college moved the HC in 2018 after the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa stopped enrolling students who graduated from the law college on the grounds that the college’s approval had lapsed.The college then approached BCI seeking fresh approval but after BCI demanded ₹21.5 lakh for the same, the college decided to move the court.The college argued the 2008 rules were ultra vires which means it was beyond the rule-making power conferred by the BCI Act. The college also said the rules could not be applied to the college as it was established much before the introduction of the 2008 rules and in view of the fact that the college had been granted permanent approval in 1995 under the Legal Education Rules prevailing at the time.The bench, however, refused to accept the contention. It said BCI has been conferred necessary power to prescribe standards of legal education to be observed by universities for the purpose of discharging its function of promoting legal education and laying down standards of legal education.“This rule-making power would thus include power to modify existing rules with a view to maintain and improve standards of legal education in universities,” said the bench.The court added that the expression “standards of legal education to be observed by the universities” in Section 49(1)(d) of the BCI Act, 1961, does not envisage a one-time exercise to be undertaken by BCI or universities.“Maintaining standards of education cannot be confined to a time frame nor can legal education remain static,” the bench said while dismissing the petition, adding, “It has to evolve with the passage of time keeping pace with developments in legal fields across the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-interfere-with-bci-s-rules-for-legal-education/story-K0Tyhj2TTj8NWCLvn368EJ.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||At Delhi’s Covid-19 review, no answers to 2 crucial questions on Tablighi Jamaat||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Thursday led a review of the Covid-19 spread in national capital Delhi, the lockdown protocols and the ability of the administration to accommodate a large number of coronavirus patients in case of a spike in cases. In a statement issued later, Raj Nivas put out a statement outlining the status in concrete terms.What it did not reflect, officials said, were the two key concerns that were expressed at the meeting about the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at its headquarters, or Markaz, last month.“There were two questions to which there were no clear answers,” a senior government official told Hindustan Times after the meeting. One, if the authorities had been able to trace the last of the Tablighi Jamaat worker in Delhi who attended the congregation. “And two, have we been able to pinpoint all the clusters linked to the Jamaat”.Complete Coverage: Coronavirus OutbreakA second government official said there were no clear answers to these questions in a city where two-third of all Covid-19 cases have been traced back to the Jamaat. By last evening, the city had 669 Covid-19 positive cases. Of these, 426 cases had been linked to the Jamaat. There were 93 fresh cases last evening. All of them had been evacuated from the Markaz and located in quarantine facilities in north Delhi.This remains an area of concern, the second official said, pointing that the story of the family of three in south Delhi’s Defence Colony who tested positive reinforced this worry.It turns out that the private security guard of the locality had attended the congregation in Nizamuddin in March. He did not volunteer the information when the authorities appealed to people who had been to the Markaz to come forward. He was eventually located after the three tested positive to the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen and health officials started contact tracing.The police registered a case against the guard and sent him to a quarantine facility. “But there could be others, many others,” the second official mentioned above said.The police already have been trying to trace people who may have attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation using their mobile phones. But it is a painfully slow exercise.Also Read: How India performs on 6 steps to flatten coronavirus curveThe use of mobile phones to track people who violated orders to be in self-isolation has led the police to identify 23 violators so far. They have been charged under the penal code and sent to a state-run quarantine facility, the Raj Nivas statement said.In his presentation, the Delhi health secretary outlined the city administration’s medical preparedness considering possible scenarios.“The Health Department is implementing a containment strategy for all possible high risk zones.... ASHAs and ANMs (Auxiliary nurse midwife) have been trained, retired govt/private medical professionals are being engaged to augment human resources,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-delhi-s-covid-19-review-no-answers-to-2-crucial-questions-on-tablighi-jamaat/story-MBjV2AUzcFtnnH1UCzV5DL.html
09-04-2020||City||Covid lockdown: Areas in Bawana, Kirari send most distress calls to police||New Delhi: The city police have identified 10 areas in the national capital from where they received maximum number of calls complaining about unavailability of cooked food, ration and other essential items. Based on the number of calls received at their dedicated 24x7 Covid-19 helpline, 011-23469526, the police have categorised these 10 areas into “distress zones” and placed them on top priority so that quick action can be taken in case of a distress call. The police helpline has received 527 calls in total regarding “no food and no ration” between March 24 and April 7 in the ongoing lockdown period. The objective behind identifying the areas is to give maximum focus on people living in such areas and increase the number of volunteers involved in distribution of cooked food, ration and other essential items, said deputy commissioner of police (licensing) Asif Mohammad Ali, who is supervising the helpline. “The calls received from such areas are transferred to the police stations concerned and also to the organisations and individuals who are volunteering in distribution of food packets, ration and other essential items. Hundreds of people are supplying rice, flour, cooking oil, and other food items to our police stations to distribute among the needy. The idea is to ensure nobody sleeps hungry,” said Ali. An analysis of the 527 such calls received at the helpline shows that of the ten “distress zones”, four are in outer Delhi areas while two each in north and south Delhi. The other two places are in central and north-east Delhi. All these areas are inhabited by migrant workers and poor families, whose source of livelihood has been lost because of the 21-day lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the police said. According to the list of “distress zones”, accessed by HT, outer Delhi’s Prem Nagar in Kirari tops the list as 20 calls related to hunger and non-availability of ration have been received so far. It was followed by JJ Colony in Bawana from where 12 persons called the city police’s helpline, informing that they do not have food, money or ration. A total of 10 such calls have been received from Shastri Nagar while the police helpline got nine calls from Sant Nagar in Burari, eight calls from north-east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar, and seven calls from Swatantra Nagar in Narela, outer Delhi. The helpline received five calls each from south Delhi’s Meethapur and Madanpur Khadar. Four calls were received from outer Delhi’s Begampur while three calls for cooked food and ration have come from Rabhubarpura in central Delhi. The Delhi government said it will coordinate with the police to address the issues in the areas mentioned. “We already have 1,800 hunger relief centres. Many locations mentioned in the list do have such centres. We will alert our area officials to inspect and start more centres if needed. We will also create more awareness about our existing centres in these locations,” an official in the chief minister’s office said. According to DCP Ali, a majority of hunger and no-ration calls are made to the helpline between 8 am and 8 pm.

The Samajwadi Party president has won the Kannauj LS seat thrice--one bypolls and two general elections, while his wife Dimple Yadav has been Kannauj MP twice--one bypolls and one general election.

09-04-2020||Delhi||Migrants battle boredom and anxiety at Delhi’s shelter homes||“If the morning tea isn’t so watered down, life will be better,” Tuntun Kumar says, with a shy smile.Kumar has just had his lunch — two pooris, potato, rajma and rice. It was preceded by a breakfast of tea and bread pakora and will be followed by evening tea and biscuits, and a dinner of rice and dal. “The food is good, but the lunch timing of 1pm doesn’t suit us. We, masons, are used to eating by 10-11am,” his friend, Rakesh Kumar, quips in.The Kumars are among four masons who had walked 60 kilometres from Sonepat in Haryana to the Anand Vihar bus terminal on March 29 in the hope of getting to their hometowns in Bihar, before they were lodged at the Sarvodaya Co-education Secondary School in Patparganj.It is one of the 328 shelter homes set up by the Delhi government for accommodating migrants and the homeless during the lockdown. The shelters can accommodate 57,270 people in total and are occupied by 11,500 people currently, a senior government official said.The conversation, meanwhile, has woken up Sunder Mahto, a furniture loader in Kirti Nagar before the lockdown, who also failed in his attempt to get back to his home in Bihar’s Begusarai. He was sleeping in late as he couldn’t doze off at night. “There is such persistent buzzing of mosquitoes that it is as if they are trying to lift me from the bed,” says Mahto.The five men are among 153 migrants staying at the shelter, who are battling boredom, worrying about their families and repeatedly calling their employers in the hope of getting their dues.“If the lockdown isn’t lifted after April 14, we plan to leave and walk along the railway tracks till we get back home,” says Tuntun Kumar. He has only ₹1,600 in his pocket. “I call the contractor every day, but I know he is also in trouble,” he says.Government officials, however, said that if the lockdown is lifted, it is unlikely that they will be allowed to leave the shelter and return home on their own. “Lifting the ban doesn’t mean the spread of the virus is over. So, there will be a standard operating procedure in place for transporting them to their homes in sanitised buses, with adequate social distancing,” an official, on the condition of anonymity, said.While white circles painted on the ground help enforce social distancing when the migrants queue up for their meals, the concept of distancing goes for a toss inside the classrooms where they are staying. With a limited number of power outlets to charge their mobile phones, four to five men lie down on mattresses next to each other and watch a film together on a phone.The staffers at this shelter have had it easy with the migrants so far. “The civil defence volunteers have been able to enforce social distancing outside the rooms,” says Anil Kumar, the manager of the shelter.The situation is different a kilometre away, at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Ghazipur, where the volunteers, cooks and contractors are struggling to convince those housed there that the facilities are the best that they can provide in the circumstances.Ashok Kumar, who worked at a factory in Ghaziabad until the lockdown, got into a confrontation with the staffers on Wednesday morning because they insisted that each member of the family should queue up individually for meals. “My mother won’t let anyone leave the room. She is afraid we’ll all contract the disease if we all queue up for meals,” he says.Despite white circles to ensure social distancing under the watch of volunteers, Kumar’s mother remains defiant. “It is better I die than my children.”The management here has refused to concede to their demands. “It is not practically possible for one member of a family to collect food for all of them,” says Rajender Swaroop, the in-charge.Bipin Rai, a member of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which runs 238 shelters in the city, said the government is trying “every means” to provide a comfortable stay at these shelters.“Whenever there is a requirement of soaps and even shampoos, we are providing it to them. We have medical teams deployed at each school, which has been turned into a shelter. The teams check the body temperature of all occupants daily and also provide medicines for regular illnesses. So, we are trying our best to keep them happy and engaged,” he said.Some at the occupants have complained about the taste of food and alleged that stale food is served when they return for a second helping. “My children and I won’t eat your food anymore,” an angry Sunita, who stayed in Nangloi, where her husband used to work as a tailor, tells SK Gulati, the contractor at the Ghazipur shelter.She was also miffed that she and her husband were allowed to take food only in two plates despite informing that they have to feed three children. “We were told to collect food for our children in the two plates,” she says. A total of 23 people live in the classroom she is putting up at, but most of them prefer to stay close by joining cots.Swaroop says that while the supply of raw food materials is sufficient, it is not the same case with disposable plates. Earlier in the day, some women had allegedly attacked them because he had turned down their demand for new plates when they came for a second helping.Contractor Gulati, meanwhile, attempts to pacify Sunita. “Didn’t you like the rajma-rice we prepared? I personally supervised it and used branded spices,” he says, with a gesture that reveals deep bruises on his left arm.“I was beaten up by the police when I went to collect vegetables from the Ghazipur mandi,” he says.As there are 395 migrants at the shelter home, the management has started the token system to keep them in a queue. “When we serve bread pakora for breakfast, some people ate three to four, leaving none for others,” says Swaroop.Electricity connections were pulled out from tubelights to let the occupants here charge their phone. But that hasn’t stopped them from clustering. Some formed small circles to play cards, while others sat in small groups to chat.While these two shelters being run by the government provide the migrants four meals a day, only two meals, at 1pm and 7pm, are served at an NGO-run shelter in Sarai Kale Khan.Among the 50-odd migrants, who are sharing space with the 400 homeless people, who were staying since before the lockdown, is 28-year-old Mandu Tiwari, seated cross-legged under a tree, with a steel plate in front of him, awaiting his first meal of the day.But Tiwari is all smiles.He has taken a bath and has donned fresh clothes after almost a fortnight, as his belongings were stolen outside Nizamuddin Metro station, where he spent the first few days of the lockdown. “Someone at the shelter gave me his clothes,” he says.He had walked for three days from Rajasthan to Delhi in the hope of catching a train, but spent the initial days outside the Nizamuddin railway station until the NGO took him in. “I haven’t spoken to my family all these days. I don’t remember their phone numbers, as they were saved in the phone that got stolen,” he says, brushing aside questions about his prospects of retaining his job at an automobile parts factory.While ‘tehri’ (flavoured rice) and potato-brinjal vegetable are served to him and the dozens around him, a civil defence volunteer scolds a woman who has brought her children for the meal. “None of you are wearing masks. Didn’t I tell you to take food for your children?” Pawan Chauhan tells her.“The government must provide a projector and screen to educate these people about the severity of the threat,” Chauhan says.However, those an official of the NGO running this shelter says that it is getting difficult to provide two meals a day. “The money we receive is sufficient to serve just two meals. We will be in a tight situation if the lockdown continues,” says the official, who didn’t want to be named.Another government official, meanwhile, said that about 1,800 hunger relief centres are also providing lunch and dinner across Delhi to ensure people don’t go hungry. “We are feeding at least 1.2 million people every day,” the official says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/migrants-battle-boredom-and-anxiety-at-delhi-s-shelter-homes/story-QrxuEMYVgERUVlbWa8B8lI.html
09-04-2020||Lucknow||PTR, Dudhwa officials to keep watch on all big cat species||Officials at the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and Dudhwa National Park have swung into action to ensure compliance with a directive from the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change to ensure the well-being of both forest staff and wild animals.This directive was issued to the principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), UP, after a tiger tested positive for Covid-19 at the Bronx zoo in New York.“The order of the Central Government and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) would be strictly implemented,” said H Raja Mohan, field director, Pilibhit Tiger Reserve.He said forest officials will monitor all feline species, particularly tigers and leopards. Villagers across the forest belt too were asked to instantly inform the forest officials if they come across any tiger or leopard outside the forest, he said.The advisory issued by Dr Vaibhav C Mathur, assistant inspector general of the central government and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to all states, says that groups that rescue tigers and leopards should be vigilant. If any carnivore is found dead in the forest, then its samples must be collected and sent for tests.Foresters must undergo health check-ups to ensure that they are free of the infection before interacting with villagers living around the forests. The guidelines also require that villagers avoid routes that go through the forests.Pilibhit Tiger Reserve is home to around 65 tigers. Apart from the big cats, there are a variety of leopards. According to 2019-20 estimates, PTR has 25 leopards, 119 bears, 5800 deer species, 5400 nilgai (blue bull) and 320 vultures.Two prominent NGOs, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) that regularly provide support to foresters, have also been asked by the NTCA to adhere to the guidelines.“Except forest officials and support staff, with proper sanitization, no one will be allowed to enter the forest area,” said deputy director Dudhwa, Anil Patel.He said camera traps would be used to monitor the condition of carnivores.The NTCA guidelines mandate close observation of wild animals having respiratory complications, including nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing or laboured breathing, he said.Even in case of natural death of a wild animal, its samples must be sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) Bareilly for analysis, he added.If any carnivore exhibits symptoms of Covid-19, then it will be provided treatment. A committee of wildlife veterinarians along with range officers and forest guards will be formed to regularly monitor the condition of carnivores.“We have prepared a quarantine ward for the animals in the zoo on the instructions of our director, RK Singh. In case any animal shows any symptoms of Covid-19, it will be kept in quarantine and its samples will be sent for testing. All the staff will be properly sanitised before entering the zoo and all will have to wear masks, gloves and disposable apron while feeding animals. Even the vehicles used for transporting food will be regularly sanitized with sodium hypochlorite solution. Our director has ensured that we have sufficient PPEs at the zoo,” said Dr Brijendra Yadav, veterinarian, Lucknow zoological garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ptr-dudhwa-officials-to-keep-watch-on-all-big-cat-species/story-CqPS6FsLE8DEeR1Qvepi5I.html

Our team has been working hard to ensure we supply healthy and nutritious food to the needy in these tough times, while maintaining high standards of cleanliness and systems.How does your day begin and roll out? Since I am a follower of Iskcon Mandir, my day begins at 4 am by chanting the names of Shri Krishna for one-and-half hours and Shri Radha Krishna deity worship followed by 45 minutes of walking. Alongside, I am in contact with my kitchen team since their operations begin at 4.30am. I begin contacting vegetable suppliers by 6.30 am to ensure timely availability of vegetables for my kitchen team.Later during the day, a visit to the kitchen in Pimpri and to various areas in which we are distributing meals follows. I try and meet all our volunteers to inspire and thank them for serving in these tough circumstances and to ensure they are following precautions.Also, I spend some time reading Ramayan, Bhagwad Gita and Bhagwat Puran in order to retain some positivity and calm after being involved in this tense situation the whole day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-frontline-rising-cost-of-essentials-to-feed-the-poor-is-a-concern-says-sanjay-bhosale-director-annamrita-foundation/story-whd9OiqR6IZKphWlklG0sL.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Bengali Market becomes first Covid-19 containment zone in Lutyens’ Delhi||The popular Bengali Market has become the first Covid-19 containment zone in Lutyens’ Delhi. It is among 23 such places identified by the Delhi government across the city. The upscale neighbourhood made its way to the list after a surveillance team of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) found 35 workers of a famous pastry shop living under “unhygienic conditions” violating social-distancing norms. Two workers who had fever-like symptoms (common in Covid-19 patients) will undergo tests.The surveillance was conducted after three persons were found positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from the neighbourhood. The exact location is not immediately known. The team, which comprised officials of the district administration and the NDMC, screened 325 houses, two markets and about 2,000 people in the Bengali Market and Mandi House area. Bengali Market, which was founded in 1930, has now been sealed by the police, who have blocked all entry and exit points. According to an order issued by New Delhi district magistrate Tanvi Garg, the adjoining areas of Todarmal Road, Babar Lane and School Lane have also been blocked for any kind of movement or congregation.The order asked for action against the bakery shop where workers were living in “highly unhygienic conditions” and social distancing was not being followed.Now, residents in the neighbourhood are not allowed to step outside even to buy essentials, which will be home-delivered to them.“Bengali Market area has been sealed. Strict legal action will be taken against people who violate guidelines issued for the hard lockdown. A list of phone numbers has been made public. You can order essential items on the phone. It will be delivered at your doorstep,” a police official said.DM Garg directed the NDMC to “immediately sanitise” the entire area under containment plan to “prevent” further spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bengali-market-becomes-first-covid-19-containment-zone-in-lutyens-delhi/story-g3JFABxlAS1VYGZvkrr4CM.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||17 policemen quarantined in Punjab’s Ludhiana after thief tests positive for Covid-19||LUDHIANA: Seventeen policemen were placed under quarantine in Ludhiana on Thursday, two days after a thief they arrested tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The station house officer (SHO) of the local Focal Point police station was among those quarantined after the vehicle thief, Saurav Sehgal, 25, was caught and produced in a court on April 5.

09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Sangrur nurse murder: Accused could face capital punishment||Maninder Singh, 31, who was arrested on January 14 from a news channel studio in Chandigarh while confessing on live television to have murdered a Sangrur nurse at a hotel in the Industrial Area around the New Year eve, could face capital punishment as Chandigarh Police have charged him with Section 303 (punishment for murder by life convict) of the Indian Penal Code in the 2,000-page challan filed in court on Wednesday.Initially, police had booked him under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It has also been retained besides other sections of cheating and forgery.Before murdering Sarbjeet Kaur, 27, Maninder had killed another woman, with whom he had a relationship as well, in Karnal in 2010, and was awarded life sentence in 2012. Section 303 of the IPC states that “when a murder convict sentenced to life imprisonment commits another murder, he can be punished with death”. Maninder was currently out on bail after he filed a review petition against the Karnal court ruling in the Punjab and Haryana high court.The investigating officer, sub-inspector Sarita Roy, in the chargesheet has described how on January 1, 2020, Sarbjeet was found murdered in a hotel room, with her throat slit. Sarbjeet, who had previously worked in a private hospital in Mohali, had checked into the hotel room along with Maninder on December 30. He had left the premises the same evening.Maninder had studied till Class 12 at Government Senior Secondary School in Sector 27. He used to work as a driver at a factory in the Industrial Area, till about three months before the crime, and had visited the same hotel along with Sarbjeet a number of times.After committing the crime, Maninder had been on the move — staying in Bathinda, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur, Patiala, Sangrur and Jalandhar — to avoid being traced. His Hyundai i20 car, which was abandoned in Patiala, was recovered two days before he surfaced.PREMEDITATEDAccording to the chargesheet, the murder was premedidated and did not happen in the spur of the moment after a heated argument in the hotel room, , as claimed by the accused.To corroborate their claim, police have attached the video footage of Maninder buying a knife from Big Bazaar in Zirakpur on December 13. The same knife was used to kill Sarbjeet, it is claimed.Police have given two reasons behind the murder. First, Sarbjeet was gradually stepping back from her promise to marry Maninder.Second, Sarbjeet had given ₹6 lakh to Maninder in September 2019 to make arrangements for their runaway wedding. Maninder had spent it on a car and clothes for himself, and feared Sarbjeet might demand the money back if they parted ways.EVIDENCE ATTACHED“I killed her because she was having an affair with her sister-in-law’s brother,” Maninder had said during his interview to the Punjabi news channel.Police have also attached the footage from the news channel office, though its forensic report to establish veracity is awaited. Likewise, reports of biological evidence, including hair samples and viscera of the deceased, are awaited as the work has been suspended amid the Covid-19 lockdown. Maninder had duped Sarbjeet into coming to Chandigarh by creating a fake email ID of “PGI Recruitment Cell” and writing her on December 24 that she had been selected for a job at the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bathinda, and has to join training at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) from December 26.Believing the email to be genuine, Sarbjeet’s brother and sister-in-law dropped her at thePGIMER on December 26, from where Maninder picked her up.Police have attached the PGIMER’s response, denying that any such results were declared. In all, 50 witnesses have been named in the chargesheet and around 100 statements have been attached.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sangrur-nurse-murder-accused-could-face-capital-punishment/story-iw95ILiBdAokOM5cFOxe0I.html

09-04-2020||Delhi||FAQ: Your 14 queries on 23 Delhi containment zones answered||At least 23 areas in Delhi have been declared containment zones and put under a hard lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Here’s a primer on what to expect in these areas.What does this mean?If the area where you stay is part of a containment zone, it means that you are not allowed to step outside your house.There is a nationwide lockdown anyway…Yes, but it does not ban anyone from stepping out to buy vegetables, grocery items, medicines and other essentials.Then how to get essential supplies?Do not panic. The local administration has tied up with Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and market associations to provide door-to-door supply of essential items. Areas where such associations are not active, civic volunteers will be roped in.Will any shop stay open?Nothing, including banks, will be open. Even if you need medicines, it is to be delivered to you.Who is allowed to enter or leave a containment zone?No one other than officials of the local administration, police, health officials and municipality workers. Serious medical cases will be exempt, but after due verification. Entry and exit of every person, including those from enforcement agencies, will be registered in the records. Media will not be allowed to enter these places, but journalists and others involved in essential services staying in these areas will be allowed to go their workplaces. But they have to undergo screening for Covid-19 symptoms each time they enter or exit a containment zone.How long will it continue in Delhi?The containment plans will stay in place “till the potential threat of Covid-19 is not ruled out” in these areas.How do I know if my house falls in a containment zone?The local administration has issued a list of these areas. Additionally, it is informing residents using public address systems. If your house falls in a containment zone, all entry and exit points in that area have been cordoned off or sealed by now. And still, if you step out unknowingly, you will be stopped by the police and informed about the lockdown.What do I expect during this time?There could be multiple screening by health officials, police and civic bodies. People living in containment zones are put under surveillance to track if any person has developed the symptoms of Covid-19 (fever, sore throat ,etc.).How large is a containment area?It can be as small as one lane in a residential colony or it can be a wider area comprising an entire ward or more. The size of a containment zone is directly proportional to the population density of the cluster in question and the scale of the outbreak.My area has been declared a containment zone. Does it mean I live in a Covid-19 hot spot?Not necessarily. While all hot spots are turned into containment zones, all containment zones are not always hot spots. Some lanes and neighbourhoods can be declared containment zones even if there is a single case of Covid-19. A hot spot is an area where multiple cases emerge from a locality (Examples: Nizamuddin Markaz and Nand Nagri).What is the difference between a hot spot and a containment zone?A hot spot is a potential threat area identified by authorities after multiple cases emerge from that place. Following this, a containment strategy is devised to prevent further spread of the infection and to break the transmission chain. Under this strategy, a containment zone is declared. A containment strategy is also adopted when contact tracing of a Covid-19 positive case is unsuccessful (that means when authorities are not able to find the clear source of infection --- travel history or contact with a positive case --- of a patient). What about cleanliness in a containment zone?Sanitizing the area declared under the containment plan is a top priority for the local municipal corporation. It disinfects every nook and corner of the declared area multiple times a day.What happens if one violates the rules?The person may be warned at the first instance. But violators can be booked under various sections of Disaster Management Act, 2005, as well as the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and provisions of the Indian Penal Code. The punishment can be jail sentence up to two years and/or a fine decided by the enforcing agencies.Which are the 23 containment zones in Delhi?1. Entire affected street near Gandhi Park, Malviya Nagar, New Delhi2. Entire affected street of Gali No 6 , L 1 Sangam Vihar, New Delhi3. Shahajahanabad society, plot no 1, Sector 11, Dwarka4.

09-04-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka to finalise lockdown exit strategy by April 13||The Karnataka government is currently engaged in discussions with experts, specialists and other stakeholders to decide on its lockdown exit strategy and would take a final view by April 13, a key Minister said on Thursday. “Day after tomorrow we have a VC (videoconference) with the Prime Minister,” Medical Education Minister Sudhakar K, who is in-charge of all matters related to COVID-19, noted when asked about the States strategy. He said a task force of specialist doctors on Wednesday submitted its report to the government, giving its recommendations. “We are meeting lot of stakeholders of the society taking their views,” the Minister said, adding, the Cabinet would also hold discussions. “Finally, day after tomorrow, after discussing with the Prime Minister during the VC, the government will take a view on this by April 13 or so. As of now, we have not taken any view on it. We are studying all the reports,” Sudhakar told PTI. The Minister observed that the COVID-19 cases were slowly spiking in India but not multiplying the way they have in some other countries like Italy, Spain and the United States as the government had declared 21-day national lockdown early and taken other strict measures. “Let’s see for one week and see.” “We need to fight this out collectively and by strictly following the quarantine methods and social distancing,” Sudhakar stressed. The Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had on Wednesday said his government was in favour of lifting lock-down in districts which remained free from COVID-19 after April 14 subject to approval from the Centre. “If the Prime Minister suggests to States to take decision (on lock-down) based on the situation in their respective States, my position is to take a call (on roll- back) in districts free from COVID-19,” he had said. “This is to allow people to go about their business and move about within the district and not from one district to another, after April 14, after taking the approval of the Prime Minister.” According to State officials, as many as 12 districts continue to remain free from COVID-19. The task force has recommended continuation of lockdown at “hot spots” beyond April 14. It has suggested that schools and colleges be shut till May 31, while non-air-conditioned shops can be opened. Also, IT/BT companies, government offices providing essential services and factories can function with 50 per cent staff, the task force said in its recommendations for 15-day period after April 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-to-finalise-lockdown-exit-strategy-by-april-13/story-KMB1cAO3MaANG0v4KnNHEJ.html

09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus: Punjab CM holds discussions with party MLAs, opposition leaders||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday held consultations over the coronavirus outbreak with party MLAs and senior leaders of opposition parties, seeking suggestions to ensure the gradual return to normalcy. Describing the COVID-19 situation as developing one, the CM told them that though the country was doing better than many advanced countries, one could not afford to be complacent.  A government release said the chief minister held separate discussions over the phone with former Punjab CM and Shiromani Akali Dal patron Parkash Singh Badal, AAP’s Harpal Singh Cheema, CPI’s Hardev Singh Arshi and rebel Akali leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. Earlier, he held a video conference with the Congress MLAs, led by party chief Sunil Jakhar, the government release said. All Congress leaders extended their support to the state government in its fight against COVID-19 and broadly agreed with the government line of action in tackling the problem. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader favoured the distribution of more food packets through the government machinery in the state, the release said. The chief minister also assured the opposition leaders of all possible help from his government. The Punjab Congress gave the complete authority to the chief minister to take any decision he deemed fit to deal with the situation. The chief minister said steps will be taken keeping in view the interest of people, who also wanted stern measures to tackle the unprecedented crisis. The CM, while sharing the latest status on COVID-19, said there has been a sudden spike of cases in Punjab due to the Tabligh-e- Jamaat incident of Delhi’s Nizamuddin, from where 573 people had come to the state. Of these all but 38 have been traced,he said. In response to a concern expressed by Congress MLA Fateh Bajwa on the “vilification” of NRIs, the CM appealed to the NRIs not to be scared but to come forward and disclose their travel history, assuring them they will not be harassed. The party will fully support the government in any decision taken on this issue in the days ahead, said Jakhar. Responding to queries by certain MLAs, the CM said the state was fully geared to handle the upcoming harvesting and procurement season, with nearly 3,800 mandis being set up. He, however, expressed concern that the Centre is yet to approve the incentive suggested by the state government for farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-punjab-cm-holds-discussions-with-party-mlas-oppn-leaders/story-cD8pdk9clbHNqwyXvsjvoN.html

09-04-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi traced: Report||The Delhi Police has traced Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi, who has been on the run after an FIR was registered against him for organising a religious gathering last month despite restrictions to combat the coronavirus, sources said on Wednesday. The cleric has been traced to Zakir Nagar in southeast Delhi, sources said. His lawyer Tauseef Khan, however, said Saad is under self-quarantine and will join investigation after his quarantine period is over. On March 31, Delhi Police’s Crime Branch lodged an FIR against seven people, including the cleric, on a complaint by Station House Officer Nizamuddin for holding the congregation here allegedly in violation of the orders against large gathering and not maintaining social distancing to contain the spread of coronavirus. A day later, the Delhi Police’s Crime Branch wrote to Saad and others, seeking the details under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A second notice was also issued to him this week. “Saad is currently under self-quarantine and will join investigation once the period of 14 days gets over,” his advocate, Tauseef Khan, told PTI. Saad’s quarantine is expected to end next week. His lawyer said a reply to the second notice will be given soon. In an audio message last week, Saad said he was exercising self-quarantine after several hundreds who visited the Tablighi Jamaat’s Nizamudddin markaz tested positive for coronavirus. Visited by thousands last month, the Nizamudddin centre also turned out to be a hotspot for spread of coronavirus not only in national capital and country. According to the FIR, the Delhi Police contacted the centre on March 21 and reminded them of the government order that prohibited any political or religious gathering of more than 50 people. However, no one paid any heed to the police’s direction, it said. Moreover, an audio recording purportedly of Saad was found in circulation on WhatsApp on March 21, in which he was heard asking his followers to defy the lockdown and social distancing and to attend the religious gathering of the Markaz. On March 24, the government ordered 21-day nationwide lockdown and restricted any social, political or religious gathering. The same day a meeting was held at Hazarat Nizamuddin police station between SHO and officer bearers of the centre. The meeting was attended by Saad, Mohammad Ashraf, Mohammad Salman, Yunus, Mursaleen Saifi, Jishan and Mufti Shehzad and they were informed about lockdown orders. So far, several hundred cases of COVID-19 cases across the country have been found to be linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held in Delhi last month. More than 25,500 Tablighi members and their contacts have been quarantined in the country after the Centre and the state governments conducted a “mega operation” to identify them. At least 9,000 people participated in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin. Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tablighi-jamaat-leader-maulana-saad-kandhalvi-traced-report/story-gtJqwONAUNCltfclnJTdgI.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 lockdown: Ration distribution to card applicants starts||The Delhi government on Wednesday started distributing additional ration to thousands of poor families in the city, who are yet to get ration cards, under a scheme to ensure delivery of essential food items to households, amid the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown.“Wheat and rice for distribution among people not covered under the public distribution system of essential items were delivered in around 400 school buildings across the city on Tuesday. The beneficiaries would be able to avail of five kilograms of ration,” said Delhi’s food minister, Imran Hussain.Under the scheme announced by CM Arvind Kejriwal on April 1, beneficiaries have to apply online, following which a token, mentioning the centre and time of visit, is issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-lockdown-ration-distribution-to-card-applicants-starts/story-sXu9gkgsgADgKAkZxwSieM.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: RWAs demand micro data, area-wise break-up of cases||As the number of Covid-19 patients rise in the Capital, residents want the Delhi government to release area-wise or district-wise data of positive cases promptly and clearly, with several resident welfare associations (RWAs) saying the lack of information about the status in their localities is making people anxious and panicky.The Delhi government only releases consolidated data about the total number of positive cases in the city once a day -- usually around 9pm. It gives a break-up number of confirmed cases admitted in hospitals, those in quarantine facilities (both at home and in government-managed), those who have recovered, and the deceased. But it does not provide district-wise numbers from its 11 revenue districts.With nearly 600 cases reported in Delhi, members of RWAs across the city stress on the need for area-specific information. “We recently got to know that two people tested positive in a housing society in sector 11. We have no information regarding the total number of cases in Dwarka,” said Rejimon CK, founder and member of Dwarka Forum (an association of over 300 RWAs in Dwarka).Ever since the national lockdown has announced on March 24, city RWAs have been playing proactive roles in ensuring its implementation in their localities with the help of government agencies.“The government wants people to cooperate as we have to fight this together. Then why are they reluctant in sharing information with people? If we know area-wise information, people will be more cautious. The government should create a dashboard giving daily update to citizens about new cases and areas from where they are reported,” Rejimon said.For instance, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in Mumbai puts out a ward-wise heat map of Covid-19 cases on a daily basis in the public domain. The Maharashtra government also gives the district-wise break-up of Covid-19 cases in the state.In Bengaluru, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) shares zone-wise data of Covid-19 cases, apart from age and gender data of Covid-19 patients in the city.Atul Goyal, president of URJA, an association of RWAs in Delhi, said the Delhi administration needs to be more proactive.“When other cities can, why can’t the Delhi government share district-wise data? We are not asking for names, but if we know the number of cases in our localities, or neighbouring localities, the RWAs can take necessary measures to protect the area. People, too, will be careful why moving in areas from where a large number of cases have been reported.”In the absence of district and locality data in Delhi, residents say that they don’t know whom to contact to get the details about their neighbourhoods, and the uncertainty fuels rumours, with leads to unnecessary panic.“In Delhi, we don’t know whom to contact for information regarding Covid-19. The government officials are impossible to get through on phones and we know nothing about the cases in our areas. This lack of information exchange from the government’s side will lead to rumours and trust deficit. What’s the need for secrecy? Uncertainty over cases in neighbour areas leads to anxiety, Boothwise planning is needed & RWAs can help. As and when lockdown is lifted, information about high-risk zones or areas will help people take necessary precautions. It will also help the government,” said Rajiv Kakria, member of GK-1 RWA.With Dilshad Garden in east Delhi declared as one of the two hot spots in Delhi – there also seven containment zones -- residents of east Delhi say that there is fear among people.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWAs Joint Front, said, “There is panic in the locality if an ambulance is spotted. Lack of information only leads to fake or incorrect news. Today, we don’t know how many cases have been reported in my district.”The flip side to the argument, however, are privacy concerns, and worries that patients may be ostracised.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital said that transparency in data of Covid-19 cases will help people, while pointing put that the government must ensure at the same time that it doesn’t lead to victimisation of those who have tested positive.“Transparency is important, as people can be better prepared. It is a policy decision which the government has to take. While giving the data, the government can ensure it is disseminated in a manner that it doesn’t result in direct victimisation,” Dr Kishore said.While the Delhi government on Wednesday announced a list of 20 containment zones in the city, it didn’t give information about the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in each area. According to a senior Delhi government official, the number varies from two to eight.Despite repeated attempts, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain and other health officials did not respond to queries seeking comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-rwas-demand-micro-data-area-wise-break-up-of-cases/story-spxE3rNWLfdn7hpjjoWTdI.html
09-04-2020||Patna||542 arrested, ₹2.67 crore penalty collected from lockdown violators||In the two weeks since the nationwide lockdown came into force to curb the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, the police have arrested 542 people and seized 11,205 vehicles for violations in the state. Besides, ₹ 2.67 crore by way of penalty has also been realised from lockdown violators under the amended Motor Vehicle Act. The police said they have registered 723 FIRs across the state for such violations.To enforce the lockdown, superintendents of police in areas like Gaya, Saran, Supaul, Bhagalpur, Buxar have also used drones to monitor activities of people.Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra said, “The compliance level of the lockdown order has been satisfactory.” In Saran, the police used the drones in busiest areas to keep a tab on violators. “We used the drone in the morning and we caught several people moving on the roads. They were warned by the police asking them to stay at home,” said Bhagalpur SSP Ashish Bharti.“We started using drones to strictly enforce the lockdown and ensure social distancing even when people come out to buy the essential commodities,” said the Bhagalpur SSP.POLICE RESORT TO LATHICHARGEMeanwhile, a police team Wednesday resorted to lathi-charge at several places in Patna to stop people from flouting the lockdown order. Throughout the day, police carried out spot checks of areas known for drawing crowd like grocery shops and vegetable markets.Authorities confiscated dozens of private vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, that were found to be in violation of the mandated curfew and fined many people. The police set road blockades in many areas, including Kankarbagh, Gardanibagh, Patrakar Nagar, Gandhi Maidan, Dak Bungalow Crossing, Boring Road, Bailey Road, SK Puri, and Ashok Rajpath. Police stopped nearly 250 motorists and collected fines from them before allowing them to leave with a stern warning.The worst case of defiance of social distancing rule was witnessed in Sheikhpura where hundreds of people came out of their homes for food and other essential items.When people refused to follow the police order to return home, authorities used light force to disperse the crowd. Similar reports also came in from other areas, including Raja Bazaar, Phulwarisharif, Boring Road, Danapur, Patna City and Kankarbagh where people had gathered in large numbers. ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said, the lockdown provides for taking action against violators under the National Disaster Management Act and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, police claim that those venturing out of their homes for fetching essential items like food or medicines are not facing any action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/542-arrested-2-67-crore-penalty-collected-from-lockdown-violators/story-QjSZbXm8EjeegqR5Do7cXL.html
09-04-2020||Patna||Want paracetamol, cough syrup? Leave your mobile number with chemist||PATNADrug stores in Patna, Bhojpur and Kishanganj have been asked to prepare a database, with name and mobile number of people buying drugs for fever, common cold and cough, said officials.This was being done in an effort to track down people having symptoms of novel coronavirus (Covid-19), but reluctant to turn up at government facilities for screening, the officials said.In an effort to broaden surveillance, state health authorities had also requested private doctors, including homeopathy practitioners, to report about patients coming to their facilities with influenza-like symptoms.Among the drugs the government is keeping a tab on are paracetamol, antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection, anti-allergy, cough syrup and bronchodilators, all associated with symptoms of Covid-19, said officials of the drug control administration.“We have issued advisory, requesting drug retailers to note down name and mobile numbers of people buying anti-fever, cough and anti-cold drugs,” said Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi.“We have also advised them to check, as far as possible, prescription of registered medical practitioner before dispensing such drugs. The idea is to ensure that even people who are less symptomatic to Covid-19 are not left out of screening,” he said.Bhojpur and Kishanganj are other districts which have advised their respective drug control administration to register name and contact details of those taking medicines for flu-like symptoms.“With the help of private doctors and druggists, we are trying to prepare a database on people with influenza-like symptoms so that they can be tracked for screening, if needed,” said Bhojpur district magistrate Roshan Kushwaha.“It is always better to have a database and not use it rather than not having one at all and ask for it when a crisis arises, he said.Bihar’s principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar said the advisories were district-specific and had not been extended across the state as of now.There are around 2,500 drug retail stores in Patna and 1,000 (approx) in Bhojpur.Covid-19 cases in BiharCases: 38 Siwan:10 casesMunger 7Patna: 5Gaya: 5Gopalganj: 3Begusarai: 3Balanda: 2Saran: 1Lakhisarai:1 Bhagalpur: 1||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/want-paracetamol-cough-syrup-leave-your-cell-no-with-druggist/story-GoZYYcg2yI0wvxAaCw6d5L.html

09-04-2020||Ranchi||Extend lockdown: Doctors to CM Soren||The doctors, working in both government and private sectors, Wednesday requested chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren to extend the lockdown and implement strict enforcement of social distancing for containment of Covid-19 virus, besides procuring medical kits and strengthening the health infrastructure.They also drew the CM’s attention towards increased prices of essential medicines and protective gears and urged the government to stop black marketing. “During a recently held meeting, the doctors suggested that the lockdown period in the state be extended,” the press statement read. “There is a possibility of quick spread of the virus if the lockdown ends. Social distancing is the best safety measure. We have to give our best effort given our limited resources,” the doctors stated. The suggestions were made at the meeting of the doctors and private hospital owners convened by the state government to find best possible ways to tackle Covid-19.The meeting was crucial before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conferencing with all chief ministers on April 11.The CM while briefing the doctors said that the state government will apprise the Union government of the suggestions discussed.He said his government is doing good on social security while admitting that Jharkhand lags behind in health services.The chief minister said the state still has less number of Covid-19 patients but the matter should not be taken complacently. He said, “The Coronavirus has given us time, we should gear up and prepare ourself for the coming days.”He sought cooperation from the medical fraternity and asked the doctors to suggest more measures to the government.Hemant said that the impact of lockdown is visible while expressing concern over the lacklustre attitude of people in the urban pockets.He said several hundreds of people are stranded outside Jharkhand and it will be a real challenge when they return after the lockdown is lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/extend-lockdown-doctors-to-cm-soren/story-M71GEH8ULtozsfJ8uAhJ1O.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19: 3 of a family in Defence Colony test positive||Three members of a family in Defence Colony, whose private security guard had attended the congregation at the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Nizamuddin in March, have been found Sars-Cov-2 positive. The police have registered an FIR against the guard for withholding the information from his employers, deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said. “The family lived on the ground floor of a building. They have been admitted to a private hospital. Other members of the family and those living on other floors of the building have been asked to remain in home quarantine,” the DCP said. Another senior police officer said the guard continued to work despite having Covid-19 symptoms. He said during the contact tracing of the affected family, it was found that their security guard had attended the Tablighi meeting at Markaz. The police found the guard at his home in Okhla. “The local SDM was informed and the guard has been sent to a quarantine centre for screening and testing,” the DCP added. Ranjit Singh, president of the Defence Colony residents’ welfare association said, “Some members of the family had recently travelled abroad. I have not been able to speak to them....After the matter came to light, the SDMC has not satisfactorily disinfected the area. The family’s residence has been disinfected but what about the rest of colony?”.The police, however, said that all family members were tested after they returned from abroad more than a month ago. “Their reports were negative. Also, the notice, which reads ‘home quarantine’ was not pasted outside their residence,” the officer said.In a separate case, the police in Dwarka registered an FIR after two bottles filled with liquid, which looked like urine, were found on the premises of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) flats in Dwarka, which have been turned into quarantine centres. Also, a man who had attended the congregation was booked for misbehaving with staff at Bakkarwala quarantine facility in outer Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-3-of-a-family-in-defence-colony-test-positive/story-8n0wblyrECpcEQdtJfhdaM.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus: Chandigarh admn gives ₹50L life cover to frontline health workers||Health workers involved in handling the Covid-19 crisis in the city have been given a life insurance cover of ₹50 lakh, in case of loss of life due to the infection, the UT administration has announced. In March, after the Centre announced a ₹50 lakh insurance package for workers at the frontline of the epidemic, the UT administration had taken up the case for its own workers.On Wednesday, Chandigarh finance secretary Ajoy Kumar Sinha, in a daily review meeting, chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, said requisite arrangements to pay the insurance sum had been put in place. The procedure for claiming the sum has also been established and shared with the health department.Even private sector healthcare workers in the current crisis have been covered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). The UT administration is also working on introducing a similar compensation for personnel of police and sanitation department.Badnore also expressed his concern over the spurt in coronavirus cases in Dera Bassi. He advised officers to strictly take measures to prevent its spread in Chandigarh by tracing people who might have come in contact with those patients and quarantining them. The Mohali deputy commissioner was also advised to remain in touch with his Chandigarh counterpart and start joint containment operations.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said extra care is being taken to ensure visitors from outside do not spread the infection in Chandigarh. Pvt schools can announce summer holidays: DEODistrict education officer Alka Mehta on Wednesday said city schools can declare the lockdown period as summer vacations. In a letter written to the secretary of the Independent Schools Association (ISA) on April 6, Mehta said the schedules of summer and winter vacations were finalised by private schools at their own level. Therefore, schools had the liberty of declaring these holidays as summer breaks as per the Right to Education Act, CBSE and MHRD guidelines. The move comes after the Chandigarh ISA sought directions from the education department on the matter on March 30. The body has 77 schools, with over 50,000 students, as members. There is no clarity on a similar decision for government schools, said sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-chandigarh-admn-gives-50l-life-cover-to-frontline-health-workers/story-QX1RKQqQMGtw4dJibAXLAJ.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC traces 245 contacts of 18 coronavirus patients||The contact tracing team of the municipal corporation has completed the task of tracking all those who came in contact with the 18 Covid-19 positive patients of Chandigarh, seven of whom have recovered. The count is 245 and they all are under home-quarantine.A total of 1,446 people were put under home-quarantine, of which 245 had come in contact with positive patients; 163 people attended or came in contact with persons who attended the Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area; and 103 had attended a kirtan function in Sector 27 by Bhai Nirmal Singh Khalsa, who died of Covid-19.So far, 900 persons have completed their home-quarantine period.Chandigarh had reported its first positive case on March 18 — a 23-year-old woman from Sector 21 with foreign travel history. She had come in contact with 60 people before she was admitted to an isolation ward, hence, all 60 were put under home quarantine.Five people, including her mother, brother, cook and two friends, contracted the infection from her in Chandigarh, besides one in Mohali and a salon worker in Panchkula, the district’s first case. The only other positive case so far in Panchkula is a nurse who attended to the salon worker at the local civil hospital.The 23-year-old has since recovered and was discharged on April 6.The highest number of contacts were traced back to a 22-year-old man from Sector 30, who had returned from Dubai and tested positive. He came in contact with 130 people and ended up infecting three — his mother and two friends.Another positive case, an NRI man from Sector 33, came in contact with 29 people and infected three, including his mother, wife and a 10-month-old daughter. His wife’s mother also tested positive in Mohali. Similarly, a man from Sector 35 came in contact with 15 others before he tested positive.After that, a nursing officer at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education And Research, came in contact with two persons, while a doctor from Sector 49 came in contact with six others before testing positive. They were all home-quarantined.An MC official requesting anonymity said, “This does not mean that our work of contact tracing is over. Now, the focus is on the list released by the central government and other updates regarding persons returning from other high-risk cities or states.”NOW, APP TO MONITOR PEOPLE IN ISOLATIONThe municipal corporation has started monitoring people who are quarantined at home through a mobile application.The app makes it mandatory for the person in isolation to update their medical condition on a daily basis. In the last two days, all those under home quarantine downloaded the app. An official involved in the process said it was a far better way to keep tabs on those in quarantine instead of keeping in touch through phone.The total number of persons in home quarantine has crossed over 1,000, making it hard for authorities to keep a daily track of their health, especially when UT has extended the quarantine period for those in isolation. Even those who have served a quarantine period elsewhere are being put under another 14-day isolation term upon reaching Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-traces-245-contacts-of-18-coronavirus-patients/story-YD8pkxz8XuJ7pMi0zV1IAP.html
09-04-2020||City||Dera Bassi count surges to 21, Mohali’s to 36||Ten new Covid-19 positive cases were reported from Jawaharpur village of Dera Bassi in Mohali district on Wednesday, taking the district count to 36, highest in Punjab as well as the tricity.Since a 42-year-old year panch of the village tested positive on April 4, 20 more people —14 part of his extended family — have tested positive for the infection.Over the past few days, 118 samples were collected from the village to check for community spread, and 10 samples tested positive on Wednesday. Four of them are from the panch’s family. As many as 80 samples were negative and results of 28 samples are awaited.Situated on the Ambala-Chandigarh highway, Jawaharpur village has a population of 3,000.With the village becoming the new disease hotspot, the district administration has sealed it and the neighbouring Devigarh and Mehmudpur villages, deploying 75 cops with three PCR vehicles to ensure no movement.Those testing positive from the panch’s family include a 53-year-old panch of the village, a 56-year-old man, who is the sarpanch’s paternal uncle, and two other cousins of the 42-year-old panch. The other six patients include an employee of the public health department in Chandigarh and another runs a shop in the village. They all either came in contact with the panch or the sarpanch, who had tested positive on Tuesday.“None of the 21 patients has travel history. Most of them were asymptomatic and detected only though testing,” said Girish Dayalan, the Mohali deputy commissioner.He said some Tablighi Jamaat members had stayed in the village, but left before anyone could get information about them. “We suspect that the panch came in contact with his factory workers, who had met the Tablighi Jamaat members, which led to spread of the virus,” the DC said, adding that so far they had traced 138 contacts of the 36 positive patients in Mohali district, which will help in containing the spread of the virus.After the 42-year-old panch tested positive on April 4, his father (67), brother (38) and wife (43) were confirmed to have contracted the infection on April 6. A day later, his mother (61), brother’s wife (35), and her children, aged 16 and 12, also tested positive. The village head (sarpanch), aged 39, her husband (43), who is the panch’s cousin, and their daughter (19) were also confirmed positive on Tuesday.All 21 patients are admitted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur.“The village has been totally sealed. No one is allowed to move out. Our effort is to contain the cases in the village itself. Further sampling of all family members of those testing positive will be done,” said Manjit Singh, civil surgeon, Mohali.INFECTION’S SOURCE STILL A MYSTERYAuthorities are still trying to track down the source that brought the infection to Jawaharpur village. “We are working to ascertain the source, which is still not clear,” said Dera Bassi sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Kuldeep Bawa.The panch owns a tent house and a tile factory, and had come in contact with eight labourers, who had further met attendees of Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz event in Delhi. However, none of these contacts is positive. He also frequently travelled to Delhi for supplies for his tent house. “We are tracing his travel history using mobile phone locations and call details,” said Harmandeep Singh Hans, superintendent of police (investigations), Mohali.HELPDESKS SET UPAs three villages have been sealed in Dera Bassi, a helpdesk has been set up in each village to assist villagers. “The villagers will call the helpdesk, and we will provide whatever they need at their doorstep. No one will be allowed to move out,” said SDM Bawa. The villages are home to a large number of migrant workers, who will be provided food by the administration. Announcements have been made from local gurdwaras and temples directing people to stay indoors.NO FRESH CASE IN CHANDIGARH, PANCHKULANo fresh Covid-19 case was reported in Chandigarh for the sixth consecutive day on Wednesday while in Panchkula, too, no new case surfaced for eighth day in a row.However, reports of seven suspect cases are awaited in Chandigarh.In Panchkula, even as all 50 people who had attended Tablighi Jamaat events have tested negative in the past two days, the health department on Wednesday confirmed 65 more such persons have been admitted to the isolation ward of the civil hospital and their samples have been collected for testing. These people were put up in quarantine facilities at the Nada Sahib gurdwara and a village in Raipur Rani last week. Reports of 12 other suspect cases are also awaited.Meanwhile, the PGIMER, Chandigarh, while appreciating the UT administration’s decision to make masks mandatory in public places, cautioned that there is no need to wear N95 masks by the general public as these are required by healthcare workers screening patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dera-bassi-count-surges-to-21-mohali-s-to-36/story-Sq5PP62jhAIAs1kkHI41TN.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus: Chandigarh admn taking no chances, contingency plan on the anvil||The UT administration is preparing a crisis management plan in case the number of positive Covid-19 cases surges in the city.As per the proposed plan that factors in Chandigarh’s estimated population of 12 lakh, a contingency protocol is being laid down which has to be followed by different authorities including the health department. A three-level facility for housing the patients is being worked out. Covid care centres are proposed to be established for people with mild symptoms. Hotel Parkview, Panchayat Bhawan, and other community bhawans are likely to house such centres. Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, will house the Covid health centre for positive cases with moderate symptoms. Covid-exclusive facility for severe positive cases will be created at the Post Graduate Institute Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and the civil hospital in Sector 48.UT home-cum-health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta along with medical experts is preparing the plan on the directions of Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in view of surge in number of COVID-19 cases across the country in the past one week. While no fresh positive case of coronavirus has been reported in the city in the past six days, a senior UT official privy to the development, said that the plan will be put in place to deal with any worst-case scenario as the cases are surging across the country.“Though the situation in Chandigarh remains far better than other parts of the country, we do not want to take any chances. The key focus in the plan would be requirement of ventilators, medical equipment and experts, accommodation and other protocols to be followed,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-chandigarh-admn-taking-no-chances-contingency-plan-on-the-anvil/story-eQPebdexmg2sEwldstXNCM.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Stuck at home, Chandigarh cricketer Rajni focuses on fitness||The Covid-19 enforced lockdown came at a time when Chandigarh’s U-23 and senior women teams were gearing up for the One Day cricket tournament quarter-finals, respectively. Leg-spinner Rajni Devi, who had scalped 18 and 15 wickets in the U-23 and senior women One Day tournament leagues stages (Plate Group), was raring to shine for Chandigarh in the knockouts as well. An experienced bowler, who has played seven seasons for Punjab, it was 21-year-old’s debut outing for Chandigarh. “Although, I played seven seasons for Punjab, I never got so many matches to play. Chandigarh getting BCCI affiliation came as a fresh lease of life for cricketers like me who were struggling to find chances when with the Punjab U-23 and senior teams. And just see, players like Amanjot Kaur, Kashvee Gautam, Nandani Sharma and Monika Pandey all have blossomed while playing for Chandigarh. All of us were usually warming the benches in previous seasons for Punjab,” felt Rajni, who comes from a humble background. For someone, who received a state award from UT Administration for leading Chandigarh team to maiden national school games U-19 cricket title back in 2015, cricket has been a way of life since she joined the academy at GMSSS, Sector 26, a decade ago. She played for Punjab U-19, U-23 and senior teams in the previous seasons.Her main weapon for wickets turned to be ‘googly’ on which she worked on under coach Khyati Gulani before the start of the season. Rajni, who idolises India leg-spinner Poonam Yadav, said that a seasoned coach like Khyati helped her raise her game. “The camps conducted by UT Cricket Association this season brought a different learning curve to my game. I could learn so much from Khyati ma’am and had time to incorporate her inputs. She made a personal connect with all players and encouraged. If you have a coach who backs you and is ready to make you learn all the time then a player does well and improves season by season,” added Rajni, who is a resident of Bapu Dham colony, Rajni lost her father over a decade ago and had to depend all through on her two brothers meager income, who sell snacks on a ‘rehri’ in Sector 19 market in Chandigarh.The cricket academy at GMSSS, Sector 26, brought hope for Rajni and her life took a turn for good like a few others. “Cricket has brought a meaning to my life. I want to make my life worthy and train harder to reach the top. It was good to win all Plate Group league matches in the U-23 and senior One Day Tournaments. Next season, we will get to play in the Elite Group. I will start to train in the off-season for the next season. Doing well against the teams in the Elite Group will help me garner attention from the national selectors,” said Rajni, who wants to work on her batting for the next season and is nowadays working on her fitness at home. She also sends her videos to coach Khyati to keep her updated.Heaping praise on Rajni, coach Khyati Gulani said, “She has the hunger to do well in challenging situations. You give the ball to her when the opposition are dominating, she will get you a breakthrough. She is a superb fielder and gives 100 percent on the field. More specialized camps and practice matches will help Rajni become a better cricketer. Cricket all around the year will help players like Rajni reach the next level. She needs to do strength training and work on her batting.” Rajni hit two consecutive boundaries to help Chandigarh record a win over formidable Pondicherry in the Plate Group league game in the One Day tournament for senior women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stuck-at-home-chandigarh-cricketer-rajni-focuses-on-fitness/story-GaRDFkvU7jCB6a3USWkXRI.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||With uncoordinated rationing, Chandigarh’s poor sleep hungry||My family is starving, cries an eight months pregnant Sona, who lives at Kacchi Colony in Dhanas. “I have four children at home but the administration provided food for just one. I don’t have any ration at home. How will I feed my children with just a small bowl of dal and four chapatis that they gave?” laments Sona with an empty plate in her hand.Similar is the story of Chandravati who had gone to a queue set up in the neighbouring street for ration distribution. “The workers kicked me out saying that I have already taken food. I have six people at home, and no money or ration, and they just give me a handful of rice and a katori of dal and expect me to feed them. I will have to stand in line again,” said Chandravati. Sona and Chandravati are among the many residents of Kacchi Colony who have failed to get ration and supplies to keep themselves sustained amid the lockdown. The only source of food for them is the community food being given twice a day by various NGOs and the administration, who are also struggling to reach out to the real needy.Hoarders an issueSumit Jain, a volunteer who distributes food in Motor Colony of Manimajra, said, “Initially we used to pack the food in packets. Some people used to take multiple packets depending upon their family size, but we are not sure if that reached the beneficiaries or was it just for hoarding. Now we have asked them to get their own utensils to get the food in. I also have around 100 packets of ration with me, but we are not distributing them all as many people have hoarded them.”Jain added that some people are getting ration twice or thrice. “Some areas are flooded with ration, so now we are distributing it with the help of police officials as they are aware of the needy,” he said.Vivek Mehra, another volunteer for ration distribution, said, “Many people with an intention of having more food call us up multiple times, despite already being given ration. The administration should intervene and coordinate with NGOs for better working so that the doubling of the ration can be avoided.”Sub divisional magistrate (SDM, central) Nazuk Kumar, the nodal officer for ration distribution, said, “It’s our responsibility to ensure that everyone gets food. We give food to everyone who stands in line. However, we don’t have any means to know how many family members a particular beneficiary has.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-uneven-rationing-chandigarh-s-poor-sleep-hungry/story-c3xvu6WF2SvJIYopf5D6fM.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh issues advisory amid surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine||Following a surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the UT health administration has issued an advisory regarding its use.The health administration has assured that there is no shortage of the drug in the market or in government-run pharmacies. But the advisory has also stated that the drug is not recommended for prevention of coronavirus infection.HCQ is used to prevent and treat malaria. Other uses include treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus (an inflammatory disease caused when the immune system attacks its own tissues).“Three days back, we received 1 lakh tablets to be used by frontline health workers only. Residents are advised not to take it without medical consultation,” said UT health secretary Arun Gupta.India is the biggest manufacturer of HCQ, a derivative of antimalarial drug chloroquine. The drug is being aggressively sought by US President Donald Trump for treatment of Covid-19 (the disease caused by coronavirus). However, experts have said there is not enough proof of the same.The advisory states that if at all it has any role, it is in Covid-19 patients where it may enhance the response of supportive treatment. For that, too, there is not sufficient evidence, the advisory states.The general secretary of Chandigarh Chemist Association, Vinay Jain, said on an average 10-15 people were calling up and visiting every single store to buy this medicine.“We are educating people that there is no proof to suggest HCQ can prevent Covid-19. There is no shortage (of the medicine), but we are not selling it without prescription. With the drug making news, people have started coming to shops and asking for the medicine without prescription. When we inquire about the need, they say the drug will cure Covid-19, which is not the case,” Jain said.He added that those complaining of a shortage were the ones turned down for not having a prescription.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-issues-advisory-amid-surge-in-demand-for-hydroxychloroquine/story-SOtMfrGVPoXJE8HB0k4pGJ.html
09-04-2020||India||1,135 cases in Maharashtra within a month; where did state go wrong?||Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 117 more cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), taking the number of infected people in India’s worst-hit state to 1,135. The state crossed the 1,000-case mark in 30 days, from March 9 to April 7, with a 5.98% mortality rate, more than twice the country’s rate of 2.66%. The past five days accounted for 56.8% (645) of the state’s cases. Maharashtra’s capital, Mumbai, is the worst-affected city in India with 714 cases, which is 62.9% of the state’s total. At 45 deaths, Mumbai recorded 62.5% of the state’s toll of 72, including eight deaths on Wednesday.Doctors and medical experts attribute these figures to “porous and faulty” policies of the state health department, including “delayed” universal screening of passengers from abroad and “inadequate” testing — one test per 4,208 citizens – in Maharashtra.On March 9, Maharashtra reported its first case of Covid-19 when a couple from Pune, who had travelled to Dubai, tested positive for Sars-Cov-2, which is the virus that causes Covid-19. The next day, three more people in the city who had come in contact with the couple tested positive. All five of them were admitted to Naidu Hospital in Pune. On March 11, two people in Mumbai who were co-passengers of the Pune couple tested positive, making them the financial capital’s first cases. All these people were part of a 40-member tourist group that returned to Mumbai from Dubai on March 1. They were not screened at the Mumbai international airport as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was not in the list of 12 countries for compulsory screening at airports to find any infected patients. This is despite the World Health Organization (WHO) already declaring an “outbreak” of coronavirus. According to the Airport Health Organisation (AHO), universal screening of passengers started from March 17. “In Maharashtra, more than 40% of the infections were owing to travellers who returned from the UAE. Even though Maharashtra’s first case was of a Dubai returnee, the state government waited for 10 days to start screening travellers from the UAE. This was a major loophole in the screening process,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra. If the government didn’t have adequate kits to run tests on thousands of travellers, they should have quarantined them for 14 days, said doctors.Dr Bharat Purandare, infectious diseases expert, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Pune, said, “In retrospect, we can say that the government should have made universal screening of all passengers mandatory much earlier. Also, we should have stopped international flights in the first week of March.”“The outbreak of the infection was reported in China in the last week of December. Despite this, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) didn’t make arrangements to quarantine international travellers until they started the SevenHills Hospital facility on March 18. Mumbai has one of the biggest international airports, so the government should have kept a more diligent eye on travellers,” added Dr Bhondwe.Doctors have also blamed the state’s testing policy for the spread of the infection, pointing to the example of a 43-year-old Covid-19 patient with no travel history or close contact with an infected person. She is undergoing treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Fortis Hospital, along with her son. On March 19, when she developed symptoms, she contacted the civic-run Kasturba Hospital for a test. But the hospital refused as she was not a high-risk patient. On March 27, she was diagnosed with the disease through a test conducted in a private laboratory, but it was too late as her son and mother were already exposed to the virus because of the delay in diagnosis.Similarly, there are several other patients with no international travel history or close contact with infected people, but owing to the “rigid testing policy of the state government”, many were refused the test, which further spread the infection, said doctors.Maharashtra has a population of 11.50 crore, but only 27,090 tests have been conducted till Wednesday night — which is one test per 4,208 citizens.Experts said this is inadequate as the number of asymptomatic patients in the state has increased to 76%, according to the state health department.“A freely accessible testing policy through both private and public-sector clinics, which is available on demand and with assured privacy of results, should be the first national priority to identify and quarantine asymptomatic patients. This is likely to increase the numbers of Covid-19 patients, but is essential to determine the extent of the spread in order to contain it,” said Dr Ramen Goel, president, Indian Association of Gastrointestinal Endosurgeons (IAGES). Another lapse that has recently come to light is the lack of appropriate standard operating process (SOPs) in private hospitals to diagnose asymptomatic patients. More than 60 medical staffers have been infected with the virus after unknowingly getting exposed to Covid-19 patients. Nursing associations have criticised the government for not providing adequate training to them in handling coronavirus patients. Along with that, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) has turned into a big hurdle in treating Covid-19 patients. A doctor from King Edward Memorial (KEM), Parel, said they aren’t given proper PPE to screen or treat patients. “We are using protective kits for HIV while treating Covid-19 patients in ICU or isolation wards,” said the doctor, on condition of anonymity.Dr Manohar Kamath, general secretary of Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI), said, “In China, due to the same mismanagement, more than 3,000 medical staffers got infected. In this situation, we need more medicos. We can’t afford to get front-liners infected. The government should have planned about the procurement process earlier, considering the size of the state.”During the beginning of the outbreak, the state health department stated that surgical masks were enough for medical staffers in hospital setups. But soon, as doctors started contracting the infection from asymptomatic patients despite wearing surgical masks, the health department on Wednesday has made it mandatory for everyone who steps out to wear masks. “This is a new strain of coronavirus, so medical knowledge about the virus is very limited, but health officials should have taken notes of the mistakes done in China. We have done several things wrong, which led to the spread,” said a senior epidemiologist, on condition of anonymity. Some doctors are suggesting bringing in the Army, like in the United Kingdom (UK), to streamline healthcare supply logistics. “In addition to immediate policy action, the Indian Army, too, can be asked to step in for the protection of healthcare facilities. Without our soldiers — both literal and proverbial — India’s ability to reduce the fatalities of this war could be severely crippled,” said Dr Goel.Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare) and director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra said, “The screening of passengers at the airport comes under the Central government and we just followed their guidelines. Maharashtra has done the highest number of tests so far in the country, so it’s unfair to say that we haven’t done adequate testing. We are setting up thousands of makeshift shelters for high-risk people to break the chain of transmission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-135-cases-within-a-month-where-did-state-go-wrong/story-2VltIRZSF2tPIXZ5EEB8PN.html
09-04-2020||Mumbai||Is Maharashtra in stage three of outbreak? Govt says not yet||Has Maharashtra moved on to the dreaded stage three (community transmission) of the coronavirus outbreak, which means the source of the infection cannot be traced? While the state government maintained that Maharashtra is still in stage two, where disease transmission is limited to those with travel history to affected countries or those in contact with the infected person, experts feel that the next few days are crucial, against the backdrop of the infection’s steep upward curve in the past eight days. From April 1 to April 8, the state has recorded 833 cases and 62 deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), 73.39% and 86.11% of the state’s tally and toll respectively. Nearly 11% of them have no source of infection established, which has prompted the phase three question.State public health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the state is yet to enter stage three. The minister also said that although the numbers are increasing, they are not multiplying. On Wednesday, Maharashtra recorded 117 more patients and eight deaths, taking the tally to 1,135 and toll to 72. Of the eight deaths, five are in Mumbai, two in Pune and one in Kalyan-Dombivli. Two of the victims are above 60 years of age, while the remaining six were between the ages of 44 and 59. As of Wednesday, Mumbai has 714 patients, the highest in the country, followed by Pune at 166. A total of 25 patients are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat programme organised in Nizamuddin in New Delhi last month and which has emerged as the largest hotspot of cases in the country. Of them, eight are in Latur, six in Buldhana and two each in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Ahmednagar.Most of the state’s cases are from densely populated areas, such as Dharavi, Worli Koliwada in Mumbai and Gultekdi, Market Yard in Pune, where maintaining social distancing has become a herculean task. The state government is now worried if its machinery falls short in containing the spread in the slums.Tope, however, said that they have been able to trace index cases in positive cases from these areas. “If we have reached stage three (community spread) or not will be decided by the World Health Organisation(WHO). Daily data is sent to WHO through the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Based on the data we have collected, we have not reached stage three,” Tope said.Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said the picture will be clearer early next week. “Yes, we have 10% of cases without contact history, but that does not mean we have reached the third stage. Sometimes, the patients are not able to trace their contact links, leading to difficulty in establishing the contact. We are hopeful that we do not slip into the third phase as the timely lockdown in the state has worked. We are way better than other countries like Spain, United States of America (US), United Kingdom (UK) and can easily say that community spread has not started yet,” he added.Dr Om Srivastav, infectious diseases specialist, said that the data can establish if we have reached stage three. “To prove if the virus is present in the community and it’s leading to the community transmission, aggressive testing is required. Only then can we contain the spread in the hotspot. If the government is claiming that we are still in phase two, based on data, we will have to believe it. As far as the current spike is concerned, there is nothing surprising and it is as per the trend witnessed in other countries,” he said.The state government has now intensified its strategy by monitoring the hot spots at a micro level. “We are targeting at least 5,000 people around every positive case in the densely populated area and then treat them accordingly. We have also putting more restrictions in these areas to ensure that there is no rapid spread. In some areas, ‘curfew’ has been imposed by restricting movements for even essential services. The rapid testing being introduced will help in establishing the vulnerability to the Covid-19 infection and the portable clinics started in Mumbai will help us identify more cases,” said an official from Mantralaya.Tope, too, attributed the high mortality rate in Maharashtra to comorbidities in Covid-19 victims. The mortality rate in the state is 6%, which is more than double the country’s fatality rate. “The Covid-19 deaths are in a higher percentage in old patients with comorbidities,” he said.The official said that though the number of tests conducted in Maharashra is highest among all states, non-availability of kits is another reason the labs are not running to their full capacity. He said that portable testing centres and the rapid testing facility will, however, help in screening more suspected cases. “Still we are not in phase three, which sees the multiplication of cases on a day-to-day basis. Here we are witnessing a rise of just 10% or so. It is true that the mortality rate is high, but it’s because of a delay in admissions and comorbidity among patients,” he said.Tope said the health department has categorised hospitals and patients will be admitted in these hospitals, depending on the severity of the case. The health department has marked five hospitals where asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 cases will be treated. The severe and critical cases will be treated at four dedicated hospitals, where specialist doctors to tackle comorbidities in patients will also be stationed.“Asymptomatic patients or those who show mild symptoms will be admitted at Sushruta Hospital, Bombay Hospital, Poddar hospital, Lilavati Hospital and Sai Hospital. Severe and critical cases will be admitted to SevenHills hospital, Kasturba hospital, Nanavati hospital, and Saifee Hospital. All these hospitals will have tertiary care to treat people with other issues. The idea is to try and lower the mortality rate,” Tope said.Tope said the lockdown should be strictly followed in Dharavi, which has seen 13 cases and two deaths. He said that he has instructed the police and officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to take all necessary care to reduce crowding and maintain social distancing in the area.“It is a matter of concern as Dharavi is a densely populated area…I have visited Dharavi yesterday. I have informed the home department, local DCP, and Praveen Pardeshi that social distancing should be followed strictly in Dharavi. The crowding in public toilets should be avoided to curb the spread of infection. I do not think there is any need for a lockdown today. Whatever lockdown is there, should be implemented properly in Dharavi,” he said.“We are monitoring how the number of cases are increasing in districts. We are also looking at the advisories of the Centre. Based on that, we can decide to relax lockdown in areas where there are no cases. However, the process to lift the lockdown has to be scientific and a protocol has to be followed,” he added.The state health department, in conjunction with the Indian Medical Association, is also planning to start “rakshak” clinics at taluka level and “mobile clinics” in urban areas.The minister said that the Centre did a flip-flop on the clearance for commencing rapid testing or antibody tests. “The Centre once said yes for the testing, later said not to do it. Now again it has given its clearance. One thing is that the rapid tests cannot give 100% result on coronavirus cases. We cannot rely on it completely. We are awaiting kits, once they provide it. we can start it in Mumbai and Pune,” he said. He added that the state has sought a time frame from the Centre to procure personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N95 masks and ventilator. Tope said that if there is going to be a delay, the state government will ask manufactures in Maharashtra to increase its capacity and provide these types of equipment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/is-maharashtra-in-stage-three-of-outbreak-govt-says-not-yet/story-gUMYNj7NIDIYBlvAI5TiaO.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Rendered jobless due to lockdown, they are working at shelter homes; feeding the needy||Sitting next to a pile of bottle gourd, 25-year-old Vishal is busy peeling the vegetable. It is 2.30pm and he has just two hours to finish the pre-cooking preparations, including dicing 30 kg of the vegetable for the next meal which will be served at 7pm at a shelter home in south-east Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan.Vishal, who used to work at a bookstall in the Nizamuddin railway station, says he does not know how to make food. But in the last two weeks, he has picked up some basic skills while helping a team of cooks at the Delhi government-run shelter home.“Everything changed after the janta curfew (March 22),” said Vishal, who hails from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, and worked at the bookstall for three years, earning Rs 8,000 per month.“I had shifted here a few months ago to save money, but now I don’t know if I’ll get my job back or not as the bookstall owner has also suffered huge losses due to the lockdown,” he said. Vishal says he has a younger brother, who is in class 11, and a grandmother back home to support.But the shelter home has given him hope. “I’m told that I’ll get some money. It might not be as much as I used to earn earlier, but it will be enough to survive this period,” he said.Besides Vishal, there is a team of eight-nine people, most of them rendered jobless due to the lockdown, who have taken charge of providing meals to hundreds of needy at the shelter home.It was Santosh, a cook at a roadside eatery at the CGO (central government office) complex who lost his job due to health concerns a few months ago, who got the team together. The 46-year-old manages the open-to-sky kitchen at the shelter home. Every day they cook for nearly 600 people.A few kilometres away at another shelter home in Yamuna Pushta, 42-year-old Ram Lakhan says he does not have free time anymore as most of his day is spent in the preparation of the two meals a day that he and six-seven others prepare for almost 3,500 people.Lakhan, who hails from Itah in Uttar Pradesh and used to work with a catering service as a cook, says he is one of the lucky ones who, despite losing their jobs, are able to earn some money. close to Rs 700-800 per day by working at the shelter home. He has found work with Safe Approach, the NGO which runs the government shelter home.“Though I’m not able to earn as much as I used to a few weeks back, something is better than nothing,” said Lakhan.Safe Approach director Santosh, who runs the 51 Delhi government shelter homes, said he has hired people from the shelter homes to cook meals as the workload increased manifold post the lock down. “The workload is too much now. These people were hired as we have known them since sometime and can trust them with food preparations,” said Santosh. Bhanu Singh (33), a mechanic by profession and a resident of Morena in Madhya Pradesh, had come to Noida on March 20 for an interview at a factory. He was told to join from March 29. While the first few days after his arrival he stayed at the factory, he didn’t have a place to stay after the lockdown was announced on March 25 and couldn’t go back home also.“I did not know anyone in Noida, so I called a friend who lives at this shelter home. He asked me to come. I walked a few kilometres and somehow reached here,” said Singh, who now helps in cooking and serving food to people at the Sarai Kale Khan shelter.Rajesh Kumar, executive director of Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses, who runs close to 62 shelter homes in Delhi, said: “Initially after the lockdown was announced, we had a lot of mouths to feed as migrant labourers had queued up at our shelter homes. It was difficult to manage the rush with our old staff strength. Then, some of these people, who knew how to cook, volunteered. They are a huge help to us.”Working at the shelter home, all of them say, has helped them sail through a tough period when hundreds are struggling for even one square meal a day.Vishal, who has studied until class 8, says he hopes to go back to selling books at the railway station when all this is over. “I started working at the bookstall as I love reading. I just pray that the lockdown is not extended and things go back to normal. Thankfully, I don’t have to worry about food… We thought the lockdown was for a day. Had I known that it would get extended, I would have brought some books with me,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rendered-jobless-due-to-lockdown-they-are-working-at-shelter-homes-feeding-the-needy/story-opt0j0LQ1SJhsZBrF5qpgJ.html

The decision was taken after the city witnessed high temperatures in recent days.According to the police, several checkpoints were set up across the city after the authorities announced a complete lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and officials were posted there for round-the-clock duty.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said that the tents were provided to the officials under the supervision of police commissioner Mohammed Akil. “As the temperature is soaring, we do not want our officials to stand under the sun while keeping vigil. Hence, it was decided to set up tents at the checkpoints across the city. Our officials are working hard to maintain law and order amid the lockdown and asking people to not leave their homes,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-lockdown-gurugram-police-officials-at-checkpoints-get-tents-as-day-temperature-rises/story-s1sb0yaWVT1GAJ8aLOr7FJ.html
09-04-2020||Gurugram||Haryana announces Rs10,000 rebate on fixed power charge for industries||The Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) issued a notification on Wednesday announcing flat rebate of ₹10,000 in fixed electricity charges for industrial consumers for the months of March and April. However, industry owners’ association said this was too little to make any difference and that they had demanded complete waiver of the fixed charges from March to May. The relief package was announced in view of the economic slowdown brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak and after the Haryana government received numerous representations from industry owners and their associations recently. “After receiving representations from industry owners it has been decided by the Haryana government (through the Haryana electricity regulatory commission) that the fixed charges of consumers having load 20 KW and above for the month of March and April shall be waived off subject to a ceiling of ₹10,000 per month provided the monthly consumption of the consumer is 50% or less,” the notification said. Fixed charge is an additional, but major component of the electricity bill that the department, such as Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), calculates at ₹170 per kilo watt in addition to the electricity consumption.A consumer having, for instance, 100 KW sanctioned load currently pays ₹17,700 as fixed charge to government per month. After rebate, s/he will have to pay ₹7,700. “Most of the industry owners pay ₹2 lakh to ₹3 lakh fixed charge every month in addition to electricity consumption. For us, ₹10,000 relaxation is negligible. We are disappointed. Rajasthan and UP governments have waived off fixed charges. We gave representation for complete waiver of fixed charges for three months, March to May. We will write to the government in this regard,” Manmohan Gaind, general secretary of Manesar Industrial Welfare Association, said.“We were hoping the government would waive off fixed charges completely for three months since we are witnessing economy slowdown also – our industries are shut and we are in loss, our businesses have been halted by virus outbreak,” said Manoj Jain, joint secretary of Gurgaon Industrial Association.HELP FOR SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRIESThe industries are big electricity consumers of the DHBVN and their connections range from 20KW to 1000KW and above. The DHBVN maintained the ₹10,000 rebate was good relief for thousands of small-scale industries.“This rebate will bring relief to industries having 50 KW load or less as their average monthly fixed charges are normally less than ₹10,000 and they will have to pay no amount in the fixed charge category,” said KC Aggarwal, DHBVN chief engineer Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-announces-10-000-rebate-on-fixed-power-charge-for-industries/story-eICdeSTXmgTAMxyAJqxvFJ.html
09-04-2020||Gurugram||Teams to survey 400,000 households in Gurugram||With 12 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in one day, the district tally for the coronavirus disease shot to 30 on Wednesday, prompting the district administration and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to announce a a door-to-door survey to trace symptomatic cases. In a statement, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said the survey was being conducted to identify those who require immediate medical help and appealed to citizens to provide accurate information.Of these 12 new cases, 10 attended the Tablighi Jamaat gathering Delhi and had taken shelter in Sohna’s Raipur village in the last week of March; they are natives of Himachal Pradesh. Hundreds of cases of Covid-19 across the country have been traced to a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in mid-March. The other two patients are from Agra who are under treatment in a private hospital. The remaining cases reported since March are from sectors 9, 50, 83, 47 and 39, Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok-1, Devi Lal Colony and wards 14 and 11 of Pataudi. About 1,200 small teams have been formed to survey four zones of the city to cover at least 400,000 households in urban, semi-urban areas, villages and slums, officials said on Wednesday. They will enquire about the health condition of family members and requirement of household rations.“At least 799 units (teams), along with an additional 400 units for urban areas have been formed. Each unit will include one government employee, an NGO {non-government organisation} worker or volunteer, who will inquire about the health condition of all members of every household to trace symptomatic Covid-19 cases. They will also check if the elderly, physically disabled or migrant workers need food or medication. A single team would cover least 250-350 households in their specific zone,” said VS Kundu, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the monitoring officer for Covid-19 cases in Gurugram. Kundu added that the administration was strengthening the grassroots workforce to understand the requirements of the people, share them with the supervisory officer and address them. The survey will be handled by zonal officers, sector officers and units at three levels. Kundu, in a meeting with officials on Wednesday, said that to prevent them from catching the infection during the survey, teams should be apprised of precautionary measures such as the need to maintain a physical distance of 1 metre, not touching any object and using a pen to press the doorbell. District administration officials have been in touch with resident welfare associations (RWAs) for the last two weeks and they anticipate no hindrance in carrying out the survey in gated colonies. MCG’s teams are aiming to reach out to migrant workers, people in the unorganised sector, senior citizens, pregnant women, and people with special needs on a priority basis. MCG additional commissioner Mahabir Prasad said that at least one of the team members will be familiar with the area and will identify those who may be vulnerable to the infection. Units will be active in 203 gram panchayats. Each unit will include the sarpanch, village secretary, auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) and accredited social health activists (ASHAs) of their villages. As per the 2011 census, there are at least 312,075 households in Gurugram. Officials said there had been a 25% increase in this number since, leading them to estimate the number now at around 400,000 households.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teams-to-survey-400-000-households-in-gurugram/story-4rp7uk1EGKfuOQpIY8mrQP.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Covid lockdown helps relax zoo animals, make them feel ‘almost at home’||Vijay, 12 has been enjoying long naps, lots of playtime with his favourite wooden log, and peaceful walks around his enclosure. Six years ago, it was during one such evening stroll that Vijay, one of Delhi zoo’s white tigers, was confronted by a 22-year old man who had jumped or fallen into the enclosure. Vijay killed the man, an act that changed his life. He was initially kept under observation. Then, when he was released, he realised he had become a celebrity. He got used to having people screaming to attract his attention, even (when the zoo officials were not looking), throwing things at him. he also got used to the incessant clicking of mobile phone cameras. Now, with the zoo close to public, Vijay is enjoying his non-celebrity lifestyle, according to his trainers, who add that he has actually become more relaxed and responsive.It isn’t just him; most animals have become less shy and stress-free since the zoo closed for general public on March 18, after the Covid-19 epidemic had started to spread in the national capital. With a national lockdown for three weeks being declared from March 25, zoo authorities appointed an animal behaviourist to analyse behavioural changes in the 1,200 animals kept in captivity here. Two biologists of the zoo accompany the behaviourist to record activities of the animals on a day-to-day basis to asses if there is any change.A report on the assessment based on the stress levels, diet, sleep, mating and defecation patterns of the animals will be submitted to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) after the lockdown is over.Suneesh Buxy, director of Delhi zoo, said initial observations show that most of the wild animals are now stress-free and enjoying the absence of visitors.“The stress factor has reduced. There is no noise. Except for the zoo staff, there is no human interaction with animals,” Buxy said, adding that the research could be useful. “If some pattern is observed, it will be a good for further research.” Explaining the changes observed in the big cats over the last fortnight, zoo officials who are involved in the study said that the animals are now showing more activity, have become more playful, and that their aggression levels have gone down. One tiger, which otherwise is the most aggressive of the lot, has remained mostly calm, Buxy added.Scientists have also observed that the Asian elephants and apes were spotted roaming freely around, without any coaxing from their keepers. Previously shy foxes, rarely seen during the day, are venturing out. And lion-tailed macaques are using the swings installed for them, more frequently now.The bowel movement of animals such as elephants and apes are also more regular and the faeces is not as constipated as it used to be, zoo officials said -- one indicator that they are not under stress. Another change is that they are drinking enough water now. Many of these animals earlier used to hesitate to drink water, because many water troughs are open to public view. Some even risked dehydration, officials said.“Apart from the limited human interaction, animals are now also getting fresh meat, which we are slaughtering in the zoo itself. As a result, we have observed that there is no wastage” said Saurabh Vashisht, range officer at the zoo. The zoo used to source meat from suppliers before. It was granted special permission to slaughter animals in the zoo during the lockdown. Among big cats, the zoo has nine tigers, four leopards, two jaguars and four lions.The story seems to be similar in zoos around the world. Martha Deen, a senior zoologist at the US’s Montana State University, has been heading a project to analyse the behaviour changes in various categories of animals in America’s zoos since their interaction with humans became limited.“Our observations are still ongoing, but we have seen that while wild animals such as tigers and lions are more stress-free and are even mating on their own, performing and petting animals — such as chimpanzees, walruses and wild goats — were showing signs of loneliness and depression,” Deen said, in an email response. She said that in many state-run zoos in the US, people are allowed to pet and play with animals and they are used to having humans around. These animals were seen to shows signs of “attention deficiency”, she added. “For instance in Ohio’s Columbus, we have got reports that zoo keepers have to be around the bonobo (a monkey), because every day at 2pm they have a little show for the public...They are like performers, who are missing their audience.” .Vijay clearly isn’t.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-lockdown-helps-relax-zoo-animals-make-them-feel-almost-at-home/story-KwxkoAhgQu9KO0Ln0AII8I.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus: Delhi likely to see rise in number of Covid cases, but experts say nothing to be worried about||With the Delhi government planning to ramp up mass testing and random testing in the city’s coronavirus disease (Covid) hotspots, will there be a spike in the number of infections in the capital? Yes, experts say, but it is not something to be alarmed about.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s government has ordered 50,000 kits for testing people and wants to procure 100,000 kits for rapid or antibody testing in the city where, until Wednesday night, 669 people had tested positive for the disease and nine had died. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “Naturally, if you start testing more people, there will be an increase in the numbers. But it is not something people should be scared of. More aggressive antibody testing will help us detect cases early and treat them, reducing the mortality,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.The city-state’s government is aiming is to double testing from 500 samples a day to 1,000 samples.The government has already put in orders for 50,000 kits. Another 100,000 rapid testing kits have also been ordered to test people in the hotspots.“If you do not test, you will never know where the cases of corona (Covid-19) are. We will scale up testing in Delhi just like in South Korea where they tested and identified each and every person with the infection and treated them or sent them to quarantine so that they could not spread it to others,” Kejriwal said on Tuesday.Also read| Covid-19: Masks must in Delhi, 23 ‘zones’ sealed fullyExpecting a surge in the number of cases, the government has also laid out a plan for treating up to 30,000 active cases at a time. “We are on a growth trajectory and any increase in the numbers should not scare the people because the government is prepared even for the worst-case scenario,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and head of a five-member panel advising the chief minister on Covid-19 preparedness.Kejriwal said on Tuesday hat the rapid testing kits that have been ordered will reach the Delhi by Friday, when increased testing in the hotspots will begin.“In the meanwhile, we are preparing guidelines on who should be tested in the hotspots. Once the kits arrive, the priority will be Nizamuddin area as there is a high likelihood that the people in the area might have come in contact with those from the Markaz,” said an official from Delhi’s health department, on condition of anonymity.Also read: No dearth of anti-malaria drug, say states amid local concernsOf Delhi’s 669 cases of Covid-19, 426 have been linked to the mid-March congregation of a Muslim missionary group, the Tahblighi Jamaat, in the Markaz, its six-storey headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti, which has emerged as the biggest hotspot of the disease in the country.An 82-year-old patient from Nizamuddin West had in March end tested positive for the disease without any travel history or clear history of contact with any of the positive cases reported until then. Another man from the area, a 73-year-old,who died on March 31 at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, also did not have any clear history of travel or contact with a carrier of the infection.The authorities are planning random testing in hotspots like Nizamuddin and Dilshad Garden.“We cannot do door-to-door testing; besides the cost, there is also an issue of consent. However, the known contacts with the positive cases or at high risk to get the disease should be tested,” said Dr Sarin.These tests will also help the government in deciding containment strategies.“More testing means more information. Yes, the numbers will likely shoot up, but it will improve the government’s response. In high-risk areas, the antibody tests can help in detecting the asymptomatic cases as well and ensure that they get quarantined. Apart from that, if there is high positivity in an area – for example you test 1,000 people and 800 turn out to be positive – then the government can decide to physically lock down the area to prevent them carrying the infection to other parts of the city,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The converse is also true. “If there are 40,000 people in a quarantine area, and more than half test negative then we can say they were never exposed to the infection,” said Dr Sarin.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Rapid testing is also a helpful way of establishing the burden of Covid-19.“The rapid testing is antibody or blood-based and the samples can be easily collected without too much risk of healthcare workers getting the infection. If we are able to do a large number of tests, we will come to know the burden of disease. It is helpful in the study of epidemiology later on but in the short term, it also helps in planning response. Based on the antibody levels in the population, we can predict how many infections are likely to happen in an area rather than going blind as we are currently doing,” said Dr Kishore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-likely-to-see-rise-in-number-of-covid-cases-but-experts-say-nothing-to-be-worried-about/story-UYLtRXpwe2jZWZTVMUSxlK.html
09-04-2020||Noida||Two more test positive in GB Nagar, total Covid-19 cases now at 60||The Gautam Budh Nagar district health department confirmed two more Covid-19 cases in the district on Wednesday, taking the tally of cases to 60, of which 48 are active cases. Twelve persons have so far been discharged from the isolation wards of different hospitals after being cured of Covid-19.Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer Dr AP Chaturvedi said the two women were the latest to test positive for Covid-19. “While one patient is from Supertech Capetown in Sector 74, the other is from Chouda village in Sector 22,” he said. The husbands of both women are employees of fire safety firm, Ceasefire, and they had both tested positive earlier.Dr Chaturvedi further said as of Wednesday, 693 people are admitted in different isolation wards of the district, including 346 in Galgotias University hostel and 174 at the district hospital building in Sector 39. “Besides them, we have also kept 127 patients in isolation at Dr BR Ambedkar SC/ST hostel in Gautam Buddha University, 28 at the super specialty child PGI, 15 at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and three at Sharda Hospital,” he said.The CMO further said so far, the medical teams of the district have visited 15,350 houses and screened 53,582 persons. “Among those screened, we have traced the travel history of 211. The samples of 1,111 persons have been collected so far and sent to different laboratories for testing,” he said.Of the 60 positive cases in the district, 41 are linked to Ceasefire, whose employees had jumped their quarantine and caused the disease to spread. Even the two cases confirmed on Wednesday are linked to the company, as the husbands of both women were employees of the company.On Tuesday night, the district administration shifted around 200 slum dwellers from Sector 8 to a quarantine centre at the Galgotias hostel as a precautionary measure to curb community spread of the disease. Last week, four people from the slum colony in Sector 5 had tested positive for Covid-19. A domestic help, who worked at the house of an employee of Ceasefire, as well as three of her family were among those who tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-more-test-positive-in-gb-nagar-total-covid-19-cases-now-at-60/story-auAIL5EDv3SvuZuqySKoPM.html
09-04-2020||Noida||Of all polluted cities in UP, Noida and Greater Noida register the best improvement||With the 21-day nationwide lockdown bringing to a halt vehicular movement across cities and also shutting industries, both polluting and otherwise, the air quality has markedly improved, especially in Noida and Greater Noida, a recent analysis of major cities of Uttar Pradesh shows. Both industrial districts – Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida and Greater Noida) and Ghaziabad – had been consistently listed as the most polluted cities of the country, with excessively high concentration of particulate pollutants.The analysis done by Greenpeace India compared the levels PM2.5 – particles in air with a diameter less than 2.5 microns – of seven top polluted cities of the state for the period from March 24 to April 4 for the years 2020 and 2019.While all cities have shown a reduction in PM2.5, the drop in Greater Noida is 68.83%, Noida 65.87%, Ghaziabad 65.75%, Agra 58.92%, Lucknow 55.25%, Kanpur 50.25% and Varanasi 46.96%. Greenpeace India procured its data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the apex body for monitoring ambient air quality in the country.“This analysis clearly shows humane activities such as burning fossil fuel, transport sector, and the energy sector contribute significantly to particulate matter in cities and it can be controlled by transitioning from fossil fuels to renewables,” said the Greenpeace India analysis. It added that PM2.5 is the major pollutant that causes serious health risks such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and lung cancer.According to the report, the average concentration of PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 26.98 microgrammes per cubic meters (Ug/m3) for period between March 24 and April 4, 2020, against 86.56 Ug/m3 for the same period last year. The average concentration for Noida was 29.80 Ug/m3 this year against 85.40 Ug/m3 last year. The average concentration of PM2.5 for the given period for Ghaziabad was 35.74 Ug/m3 against 104.40 Ug/m3 last year.The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 Ug/m3, according to the national standards, while the World Health Organization keeps it 25 Ug/m3.“Although we are seeing a reduction in air pollution across cities owing to the lockdown, we should not see it as a relief. The changes are very temporary, and will not contribute much to the annual average pollution levels. Once the lockdown ends, the pollution will increase again,” Avinash Chanchal, senior campaigner, Greenpeace India, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/of-all-polluted-cities-in-up-noida-and-greater-noida-register-the-best-improvement/story-icu5uxLE3nqu1sdMhsAvNO.html
09-04-2020||City||12 hot spots in GB Nagar, 13 in Ghaziabad to be under intensive lockdown till April 14||With the Uttar Pradesh government Wednesday announcing the sealing of 105 Covid-19 hot spots across 15 districts, 25 such clusters in the NCR -- 13 in Ghaziabad and 12 in Gautam Budh Nagar – will be under intensive lockdown measures for a week, with residents confined indoors, all shops and banks shut, and all vehicular movement completely curtailed.The order comes into effect on Wednesday midnight and will remain in force until the morning of April 15. During the period, the government will carry out extensive sanitisation of the identified areas, and facilitate doorstep delivery of food and other essential supplies. ,,,,,A decision to seal the Covid-19 clusters – areas having six or more coronavirus-positive cases --- was taken after chief minister Yogi Adityanath met senior officials to review the implementation of the 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from March 25.The hot spots are spread across Agra (22), Ghaziabad (13), Gautam Budh Nagar (12), Kanpur (12), Lucknow (12), Meerut (7), Saharanpur (4), Maharajganj (4), Shamli (4), Varanasi (4) Bulandshahr (3), Basti (3), Firozabad (3), Bareilly (1) and Sitapur (1). “We have identified these hot spots in consultation with the director general of police (DGP) Hitesh Chandra Awasthy,” said Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary for home in the Uttar Pradesh government.Till Wednesday, Uttar Pradesh has reported 361 Covid-19 cases from 37 districts and three deaths. “We have identified clusters where Covid-19 positive people live or had links with. We will enforce the complete lockdown and sanitise the clusters,” DGP Awasthy said.Addressing a joint press conference, Awasthi and the DGP said Adityanath had directed government officials to implement the lockdown more strictly in the hot spots. In the remaining areas of the 15 districts, the lockdown ordered on March 25 will continue, they said.Avnish Awasthi said a curfew will be clamped in the hot spots and people will not be allowed to move out of homes. All commercial establishments, including banks, groceries and subsidised public distribution system outlets, will be shut and the movement of traffic banned. No one will be allowed to enter the clusters until the morning of April 15.“The areas will be segregated from other areas with the help of barricading and banks, shops, etc will remain closed. All the medical and general supplies will be delivered at doorstep. Movement in these areas will be restricted like under a normal curfew situation,” DGP Awasthy said.Police and health teams will carry out house-to-house searches to identify people infected with the coronavirus, officials said. People who have come from other districts will be identified and their contacts traced.The hot spots will be inaccessible to the media as well, and the government photographers will release pictures to the media. The fire services department will carry out an extensive sanitation drive in hot spots. All lockdown passes issued to civilians will stand cancelled. Drones will be used to watch the densely populated neighbourhoods. The administration will use loudspeakers to pass on information to residents of hot spots, officials said.“The police will deploy UP-112 vehicles and will take up extensive surveillance using drones. Residents will be kept informed through loudspeakers. Extensive sanitisation will also be taken up with the help of fire tenders. Banks and shops will remain closed in all such areas. The restrictions will be only for hot spot areas and the remaining parts of the district will be under the normal lockdown,” Awasthi said.Another senior police officer said the number of hot spots may increase if more Covid-19 positive cases are detected in any other neighbourhoods. Responding to reports of people resorting to panic-buying, officials said people should not panic as all essential commodities and medicines will be supplied to their doorstep.Clarifications were later made by officials of Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts that the orders were only for hot spot areas and not for the entire district as such.“There are reports doing the rounds that curfew will be imposed in Ghaziabad. These reports are incorrect. The lockdown is in place and supplies and services will continue as usual. Residents should not violate the lockdown rules, else we will take legal action,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad, said.“The sealing orders are for 12 hot spot areas in Gautam Budh Nagar. But this does not mean that essential supplies such groceries, medicines, fruits and vegetables will not be available. The administration will ensure delivery at doorstep. So we request everyone to follow the lockdown rules,” Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority, said.“We are now going to issue an order that everyone who moves out of their homes will have to mandatorily cover their face with a mask or cloth in order to prevent the spread of the infection,” Amit Mohan Prasad, principal secretary (health), said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/12-hot-spots-in-gb-nagar-13-in-ghaziabad-to-be-under-intensive-lockdown-till-april-14/story-aWdlsVWOKXmj6eCO0XHIjN.html
09-04-2020||Delhi||Art of living through the Covid crisis||Parvesh Bansal was known for her sketching skills in her teens. But her artistic pursuits got no encouragement from her parents, who always told her not to waste time on doodles and rather focus on studies. By the time Bansal was in college, she had given up her hobby.Fifty-two years on, at 70, a few days back, she borrowed a pencil from her neighbour’s school-going son and drew again—a house in the hills, surrounded by the towering pine trees.“My son lives in the United States and I live alone. I was feeling anxious and restless, having remained holed up in my apartment, all alone, for almost two weeks now,” says Bansal, a retired teacher who lives In Noida. “I wanted to distract myself from all that is happening in the world. Drawing immediately soothed me. I have done a few sketches in the past three days and exhibited them on Facebook. My relatives gave encouraging comments, and I felt 18 again. Believe me, there is no better way than art to deal with isolation.”Parvesh is not the only one – thousands of people from various backgrounds and age-groups — doctors, lawyers, teachers, students , are taking to art, giving expression to their experiences of social distancing and lockdown. Social media – especially Facebook and Instagram-- are full of such artwork these days.Take for example the works of Muskan Sharma, a Delhi University BCom student, who has done a series of paintings, depicting doctors’ importance in society. One of her paintings on Sunday showed a doctor surrounded by a multitude of people of different nationalities, wearing masks depicting their national flags. “I wanted to show how doctors are critical to our survival and how the world is rallying around them,” says Sharma.While doctors may be a subject of many artworks these days, many doctors themselves are turning to art for its therapeutic effects.Dr. Aparna Govil Bhasker, a Mumbai- based bariatric surgeon, has done a series of paintings in the past few days dealing with various aspects of lockdown—the stigmatisation of health care workers, including doctors, the condition of migrants, the role of invisible heroes such as sweepers and vegetable vendors in easing lives of people. “ Today we all want to say something but we get caught up in taking sides. For me art is the most effective medium of expression. It allows me to say whatever I want to say; people can interpret it however they want. Art keeps me sane in these fraught times”. Similarly, Dr. Rajesh Gupta, a pulmonologist with Fortis hospitals, likes to paint for an hour every evening after work. “These days I get an enormous number of queries from family, friends, neighbours and patients who fear they might have contracted Covid-19. A doctor’s job is always stressful even in normal times, but currently it is much more so. Art allows me to relax, prepare for the next day,” says Gupta. “The right brain qualities, which are related to imagery, visual and drawing skills also hold me in good stead in today’s digital, image-based world of medicine.”Vasvi Srivastava, co-founder, Abhyaantar, a Delhi-based organisation that facilitates wellness and healing through creative arts, says that the lockdown has given people an opportunity like never to discover their creative selves, and to do things they always wanted to do, but never got time.“Art puts you in a meditative state, relieving depression, general anxiety, and a host of other mental health issues. Even science has proved its healing powers,” says Srivastava, also a psychologist and an expressive arts therapy facilitator. “Art is the first thing we do as a child, much before writing, but unfortunately children have never been encouraged to take up art. I hope the current lockdown eventually will lead to a better appreciation of arts in our society.”Krishna Das, who runs Kriya, an organisation that encourages artists from different walks of life, has launched an initiative, Artists of Kovid -19, to showcase works done by both professional as well as amateur artists during the lockdown. “The best art happens when artists have time and solitude to look within and be themselves. In normal times, we never introspect or retrospect, which requires both solitude and courage. The lockdown has given people that rare opportunity,” says Das.She refers to legendary American psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy triangle, comprising a five-tier model of human needs, which also puts emphasis on the need for creative activities as a means of self-actualisation. “ Art is very important for us to become a better society, ” says Das.One of the many artists who have contributed to Artists of Kovid -19 project, is Simran Wadhwa, a professional artist. Among the many works that she created during the lockdown is a brightly coloured face of a woman against a pitch dark background.“The dark background represents the difficult times we are going through, and the bright colours on the face represent positivity of the person, her ability to see light at the end of the tunnel,” says Wadhwa, adding that in the past two weeks she has seen a change in the attitude of people towards art. “ A lot of parents are contacting me these days to do online art sessions for their children, which they feel is a creative way of spending time. But only time will tell if this change in outlook towards art will last.”Manroop Chawla, another contributor to the Covid-19 project, has painted a young girl with long dark hair standing against a blue background, her face painted light blue.“The blue in the background conveys a sense of solitude that pervades all around us, and the blue on the face of the girl represents how people are getting affected by the bleak atmosphere around them,” says Chawla. “ Art is helping me fight my own blues.”In fact, not just Das, many other art organisations have also launched several projects and competitions related to Covid-19, social distancing and quarantine. On 25th March, the day the country-wide lockdown began, Mumbai-based Milind Sathe, an art promoter, who runs Indiaart , an online art platform, launched “Art in the time of Corona - hope and positivity through creativity”, a project exhorting people to create and share their work -- be it a doodle, sketch, painting or anything else--- during the lockdown.“I have always believed in the power of art in tackling negativity and despair. At a time when there is constant negative news all around, I thought that people should create something positive and not be just passive listeners to the stories of doom. Apart from the joy of creation, art can also soothe the stressed minds and give everyone a strong reason to live another day,” says Sathe.The response to Sathe’s initiative has been overwhelming, with people from diverse age-groups and backgrounds-- homemakers, doctors, IT professionals, school children and college students and others sending their entries.“I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality and depths of some of these works,” he says.On Tuesday, Aparna Bhasker put up a new piece of art on her Facebook page. This time, it had a message: “In the end we washed the virus offAnd no evidence of infection did we findBut deep down, the feeling of being stigmatized was somewhat left behind#EndCoronaStigma”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/art-of-living-through-the-covid-crisis/story-GtHwrRoq51SAEZcGFIumYL.html
09-04-2020||Chandigarh||Facing threat, Sikhs, Hindus in Afghanistan awaiting India’s response on asylum pleas||As they are receiving death threats from terror organisations following the attack on historic Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib in Kabul, which killed 27 Sikh devotees on March 25, the Sikh and Hindu families living in Afghanistan are eagerly wanting to be evacuated from the terror-hit country at the earliest and waiting for India’s response on their pleas for asylum.Talking to HT over phone, Hira Singh, a prominent Afghan Sikh leader who left Afghanistan in 1993 after the civil war and is living in Delhi as a refugee, said several Afghanistan-based organisations, including Hindu-Sikh Welfare Society, Khalsa Diwan Society and managements of gurdwaras, have written to the Indian government seeking asylum and they have also approached Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal to take up the matter.“However, we don’t know the fate of these pleas of Afghan Sikhs. The government’s response is awaited yet,” he added.In a letter written by managing committee of Gurdwara Dashmesh Darbar Karte Parwan, Kabul, to Union home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Harsimrat on April 3 through Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), the Afghan Sikhs stated, “The conditions here are very volatile and dangerous. There was another attack on March 25 during the funeral services and explosives were found near the gurdwara. Finally, members of the community received phone calls from anonymous individuals, who claimed to be (belonging to) ISIS and told us to evacuate Afghanistan in 10 days or they will attack again. We have taken this threat very seriously”.As Afghanistan has planned to evacuate more than 2,500 Afghans stranded in India amid Covid-19 lockdown and charted flights to evacuate them from New Delhi, the Sikhs and Hindus approached Indian embassy in Kabul to send them to India on these flights which would be going empty otherwise.“Lives of the remaining Hindu and Sikh families are in grave danger and they need to leave Kabul in next 2-3 days because of the threat from ISIS”, reads this letter.When contacted, Sirsa said, “We are pursuing the matter”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/facing-threat-sikhs-hindus-in-afghanistan-awaiting-india-s-response-on-asylum-pleas/story-2yn4See00zlJlleUknbp6O.html

While ventilators cost between Rs 25,000 to upwards of Rs one lakh of rupees, the COEP prototype was developed at a cost of around Rs 10,000, Ahuja said.A team of six members including Ahuja, two faculty members and four research students worked on the project for two weeks. “Initial tests have been satisfactory and we now await a feedback from the doctors at Sassoon Hospital,” Ahuja said. He said the cost could further reduce with mass manufacturing. Once accepted by the doctors, COEP will tie-up with a startup or existing manufacturers to manufacture and market the much-needed medical device, the COEP director said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coep-faculty-students-develop-mechanical-ventilator-for-sassoon-hospital-in-pune/story-sGO8sLrMDQk61dH2YOsJbJ.html

Stock up for the next 8-10 days. It is necessary to reduce the number of people on the streets. We have finished two weeks of lockdown and Pune citizens have supported us so far,” said commissioner Venkatesham.“There was no complaint of crowding and the two hours of relaxation for buying of essential goods were observed by the residents of Kondhwa very well. We spread awareness through mobile public announcement systems and the masjids in the area,” said Suhas Bawche, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-5 of Pune police.Commissioner Venkatesham was speaking on the second day of curfew announced in four parts of the city in light of increase in positive cases in the city. The rest of the city, along with the entire country, remains under lockdown until April 14. However, in the curfewed areas, shops providing essential goods, except pharmacies, will remain open only between 10am and 12 noon. “A geospecific map of places where positive cases were found was drawn up and the curfew was announced based on that,” said commissioner Venkatesham.He visited the Katraj chowk along with joint commissioner Ravindra Shisve; additional commissioner Sanjay Shinde, where over 200 policemen performed a route march to assert their presence in the area.Two companies of state reserve police force (SRPF) have been provided to the city police and are being kept on reserve for enforcement of the curfew and assembly prohibition orders. “We have almost finished the list of people who were present at the Markaz (Tablighi Jamaat, Nizamuddin). The foreign returned nationals as well as those in home quarantine are being tackled by the PMC and revenue department officials. We have developed the HQTS system where a person in home quarantine can upload a selfie (to ensure they are at home),” he said.He also warned citizens of police action if they failed to adhere to the lockdown rules. So far, 9,900 vehicles have been seized and over 4,500 cases under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code for violating lockdown rules have been registered in the city, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/leisure-buying-must-stop-says-pune-police-cp/story-uuDOyQQkAcXOAzCT9UiXQJ.html
09-04-2020||Pune||No public Holy Week services, as Thomas Dabre, Bishop of Pune urges priests to ‘live’ stream masses||Holy Week for Catholics in Pune will see no public observances on Maundy Thursday, Good Friday or Easter Sunday, as advised by a public notice issued by the Rt Reverend Fr Thomas Dabre, Bishop of Pune.“This is one of the important weeks for the Catholics in Pune, but because of the pandemic situation of coronavirus, celebration of Holy Mass has been suspended,” said Bishop Dabre. Following the norms laid down by the Vatican and the Conference of Catholic Bishops in India, Bishop Dabre has instructed priests to hold private services, with no more than five persons present, and to ‘live’ stream the same so that the laity can partake in their own homes.Bishop Dabre himself will say the Good Friday (day marks the crucifixion of Jesus) and Easter Vigil (observed by Christians as day of Jesus’ Resurrection) services, both of which will be streamed online.Catholics in Pune plan to pray with their family members at home.Raymond Martin, a musician and senior citizen, living in Kondhwa said, “Though we cannot go to the church, it does not exempt us from the holy things of the season, beginning with Maundy Thursday, which is the celebration of the institution of the priest hood. I plan to attend mass online. The family will pray together.”According to Bishop Dabre’s instructions to the Pune Diocese , the private celebration of the Mass this year will omit some of its most distinctive features, including the lighting of the Easter fire with procession. This year only the Easter Candle will be lit.According to Benitta Jacob, living in Pashan, “Usually, Good Friday is a day of mourning. There is no celebration. On Sunday, it is Easter, Christ has risen, so Easter eggs are gifted to each other, but this year, the mood is very sombre that gives us no reason to celebrate.” “With all that is happening around the world the best way we can celebrate this Easter would be family prayer and an online mass. Easter eggs can be made at home. The most that we can contribute this Easter to this world would be to stay at home with family,” said Jiji Johnson, resident of Vimannagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-public-holy-week-services-as-bishop-dabre-urges-priests-to-live-stream-masses/story-UBFtlqShprzDmBpBBQtqfL.html
09-04-2020||Pune||As many refuse to cooperate, PMC health dept takes police help to conduct contact tracing survey||With the city reporting increasing number of Covid-19 (coronavirus) infections daily, it is imperative for the civic body to be able to trace the contacts of the positive cases to prevent the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. However, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) employees have complained that some of the Covid-19 positive patients are not cooperating with the civic staffers who approach them to gather information for contract tracing. The non-cooperation has prompted the Pune civic body to take the help of police officials.As per the protocol, once a Covid-19 positive case is detected, the first job of the PMC health team is to start search of the first contacts of the patient. However, with number of cases rising rapidly and lack of cooperation from positive patients, the task of the health department officials has become difficult. Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health chief of PMC, who is incharge for contact tracing, said, “As positive cases have increased, the work for our teams is increasing day by day to identify the contacts of the positive patient. We conduct a survey in the 1km and 3km radius, but at some sensitive places, people are not cooperating with us. They do not give the correct information and even treat our staffers badly. Hence, we are seeking police bandobast to conduct the survey.”Jadhav added, “Our team recently visited the residence of a deceased three days before he was admitted, but the family members did not give correct information about symptoms despite asking repeatedly. If the family members had given proper information, there were chances that this person would get treatment in time and survive. We are also planning to file first information reports against such people who are not cooperating.” Meanwhile, mayor Murlidhar Mohol appealed to citizens to cooperate with the PMC health staff who are conducting the door to door survey. Mayor said, “It is in the interest of citizens if they provide true and proper information about symptoms and any contact with positive patients as well as travel history. It will help control the spread of Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/as-many-refuse-to-cooperate-pmc-health-dept-takes-police-help-to-conduct-contact-tracing-survey/story-wHRvIfdfQqcM2qF6RM1jjK.html

We are buying more ventilators and as the demand for the ventilators grows we will buy as per the requirements. We have requested more from the state government.” As per data from district health department, there are a total of 1,184 isolation beds currently reserved for Covid-19 patients which can be increased to 2,374 beds if the situation worsens. There are 389 ICU (Intensive care unit) beds available in the district and 361 ventilators in the district hospitals.Pune district has a population of 94.29 lakh (2011 census) and includes Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad munciipal corporations; Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road cantonment boards and 14 talukas.Dr Dilip Sarda, member, Maharashtra Medical Council said more ventilators are needed in Pune. “Looking at the current situation this is a very less number. This cannot be increased overnight because the expertise to handle ventilators and isolation bed patients is also less. We cannot just have the infrastructure; we need the necessary expertise too. The less number of ventilators or lacking infrastructure is a result of ignoring health and not allocating the necessary budget for health over the years.” Facilities created in Pune Division(includes Pune, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur and Sangli districts)* population: 2.34 crore* 88 quarantine centres with a capacity of 12, 850 beds.* 52 isolation centres with 2167 beds.* total of 1465 ventilators: 137 in government hospitals and the rest in private hospitals- Source: Pune Divisional Commissionerate List of some isolation/ICU facilities in the city· Around 36 private hospitals and 3 government hospitals with 238 beds organised for rural/municipal council areas in Pune district.

Kale, who represented Haryana Steelers in the Season 7 of Pro Kabaddi League also plays for Maharashtra and Satej Club Baner. The 32-year-old, Kale is taking complete care of his training by including terrace sessions in the evening.“I go to the hillock only in the morning as there is no one there and avoid stepping out in the evening as I know we are not allowed to step out,” explains Kale, listing his daily schedule.Morning sessionI wake up at 5:30am -this is the one habit which I have not changed since my childhood. At 6:30am, I go to the hillock as nobody is there and I can train myself in a peaceful environment. I do long running, tyre running and speed running – each of which is schedule two days in a week. I take Sundays off, but on other days I follow this routine strictly. Once I return from practice (8:30am), I have a heavy breakfast, full of proteins.I also help my parents by doing household chores or if there are any essential commodities which have to be bought.Afternoon sessionAfter having lunch, I read. I like reading motivational books and currently, I am reading a book on Mary Kom – Unbreakable -her autobiography in Marathi. I also sleep for an hour and 30 minutes.Evening sessionIn the evenings, I train on the terrace and do stretching exercises which include squats, push-ups, lunges, core and burpees. Sometimes, I also do skipping. The session continues for two hours and finishes at 7:30pm. Then, I play with my dog ‘Chiku’ for sometime – he loves me watching at home and I spend almost an hour playing with him. After dinner, I watch television news and the entire family discusses the day’s events. I respect all police and medical professional who are currently fighting this war against coronavirus. I sleep early at night.Tyre, heavy stones replace gym weightsOne cannot have all the gym apparatus at home, so I have different tyres of varying weight and I have also kept stones of various weights at my terrace, which helps me do weight lifting exercises at home. I miss my teammates from the local club (Satej Club Baner) with whom I practice every day on normal days. With many sports events getting postponed or cancelled, I still hope Pro Kabaddi League will happen in 2020.HobbiesI love gardening and have a small garden on our terrace.

09-04-2020||Patna||10p/unit reduction in Bihar’s power tariff||The Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) on Friday reduced power tariff by 10 paise per unit across all the categories of consumers while introducing metered connections even for those living below poverty line (BPL).The new tariff rates will be applicable across the state from April 1.The BERC has reduced power tariff for the first time in 15 years of its existence. The state-run discoms wanted to keep energy charges constant, while proposing a minor hike in fixed charge per kilowatt for the next fiscal.The domestic consumers in Patna and other urban areas would now pay between ₹6.05 and ₹8.50 per unit, while those in rural areas would have to pay between ₹6.05 and ₹6.95 per unit.Similarly, commercial establishments in Patna and other areas would be charged between ₹6.30 and ₹ 7.40 per unit. Bihar also became the third state after Gujarat and Tamil Nadu to abolish meter rent. Meter rent is a monthly fixed charge, which discoms recover from consumer for energy meter provided at their respective premises. It varies depending on the category of connection, say for instance ₹18 for a single phase domestic urban connection and ₹45 for three-phase connection.The regulator reduced the minimum billing demand from 85% to 75% under demand based billing for those who do not consume the contracted energy load.Bihar also became the first state to link recovery of fixed/demand charges with availability of power supply. It allowed full refund of fixed/demand charge if discoms failed to provide an average daily 21 hours power supply in a month. This was, however, not meant for agriculture and street light consumers.It also gave low tension to industrial consumers, including those having rice mill, cold storage, etc. the option to choose the rate at which, they wanted to draw power at peak load, off-peak and normal rate, by introducing “time of day tariff” on optional basis. Bihar goes to polls later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/10p-unit-reduction-in-bihar-s-power-tariff/story-GdCIHSGL4I354G3UIn7wzI.html

The report also pointed to chatter on social media from some terrorist elements pushing for targeting stores owned by the people of “Indian descent.”The alert was issued by the National Counterterrorism Centre in America, and formed part of a security advisory from the US rail industry. The existence of this document, which has been distributed in Canada by the First Responder Terrorism Awareness Program of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP, was first reported by the Canadian outlet Global News. Terrorists are being encouraged not just to use conventional means for attacks but also to infect large groups with the Covid-19 virus.The report warned that extremists on the social media platform Telegram, considered popular among members and followers of the Islamic State, had advocated for infecting rabbis and store owners ‘of Indian descent.” However, the concern is not limited to jihadi groups but also over white supremacists.The report stated: “Pandemics and other natural crises create unprecedented challenges that terrorists could exploit to conduct attacks against and already stressed society, and strained government and public safety system,” according to excerpts published by Global News.While the majority of people remain at home due to fear of coronavirus infection, places where there are still larger gatherings like hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets could be “potentially attractive targets” for terrorists. It also noted that terrorists with Covid-19 were asked to spread the disease in places like mosques, synagogues and neighbourhoods with diverse populations.The US intelligence report also said, “A related concern is propaganda calling on ‘believers,’ adherents, and supporters to exploit the prevailing duress on law enforcement and security professionals to attempt to execute attacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrorists-could-plot-attacks-as-public-safety-system-under-stress-due-to-covid-19-report/story-y7HkQbsMkBMFu2pumHKcnL.html

The monarch has isolated himself in a palace on an island on the Red Sea, and the crown prince is sheltering with senior member of his government at a remote site where he has planned to build a futuristic city, the publication said.It cited an internal memo issued by the hospital on the beds being set aside. “We don’t know how many cases we will get but high alert,” the message said, instructing that “all chronic patients to be moved out ASAP.”A senior royal who is governor of Riyadh is among those infected and is in intensive care, the report said.The coronavirus does not discriminate, as it has demonstrated. US Prime Minister Boris Johnson remained in ICU in London for the third day Thursday, and many members of the Iranian government are reported to have been infected.Saudi Arabia has nearly 3,300 reported cases confirmed infection and 44 deaths. But the kingdom began its mitigation effort even fore the first case was reported , air travel was suspended on March 2 and so was pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.There are indications the kingdom may cancel this year’s Haj pilgrimage, which has been held annually without interruption since 1798.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/150-saudi-royals-infected-says-report/story-ISXH1kP6fsF4y1ReknErOK.html

Then, a rider||The Pakistan government on Thursday pledged $3 million to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation’s (SAARC) Covid-19 Emergency Fund on the condition that the facility be administered by the Saarc secretariat.Pakistan is the last of Saarc’s eight members to contribute to the fund, which was created with an initial corpus of $10 million provided by India following a video conference of leaders of the grouping on March 15.“While communicating Pakistan’s decision to the Saarc Secretariat, it has been conveyed that all proceeds of the Fund should be administered by the Saarc Secretariat and that the modalities for the Fund’s utilisation should be finalised through consultations with the Member States as per the Saarc Charter,” said a statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office.“Pakistan’s perspective in this regard was also conveyed during a telephone conversation between Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood and Secretary General SAARC Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, today,” the statement added.According to New Delhi, India’s engagements with Saarc members on Covid-19 related matters are stand-alone events whereas Pakistan has sought to bring all issues under the Saarc secretariat in a bid to block Indian initiatives.On Wednesday, Pakistan skipped a video conference of senior trade officials of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), saying it chose not to participate since the Saarc secretariat wasn’t involved in organising it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pledges-3-mn-to-saarc-covid-19-emergency-fund/story-Amx06zCQoTxMYhMVhwjxSN.html
09-04-2020||World||Covid-19: UK to continue lockdown as coronavirus death toll nears 8,000||It is too early to lift the ongoing lockdown, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Thursday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued to improve in the intensive care unit, while the UK’s death mounted by another 881 to 7,978.“Thank you for your sacrifice but we’re not done yet. We must keep going. The measures will have to stay in place until the evidence shows we have moved beyond the peak”, Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, said at the daily briefing. The number of cases rose to 65,077.“The early signs suggest they are having an impact. We mustn’t give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people. I know it is tough going but this is a team effort. The measures will have to stay in place until we have got evidence that shows we have moved beyond the peak”.Chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said social distancing is helping to stop the virus spreading within the community. There “might even be some flattening” of new cases, he said, because had it not been flattening, there would have been “many, many more” cases.Meanwhile, initial data and anecdotal evidence of medical professionals suggested that 35% of critically ill coronavirus patients are of Indian and other non-white origin in the UK, with London boroughs with large Indian population figuring among the most afflicted.The London area has the largest number of cases in the UK, followed by the Midlands (including Birmingham, Leicester). The London boroughs with high number of cases include Brent, Barnet, Ealing and Harrow – each with a high presence of Indian-origin people.Kamlesh Khunti, a medical expert at the University of Leicester, told BBC: “A lot of people have been concerned about this issue based on anecdotal reports and now this data is showing a signal regarding a higher number of black and minority ethnic populations being admitted to intensive care units.”NHS doctors who have died so far are all from minority origin, including Jitendra Kumar Rathod. Nurses who have passed away also include some of Asian origin.

But new data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre says 35% of the critically ill are from black or minority ethnic backgrounds.The London area has the largest number of cases in the UK: 14,355, followed by the Midlands (including Birmingham, Leicester): 8,589. The London boroughs with high number of cases include Brent (853), Barnet (752), Ealing (553) and Harrow (530).Kamlesh Khunti, a medical expert at the University of Leicester, told BBC: “A lot of people have been concerned about this issue based on anecdotal reports and now this data is showing a signal regarding a higher number of black and minority ethnic populations being admitted to intensive care units.”NHS doctors who have died so far are all from minority origin, including Jitendra Kumar Rathod. Nurses who have passed away also include some of Asian origin. Their deaths have been highlighted by anti-racism campaigners who hail their contribution to the NHS.According to Khunti, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the figures, despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the UK population, include many coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, working in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.A large number of doctors and nurses who qualified in India are on the frontline of treating thousands of coronavirus patients across the UK. India-qualified doctors account for the second largest group in the NHS, after those qualifying in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/many-indian-origin-people-in-uk-stricken-by-covid-19/story-4UoLGf18jHQuX7TxczjqmL.html

Many establishments shut down and others downsized to survive the cascading drop in business.Janet Yellen, the former chair of the US federal reserve, has said the unemployment rate in the US is already at 12-13%, which is the worse it’s been since the Great Depression of 1929, according to the Washington Post, which cited another economist saying this is “the Great Depression II”. The Great Depression was the worst economic downturn in US history and lasted for years, into the 1930s, with unemployment shooting up to 25% at its peak.The coronavirus had killed more than 14,800 people in the United States till Thursday morning, when the new unemployment numbers were announced, and left 432,000 reported cases of confirmed infections, almost a fourth of the global total of 1.5 million. New York state remained the worst hit with more than 6,200 deaths; 4,571 in New York City alone.The adjoining state of New Jersey was next with 1,500 fatalities; followed by Michigan with nearly 960; Louisiana with 650; and California with more than 500. Hundreds of fatalities have been reported from many other states. African Americans have accounted for a disproportionately higher rare of death than other racial demographics.But US public health officials have said despite these growing numbers of infections and fatalities, there is evidence that social-distancing and all other mitigation efforts are working, which has caused a lowering of the projection of deaths. To 60,415 by August, from more than 80,000 at the start, according to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation.“We’ve carefully looked at Italy and Spain,” Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force on the coronavirus, told reporters at the daily briefing Wednesday, referring to the two European nations that have had the highest fatalities so far with 17,699 and 15,328 respectively. “ And we are doing much better, in many cases, than several other countries. And we’re trying to understand that”But Birx and Anthony Fauci, the leading epidemiologist and a member of the White House task force, have stressed the need to keep the mitigation efforts in place, arguing now is not the time to ease them.President Trump is going with their advice, but has been keen to reopen up the country and put it back in business precisely because of the kind of unemployment numbers that are being reported and has repeatedly sought to be more optimistic; he has taken to saying he can see the light at the end of the tunnel these days.“We’re hopefully heading toward a final stretch -- the light at the end of the tunnel, as I was saying,” the president said at the daily briefing. “As we continue to wage all-out medical war to defeat the virus, we’re also fighting an economic war to ensure we can quickly turn to full financial strength”.The Trump administration has sought a relief package of $250 billion in addition to the record $2.2 trillion cleared March end. The additional amount is meant for small businesses (with 500 and less workers) that employ 48% of the US workforce., to enable them to stay in business and hold on to their employees.The $2.2 trillion package, which pumps money into every corner of the economy, includes enhanced unemployment benefits of $600 a week for the next four months; in addition to the direct payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child that most Americans below a certain income level are expected to receive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-leaves-6-6m-more-americans-jobless-kills-more-than-14-800/story-OR70gVD9lOSkcbgBpMVqNK.html
09-04-2020||World||Pakistan asks Afghanistan to hand over captured ISKP leader Aslam Farooqi||Pakistan on Thursday demanded Afghanistan should hand over the Pakistani-origin chief of the Islamic State of Khorsan Province (ISKP), who was captured by Afghan forces during an operation last week.Aslam Farooqi, who was earlier linked to the terrorist groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, was captured along with 19 other members of ISKP on April 5. Several of the other captured terrorists are Pakistani nationals, Afghanistan’s spy agency or National Directorate of Security (NDS) said.Farooqi has been linked to the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed more than 25 people, including an Indian national. Indian security officials have also said the ISKP targeted the Sikhs after being unable to attack the heavily fortified Indian mission in Kabul.On Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office called in Afghan ambassador Atif Mashal and informed him of Islamabad’s views regarding the arrest of ISKP leader Aslam Farooqi by Afghan authorities.“It was underscored to the ambassador that since Aslam Farooqi was involved in anti-Pakistan activities in Afghanistan, he should be handed over to Pakistan for further investigations,” said a statement from the Foreign Office.The statement added, “It was emphasised that Pakistan had been expressing its concerns over the activities of this group, which were clearly detrimental to Pakistan. Pakistan’s position in this regard was being regularly shared with the Government of Afghanistan and others concerned.”Pakistan also called for the two sides to “coordinate actions against the menace of terrorism, including through established mechanisms”.Security officials in New Delhi were sceptical about Pakistan’s demand. One official, who declined to be named, said: “It seems the Pakistanis are more worried about what Aslam Farooqi could divulge about his long-standing links to the Pakistani military establishment.”The ISKP has claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Afghanistan’s minorities such as the Hazara Shias and Sikhs. However, it has been put on the backfoot after coordinated operations by Afghan forces since November in Nangarhar led to the surrender of hundreds of the group’s fighters and sympathisers.When ISKP claimed the March 25 attack on the Sikhs in Kabul, it said an Indian national from Kerala – Muhsin Trikaripur alias Abu Khalid al-Hindi – was among the attackers. All the terrorists involved in the attack were killed.Two other top ISKP leaders, both Pakistani nationals, were captured along with Farooqi. Also known as Mawlavi Abdullah, Farooqi became head of the ISKP last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-asks-afghanistan-to-hand-over-captured-iskp-leader-aslam-farooqi/story-05ZVJSIIN2oZQxaYtcgdfK.html

But an emergency situation is not a blank cheque to disregard human rights obligations,” said Michelle Bachelet.The former Chilean president was addressing the first-ever virtual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.“Emergency measures should be necessary and proportionate,” she said.“I am profoundly concerned by certain countries’ adoption of emergency powers that are unlimited.” Free speech restrictions Many countries have adopted extraordinary measures to deal with the pandemic, which has killed nearly 100,000 people worldwide since it emerged in China in December.In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is now ruling by decree until his government says the crisis has passed.“In a few cases, the epidemic is being used to justify repressive changes to regular legislation, which will remain in force long after the emergency is over,” said Bachelet.“In some countries we have already seen reports of journalists being penalised for reporting a lack of masks, health-workers reprimanded for saying they lack protection, and ordinary people arrested for social media postings about the pandemic.“Criticism is not a crime.”Bachelet also called on governments to “greatly increase access to accurate information and statistics” on the pandemic, stressing that “transparency is paramount and can be life-saving in a health crisis”.Some countries, organisations and leaders -- including US President Donald Trump -- have voiced doubts about the figures from China on the numbers of deaths and infections.Bachelet also urged countries to protect their most vulnerable citizens during the pandemic, including detainees, the poor, women and migrants.“Unchecked, the pandemic is likely to create even wider inequalities, amid extensive suffering,” she said, reiterating her call for a relaxation of international sanctions on countries like Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-no-blank-cheque-to-flout-civil-liberties-says-un/story-YIefXRntkSXqt8YY0o7qBN.html

We have had a total of 4,110 deaths due to the COVID-19 disease.” Iran, which announced its first Covid-19 cases on February 19, is by far the worst hit by the pandemic in the Middle East, according to official tolls.But there has been speculation abroad that the real number of deaths and infections in the country could be higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-deaths-in-iran-cross-4-000-but-country-witnesses-drop-in-new-cases/story-WR1yMFe4ldjUfwm7wU4fIO.html

He was acquitted.The affair made Tripp a villain to Democrats and Clinton supporters, but a minor hero to Republicans.Tripp said in a 1999 interview, on the day of Clinton’s acquittal, that she had no regrets despite having received numerous threats.“The public has no clue... absolutely no idea what Monica endured,” she told NBC.“It was worth it to me to do what I considered to be my patriotic duty.”She was later forced from her job, in which she was a political appointee, when Clinton left office in January 2001.After that she moved to Middleburg, Virginia where she operated a Christmas store, The Christmas Sleigh, with her second husband Dieter Rausch. Lewinsky, who made clear at the time that she felt deeply betrayed, tweeted earlier Wednesday about Tripp after news emerged that she was severely ill.“No matter the past, upon hearing that Linda Tripp is very seriously ill, I hope for her recovery. I can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/linda-tripp-who-exposed-clinton-lewinsky-sex-scandal-dies-of-cancer/story-Ew37d3KSoDXWPVl07W1V0K.html

She and 40 others at the service were subsequently diagnosed as carrying the virus.Twelve of that group have since died, but Ras was told by her doctors on Monday that she had beaten the infection.“We did not expect her to survive this”, her niece Maaike de Groot told the newspaper.“She takes no medicines, still walks well and gets down on her knees every night to thank the Lord. From the looks of it, she will be able to continue to do so.” Prior to Ras, the oldest widely documented coronavirus survivor was Bill Lapschies, a 104-year-old American.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-107-yr-old-dutch-woman-recovers-from-covid-19/story-CSalfSFHtLxh0rVgtYUnQN.html

So far, 572 patients have recovered from the deadly disease in Pakistan, ANI reported.Five people have died in the last 24 hours bringing the nation-wide toll to 64. Thirty-one patients are currently battling for life at healthcare centres, the news agency said.The country’s Punjab province has more than 2,100 affected people.Pakistan is making frantic efforts to tackle the pandemic. Prime Minister Khan once again warned the people to follow official guidelines on self-isolation or the virus would spread further.“It is a misconception that this pandemic will not spread rapidly; it will become worse in the days to come. If we don’t take preventive measures, the deadly disease will rise in the country like it did in Europe and will create a lot of trouble for us,” Khan said.He also said that the hospitals in Pakistan may not be able to cope with the patients, according to local media.He, however, defended his decision to not impose total lockdown, saying over 50 million were below the poverty line in the country and they could die of hunger if such step is taken.The Sindh province has reported as many as 1,128 cases, followed by 560 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 213 in Gilgit Baltistan, 212 in Balochistan, 102 in Islamabad and 28 in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK).The government has extended partial lockdown till April 14 and is constantly asking people to stay indoors and follow social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-near-4-500-in-pakistan-but-imran-khan-won-t-impose-total-lockdown/story-EDM40ZP2hGHAiNDb7zFvsI.html

While she was cleared of the infection recently, Trudeau had chosen to remain in self-isolation and Wednesday marked the first time he attended a meeting in person. He will continue to work mainly from home.However, as Covid-19 cases spike in Canada, Trudeau said the government couldn’t tell “exactly when we’re going to be peaking.” But, he added that if Canadians kept to measures like social distancing and leaving home only for essential activities, then the nation “will get through this much, much quicker.”He welcomed the positive effect that social distancing has had in curbing the spread of the disease, and added that such behavioural changes may be necessary for more than a year, till a vaccine to counter Covid-19 becomes a reality. “Once we are through this initial phase, we will then be in a mode, until there is a vaccine, which could take many many months, if not more than a year, to get to. We will be calibrating very carefully our behaviours as a country, as a society, as an economy, to managing the existence and persistence of COVID19,” he said while addressing the media.He also said that social distancing and staying at home had proved “very effective.”“It is clear that the best outcomes come when there is maximal social distancing, as we are pretty close to doing right now,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-25-days-in-self-isolation-canadian-pm-chairs-cabinet-meet-on-covid-19/story-41P4HVEiDAloEzfDk8oXpL.html
09-04-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson stable as lockdown extension looms||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday began a fourth day in intensive care “improving” in his battle with coronavirus, as his government prepared to extend a nationwide lockdown introduced last month.Johnson is the most high-profile world leader to become infected with Covid-19 and his transfer to intensive care on Monday is unprecedented for a prime minister during a national emergency in modern times.“He’s stable, improving, sat up and engaged with medical staff,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC News. “I think things are getting better for him.”The disease has struck at the heart of the British government, infected more than 60,000 people nationwide and killed over 7,000, with another record daily death toll of 938 reported on Wednesday.Senior ministers were set to discuss at Thursday’s daily coronavirus response meeting the process for extending the stringent social distancing measures rolled out on March 23.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, will lead the so-called “war cabinet”, as he has done since Monday.However, ministers have made it clear no announcement on the status of the lockdown -- rolled out for an initial three weeks -- would be made until that period has ended on Monday, at the earliest.The Sun newspaper reported the government’s top scientific advisers will not meet until Friday to assess the situation.“You shouldn’t expect a decision today on restrictions,” Dowden said, stressing the actual review would happen next week.“Right now it’s just beginning to work,” he said of the lockdown, noting new Covid-19 cases in Britain were not “accelerating”.“When we have the opportunity to change it, we will, but that is not the moment now.” ‘Relentless’ Johnson arrived in hospital on Sunday night following concerns he still had a cough and high temperature 10 days after being diagnosed with coronavirus.He had spent the previous nine days in self-isolation in a flat above his Downing Street office.The 55-year-old Conservative leader was transferred to intensive care on Monday night on the advice of his medical team as his condition was seen to be deteriorating.He has received messages of support from around the world, with US President Donald Trump sending best wishes to his “very good friend”. Russian leader Vladimir Putin said Johnson’s “energy, optimism and sense of humour” would see him through.Experts have said it was not uncommon for Covid-19 patients to move to intensive care, but said it showed his condition was serious.The British government has been criticised for a slow response to the pandemic, initially refusing to follow other European countries in requiring people to stay home as the virus spread rapidly across the globe.Johnson himself said in early March that he was still shaking hands with people -- only for Covid-19 to sweep through the British establishment weeks later.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, have both since been infected, although they have since recovered.The government has insisted that its coronavirus response has been led by the medical and scientific evidence throughout.Attention is now increasingly focused on when it might be able to lift the unprecedented restrictions it eventually put in place to stem the spread.Despite several European countries setting out plans to ease their lockdowns, British newspapers reported Thursday the measures were set to remain in the UK into at least May.Meanwhile, with good weather forecast for the upcoming long Easter weekend, The Times said political leaders from across Britain will unite to launch a “stay at home this Easter” campaign.“We need to be relentless,” a source told the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-stable-as-lockdown-extension-looms/story-iBQrN8Mdl4uRN7caBa6CMP.html

09-04-2020||World||Wuhan coronavirus lockdown over, but lingering fears slow recovery||Hairstylist “Ah Ping” is back in business now that Wuhan’s coronavirus lockdown has been lifted, but his salon has no customers, only empty chairs and lingering fears over a contagion that continues to haunt the city.Wuhan is waking from its coronavirus nightmare, loosening tight restrictions on movement and business as the global pandemic’s launchpad tries to move on.But full recovery remains hampered by fear of a potential new wave of infections.Many businesses and all schools are still closed, restaurants aren’t allowed dine-in customers, and some neighbourhoods remain sealed off behind barriers.Residents need to show they have a “healthy” rating on a mandatory phone app to leave their homes, use public transport, or enter most public spaces.“When people come out, infections will probably rise. I’m really afraid of this,” said “Ah Ping”, a nickname.The 43-year-old, who declined to give his full name, also worries about getting his life restarted.He paid his salon’s quarterly rent of 15,000 yuan ($2,100) in full just before Wuhan was locked down on January 23. Now another rental payment is due.“Isn’t that terrible? I paid 15,000 in rent and did no business,” he said.‘Not much change’ While many other Chinese cities are getting back to near-normal, Wuhan’s government has made clear that easing controls poses new perils and that a return to usual life will have to wait. In some areas, it’s been two steps forward, one step back.Wuhan authorities said 70 residential neighbourhoods -- out of nearly 7,000 recently declared “epidemic-free” -- lost that status this week, prolonging lockdown measures there.The government has suggested the status revocation was due to the discovery of asymptomatic cases.China initially withheld numbers of asymptomatic cases -- people who test positive but show no symptoms of COVID-19, the pneumonia-like illness caused by the virus.It said on Thursday that the country now has over a thousand such patients under medical observation -- with 674 of those in Hubei, where Wuhan is the provincial capital.Chinese officials have said the virus emerged from wildlife sold for food at a local wet market.Many Wuhan residents expressed to AFP journalists a continued fear about resuming normal activities.A 59-year-old shopkeeper who gave only her surname, Zhou, has reopened her little store, but says people are too scared to come out and shop.Dancing outside the shop to get the blood flowing, Zhou said she also fears moving around the city, rarely going out and only for essentials while wearing protective clothing, mask and gloves.“It’s really hard now. I know some people who have been infected. It’s really scary,” she said.Traffic has picked up after a ban on leaving the city was lifted on Wednesday, but vast numbers of businesses remain closed and plastic barriers in streets hamper movement.“The ban is not lifted, not in residential compounds. There’s not much change,” Zhou said. Health codes Daily new infections in Wuhan are now down to zero on most days, but suspicions linger over the data publicised by the secretive ruling Communist Party that stands accused of a slow response to the outbreak, cover-up attempts, and moves to silence domestic critics.Many residents are still unable to leave their homes due to the mobile phone health code system which tracks if where they live or have visited remain high-risk.This hinders movement back to prosperous coastal regions where many Wuhan citizens work, a major income source for their families.The welcome in those industrial zones is fraying.Wuhan travellers face mandatory 14-day quarantines upon returning to some areas, and web-users in places such as Shanghai have expressed fear and outrage at the prospect of people returning from Wuhan.A delayed recovery will add to the suffering of people like Hao Mei.When the lockdown came the 39-year-old was in Wuhan working odd jobs, so was forced to leave her son and daughter -- aged 14 and 10 -- at home in Enshi, around 550 kilometres (340 miles) away.“It was very difficult because I’m a single parent,” she said, adding that at first she cried every night. “The pressure is very big.”She is now heading back to Enshi, but with no family support the future is dim.“I’ll stay home for three days at most. If I don’t earn any money, I can’t keep my kids alive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-coronavirus-lockdown-over-but-lingering-fears-slow-recovery/story-2bYlwfWFk6QqRXQv22oQ0K.html

She still wakes up at night struggling to breathe.Lakhani, a sales executive, started to show symptoms of Covid-19 while in hospital, where she was admitted for an operation.Seven years ago, she was diagnosed with a rare condition which makes swallowing difficult. The surgery was designed to help her manage this oesophageal disease, called achalasia, the report said.Though her admission to hospital was supposed to be a routine one, the situation became serious very soon. She began to struggle with her breathing and then developed a temperature.While everyone hoped it was just a side-effect of her surgery, a Covid swab test was taken as a precaution. But to the surprise of all, it turned positive for coronavirus.Soon her room was cordoned off and the rest of the ward evacuated.As her condition deteriorated, she required more oxygen. She was then shifted to one of London’s major Covid-19 treatment centres.“Things went from bad to worse - taking a breath became as hard as climbing a mountain,” she wrote on Facebook.“I almost died,” she says, speaking from home to the BBC.“I almost didn’t come out of there. There was a point when I actually started to write difficult messages to my family. I almost died now I’m alive. How can life go back to normal after that?” Lakhani is still not clear whether she developed pneumonia but says even now, from her recovery bed at home in Harrow she can hear a “crackling sound” in her lungs”.According to the World Health Organisation, most people (about 80 per cent) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Lakhani said her recovery has been slow. In hospital she could barely move at first and was given morphine on top of the oxygen because of the pain. She praised the medical staff who treated her. They are “true heroes,” she said.“It was the small wins and things like the nurses making sure Iris had a constant supply of hot tea and a sneaky extra slice of cake that made me smile.” At home, she has to maintain a distance from her husband and continues to be besieged by coughing fits.But she’s relieved that she was able to fight the virus, especially considering how many people have died.The UK’s death toll in the coronavirus pandemic continues to rise and hit 7,097 on Wednesday - a record increase of 938 in a day. The government has urged the public to continue to follow strict social distancing rules before a decision to review the measures can be taken.The UK also has over 55,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, putting immense pressure on the country’s medical system.“I can’t explain the moment I left the hospital, I’ll never take anything for granted again,” she added.

09-04-2020||World||China seeks to contain new coronavirus ‘silent carriers’ to prevent second wave of infections||China took new measures on Wednesday to try to prevent asymptomatic “silent carriers” of the new coronavirus from causing a second wave of infections, as the country reported another modest rise in confirmed cases.Mainland China reported 63 new infections on Wednesday, up from 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said. Of those, 61 were travellers arriving from overseas, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in China to 81,865.While new infections have fallen from their peak in February after China locked down several cities and imposed strict travel restrictions, authorities have called for continued vigilance amid fears of a fresh resurgence of infections.Aside from curbing an influx of infected travellers from abroad, China’s other concern is managing asymptomatic people, or virus carriers who exhibit no clinical symptoms such as a fever or a cough.On China’s Twitter-like Weibo service, “Are asymptomatic people really asymptomatic?” was the third most-discussed topic on Thursday afternoon, highlighting a state media interview with Liu Youning, a professor of respiratory medicine at the People’s Liberation Army General Hospital.Liu said asymptomatic carriers posed little risk, but that people should continue to avoid crowded areas, maintain social distancing, wear masks and wash hands.“Scary, we need to keep safe. Some people are already getting slack, they don’t wear masks when going outside,” wrote a user posting under the name “Lu Ban of the Vast Desert”.China reported 56 new asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of such cases to 657 since data for such infections were published daily from April 1. The State Council, or Cabinet, on Wednesday published new rules to manage asymptomatic coronavirus carriers, or what some state media described as “silent carriers” of the virus. Under the regulations, medical institutions must report detection of asymptomatic cases within two hours of their discovery. Local governments must then identify all known close contacts of the case within 24 hours.Asymptomatic patients will be quarantined collectively for 14 days, and will be counted as confirmed cases if they start to show symptoms. People who have had close contact with them must also be quarantined for two weeks.Earlier this week, a new function appeared on Tencent’s ubiquitous WeChat mobile platform allowing people to check if they have ever sat on trains and planes near an asymptomatic carrier who later became a confirmed case.The heightened sense of caution came as restrictions on outbound movement of people from Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province and epicentre of the outbreak in China, were lifted on Wednesday after a virtual lockdown of over two months.Easing was also evident elsewhere, as the commercial centre of Shanghai said it would begin reopening some schools from April 27.Makeshift hospitalOf the 61 new confirmed cases arriving from overseas, 40 were in China’s northeast Heilongjiang province, which shares a border with Russia. All 40 were returning Chinese nationals, reported Xinhua.The Heilongjiang city of Suifenhe is building a makeshift hospital because imported cases from Russia continue to rise, reported state-controlled tabloid Global Times on Thursday, as all of the city’s isolation hotels were full. Suifenhe has closed its borders to all arrivals and implemented restrictions on the movement of its citizens on Wednesday, similar to measures seen in Wuhan. Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people in the middle reaches of the Yangtze river, still sees tens of new cases of asymptomatic carriers each day. Hubei’s health authority has reported 303 new asymptomatic cases since it began publishing data for such cases on April 1, but only two asymptomatic patients in Wuhan were reported to have developed symptoms and become confirmed case in the same timeframe.Mainland China has reported 657 new asymptomatic cases so far this month. Of those, it said 57 have developed symptoms.Chinese health authorities estimated earlier in April that around two-thirds of the asymptomatic patients will later develop symptoms.As of Wednesday, 3,335 people in China have died from the virus that causes a flu-like respiratory disease. Wuhan accounts for more than 75% of the fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-to-contain-new-coronavirus-silent-carriers-to-prevent-second-wave-of-infections/story-uUQ1NB1J7P9cKdsmCNvdeL.html

09-04-2020||World||‘I’m well’: 103-year-old Italian says courage, faith helped her fight Covid-19||To recover from the coronavirus, as she did, Ada Zanusso recommends courage and faith, the same qualities that have served her well in her nearly 104 years.Italy, along with neighboring France, has Europe’s largest population of what has been dubbed the “super old” — people who are at least 100. As the nation with the world’s highest number of COVID-19 deaths, Italy is looking to its super-old survivors for inspiration.“I’m well, I’m well,” Zanusso said Tuesday during a video call with The Associated Press from the Maria Grazia Residence for the elderly in Lessona, a town in the northern region of Piedmont. “I watch TV, read the newspapers.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicZanusso wore a protective mask, as did her family doctor of 35 years beside her, Carla Furno Marchese, who also donned eyewear and a gown that covered her head.Asked about her illness, Zanusso is modest: “I had some fever.”Her doctor said Zanusso was in bed for a week.“We hydrated her because she wasn’t eating, and then we thought she wasn’t going to make it because she was always drowsy and not reacting,” Furno Marchese said.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“One day she opened her eyes again and resumed doing what she used to before,” Furno Marchese said. The doctor recalled when Zanusso was able to sit up, then managed to get out of bed.What helped her get through the illness? “Courage and strength, faith,” Zanusso said. It worked for her, so she advises others who fall ill to also “give yourself courage, have faith.”COVID-19 can cause mild or moderate symptoms, and most of those who are infected recover. But the elderly and those with existing health problems can be at high risk for more serious illness.The virus has killed nearly 18,000 people in Italy and over 88,000 worldwide. The World Health Organization says 95% of those who have died in Europe were over 60 years old.Under Italy’s five-week-long lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of infections that have overwhelmed hospitals, visitors aren’t allowed at homes for the elderly.Her doctor asked Zanusso what she would like to do when “they open the doors.”“I’d like to take a lovely walk,” she replied. And your three great-grandchildren? “Watch them play together.”Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are leveling off in Italy, and Premier Giuseppe Conte is expected to announce in the coming days how long the lockdown will remain in place, with expectations that some restrictions could be eased.For now, Zanusso is isolated from other residents as she awaits a follow-up swab test to confirm she is negative for the virus.She grew up in Treviso, in the northeastern Veneto region, where she worked for many years in the textile industry. Zanusso, who turns 104 on Aug. 16, had four children — three of whom are living — and has four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.“She’s old, but healthy, with no chronic illness,’’ her doctor said.This week, Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera devoted an entire page to the stories of super-old survivors, called “healing at 100 years old.” The inspirational portraits are a counterpoint to news of large numbers of deaths among elderly people living in Italian nursing homes and other assisted-living facilities.Of the victims, most elderly weren’t tested for COVID-19 if they died in nursing homes, so the numbers don’t figure into Italy’s overall coronavirus death toll, which is the highest in the world.Medical staff “went through a very hard time,’’ said Furno Marchese, the doctor. “It was a great emergency with so many residents ill, so to see a positive outcome was very rewarding, not only for me, but for all the people who worked hard here nonstop.”Outside the nonprofit, 61-bed Maria Grazia Residence, the Italian flag flies at half-staff in tribute to those who died of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-m-well-103-year-old-italian-says-courage-faith-helped-her-fight-covid-19/story-IXOLwZGZKr2tZG1IGwbuzN.html

That doesn’t bother me,” Trump told reporters during a White House news conference. Iran has become one of the world’s coronavirus epicenters, with more than 60,000 people infected and over 3,800 deaths.He was responding to a question on the call made by French President Emanuel Macron to his Iranian counterpart that Europe has started to ship the medical goods to Iran.“Medical good?... That doesn’t bother me,” Trump said.Earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that the US has offered humanitarian assistance to Iran.“I regret that they chose not to take that. I’ve heard people talking about sanctions,” he said.“The world should note there are no sanctions that prevent humanitarian assistance, pharmaceutical medical supplies, pharmaceuticals from going to Iran. We offered American assistance; we try to help other countries get assistance in there as well. We had some ability to do that,” Pompeo said.On March 30, the UK, Germany and France circumvented Iran sanctions by using Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges for the first time to send medical goods to Iran in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Iran has the sixth highest number of fatalities after Italy, Spain, the US, France and the UK. In March, Iran became the first major COVID-19 hotspot outside Asia. It has now suffered more deaths than China, where the outbreak originated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-objection-to-europe-sending-medical-supplies-to-iran-trump/story-iq3wZ9NTHkh0mJgyEA9kiN.html

You know, we stopped counting how many bodies came out,” she said. “This is very serious. This is very real.” As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has now claimed more lives than did the attacks of September 11, the city has been forced to take over new spaces to absorb the loss.Emergency field hospitals have been set up in Central Park and other locales. And refrigerated trucks have fanned out across the city to process the pileup of corpses.As of Wednesday, New York state has had nearly 150,000 reported coronavirus cases and over 6,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.In her interview with Reuters, Monteleone recounted how she and her fiance discovered their front-row seat to the pandemic.When Kozlow was walking their dog last week, he called to tell her that he overheard two doctors saying the trucks would be coming in. Shortly after, Monteleone said she “turned around on the couch and peered out the window and saw it.”“This is what they were saying online was going to be mobilized throughout the city.”The following morning the couple awoke to workers setting up a platform and a ramp to serve two refrigerated trucks. It wasn’t long after that the couple saw “a pretty serious string of bodies.”Monteleone commended the head of Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, Ramon Rodriguez, for checking in on the neighbors.She said the couple were staying put - for now.“Everybody in my personal and professional life has urged us to leave. They don’t think this is a good place to be,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-very-real-from-their-window-new-york-couple-sees-trucks-remove-covid-19-victims-bodies/story-eePY7uf9Ksgo17PqTEeZWN.html
09-04-2020||World||Taiwan protests WHO leader’s accusations of racist campaign||Taiwan’s foreign ministry on Thursday strongly protested accusations from the head of the World Health Organization that it condoned racist personal attacks on him that he alleged were coming from the self-governing island democracy.The ministry expressed “strong dissatisfaction and a high degree of regret, and raised the most solemn protest.” Taiwan is a “mature, highly sophisticated nation and could never instigate personal attacks on the director-general of the WHO, much less express racist sentiments,” the statement said.Taiwan’s 23 million people have themselves been “severely discriminated against” by the politics of the international health system and “condemn all forms of discrimination and injustice,” the statement said.On Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused Taiwan’s foreign ministry of being linked to a months-long campaign against him amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At a press briefing, Tedros said that since the emergence of the novel coronavirus, he has been personally attacked, including receiving at times, death threats and racist abuse.“This attack came from Taiwan,” said Tedros, who is a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister and the WHO’s first African leader.He said Taiwanese diplomats were aware of the attacks but did not dissociate themselves from them. “They even started criticizing me in the middle of all those insults and slurs,” Tedros said. “I say it today because it’s enough.” The basis of his allegations were unclear.Tedros was elected with the strong support of China, one of five permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council and which claims Taiwan as its own territory. He has firmly backed Beijing’s claims to have been open and transparent about the outbreak, despite strong evidence that it suppressed early reports on infections, while echoing its criticisms of the U.S.At China’s insistence, Taiwan has been barred from the U.N. and the WHO and even stripped of its observer status at the annual World Health Assembly. At the same time, it has one of the most robust public health systems in the world, and has won praise for its handling of the virus outbreak.Despite its close proximity to China and the frequency of travel between the sides, Taiwan has reported just 379 cases and five deaths.U.S. and Taiwanese officials met online last month to discuss ways of increasing the island’s participation in the world health system, sparking fury from Beijing, which opposes all official contacts between Washington and Taipei.Also at Wednesday’s briefing, Tedros sought to rise above sharp criticism and threats of funding cuts from President Donald Trump over the WHO’s response to the outbreak.The vocal defense came a day after Trump blasted the agency for being “China-centric” and alleging that it had “criticized” his ban of travel from China as the COVID-19 outbreak was spreading from the city of Wuhan.In a further comment on Tedros’ remarks, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted that the island agreed with his assertion that there was, “No need to use COVID to score political points.”“We agree! Yet without evidence, #Taiwan is accused of orchestrating personal attacks. This claim is baseless, without merit & further marginalizes the good work in which the @WHO is engaged worldwide,” Wu tweeted.Tedros had not appeared to have accused the Taiwanese government of being directly behind the attacks, but merely of condoning them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-protests-who-leader-s-accusations-of-racist-campaign/story-YvyNelJO8eMJCfdNsD36SK.html
09-04-2020||World||UN Security Council to discuss Covid-19 pandemic in closed session today||The United Nations Security Council on Thursday will discuss the prevailing coronavirus situation across the globe in a closed session.The Council’s discussion will be around “Impact of COVID-19 on the issues that fall under the Security Council’s mandate”. The video-teleconferencing session will see UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres participate in the afternoon as a briefer. Last week, Special Envoy from the Dominican Republic to UN Ambassador Jose Singer and President of Security Council for April said that a Council meeting on the coronavirus situation had been requested by five or six ambassadors and the Dominican Republic was working to schedule the discussion.“We have not discussed the issue of a resolution... We are first expecting to hold that meeting, and then we’ll see how events play out,” Singer had said last week. US President Donald Trump has fired a fresh salvo at the World Health Organization, accusing its chief of siding with China and “politicising” the coronavirus pandemic while repeating his threat to freeze the UN agency’s funding.In such a situation, Beijing is likely to face some heat at the UN Covid-19 session today. All the 10 non-permanent members of the UN Security Council have backed the informal discussion led by the UNSC President; the post is held by the Dominican Republic. But whether the closed-door discussion will conclude with any outcome depends on the proposals put up and the exercise of veto powers of China and its ally Russia.Coronavirus has infected more than a million people across the globe and has killed 80,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-to-discuss-covid-19-pandemic-in-closed-session-today/story-CKY8GmycgNBwv9Ip2jpz5I.html

FEMA will then determine if the equipment should be returned for use in the United States, purchased by the US government or exported.President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on Friday that directed federal agencies to use any authority necessary to keep the highly sought-after medical supplies in the United States.Governors, mayors and physicians have voiced alarm for weeks over crippling scarcities of personal protective gear for first-responders and front-line healthcare workers, as well as ventilators and other medical supplies.The move to seize exports will include N95 respirator masks, which filter airborne particles and are used to protect against COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. The US manufacturing company 3M Co , a leading producer of the masks worldwide, said on Monday that it had reached a deal with the Trump administration that would allow it to continue to export the masks to Canada and Latin America despite the new restrictions. The company had said days earlier that ceasing exports to those regions would have “humanitarian implications.”A federal regulation that outlines FEMA’s procedures for seizing and vetting the exports will go into effect on Friday and remain in place until Aug. 10, according to a draft version posted online.FEMA will aim to make decisions about exports quickly and seek to minimize disruptions to the supply chain, the draft regulation said.Some state and local government officials have accused FEMA in recent days of confiscating shipments of masks and other supplies coming from overseas.An official with the US Department of Homeland Security who requested anonymity to discuss the matter earlier this week said half of the protective gear brought to the United States on US government flights can be redirected to high-need areas around the country, but disputed the idea that the equipment had been seized.FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-seize-exports-of-masks-and-gloves-amid-coronavirus-crisis/story-4VdLFVJKhk1zjdGz0KIRJN.html

In a letter to PM Modi, President Bolsonaro compared India’s move to Lord Hanuman and Sanjeevani booti (herb) in the epic Ramayana.“Just as Lord Hanuman brought the holy medicine from the Himalayas to save the life of Lord Rama’s brother Laksmana, and Jesus healed those who were sick and restored the sight of Bartimeu, India and Brazil will overcome this global crisis,” President Bolronaro had said in his letter to Prime Minister Modi.India is the largest manufacturer and exporter of hydroxychloroquine in the world.But on Saturday, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade notified a ban on exports of hydroxychloroquine and any formulation containing the miracle drug from special economic zones (SEZs) and export-oriented units too.President Bolsonaro, who was in the country this January to be chief guest at India’s Republic Day celebrations, spoke with PM Modi the same day. He followed up the conversation with a letter on Tuesday that underscored the important role that he expected hydroxychloroquine to play in the fight against Covid-19.In all, India received similar requests from 20 countries as countries explore any possible cure for the pandemic that has infected 1.4 million people and killed nearly 82,000 around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-thanks-india-for-timely-help-after-nod-to-hydroxychloroquine/story-ABkm3ylEZpEeU1TtMeyXYO.html

The package “will help build that bridge to the recovery on the other side.”The support will see the government pay wage subsidies of A$1,500 every two weeks per employee to help struggling businesses keep people in work. It’s the latest step in Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s plan to ensure the economy can survive in “hibernation” during the health crisis and then quickly be revived when businesses such as restaurants, clubs, casinos and cinemas are allowed to reopen.Since the coronavirus threat emerged, the conservative government has abandoned plans to return and keep the budget in surplus, pumping an unprecedented amount of stimulus into the economy in a bid to avert it from falling into a crippling long-term recession.Total fiscal and monetary stimulus has now exceeded A$320 billion, or 16.4% of gross domestic product. Asked on Sky News Thursday whether further huge fiscal support was likely, Frydenberg said the A$130 billion “jobkeeper” package would be “hard to beat.” Australians would be paying back the debt burden “for years to come,” he said.The jobs-rescue plan was passed on Wednesday in a special sitting of parliament with a reduced number of lawmakers.In other economic measures, Morrison last week announced it will make childcare free to help workers stay in their jobs. On Tuesday, he said a new industry code of practice for commercial tenancies would be legislated to provide rent relief for businesses hit by the outbreak. Any decline in revenue for small- or medium-sized enterprise will be reflected in a proportionate drop in rent they have to pay, he said.Still, Morrison’s government can only do so much. Some economists are forecasting that Australia’s unemployment rate could soar to 12%, from 5.1% in February, as potentially hundreds of thousands of workers lose their jobs amid the shutdown. The nation’s central bank has cutting its rates to 0.25% and shifted to bond-buying operations.Australia’s Huge Household Debt Threatens to Worsen RecessionMorrison has grown more confident that social-distancing restrictions and the nation’s relatively high rates of testing appear to be working to control the outbreak and “flatten the curve” of growth. As of 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Australia had 6,013 confirmed cases, up 1.8% from the day before. Fifty people have died.Authorities are warning they don’t want Australians to relax during the Easter break, which starts on Friday. In New South Wales, the most populous state that’s been hardest hit by the outbreak, police warned on Wednesday they will use the holiday period to patrol country roads, back streets, main highways and caravan parks to ensure people are complying with the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-australia-passes-record-80-billion-employment-rescue-package/story-o7pFUZs0hIEA3RI0ctvXuI.html

09-04-2020||World||Covid-19: South Africa’s minister who flouted lockdown rules sent on leave||South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday placed on special leave a minister seen lunching at a friend’s house in violation of the coronavirus lockdown.Ramaphosa has ordered a three-week national lockdown to try to brake the virus, which has infected 1,749 people, killing 13 of them, according to an official tally.But a picture posted on Instagram on Sunday showed Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams having lunch with five other people at the home of a former deputy minister earlier that day.“President Ramaphosa has placed the Minister on special leave for two months,” the presidency said in a statement. Ramaphosa has “accepted the minister’s apology for the violation but was unmoved by mitigating factors she tendered,” it said.“The nation-wide lockdown calls for absolute compliance on the part of all South Africans,” Ramaphosa was quoted as saying. “None of us -- not least a member of the national executive -- should undermine our national effort to save lives in this very serious situation,” said Ramaphosa. “No-one is above the law.”Shortly after the president’s statement, the minister issued an apology.“I regret the incident and I am deeply sorry for my actions,” said Ndabeni-Abrahams in a statement issued through her ministry. “I hope the president and South Africans will find it in their hearts to forgive me.”“I wish to use this opportunity to reiterate the President’s call for all of us to observe the lockdown rules. They are a necessary intervention to curb the spread of a virus that has devastated many nations.”Last month, just two days into the lockdown, Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu was forced to issue an apology after she posted a video on her Instagram account, joking about how she was struggling to stay home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-south-africa-s-minister-who-flouted-lockdown-rules-sent-on-leave/story-o5269ErOxcXqJBzdsOjzcJ.html
09-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: CDC loosens rules to let essential workers return||In a first, small step toward reopening the country, the Trump administration issued new guidelines Wednesday to make it easier for essential workers who have been exposed to Covid-19 to get back to work if they do not have symptoms of the coronavirus.Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced at the White House that essential employees, such as health care and food supply workers, who have been within 6 feet of a confirmed or suspected case of the virus can return to work under certain circumstances if they are not experiencing symptoms.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe new guidelines are being issued as the nation mourns some 13,000 deaths from the virus and grapples with a devastated economy and medical crises from coast to coast. Health experts continue to caution Americans to practice social distancing and to avoid returning to their normal activities. At the same time, though, they are planning for a time when the most serious threat from Covid-19 will be in the country’s rear-view mirror.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakPresident Donald Trump said that while he knows workers are “going stir crazy” at home, he can’t predict when the threat from the virus will wane.“The numbers are changing and they’re changing rapidly and soon we’ll be over that curve. We’ll be over the top and we’ll be headed in the right direction. I feel strongly about that,” Trump said about the coronavirus, which he called “this evil beast.”“I can’t tell you in terms of the date,” Trump said, adding cases could go down and then once again “start going up if we’re not careful. ”At some point, he said at his daily briefing, social distancing guidelines will disappear and people will be able to sit together at sports events. “At some point we expect to be back, like it was before,” he said.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said if the existing guidelines asking people to practice social distancing through the end of April are successful in halting the spread of the virus, more relaxed recommendations could be in order.He said the White House task force was trying to dovetail public health concerns with practical steps that need to be in place when the 30-day guidelines end at the end of the month so the nation can “safely and carefully march toward some sort of normality.”If, by fall, things start to return to normal, Americans will still need to wash their hands frequently, sick schoolchildren should be kept home and people with fevers need to refrain from going to work, Fauci said during an online interview Wednesday with the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.People also should never shake hands again, Fauci said, only half-jokingly.“I mean it sounds crazy, but that’s the way it’s really got to be,” he said. “Until we get to a point where we know the population is protected” with a vaccine.Under the new guidelines for essential workers, the CDC recommends that exposed employees take their temperatures before their shifts, wear face masks and practice social distancing at work. They also are advised to stay home if they are ill, not share headsets or other objects used near the face and refrain from congregating in crowded break rooms.Employers are asked to take exposed workers’ temperatures and assess symptoms before allowing them to return to work, aggressively clean work surfaces, send workers home if they get sick and increase air exchange in workplaces.Fauci said he hoped the pandemic would prompt the U.S. to look at long-term investments in public health, specifically at the state and local level. Preparedness that was not in place in January needs to be in place if or when Covid-19 or another virus threatens the country.“We have a habit of whenever we get over a challenge, we say, ‘OK, let’s move on to the current problem,’” he said. “We should never, ever be in a position of getting hit like this and have to scramble to respond again. This is historic.”Even the new guidelines will not be a foolproof guard against spreading infection.Recent studies have suggested that somewhere around 10% of new infections might be sparked by contact with individuals who are infected but do not yet exhibit symptoms. Scientists say it’s also possible that some people who develop symptoms and then recover from the virus remain contagious, or that some who are infected and contagious may never develop symptoms.As of Wednesday, the U.S. had more than 400,000 confirmed cases of infection.On the other side of the globe, the journey back to normalcy is further along.In Wuhan, the Chinese industrial city that first reported cases of the new coronavirus, authorities ended a 76-day lockdown Wednesday. Residents can travel in and out of the city without special authorization, but must use a smartphone app showing they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus.Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, chimed in with a cautionary tweet from the sidelines, writing: “Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring — something we have yet to put in place nationwide.”Conservative voices, for their part, are pushing for an economic and social restart, urging Trump to overrule health officials.“At some point, the president is going to have to look at Drs. Fauci and Birx and say, we’re opening on May 1,” Fox commentator Laura Ingraham tweeted. “Give me your best guidance on protocols, but we cannot deny our people their basic freedoms any longer.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.___AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner in Chicago contributed to this report.

09-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: New York hits new coronavirus peak but curve flattening||New York recorded a new single-day high for coronavirus deaths on Wednesday but Governor Andrew Cuomo said the epidemic appeared to be stabilizing. Cuomo said 779 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll in New York state from Covid-19 to 6,268.The previous high of 731 was set on Monday. New York is bearing the brunt of America’s deadly coronavirus pandemic, accounting for around half the number of deaths across the country.The governor said that despite the rise, the hospitalization rate was continuing to decrease because of social confinement orders.“We are flattening the curve,” the governor told reporters.He added that if the rate continues to go down the hospital system will stabilize over the next two weeks, which will “minimize” the need for temporary hospitals. Field hospitals have been set up in Central Park, at the home of the US tennis center, in a convention center and on a US navy ship to deal with the influx of patients. Cuomo said the death toll was high because people put on ventilators when hospitalization rates soared in previous weeks were now passing away. On Monday, the governor extended the state-wide shutdown of schools and non-essential businesses until April 29.He again implored residents to continue to stay at home unless absolutely necessary.“It’s not a time to get complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than where we’ve been doing,” Cuomo said.“We are in the midst of it. We’re not through it. It’s not over,” he added.COVID-19 has killed almost 13,000 people in the United States, and the number of confirmed cases has grown to more than 401,000, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said this week that New York’s death toll could be higher because many deaths occurring at home are not being counted.Meanwhile, preliminary data released Wednesday showed that New York’s Latino and African-American communities were dying of Covid-19 at a higher rate than whites.In multi-ethnic New York City, Hispanic people made up 34 percent of deaths while comprising 29 percent of the population. Black people represent 28 percent of fatalities while comprising 22 percent of the population. Whites make up 27 percent of the death toll and are 32 percent of the Big Apple’s population.“It always seems that the poorest people pay the highest price. Why is that?” Cuomo asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-new-york-hits-new-coronavirus-peak-but-curve-flattening/story-wwCGPetCEAfFU9utVQO1bK.html

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said the model adopted in Bhilwara has set the standard in fight against the pandemic and involved complete sealing of the area for mass screening involving six lakh houses after a doctor tested positive for Covid-19  last month.Barmer district collector Vishram Meena said that all the four are government teachers. All the four have shown their identity cards at the check posts in the way from Jaipur to Barmer while saying them that they are going to join their duty.Barmer’s chief medical and health officer Dr Kamlesh Choudhary said a curfew has been imposed in the district’s Chohtan block and his department has started a screening in the area after the 58-year-old government school principal tested positive.The man, who is from Ramganj, travelled with three others to Barmer on April 5. “After reaching Barmer, the man complained of coronavirus symptoms. His samples were sent for Covid-19 testing on April 7. On Wednesday, he reported positive,” Dr Choudhary said.He said one of the three, who travelled with the principal, has tested negative for Covid-19 while the results of the other two are awaited.The principal, who is reported corona positive have taken a meeting on next day after reaching Barmer. District administration has put all the six under observation. While another three who have traveled with him were put to isolation.The 58-year-old, who was kept in isolation in Barmer on April 6, was referred to the Jodhpur government hospital on Thursday early morning, Dr Choudhary said.He travelled in a private vehicle from Jaipur via Jalore even as Barmer district’s borders have been sealed as part of the lockdown to ensure social distancing.Officials said three medical teams deployed for screening people at Gandhav check post through which the vehicle entered into Barmer have been removed. “Till April 5, three medical teams were deployed at Gandhav checkpoint. Following the district collector’s directive, the three teams were removed. The decision was taken after the borders were completely sealed,” said Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barmer-man-tests-positive-after-a-trip-to-jaipur-s-hot-spot/story-Gc2tBYFX3GTqNzeOyYXF6O.html
09-04-2020||India||17 Ludhiana cops quarantined after thief tests positive||Ludhiana: As many as 30 people, including 17 police personnel, were placed under quarantine on Thursday while a duty magistrate and the staff of a local court in Punjab’s Ludhiana have been asked to go into self-isolation as a preventive measure after they came in contact with an alleged car thief, who has tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. An accomplice of the alleged thief was on the run after escaping from police custody while being taken for medical examination.The in charge of Ludhiana’s Focal Point police station, NAME, is among those quarantined. The alleged thief, Saurav Sehgal, 25, was caught, and produced in the court on April 5. Two residents, who had helped police in arresting Sehgal and 11 of the alleged thief’s family members, were also quarantined. On April 6, the duty magistrate found Sehgal had fever and cough and directed police to have him medically examination before sending him in judicial custody. Police were looking for Sehgal’s alleged accomplice, Navjot Singh, 25, who was also allegedly involved in snatchings and escaped from a local hospital when they were taken for the medical examination.Assistant sub inspector Gurmeet Singh said Sehgal was unwell but Navjot Singh looked fit. “The thief has been sent to an isolation ward but the moment I opened Navjot Singh’s handcuffs, he pushed me and fled.”Three assistant sub-inspectors, two head constables, two constables and two home guards had come in contact with Sehgal on April 5 and 6. The alleged thieves were brought to the Focal Point police station for clicking their pictures to be released with the press note about their arrest. It was here that they came in contact with inspector Mohammad Jamil and a head constable. The accused were then taken to the court and the civil hospital by three police personnel and a home guard. Two constables, including a policewoman, came in contact with the accused while recording their fingerprints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-ludhiana-cops-quarantined-after-thief-tests-positive/story-4HKFtNrjmPKvd1vXzvpiyK.html
09-04-2020||India||Rural women bear the brunt of the lockdown||Ranchi/ Hyderabad/Lucknow/Pune/ Bhopal/ Bhubaneshwar: On Wednesday, 62-year-old Vandini Devi walked five kilometres from her village in Bokaro, Jharkhand to the bank in order to check if money had been credited to her Jan Dhan account. She was disappointed to learn that it hadn’t. A resident of Chargi village, Devi said that she had not received her widow pension since February, either. “We were promised two months’ free food grain, but I was given 5 kilograms of ration for only one month. My younger son, who lives with me, works as a daily wager and he has had no work due to lockdown. I am in big distress,” Devi said.In view of the 21-day national lockdown which began on March 25, India’s rural population has been central to most relief measures announced by states. On March 26 itself, the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that Rs 500 will be credited into Jan Dhan accounts held by women for three months, starting April. There are more than 20.39 crore such accounts. Separately, many states have also allocated funds to keep the Public Distribution System (PDS) flush with supplies so that ration-card holders can receive their dry rations, even as daily wage, manual and agricultural work dries up. At the other end of this are the nearly 4 crore rural women who are the purported recipients of these benefits. Hindustan Times spoke to some of these women across Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.Jharkhand has 1.33 crore Jan Dhan accounts; close to 73 lakh women are expected to receive the sum of Rs 500. According to state level bankers’ committee senior manager Bibhaw Kumar, the money has already been credited for April. “A similar amount will be paid for May and June,” he said.With no money in the bank account, and government assistance awaited, 55-year-old Shahjahan in Lucknow’s Asti village has only 15kg wheat and 10kg rice left for her family of five. On March 30, UP chief minister Adityanath announced relief worth Rs 611 crore to all Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme beneficiaries, following which Shahjahan visited her bank. She said she waited for over an hour as there was a long queue of the people keen to withdraw money. “A few other women like me did not receive any amount in the account. We asked the bank official but he could not give us a satisfactory answer,” said Shahjahan, who is a daily wage worker registered under MNREGS. Shahjahan is the head of the family in the ration card. She said she had to struggle to get the ration due to long queues. “I could not send my children like many other women as we had to go through the biometric process,” she added. No one followed any social distancing at the ration shop, she said. “We were given 10 kg of wheat and 15 kg rice free of cost,” she said. “The government had also assured us pulses and oil too, but I didn’t receive any.”In many parts of the country, work under MNREGS has come to a halt. Crop harvesting too has been affected leading to a break in supply chains, as farmers are unable to send their produce to ‘mandis’. In Maharashtra, for instance, the lockdown is being implemented rigorously, with police patrol cars preventing farmers from engaging labour to harvest the produce and farming activities. Sulekha Naba, a 40-year-old tribal woman in Badipalli village of western Odisha district of Bargarh queued up like other villagers to get the Rs 1000 assistance that chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced for cardholders under the national food security act. She also queued up to receive the Rs 500 deposited in her Jan Dhan account. Naba, a landless daily labourer, has been without work since the lockdown. While she did receive three months ration — 90 kilos of rice for her family of six, which she lugged back to her home a kilometre away — she worried that the cash assistance would hardly be enough to sustain her family. Odisha has 7.4 million households covered under Jan Dhan yojana scheme — that’s 99.85% of the total number of households in the state. Long queues of women to withdraw Rs 500 from their Jan Dhan bank accounts have been witnessed in almost all rural areas in Maharashtra. Yogesh Warkhede, a ‘bank friend’ appointed by Bank of Baroda at Nampur village in Nashik district of Maharashtra said almost 200 people have visited his home to enquire about the deposits. The rush in the branches of nationalised banks is almost three to four times more than a normal day in Nampur village (it has a population of 10,000), he said. Satish Bairagi who works for a primary co-operative society at Nampur in Nashik district and distributes food in the PDS ration shop said that crowds were normal. To an extent, the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu have been able to manage such crowds through an innovative token system: Each family is given a token with a specific date and time to pick up their rations at the Fair Price shops. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh completed the first phase of distribution of rice and other essential commodities, as well as cash assistance in the first week of April itself. Telangana has also authorised local Self Help Groups to help distribute the cash to women. “In Narayanraopet, nobody had to go to the banks. The bank authorities themselves authorised the local self-help group women in the villages to distribute the money to the beneficiaries. Most of the villages have Stree Nidhi (women banks),” said K Yella Reddy, a resident. These banks are operated by the Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas. The state has 95.9 lakh Jan Dhan account holders.In Kerala, ration holders are classified on the basis of their economic vulnerability. The state did away with biometric identification on April 1 to aid the process of distribution. It has now started supplying the ration based on SMSes in order to control the rush. To ease cash distribution, it began to offer tokens to residents, based on whether their account number is odd or even. Not all states have been able to use technology seamlessly, however. In Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh, Guddi Bai Lodhi, 58, went to the branch of Gramin Bank to collect her Rs 500. “When my turn came after more than an hour the bank clerk said the ‘link’ of the computer was not working. Then I proceeded to another branch of the bank where there were already 50 people waiting for their turn to withdraw the amount.”She managed to withdraw the amount and purchase a few grocery items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rural-women-bear-the-brunt-of-the-lockdown/story-sp9O1n21C9pK1oISVGa1VI.html
09-04-2020||India||Vital to keep warships Covid-free: Navy Chief||NEW DELHI: At a time when the US Navy is grappling with a surge in Covid-19 cases, Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh stressed that it Is vital to ensure that operational assets such as warships and submarines remain free of the virus and the navy is combat ready at all times.In a 15-minute video message to naval personnel, Singh said, “It is a very difficult task because physical distancing on board warships, especially submarines, is a great challenge… We have to keep our guard up and retain our sights on being combat ready.”Scores of sailors on board aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the disease, and its commanding officer, Captain Brett Crozier, was fired after the leak of a scathing letter he wrote to the navy’s leadership about the unfolding health crisis on his warship. Acting secretary of the US Navy Thomas Modly resigned earlier this week after delivering a controversial speech to the Theodore Roosevelt crew in which he was critical of Crozier.French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle has cut short a deployment and is returning to its home port in Toulon with around 40 sailors showing Covid-19 symptoms.As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the world, Singh told his men that while they should hope for the best, the navy should plan for the worst. “We need to be ready for the worst-case scenario and to my mind, it will be a long battle,” the navy chief said. He said the deadly virus posed a real, immediate and unprecedented danger and the navy should stay prepared for challenging times ahead.“Each one of us has put our shoulder to the wheel in these very difficult times. But the challenge will only intensify in the days and weeks ahead. And it will require us to further augment our preparedness. It can no longer be business as usual and we will have to take concrete measures so that we are prepared to tackle the full onslaught of this deadly virus,” Singh said.The navy chief said it is imperative to redouble efforts to ensure that navy personnel and their families stay safe and healthy. “We are the last bastion in this fight. And if we who are supposed to be the care givers become care seekers, it will lead to a big problem,” Singh said.The navy chief said all commands of the navy have started offering battlefield nursing assistant training to non-medical personnel and the initiative would help if casualties increased .Singh said even if the country-wide lockdown were to lifted, movement of naval personnel would be permitted only in a deliberate and coordinated fashion. “Even if it is delayed, it’s fine. But we won’t do anything a rush,” he said. Movement of military personnel is currently on hold to prevent the spread of infection.He said the navy is currently focused on work related to national security, health services and essential services. “Other tasks that involved the gathering of people have stopped. I know a lot of you are separated from your loved ones and families and many have parents in villages where they may need care and help. I know you are facing many difficulties. But I can say with satisfaction that the naval community has risen to the occasion effectively,” Singh said, adding that navy would have to intensify its efforts if the situation worsened.He said the lockdown should enable naval personnel to “unlock their true potential.”The armed forces have taken a raft of preventive measures to stop the spread of the infection within their ranks. These include cancellation of all non-essential training, conferences and travel; a freeze on postings and foreign assignments; avoiding any assembly that involves more than 50 personnel; postponing of all courses for officers; and encouraging personnel to work from home wherever possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vital-to-keep-warships-covid-free-navy-chief/story-M0pGmbUQNkCkhpfmNXzxhP.html

Speaking to reporters at his daily press conference, the Chief Minister announced that the Ayurvedic treatment was being offered alongside the regular allopathic treatment and in consultation with the doctors and the health department. “I am happy to announce that we are the first state to use Ayurvedic treatment for quarantined patients as well as for patients who are positive with proper protocols in consultation with our medical team,” Sawant who is himself an Ayurvedic doctor, said. “Along with the medical team which is working there, our Ayurvedic doctors -- the Ayurvedic Medical College and Ayurvedic Medical Association -- experts they discussed over what medicines can be given and already with the consultation with the health department we have started the treatment,” he added. Sawant has however denied claims that Ayurveda can cure Covid19 as claimed by the Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Naik, but said that while there is no cure for the disease, the Ayurvedic treatment will only help build immunity to fight the disease. Goa has six active Covid-19 patients with one 55-year-old patient having recovered from the dreaded disease while all the others are stable. “One good thing is that all our patients are doing very well, they are recovering, we have full faith in the team of doctors,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-rolls-out-ayurvedic-treatment-for-covid-19-patients/story-aeZXDhVQd8yYJpBfg8pE9N.html
09-04-2020||India||Data on Bengal’s Covid-19 cases appears opaque, raises questions||The West Bengal government said on Thursday that only five people had died of Covid-19 in the state till Thursday afternoon and the number of people to test positive had gone up by 12 in a day to touch 107. The data, was however, taken with a pinch of salt by many citizens with questions being raised about the government’s policy.The government had said on Monday it will consult an expert committee of doctors before linking any fatality to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), after allegations that it was suppressing information about the deadly infection.“We have formed a committee of five doctors who will decide the actual cause of death. They are the experts, I am not. We do not want to create panic among people. Please trust the doctors,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Monday.Unlike other states, the West Bengal government is reluctant to attribute the deaths of Covid-19 patients with pre-existing conditions like heart disease or diabetes to the virus alone, though experts say that such conditions make the Covid-19 disease deadlier.HT has accessed an order issued on April 5, according to which doctors signing death certificates must fill out a form which is then scrutinized by the committee of five doctors. Those signing the certificates are also required to attach 24 test reports, including for scrub typhus, dengue, malaria, urea, creatinine, blood, urine, CPK (enzymes in blood to diagnose heart attack) and Procalcitonin (substance in blood produced by bacterial infection). Some of the other tests reports asked for are SPo2 with time (oxygen saturation), ABG with time (arterial blood gas test), USG of abdomen and D Dimer (test for serious blood clot) CT scan reports of the thorax and a liver function test.On Wednesday this week, the chief minister announced that Covid-19 cases were restricted to only 7 identified pockets in West Bengal. Additionally, it set up a data analysis cell comprising 9 members including six doctors, to collect and collate data on a real time basis, “examine it and detect patterns and under-currents”.Since the government has neither confirmed nor denied reports of 8 other fatalities and set up the data analysis cell, West Bengal’s official death toll stood at just five till Thursday evening. . The first person to test positive was an 18-year-old UK returnee on March 17. The first death was of a 57-year-old at a private hospital happened on March 23. At that time, cumulative positives stood at 7. On March 27, with five new persons testing positive, the cumulative number went up to 15. ON March 31, with five new people testing positive, the cumulative number went up to 27 and the number of dead stood at 3.The format of the daily health bulletin issued by the state government was first changed on April 1, when two more deaths were reported. The bulletin stuck to 3 fatalities, and appended a note, which read, “Two male persons both aged 57 years and one male person aged 62 years all having Severe Acute Respiratory Illness expired. One of them had Chronic Renal Failure, another had Respiratory Failure and the third one had hypertension and other co-morbid conditions. They had all reportedly tested positive, which is subject to confirmation.”From that day on, the government began to make a distinction between those dead people, who had first tested positive, and those who died of Covid-19 and those who were infected with Covid-19 but died of co-morbidity. The bulletin was still providing the cumulative number of people testing positive, which, on April 1, stood at 37. But for the next two days, the government issued no bulletin and instead held press conferences at the state secretariat in the evenings. From April 4, the format of the bulletin changed entirely. The government began to give data only for ‘active cases’ and made no mention of the total figure. This led to confusion over the number of total positives, as the union ministry of health and family welfare’s website gave state-wise data for the cumulative figure. For example, on April 4, the state’s bulletin put the number of ‘active cases’ at 49, but the union ministry’s website put the state’s cumulative figure at 69.There were no bulletins on April 2 and 3 and, March 31 onwards, the bulletins started releasing late, often after 9 pm.From the April 4 bulletin onwards, the column for the dead was removed. There was no bulletin on April 6. However, breaking her long silence on the number of Nizamuddin Markaz returnees in the state, the chief minister gave some figures on April 8. “Around 10 to 12 days ago we had quietly quarantined 108 foreigners and 69 people from Bengal who had attended the Delhi congregation. The foreigners had come from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar. All 177 have been kept in a quarantine facility developed at the Haj Centre,” Banerjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-on-bengal-s-covid-19-cases-appears-opaque-raises-questions/story-kRKa8O3eLbObMbU3KvRLRM.html

Russia has evacuated more than 1,000 of its citizens in special flights.The two sides also decided to remain in touch for “monitoring and facilitating the emergent needs of medicines and equipment on both sides”, said one of the people cited above.Referring to the Russian chairmanship of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), Morgulov informed Shringla of different preparatory meetings which are being held through video conferencing in the coming days, the people said.A video conference of health ministers of the SCO states is expected to be held in mid-April.Both sides decided to remain in close touch on the Covid-19 situation and bilateral and multilateral matters, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-russia-discuss-situation-of-stranded-citizens/story-48i09RRfV6cScxrgWQc2YL.html
09-04-2020||India||‘This too shall pass’: Naveen Patnaik extends Odisha lockdown till April 30||Odisha became the first State to extend the lockdown till April 30 as chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday underlined that it was more important to protect lives. The CM added that schools and educational institutions in the state will remain closed till June 17 and requested the Centre not to start train and air services to the state till April 30. “Coronavirus is the biggest threat that the human race has faced in more than a century. In a powerful nation like the US, the corona cases have jumped from 3,000 to 4 lakh. Starting from the 9/11 attack to several other wars, where the US people and soldiers were killed, more people have died of coronavirus. But still lockdown could not be implemented entirely in the US,” said the CM.“Life will not be the same ever. All of us must understand this and face it boldly together. With our sacrifice and with the blessing of Lord Jagannath, this too shall pass.”The first Covid-19 case in the state was reported on March 15. Since then, the number in the state has touched 44 cases and one death. Patnaik thanked people for their cooperation and said facing the situation is the only way forward.The CM said his government has requested the neighbouring States to take good care of Odia migrant workers stranded in their States due to lockdown. The chief minister said Odisha is taking steps to do at least 1 lakh rapid testing. From April 12, Odisha would test 1,000 samples a day at four testing centres. Capital Bhubaneswar has emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot with 35 of the 44 cases being reported from there. The government has announced five containment zones in the city to stop the spread of the virus. However, in the absence of testing samples from the districts, officials are not sure if the disease has spread to other places.The government however made it clear that farmers in the state will be allowed to undertake farming operations for the Rabi season and also prepare for the Kharif season despite lockdown. However, they will have to ensure social distancing while they work on the fields,” the agriculture department said.The government also said that marketing and transportation of agricultural inputs, agricultural and horticultural products to markets both intra and inter-state are permitted without any restrictions by retailers and transporters. “Seeds, fertilizers, and pesticide outlets, seed processing units in both government and private sectors may be operated, without restrictions. Agro machinery movement/custom hiring centres and operation needs are allowed for all agricultural operations,” the agriculture department said.Finance department officials said the extended lockdown may adversely impact the State economy with revenue collection dipping below normal. Till April 7, the State managed to collect Rs 109 crore with contributions from the mining sector. “Just about 5 per cent of the GST E-way bill has been used. There has been almost no vehicle registration or land registration due to closure of the offices of transport department and land revenue department,” said a senior official.Odisha has demanded that the Centre should immediately release funds to the states under the various centrally sponsored schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Under MGNREGA, the state government is expected to get Rs 551 crore under labour component and Rs 251 crore under material component from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-too-shall-pass-naveen-patnaik-extends-odisha-lockdown-till-april-30/story-YkKUqZFerEo3QjU4JmQbeL.html

It is a positive thing for us as none of those thousands from Assam who returned to the state last month have been reported Covid-19 positive till now,” Sarma said.Assam government will provide transportation for those in quarantine facilities to return home. Those in home isolation won’t be monitored further by healthcare workers.Sarma said the government would next try to bring back those from the state who are stranded outside. Till Thursday, Assam had recorded 28 Covid-19 positive cases. Twenty seven of them were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-quarantine-home-isolation-ends-70-000-in-assam/story-KuMqkQLcImRdWjSEzjxcgJ.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19: 381 containment zones in the city||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has created 381 containment zones – areas that are sealed by the civic body, with help from the police, as a resident has tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 or close contacts of positive patients reside – by Thursday. The number was 146 on March 31.The western suburbs have the highest number of containment zones (145), following by the island city at 127, and eastern suburbs at 109. The BMC had on Tuesday had barred selling of fruits and vegetables on footpaths and in open markets in containment zones. However, the rules differ for each ward, depending on the number of cases and clusters. For instance, N ward, which covers Ghatkopar, announced on Thursday that people from areas other than the containment zones, too, cannot step out of their homes for fruits and vegetables, except on Monday and Thursday. On the contrary, F-North ward, which covers Sion, Matunga and Wadala, have barred selling of fruits and vegetables only in containment zones, leaving the rest untouched. People violating these orders have to face strict action. A ward officer said, “Partial shutdown or overall shutdown depends on the ward and its population density. If ward officers are unable to handle the crowds, they can order a complete shutdown.”Like in case of 10 crucial roads in Dharavi, where traffic, vegetable, fruit sellers and hawkers will not be allowed till further order. The roads are Mahim Fatak, Andhra Valley Road, Dharavi Main Road, Dharavi Cross Road, Matunga Labour Camp, Sant Rohidas Marh, TH Katariya Marg, AKG Nagar, Madina Nagar and Chitranagari.Meanwhile, the BMC on Thursday said it will also conduct door-to-door screening of all affected areas in Dharavi. The number of positive cases in Mumbai has reached 876 so far, with 54 deaths.

09-04-2020||India||Finance Ministry exempts customs duty, cess on import of Covid-19 test kits, ventilators, face masks||The Centre on Thursday exempted imports of Covid-19 test kits, ventilators and face masks from import duty and the health cess, the Finance Ministry announced late on Thursday evening.The two exemptions shall be available upto 30 September 2020. Most of these items attracted a 7.5per cent basic customs duty. The 5% health cess on the customs duty payable on medical devices was introduced in 2020 to fund expansion of medical infrastructure in the country.The finance ministry said the decision had been taken considering the immediate requirement of these items in the context of the Covid-19.Thursday’s decision comes as the government and the health sector looks to import more of these devices to supplement domestic production as the disease continues to spread.Just a few hours earlier, the Indian Council of Medical Research also liberalised its testing guidelines that calls for testing “asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case” between days 5 and day 14 of coming in contact with a Covid-19 patient.India’s restrictive Covid-19 testing policy has been linked by experts to a lower proportion of people testing positive than in many other countries. It is feared that the number of patients would rise if India were to test greater numbers. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently explained a spike in Delhi cases - apart from those linked to the Tablighi Jamaat - to the city’s aggressive testing policy.According to the Union Health Ministry, the number of patients in the country has topped 5,800 patients. Since there is a lag between states confirming Covid-19 cases and the Health Ministry updating its database, the number of cases is expected to have crossed 6,000.The 21-day national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ends next week but it is expected that the central government may not abruptly lift the lockdown. State governments, which have lately shifted the focus to areas that have reported coronavirus cases, have been focussing on sealing these locations. As part of this protocol, people in these containment zones have been prohibited from stepping out, not even to go to grocery stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/finance-ministry-exempts-customs-duty-cess-on-import-of-covid-19-test-kits-ventilators-face-masks/story-oLcjVvNRM0O6do7kIXyjfM.html
09-04-2020||India||India eases trade restrictions for 25 countries after stock-taking||India has so far lifted Covid-19-related trade restrictions for commercial sales, mainly of pharmaceutical products, and provision of aid for some 25 countries, including the US and the UK, people familiar with developments said on Thursday.The lifting of trade restrictions was done after a comprehensive stock-taking exercise was completed, and the restrictions were eased on a case-to-case basis, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Among the countries that have benefited from the easing of the restrictions are the US, the UK, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. In the case of larger countries, the restrictions were eased to facilitate commercial sales of pharmaceutical products such as hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol.The restrictions were eased for several smaller countries in India’s neighbourhood such as Sri Lanka and the Maldives to facilitate the provision of aid, including medical supplies.These issues figured during a virtual meeting on Thursday between foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and members of the Kolkata-based Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), led by the chamber’s president Mayank Jalan and immediate past president Rudra Chatterjee.The discussions with the members of the ICC focussed on different aspects of border trade with neighbouring countries, meeting contractual and export commitments during India’s lockdown period, and potential challenges and opportunities for Indian businesses and industry in the post-Covid-19 phase, the people said.The virtual meeting was organised at the request of the ICC, whose members were also briefed by Shringla and additional secretary (economic relations) P Harish about the external affairs ministry’s initiatives to assist Indian citizens around the world and foreign nationals in India.On Sunday, India partially eased restrictions on the export of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol and removed restrictions on the sales of 14 other drugs. The move followed requests from US President Donald Trump and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro to lift the hold on exports of hydroxychloroquine, whose use has been recommended by some experts to fight Covid-19.Bolsonaro thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India for helping Brazil with hydroxychroloquine during his address to the nation on Wednesday.“We have more good news. As an outcome of my direct conversation with the prime minister of India, we will receive, by Saturday, raw materials to continue our production of hydroxychloroquine so that we can treat patients of Covid-19 as well as of lupus, malaria, and arthritis. I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India for such timely help to the people of Brazil,” he said.Britain’s action high commissioner Jan Thompson also thanked India on Thursday for allowing exports of essential drugs. She tweeted, “Thank you @narendramodi and the Government of India for approving the export of paracetamol to the UK. Global cooperation is critical in the fight against #COVID19. UK and India have track record of working together as a #ForceforGood tackling global challenges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eases-trade-restrictions-for-25-countries-after-stock-taking/story-0jVTV1LDjzrjUlxhte54xM.html

The spokesperson added: “The Kashmir issue is a dispute left from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the Charter of the UN, Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.”China also “opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation”, the spokesperson said.Responding to these remarks, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava rejected the reference to Jammu and Kashmir made by the Chinese spokesperson.“China is well aware of India’s consistent position on this issue. The union territory of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and shall continue to be an integral part of India. Issues related to Jammu and Kashmir are [an] internal matter to India,” he said.“It is, therefore, our expectation that other countries, including China, would refrain from commenting on matters that are internal affairs of India and respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We also expect China to recognise and condemn the scourge of cross-border terrorism that affects the lives of the people of India, including in Jammu and Kashmir,” he added.On March 10, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN had delivered a letter from foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to the president of the Security Council, which called on the Council to take up the Kashmir issue.On the same day, at the request of Pakistan, China, as the then president of the Security Council, circulated the letter as an official document of the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-rejects-china-s-reference-to-kashmir-issue/story-s625dEaGIUHmfDlcJrG2eM.html

IOC has advised its distributors to give priority refill deliveries to customers getting subsidised gas cylinders under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) for whom the government has announced three refills free of cost during the months April, May and June this year.“As part of this, the Corporation has already initiated the transfer of the RSP [retail selling price] for the first LPG refill to the bank accounts linked by its PMUY customers for direct subsidy payments. Accordingly, a total amount of over Rs 2,780 crore is being transferred to the bank accounts of about 3.7 crore PMUY customers, and the process is likely to be completed in the next two days.At the time of refill delivery, a beneficiary of subsidised gas cylinder is required to pay the full market price for the refill to the delivery boy for which the person gets the subsidy amount in her bank account in advance. “PMUY customers who have taken delivery of a refill in April prior to the transfer of money in their bank accounts will also be eligible to book for a free refill after 15 days’ gap,” it said.In view of Covid-19 lockdown, the LPG distributors will not insist upon hard copy of any document required from the PMUY customers, the company said. “The required documents can be captured digitally and hard copies submitted after the lockdown is lifted for maintenance of proper records,” it added.IOC said it has also tied up additional imports of the product for April and May -- to the tune of about 50% over normal imports -- to ensure uninterrupted availability of bulk LPG for its bottling plants, it said.The company, which is the biggest refiner and fuel retailer in the country, is taking steps to increase LPG output by optimising operations, it said.“Thanks to the coordinated efforts of the supply points and the marketing network, Indian Oil could deliver more than 3.38 crore LPG cylinders to its customers in the last 15 days since lockdown, that is, 26 lakh cylinders every single working day,” the statement said.IOC’s bottling plants too are working extended hours, operating night shifts and on public holidays to meet the growing demand.The company appealed to its customers not to resort to panic-booking or visit the showrooms and godowns of their distributorships for obtaining refills and book cylinders through digital modes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-lockdown-ioc-to-transfer-rs-2-780-crore-in-bank-accounts-of-37-mn-lpg-beneficiaries/story-Ix0vtWhXaxWJ8RuQ9PkHnJ.html

The civic body has increased its testing in Dharavi by this method. We can control the spread of disease in the surrounding area. We have also identified buildings with patients and sealed them.”During door-to-door visits, after getting details such as the address of the patient, a special team (flying squad) identifies all high- and low-risk contacts of the patient. After cross-checking his/her travel history, the health staff tracks every person who has come in contact with the infected person for symptoms and then asks them to go for the test. The BMC has received more than 10,000 calls on Covid-19 helpline, of which 319 symptomatic persons have been referred for the test. The BMC’s health department has advised institutional quarantine for 1,224 high-risk persons through telephone counselling.

The civic body now plans to increase its contact tracing to ensure more persons with symptoms of Covid-19, or who are at high risk of catching the virus are identified and quarantined in time. While NSCI in Worli has been readied with a capacity of 500 quarantine beds, preparations at NESCO and Andheri Sports Complex are on. The number of beds at the latter two is yet to be decided.After NSCI was readied on Wednesday, Maharashtra Minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted: “The NSCI dome being transformed into a huge quarantine centre as we step up our contact tracing and testing in @mybmcWardGS (G/South Ward). Till now, our contact tracing has been highest and testing too.

09-04-2020||India||ICMR updates testing strategy for Covid-19||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Thursday updated its testing strategy for Covid-19 that now affected almost 6,000 people in the country. According to the revised strategy, “asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between days 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contact”.It also brought under the testing protocol all symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days. All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases will also have to be tested. Follow coronavirus latest updates here.The new strategy will also cover all symptomatic health care workers and all patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever and cough and/or shortness of breath), the ICMR said. In hotspots/cluster (as designated by the Union ministry of health and family welfare) in large migration gatherings/evacuees centres, all symptomatic ILI (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose) will have to be tested within 7 days of illness (Real-time polymerase chain reaction or rRT-PCR) After 7 days of illness, the ICMR suggested an antibody test (If negative, confirmed by rRT-PCR).There are 139 government laboratories and 65 private ones that are currently authorised to carry out tests for Covid-19. Private labs have started testing only recently.Earlier Thursday, the ICMR that it won’t recommend hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) medicine for Covid-19 patients unless tests show satisfactory results.ICMR’s top scientist Raman Gangakhedkar once again reiterated his statement that India has still not entered the third stage (or community transmission) of Covid-19 outbreak.There has been a huge demand for Hydroxychloroquine after preliminary trials in China suggested it boosted recovery and lowered the severity of the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-updates-testing-strategy-for-covid-19/story-gXlpBcqi40wEiL3QAXFqZL.html
09-04-2020||India||Battle against Covid-19 takes political turn in Bengal as BJP, TMC trade barbs||Perhaps unlike any other state, Bengal’s battle against Covid-19, both with regard to prevention and cure of the disease and providing relief during the lockdown, has turned political, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC) trading barbs on a daily basis.Over the past one week, senior BJP leaders, including state president Dilip Ghosh, union minister Babul Supriyo, Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta and BJP’s IT cell’s national head Amit Malviya took to social media to criticize the Mamata Banerjee-led government on a range of issues, including politicizing relief work, faulty implementation of the lockdown and suppressing data with regard to the number of Covid19 patients. In contrast, the Left, reserved all their praise for the Left-run Kerala government, and has kept itself from criticizing the Bengal government, saying that they wouldn’t bring politics into times of a national disaster. In response, when the Left sent Mamata a letter suggesting some measures, she promptly invited the Left leaders for a detailed discussion at the state secretariat on April 7. Supriyo, who recently made a series of social media posts over the past few days targeting the state government, wrote in one of his tweets that “WB Govt is into serious hara-kiri” and in another wrote, “WB under #TMchhi is lying thru their teeth!”The ‘pinned tweet’ in Supriyo’s account, posted on April 7, says, Truth of @MamataOfficialji’s regime in WB. Every1 is complaining • Nurses, Doctors spilling beans on condition of Anonymity • And, if there is so much smoke, Didi must b playing with Fire @AmitShah @PMOIndia @JPNadda @BJP4India #Covid_19.” This post also had a video attached which said “Mamata Banerjee is doing what China did to the world.”Supriyo argued that he was doing all these “NOT FOR POLITICS - NOT TO SCORE ANY POLITICAL POINTS ON @MamataOfficial but FOR the people of Bengal because I am OF THEM - BY them & therefore remain committed to the larger picture!”On April 7, Dasgupta shared on Twitter the photo of a text that he claimed to be “a copy of a message circulated on a WhatsApp group of senior bureaucrats in W Bengal”. The photo attached to this tweet read: “To all DMs, DNOs and Div Com – District Magistrates are advised not to respond to any query or message from officers of GoI. They should not give any report to anybody in GoI directly. In case of health related matters the concerned officer may be politely advised to contact principal secretary health and in case of queries on lockdown measures the officer may be advised to contact the chief secretary.”Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, skipped one of the two video conferences that PM Modi held with chief ministers of different states, twice put the entire blame on the Centre for Tablighi Jamaat’s March 15 event at Nizamuddin Markaz in New Delhi, repeatedly accused the Centre of not providing the state with adequate protective gears, masks and sanitizers for those in the frontline of battling Covid-19 and also of holding on to the state’s legitimate dues. “I am sorry to say that the IT cell of a political party is spreading fake news,” she said on April 6, though without naming BJP. At the same breath, while drawing an oblique reference to the ‘9 pm 9-min’ show of April 5, she said, “Those who have hit the streets with kansar (a musical instrument used in religious events) and ghonta (bells) are misleading the people. This is not the time for politics.” “The Centre is not helping at all. We are doing everything on our own,” she said on April 6.Her nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee was more direct while criticizing the ‘9 pm 9-min’ show. In a tweet on the night of April 5, he wrote, “With the firecrackers, fancy diyas & sky lanterns, we have become the first ever Nation to celebrate a pandemic #COVID19 I am also contemplating how many actually followed the norms of #lockdown to gear up for this. What was being preached: self-isolation or self-destruction?”While Mamata Banerjee turned down the Centre’s request to let jute mills and tea gardens functions, Supyiyo took digs at the state government for exempting flower, beetle leaves and sweet shops from the lockdown. “Opening up Flowers, Paan, Sweet Shops! R U kidding me?” Supriyo wrote on Twitter on April 8.Political analysts Amal Mukhopadhyay said, “Both the parties are trying to exploit the situation in their own interest. This is extremely unfortunate and undesirable. This is absolutely not the time for a blame game. I would appeal to them to practice restraint.” Incidentally, BJP emerged as TMC’s principal challenger in 2019 by bagging 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats against 22 won by TMC. The state-wide civic elections in more than 100 municipal bodies are due in May-June and the Assembly elections are due in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battle-against-covid-19-takes-political-turn-in-bengal-as-bjp-tmc-trade-barbs/story-QbOL0xrarBNItgEBZnG45K.html

The prisoner claimed that as there were allegedly two cases of inmates being infected with the virus hence sought bail and cited the Supreme Court’s direction to decongest jails. But the court said that due to the rising cases of Covid-19 infections in the city, the man was safer in the jail as the virus could be better contained there and the jails were well equipped to deal with the same.Also read: Covid-19: Mumbai identifies 21 hotspots, imposes curfew-like restrictionsJustice Gautam Patel while hearing the bail application of Jitendra Mishra lodged in Taloja jail was informed by advocate Shailendra Singh and advocate Aashish Shukla that bail was being sought based on the directions of the Supreme Court to decongest jails and not on merit.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.Singh submitted that Mishra had been in Taloja jail for the last 18 months. After a prisoner was released based on the SC directions, Mishra’s family got to know that there were two cases of Covid-19 persons in the jail and hence wanted Mishra to be released on bail for his safety and well-being. However, chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakeray refuted the claims about the infected persons and said that there was no communication from the jail authorities regarding the same and opposed the application.After hearing the submissions justice Patel observed, “You are not aware of the situation in the city where entire areas have been sealed to contain the spread of the virus.”While referring to the G-South ward and Worli Naka that had been sealed after cases of coronavirus infected persons surfaced, Patel told Mishra, “You are safer in the jail than in your home in Ghatkopar. The jails are better equipped to contain the spread of the virus and there is no point in coming out on bail and becoming more susceptible to the virus or spreading it in the family.”Patel, however, said that further hearing could take place before the regular court after the lockdown ends.Maharashtra recorded 162 new Covid-19 cases since Wednesday night, taking the count in the state to 1297 Thursday morning. Mumbai has reported the majority of the case at 857.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-bombay-hc-tells-prisoner-he-is-safer-in-jail-refuses-bail/story-eok2gxaseYFeWmCarZ4imL.html
09-04-2020||India||Vital to keep warships free of Covid-19, says Navy chief||At a time when the US Navy is grappling with a surge in Covid-19 cases, Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh stressed that it is vital to ensure that operational assets such as warships and submarines remain free of the virus and the navy is combat ready at all times.In a 15-minute video message to naval personnel, Singh said, “It is a very difficult task because physical distancing on board warships, especially submarines, is a great challenge… We have to keep our guard up and retain our sights on being combat ready.”Scores of sailors on board aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the disease, and its commanding officer, Captain Brett Crozier, was fired after the leak of a scathing letter he wrote to the navy’s leadership about the unfolding health crisis on his warship. Acting secretary of the US Navy Thomas Modly resigned earlier this week after delivering a controversial speech to the Theodore Roosevelt crew in which he was critical of Crozier.French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle has cut short a deployment and is returning to its home port in Toulon with around 40 sailors showing Covid-19 symptoms.As the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the world, Singh told his men that while they should hope for the best, the navy should plan for the worst.“We need to be ready for the worst-case scenario and to my mind, it will be a long battle,” the navy chief said.He said the deadly virus posed a real, immediate and unprecedented danger and the navy should stay prepared for challenging times ahead.“Each one of us has put our shoulder to the wheel in these very difficult times. But the challenge will only intensify in the days and weeks ahead. And it will require us to further augment our preparedness. It can no longer be business as usual and we will have to take concrete measures so that we are prepared to tackle the full onslaught of this deadly virus,” Singh said.The navy chief said it is imperative to redouble efforts to ensure that navy personnel and their families stay safe and healthy. “We are the last bastion in this fight. And if we who are supposed to be the care givers become care seekers, it will lead to a big problem,” Singh said.The navy chief said all commands of the navy have started offering battlefield nursing assistant training to non-medical personnel and the initiative would help if casualties increased .Singh said even if the countrywide lockdown were to lifted, movement of naval personnel would be permitted only in a deliberate and coordinated fashion. “Even if it is delayed, it’s fine. But we won’t do anything a rush,” he said. Movement of military personnel is currently on hold to prevent the spread of infection.He said the navy is currently focused on work related to national security, health services and essential services. “Other tasks that involved the gathering of people have stopped. I know a lot of you are separated from your loved ones and families and many have parents in villages where they may need care and help. I know you are facing many difficulties. But I can say with satisfaction that the naval community has risen to the occasion effectively,” Singh said, adding that navy would have to intensify its efforts if the situation worsened.He said the lockdown should enable naval personnel to “unlock their true potential.”The armed forces have taken a raft of preventive measures to stop the spread of the infection within their ranks. These include cancellation of all non-essential training, conferences and travel; a freeze on postings and foreign assignments; avoiding any assembly that involves more than 50 personnel; postponing of all courses for officers; and encouraging personnel to work from home wherever possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vital-to-keep-warships-free-of-covid-19-navy-chief/story-4wAm72shRP1gufCn90vhLN.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Mumbai identifies about 200 hotspots, imposes curfew-like restrictions||About 200 hotspots of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have been identified in Mumbai and Mumbai suburbs and curfew-like restrictions imposed in these places to contain the fast-spreading viral infection, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said on Thursday.The stringent restrictions will come into effect immediately and continue till further orders. No one will be allowed to venture out of their houses in these hotspots and essential items will be home-delivered, authorities decided.The move came a day after Delhi announced stringent restrictions in 23 containment zones and Uttar Pradesh did so for over 100 hotspots. People have been barred from stepping outside in these areas, which have been sealed, and essentials are being home-delivered . Frontline workers, such as health care staff and doctors, are exempt.Mumbai has already identified 381 “containment zones” to fight the disease and take necessary steps to contain the spread of the infection. On Thursday, the civic body internally categorised areas inside these places into red (high risk), orange (moderate risk) and blue (low risk) zones for better management of resources and strict enforcement of the lockdown guidelines.“In these red zones, there will be no movement in or out (to be enforced with police help and ward assistance) to prevent further spread of the infection to other areas,” municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said.Vegetable markets in these areas will be closed down as authorities say these are leading to crowding. The government is also expected to strengthen security for the effective implementation of the lockdown. “Barring medical shops, everything else would be shut in the hotspots we have identified in Mumbai. It would not be possible to contain the spread in areas like Dharavi without imposing stricter restrictions as the next eight days are crucial,” said school education minister Varsha Gaikwad, a legislator from Dharavi.Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid-19 cases (1,297 as of Thursday morning) and fatalities (72) in the country. Mumbai accounts for 857 of these cases. With 14 positive patients and three deaths, the densely populated Dharavi is one of the hot spots in the city.In Mumbai, a “containment zone” is classified as one if a single person from the area is tested positive for Covid-19. The patient’s building and at least four to five adjoining buildings on all sides will be in this zone, depending on the area’s population density. Hotspots, on the other hand, are identified on a case to case basis, if and when civic authorities see a dramatic rise in cases in one location, building, or an area inside a “containment zone”. “We are identifying hotspots for better mobilisation of resources to such areas... screening in a hotspot is happening rigorously,” a senior BMC official said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-mumbai-identifies-21-hotspots-imposes-curfew-like-restrictions/story-YfWtVyLgWjmH0Yd0P9uKMP.html

Jammu and Kashmir police chief Dilbagh Singh told HT soon after that there were many more at the terror launch pads.India’s national security planners have put a figure to this effort across the border to create a summer of discontent in the Kashmir valley.There are around 160 terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) are ready to infiltrate into the Valley from across the LoC in Kashmir, people tasked with the analysis of intelligence about terror movements and camps told HT.In the Jammu sector along the international border, around 70 armed and trained terrorists are at the launch pads to infiltrate into this area through unfenced riverine and nullahs.Terror Infiltration RoutesKashmir SectorGurez, Machchil, Keran, Tangdhar, Naugam and Uri Jammu SectorJourian, Hira Nagar, Kathua, Samba and JammuRajouri SectorPoonch, Krishna Ghati, Bhimber Gali, Sunderbani and NausheraAccording to counter-terror operatives, Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists are camping at Samani-Bhimber and Dudhnial launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and waiting for the first opportunity to infiltrate into J&K.

It also said that massive fiscal stimulus from governments will be required to get the economies going.“The global coronavirus pandemic is causing an economic crisis unlike any in the past century and will require a massive response to help in the recovery,” IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday.“In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,” she added.IMF official said the international body only expects a “partial recovery” next year, and which needed to be aided with government-funded “lifelines” for businesses and households if the hope of a recovery were to be entertained.She added that the worst of coronavirus pandemic was not over adding more uncertainty to the projection of an economic future.Click Here for Latest Reports on CoronavirusIMF warning comes amid indications that India’s GDP growth for the current fiscal will likely slow down to 4.8 per cent according to a UN report which also warned of significant adverse global economic impact of the pandemic that has sickened over 1.5 million worldwide. The report also added that the economic fallout could increase global poverty by as much a half a billion.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also made a similar prediction on Thursday saying the global economy was heading into recession in 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic wrecks havoc on global production, supply chains, trade and tourism.Indian government has announced a fiscal package worth ₹1.75 lakh crore to mitigate against the all-round economic losses caused by the pandemic and another similar package is expected to be announced soon.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The government also sanctioned an additional Rs 15,000 crores for as India’s Covid-19 emergency response and health system preparedness package, said the health ministry.The IMF is set to release its World Economic Outlook for this year and next on Tuesday. It is expected to be grim.“The bleak outlook applies to advanced and developing economies alike. This crisis knows no boundaries. Everybody hurts,” Georgieva said.Georgieva said that about $100 billion of investments had been withdrawn from the emerging markets, which was three times more than the investments that had fled during the global financial crisis of 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-heading-to-biggest-economic-crisis-since-the-great-depression-warns-imf/story-ED4io2tZoscnhzxTj1Y5LK.html

Several of these migrants started a long march home on foot and had to be accommodated into temporary relief camps set up by different states to provide them food, shelter, sanitation and medical care.The chief ministers of different states coordinated on the issue of migrants to ensure they were not left unattended. Soren referred to this while talking about the “strength of federalism”.“Strength of federalism has come to the fore in fight against Covid-19 pandemic,” PTI quoted Soren as saying. He added that chief ministers were “coordinating with each other” to help out people stranded outside their home state.Jharkhand, one of the last Indian states to report a positive case of coronavirus infection, is home to several of these migrants who were left stranded in different states including Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal, Karnataka and Telangana. Most states set up facilities to ensure that none of the workers went hungry and they also offered cash relief to the daily wagers registered in their respective states. The Central government, too, announced several measures including cash transfers to additional free ration under the food security scheme to safeguard the poor from loss of income during the current crisis.Soren’s endorsement of cooperative federalism comes at a time when the Centre and the states have held several rounds of consultations and mostly worked in tandem to enforcement measures to contain the outbreak of the pandemic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, lauded the work done by states while states that they were working in close coordination with the Centre.PM Modi is set to have another meeting with chief ministers of states on Saturday, March 11, when a decision on the extension of lockdown could be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-cm-soren-cites-a-crisis-to-underscore-strength-of-federalism-in-india/story-SSyrFT7l8CEMl98DG3BmaN.html

The pictures of the funeral went viral on social media and many questioned about the violation of social distancing norms during the viral outbreak.Sopore police authorities registered a case late Wednesday evening against the people who participated in the funeral, ignoring the government advisory about the ban on social gathering due to Covid-19 outbreak. A police spokesman said that a First Information Report (FIR) was filed against the people who attended Dar’s funeral in violation of the ban on social gathering, but it was unclear whether any arrest was made for flouting the order.“Dar’s next of kin had given a written undertaking to adhere to social distancing when his body was handed over to them. An investigation has started and the offenders will be dealt with strictly as per the law,” the spokesman said.The J&K administration has been laying emphasis on social distancing amid growing Covid-19 cases in the Union Territory.Altogether 158 people tested Covid-19 positive in J&K and four people have died so far. Two persons have tested Covid-19 positive in Sopore town as well.Dar was killed during an encounter at Gulabad, which is located about 4km away from his native village, Saidpora. Dar joined militancy in 2018 and he was active in Sopore and adjoining areas as a local JeM commander, the police said.Three encounters took place in Kashmir in the past one week, where 10 militants and five militants were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-registers-case-against-those-who-attended-jem-militant-s-funeral/story-GUq7ygLPwUby4oYGTzg36I.html

Whether it will reduce the infection, will be known only after tests. The doctors are still testing it on symptomatic patients. ntil we get satisfactory results, we won’t recommend this to anyone,” said R Ganga Ketkar, scientist, ICMR.Ketkar once again reiterated his statement that India has still not entered the third stage (or community transmission) of Covid-19 outbreak.Hydroxychloroquine has emerged as the most sought-after medicine after preliminary trials in China suggested it boosted recovery and lowered the severity of the coronavirus disease.According to ICMR, hydroxychloroquine is recommended only to those asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases.The government has ensured that there is no shortage of hydroxychloroquine in the country at present as well as in the future, Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Aggarwal said on Wednesday.“It is ensured that not only today even in future there will not be any lack of HCQ (hydroxychloroquine) as and when needed,” Aggarwal said during his daily press briefing in New Delhi.India on Wednesday cleared export of hydroxychloroquine to countries such as US and Brazil.

He has chosen to stay back in Goa and even though he had the option to fly back home on one of the three repatriation flights that the United Kingdom (UK) government is planning to operate this week for stranded British nationals because of the pandemic.“I’m looking back at an alarming situation in London, as the city is reporting a growing number of Covid-19 positive cases daily. Truth be told, I feel safer in Goa,” Taylor, who is staying at Agonda village in south Goa, told Hindustan Times. Around 20,000 British nationals are stranded in India because of the lockdown, including some in Goa.The British government has arranged three repatriation flights from Goa this week and four others from Mumbai and Delhi, but the journey back home is expected to be a long-drawn process for many stranded in other parts of the country, as the wait list has run into thousands of passengers and travelling within India is out of bounds because of the lockdown.A few Britons have chosen to stay back in Goa, even though most of them are making frantic efforts to head back home for their family exigencies.“I’d rather stay back in Goa than fly out. I’ve got a place to stay here. Essential commodities aren’t in short supply. Many restaurants are open. The Goans are a caring and friendly lot. Besides, I don’t have my own place to stay in England and I’ll have to stay with my parents. I don’t want to put them at risk in case I get infected by SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, during my return journey back home,” Josh Baxter, another tourist to Goa, said. “I’m hoping that the pandemic doesn’t worsen in India. If I get infected here, the healthcare facilities aren’t as good as the UK. A decision will be taken soon by the Indian government whether to lift the lockdown on April 14 or extend it further. Perhaps, I’ll wait until then and then take a call about my return trip,” he added.Usually, foreigners travelling to India visit other popular destinations such as Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. Goa has reported seven Covid-19 positive cases to date, but none of them is a foreigner. Also, the state is yet to report a single Covid-19 related death yet. The low Covid-19 positive case count is also a comforting thought for the stranded foreign tourists in Goa.“I’m living in Arambol, north Goa, with three people I befriended on my trip to Rajasthan. I came here with a girl I met in the hostel, where I was staying in Udaipur. My other two fellow travellers came from Jaipur. All of us met up at the airport in Jaipur on our way to Goa and now ended up staying together in Arambol. We’re having a nice time here and still undecided whether we’d like to return home soon. I’m from the northeastern part of England, my friend is from Oxford and my other friends are from Mexico and Germany. The situation is quite fluid. Besides, the price of a ticket on one of these repatriation flights is prohibitively expensive,” Charlotte Collins, another British tourist, said. The British government is charging upwards of £600 for a ticket on a repatriation flight to London, and then the passenger will be quarantined for 14 days upon their arrival there.Initially, when the lockdown started on March 25, the foreign tourists to Goa were wary. But the state government made adequate arrangements to allay their concerns. Hotels and guest houses have slashed their tariffs by half and essential commodities are being provided to many who were caught unaware of the lockdown. “The foreign tourists, who’re staying in Goa, have come some time ago. No one is targeting, as they’re not seen as a carrier of coronavirus,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said. The Goa international airport at Dabolim has handled 19 relief flights, which flew back around 3,300 tourists back to their respective countries, including Russia, France, Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-despite-the-option-of-repatriation-flights-some-tourists-choose-to-stay-back-in-goa/story-KwNCg24ojUNFV0pJdICalM.html
09-04-2020||India||Will summer halt Covid-19? Scientists say there are other factors||In a finding that has huge significance for India, where summer is just breaking, a prestigious scientific panel in the US said that high temperature is unlikely to significantly stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) without major public health interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing.The report is from the US National Academies of Sciences (NAS), which, on April 4, said Covid-19 can be spread just by talking or breathing, resulting in many countries, including India, to revise guidelines on masks. With countries currently experiencing summer, such as Australia and Iran, experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increase in humidity and temperature should not be assumed said the report, which examined virus survival in relation to temperature and humidity, and potential for seasonal reduction and resurgence of cases to provide scientific evidence for decision-making.Thus, while noting that “experimental studies show a relationship between higher temperatures and humidity levels, and reduced survival of SARS-Cov-2 in the laboratory, there are many other factors besides environmental temperature, humidity, and survival of the virus outside the host, that influence and determine transmission,” the report said in its summary. The report also calls for more research into the theme, including on various SARS-COV-2 strains. The new report, which was submitted to the White House on Tuesday, said that on current evidence and given the lack of host immunity globally, any reduction in transmission because of higher temperature and humidity may not lead to a significant decrease in disease spread without major interventions, such as personal protection and social distancing.“We cannot rely on summer to rescue us from coronavirus disease as temperature is just one of the many factors that affect transmission. Very hot climate may reduce cases by a small number in high population density areas as heat will destroy the virus faster. I’m hopeful it may do so to some extent in Dharavi, but since hotspots are typically in hospitals, malls and offices, which are often air-conditioned even in India, transmission is unlikely to end in summer without strong public health interventions,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.Other coronaviruses that cause potentially serious human illness, including both Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV that have caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle-East respiratory syndrome in the past, have not demonstrated seasonality either. Indeed, a reading of the history of such illnesses shows that those that first emerged in winter, saw a second wave in summer - and vice versa. Some of the compounding factors that affect virus transmission are geography, population density, per capita income, access to testing, quality health care systems and human behavioural patterns, including mobility and migration.“There are many other factors that may influence virus spread and it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions without data on this novel virus in the real world. In the Indian context, the factors would include population density, difficulty of maintaining physical distancing in households where space is limited, inability and unfamiliarity with cough/sneeze etiquette, migrant labour returning home with the virus, and mingling of people even during the current lockdown,” said Dr V. Ramana Dhara, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad.With little evidence on how this new virus will behave, virologists are falling back on the behaviour of coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, with which SARS-COV-2 shares the most similarity. Pandemic influenza strains have not exhibited the typical seasonal pattern of endemic and epidemic strains, the report said. “There have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years – two started in the northern hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall. All had a peak second wave approximately six months after the emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred,” said the NAS report.“The second wave of the Spanish flu in 1918 was devastating for India, and even if temperature and humidity have some affect on transmission, it may not be as apparent because most people have no immunity to Sars-CoV-2, unlike pre-existing respiratory viruses against which is there is some degree of immunity,” said Dr Dhara.“In such a scenario, I would suggest a staggered exit to the lockdown where some people can return to work to restart economic activity because a hungry and malnourished population would be more susceptible to infections, including Covid-19,” added Dr Dhara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-summer-halt-covid-19-scientists-say-there-are-other-factors/story-QNofFJuZtHkdE9PXR9ghjP.html

Gujarat, till now, accounts for the second-highest number of Covid-19 fatalities with 16 deaths and is closely followed by Madhya Pradesh which has reported 13 deaths so far. As per the latest data released by the health ministry, Gujarat has recorded 179 coronavirus cases.

Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Telangana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have registered 8, 9, 7, 3 and 4 Covid-19 fatalities respectively.

This has often affected the working of the eight-member grouping created in December 1985. Pakistan’s opposition, mainly due to its differences with India, has held up numerous initiatives.Over the past few weeks, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, has called for all Covid-19-related initiatives to be placed under the SAARC secretariat during his telephone conversations with counterparts from other SAARC states.Wednesday’s virtual meeting of SAARC trade officials was a follow-up to a video conference of leaders of the eight SAARC states on March 15. At that time, Pakistan was the only country not to be represented by its head of government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-block-indian-covid-19-initiatives-pak-seeks-to-bring-issues-under-saarc-secretariat/story-eGOSkVawg5Lg54IX2xdkbJ.html

It cited a case in Delhi’s Gautam Nagar area where it said a female resident doctor and her sister were abused and manhandled by a person in their residential colony and another incident in from AIIMS, Bhopal where two doctors were abused and assaulted by police personnel even after showing their ID cards when they were returning to their apartments after emergency duty.“These are not isolated incidents, rather part of the long chain of incidents of violence against doctors. FORDA condemns such inhumane acts of violence and demands that all such acts be marked as Non-bailable Offence. Central Protection Act for doctors, as demanded earlier, is the need of the hour for protection of the whole medical fraternity,” it said in the letter.Last month, in a television address to his constituency of Varanasi about the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned people against misbehaving with doctors and nurses amid reports that many healthcare professionals are facing harassment for caring for Covid-19 patients.Modi’s warning came a day after the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) wrote to Shah about discrimination and unfair behaviour by landlords who allegedly asked doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers involved in Covid-19 care to vacate their rented homes.Shah had then spoken to Delhi Police chief S N Shrivastava and directed him to ensure security of doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-assaults-on-medicos-non-bailable-offence-doctors-tell-amit-shah/story-E1XpmuUxUw1YvPcnjWr55I.html

Sector leaders say they have unanimously decided to conduct free tests after the interim order on Wednesday, but maintain that will not be financially viable for them. They say they are collaborating with each other constantly to formulate an action plan. The top court has made tests for the coronavirus disease in government and private laboratories free, and asked the government to pass the necessary orders so as to make this possible. The tests are already free in government laboratories. Private laboratories used to charge Rs 4,500 for the currently used RT-PCR tests. “Under the current circumstances, since it is a Supreme Court order, we are doing tests free for the time being. However, we are taking to our lawyers, and talking among ourselves, and even with the government to see what can be the way out,” says Arvind Lal, chairman and managing director of Dr Lal PathLabs, one of the private sector players allowed to carry out such tests.There are 139 government laboratories and 65 private ones that currently authorised.Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dangs Lab, a Delhi-based pathology lab that too has an approval, says, “There is a lot of confusion at the moment whether to charge or not; until the confusion clears out, I have given standing instructions to my staff not to charge anyone for Covid-19 testing.” Zoya Brar, CORE Diagnsotics CEO, says private labs have unanimously decided that no one will charge for testing till things become clear.Even corporate hospitals have decided to conduct the tests for free. “Since we have not heard anything from the government yet, we are not charging anything for Covid-19 testing,” said a spokesperson for Apollo hospital.A lab owner, who did not want to be named, describes how leaders in the sector collaborated. “It was a mammoth collaborative wherein everyone in the industry came together for this cause...We have to find a way out otherwise many labs will collapse,” this person said.Girdhar Gyani, Association of Healthcare Providers director general, proposes reimbursement to private labs by governments in case of free testing.To be sure, the court, in its order, asked the government to explore a way to reimburse private laboratories, although it did not pass any order to this effect“Since ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) handles testing and related matters, it would be appropriate to ask them about it,” said Preeti Sudan, the Union health secretary said on Wednesday.ICMR director general of Balram Bhargava did not respond to calls and text messages despite repeated attempts..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sc-order-on-free-covid-19-tests-private-labs-explore-legal-options/story-grPxNiRK8iqIZT5Pc7y4BJ.html

The officials said that Lakra, who had returned from Himachal Pradesh in the second week of February, did not show any symptoms of the disease at first. However, a couple of days ago he developed flu-like symptoms after which the villagers asked him to visit the local community health centre for screening.“As the people in the village were very sensitive about anyone showing symptoms of flu, they pressured him to get tested. At the CHC, Lakra was checked by the doctor who ruled out him being infected by the virus. The youth, however, insisted that he be quarantined as the villagers would not let him in. So he was put in the quarantine facility in a school near his locality,” said Syed Mujibur Rehman, additional SP of Rourkela.On Tuesday night, Lakra sneaked out of the quarantine facility and hanged himself from a teak tree. His body was spotted by other people in the quarantine facility on Wednesday morning. Police said they have started an investigation into the incident. Lakra is survived by his widowed mother.

As per the research, radio has a credibility score of 6.27, second only to the internet which is at 6.44 and TV at 5.74. The research is based on a sample size of 3,300 listeners above the age of 18.The radio industry witnessed a listenership of 51 million people, which is nearly as much as television’s reach of 56 million and social media’s reach of 57 million, said the research.“As the Covid-19 pandemic takes over the world, the role of entertainment mediums become all the more crucial. Radio being a critical medium has the dual responsibility of not only entertaining the listeners, but also ensuring that correct and genuine information reaches the country’s citizens,” said Harshad Jain, CEO, Radio and Entertainment, HT Media Ltd and Next Mediaworks Ltd.“At a time like this, the power and effectiveness of our medium increases manifold. People are now tuning in to the radio sets more than ever for their daily entertainment needs and also to stay updated with credible information,” added Jain.The research further said that radio listenership increased by 23 per cent during the lockdown to 2.36 hours everyday, second only to television.“It is very encouraging to note that Radio is evolving as one of the most preferred and most credible source of infotainment. We are now almost catching up on TV in terms of audience, the rise of 23 percent in total time spent per person on radio is phenomenal. We are grateful to all our listeners and look forward to help evolve this media into greater heights,” Anurradha Prasad, president of the Association of Radio Operators for India (AROI).Other companies also hailed the new research. BIG FM CEO Abraham Thomas said, “The feeling of knowing that you’re making a difference in the lives of our listeners is truly amazing.” Radio City CEO Ashit Kukian said that these finding prove that raiod has the power to create awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radio-emerges-as-credible-source-of-information-during-covid-19-lockdown-says-research/story-OIQcBR9JLCOGxJjFqC7hEJ.html

The force started by distributing a few hundred food packages daily, but the number of people being fed has increased gradually to reach 50,000 people across 15 centres.The police’s open kitchen, called oru vayar ootaam -- which loosely translates as feeding a stomach – is gaining in popularity. Many volunteers, non-government organisations and student police cadets have stepped forward to feed the needy.“We don’t want people to go hungry. We started in a small way but expanded after we realised the need to feed many. We concentrate mainly around hospitals where people usually go hungry. We’re serving senior citizens and the destitute as well,” said P Vijayan, inspector general of police (IGP), Kochi Range, and the brain behind the open kitchen initiative.Vijayan was also the guiding force behind the Student Police Cadets programme in Kerala, which has found national traction.“Kerala has taken the lead in many ways as far as tackling Covid-19 is concerned. The state was the first to report the disease. We alerted the health workers and politicians about Covid-19. There was a timely intervention from the police as well. Now, the results are there for all to see. We can’t forget our duties and responsibilities towards the poor and distressed people. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the state police chief have given us admirable support in our endeavours,” the IGP said.Charitable organisations, tour operators, student bodies and ordinary people have stepped forward to fund the police’s novel initiative.Kerala was the first Indian state to report a coronavirus case in when a student from Wuhan university in China tested positive on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-kerala-police-feeds-thousands-of-hungry-across-the-state/story-umtnjwkA5Rn1eYRpiSaLVN.html

09-04-2020||India||How rail travel could change post Covid-19. Ministry says no decision yet||That life after the lockdown is lifted, when it lifted, has been widely acknowledged in the government and beyond. The railways, according to a report in www.livehindustan.com, is also working on updating how people should travel in trains. According to the report in Hindustan, a sister publication of Hindustan Times, passengers may be required to reach railway stations well ahead of the scheduled departure time of the train. For now, the officials appear to be looking at the possibility of stipulating a four-hour lead time. This, it is felt, would give passengers adequate time to clear the additional safety protocols that could come into play.To be sure, the Railways Ministry on Thursday insists that it has not taken a decision so far.“Ministry of Railways has not issued any protocol regarding passenger travel during post lockdown period, as has been incorrectly reported in some media reports,” the railways ministry tweeted. “As and when a decision is taken, all stakeholders would be intimated. Please do not be guided by any misleading report,” it said. Ministry of Railways has not issued any protocol regarding passenger travel during post lockdown period, as has been incorrectly reported in some media reportsAs and when a decision is taken, all stakeholders would be intimated.

Only non-Air conditioned coaches may be available for travel in order to prevent the spread of the disease, which is believed to have greater potential for transmission in air-conditioned environment.2. Passengers may be required to update and inform the railways of their health status 12 hours before travel.3. If a traveller is found with symptoms of Covid-19, he is likely to be deboarded and forced to abandon his journey.4. Every passenger may be given a face mask and a hand glove to use during the journey against a small fee. The use of mask and gloves could be mandatory during travel.6. Vendors may not be allowed to enter the coaches from outside.7. Senior citizens may be dissuaded from travelling on trains to save them from catching the infection.8. Passengers may have to pass through a specially-made tunnel for disinfection.9. Social distancing norms may be enforced during the journey.10. All four doors in a train coach are likely to be kept locked to prevent any unauthorised entry into the compartment during the course of the journey.11. Most trains are likely to operate non-stop between the originating and the destination stations, only a couple of additional stops in between may be allowed in some cases.12. The side berth in sleeper coaches may be kept vacant to ensure social distancing and only two passengers are likely to be allowed in a cabin comprising of six berths.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-ac-coaches-mandatory-masks-and-early-arrival-rail-travel-post-covid-19-set-to-change/story-Igqdzn7547CX6dXXBXeZ7O.html

The India-US partnership is stronger than ever.India shall do everything possible to help humanity's fight against COVID-19. We shall win this together. https://t.co/0U2xsZNexETrump had on Wednesday showered praises on PM Modi and the Indian people on Twitter, in response to Indian government’s decision to ease restrictions on export of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine that he has said would be a game-changer in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic.“Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Thank you Prime Minister @NarendraModi for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight!” the US President had said in his tweet.Trump, during a phone call on Saturday, had asked PM Modi to lift the hold on American order of the anti-malarial drug, of which India is the major producer. India lifted the hold on Tuesday.By Wednesday night, more than 14,600 Americans had lost their lives due to coronavirus and over 4.3 lakh have tested positive for the dreaded disease. Scientists and the medical fraternity are racing against time to find a vaccine and a therapeutic solution to it.India is the world’s largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine, producing nearly 70 per cent of the world’s supply. The demand for the drug, which is also used by patients of rheumatoid arthritis, was boosted after a small placebo-controlled clinical trial in China demonstrated that the anti-malarial drug shortened the duration and reduced the severity of cough, fever and pneumonia in patients with mild and moderate disease.India banned the export of hydroxychloroquine and any formulation containing it on March 25. Last week the ban was expanded to cover exports from special economic zones, blocking pending orders, including from the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-will-win-this-together-pm-modi-responde-to-trump-s-thank-you-note-on-hydroxychloroquine/story-2EWFfE7boqW7Pu1J7dQ2zO.html

09-04-2020||India||Spring colder than usual this year, shows IMD data||The flu season is prolonged this year in many parts of northwest India because of back-to-back western disturbances (WDs). Temperature data with India Meteorological Department (IMD) for March and April in Delhi shows last year the highest maximum temperature recorded in March was 39.2 degrees C recorded on March 31 compared to maximum of only 33.3 degrees C recorded on March 26.The average maximum temperature for March was similar in both years around 28.2 degrees C, 1 degree below normal. But in the first week of April the average maximum temperature this year is 32.7 degrees C compared with 36.61 degrees C last year. The highest maximum temperature recorded last year till April 7 was 39.3 degrees C compared to 35.8 degrees C this year. The weather continues to be nippy in April.Interestingly, nights also continue to be mildly chilly. The highest minimum temperature recorded in March last year was 21 degrees C on March 31 compared to 19.6 degrees C recorded on March 27 this year. The average minimum temperature in the first week of April is 16.8 degrees C this year compared to 19.7 degrees C last year.“We had four WDs last April but more than six WDs this year. The WDs brought a lot of rain also this year. In March we got 109.67 mm rain this March which is the highest since 1901. Wind speed has also been moderate at about 20 to 30 kmph. This is why maximum temperature hasn’t risen as it should have. On April 7 also many neighbouring parts of Delhi received rains due to a WD once again bringing down maximum and minimum temperatures,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Similar trends have been observed for the entire northwestern region and even other parts of the country. “The summer heat hasn’t started and temperature hasn’t started picking up yet even in places which get very hot by now like parts of Rajasthan, Odisha, Maharashtra, some areas of Central India,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.“Its thought that high humidity and low temperature is favourable for the spread of certain viral infections. But the correlation between temperature and these infections is still a matter of conjecture. There are no scientific studies clearly establishing the link. But what we do know is that March-April and September-October are pollen or allergy season when asthma and certain respiratory conditions aggravate,” said Dr BK Tripathi, professor of medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.IMD’s Wednesday bulletin said a western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region on April 9 and 10. Also an induced cyclonic circulation is likely to form over central Pakistan and neighbourhood around April 10. “Under its influence, scattered to fairly widespread rain/snow is likely over Western Himalayan Region and isolated rain/thundershowers over Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on April 9 and 10. Thunderstorm accompanied with lightning, hail and gusty winds (speed reaching 30-40 kmph) very likely at isolated places over Western Himalayan Region during next two days.” Another WD is likely to impact the region on April 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spring-colder-than-usual-shows-imd-data/story-wDh6ZhgmGa7CPQennVwllK.html

09-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Bengal mulls disinfection walkways to keep people safe||Kolkata: The authorities in West Bengal are exploring the feasibility of installing sanitising gateways and disinfecting walkways to keep SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), at bay, as markets, hospitals and some government offices are still open, despite the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced since March 25 to contain the pandemic. Scientists from a government research institute – the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI) - have built prototypes of two sensor-based disinfecting walkways, which could help people to get sanitised in less than 40 seconds. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has started a pilot project, where sprinklers have been installed at one of the entry points of the century-old Hogg Market, one of the busiest markets in the city.The Durgapur Municipal Corporation (DMC) has shown interest in the prototypes developed by the CMERI. “A person needs to enter the chamber-like walkway and stand inside it. The embedded sensors will detect the person’s presence and trigger a mist of disinfectant. This would kill the virus and disinfect you. It could take any time between 20 and 40 seconds depending on what type of disinfectant one is using,” said Harish Hirani, director, CMERI. The walkways can be deployed at the entry and exit points of isolation and quarantine facilities, hospitals, metro stations, shopping malls, and offices among other places where social distancing is few and far between and the chances of getting infected are abnormally high.The CMERI is India’s apex research and development institute for mechanical engineering under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Two variants developed by the institute have been installed on its campus -- one at the main gate and another at its medical centre.“We’ve developed two variants. While the Hydraulic Variant Disinfection Walkway is rather simple and less costly, as it uses a pump, the Pneumatic Variant Disinfection Walkway uses a compressor and is costlier. The wastage of disinfectant is, however, less in the latter,” said Ajoy Roy, one of the scientists of the institute.The Hogg Market’s contraption is basic. “The moment a person passes through the market’s gate, sprinklers spray disinfectant to sanitise the passerby. We’re using diluted hydrogen peroxide as a disinfectant,” said a KMC official.The KMC is planning to install more such ‘sanitising corridors’ after the lockdown is lifted, as all the markets will open.“The CMERI scientists had approached us. Our technical experts would visit their campus to get a sense of the two variants installed,” said Dilip Kumar Agasty, mayor, DMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bengal-mulls-disinfection-walkways-to-keep-people-safe/story-uOvit67fepGqK5W1UYvu6M.html
09-04-2020||India||Coronavirus pandemic could push 400mn Indians deeper into poverty, says ILO||As many as 400 million Indians, including migrant workers and daily wage earners, are at risk of being pushed deeper into poverty because of the covid-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organisation said, terming the crisis as the most severe since the Second World War. The pandemic is likely to impact 2.7 billion workers, or 81% of the world’s workforce, the Geneva-based body said on Wednesday.The unemployment scenario is unlikely to improve in the second half of 2020, ILO said, adding that it estimates working hours will decline by 6.7% in the second quarter of 2020, which is equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. The forecast indicates that there may be lasting economic damage from the shock caused by the covid-19 pandemic, including widespread joblessness. Loss of wages, in turn, is likely to trigger a slump in demand.India, which has a relatively high proportion of workers outside the formal workforce, need to be on guard as workers are facing a drastic reduction in working hours, wage cuts and layoffs, the ILO said. “In India, with a share of almost 90% of people working in the informal economy, about 400 million workers in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty during the crisis,” ILO said.“In India, Nigeria and Brazil, the number of workers in the informal economy affected by the lockdown and other containment measures is substantial. Current lockdown measures in India, which are at the high end of the University of Oxford’s covid-19 Government Response Stringency Index, have impacted these workers significantly,” it added.The ILO warning corroborates local data, which shows that unemployment rate has spiked in India in a span of weeks. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s weekly tracker survey showed that the unemployment rate shot up from 8.4% in mid-March to 23% in the week ended April 5, reflecting job losses because of the 21-day lockdown that started on March 25. While urban unemployment rate was 30.9%, the rural unemployment rate was over 20%, the data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-pandemic-could-push-400mn-indians-deeper-into-poverty-says-ilo/story-68ltaIqQU3gIIJatNmbq3M.html
09-04-2020||India||As Centre considers Covid-19 lockdown extension, demand to resume industry||Even as state governments have asked the Centre to consider extending the ongoing lockdown beyond April 14, there is pressure on the central government to allow certain industries to resume operations partially and with caveats to follow the mandatory protocols for health care and social distancing. Since the lockdown was announced on March 24 to check the spread of Covid-19, only those manufacturing units such as pharmaceuticals or those that form the supply chain for essential items are being permitted.According to a few BJP lawmakers, during their interaction with the state administration and party workers across the country, the need to restart a certain section of industries such as food processing, bottling and packaging, and textiles, has been repeatedly flagged.A Member of Parliament (MP) from Bihar said many industrial groups (which he declined to name) expressed concern that it might be difficult to bring back the migrant workers who have moved back in large numbers to their respective native states.“There is a concern that with states looking after the essential needs such as food and ration and the Centre fast-tracking direct benefit transfers, workers may not return once the lockdown conditions are eased. In that case, there may be a crippling impact in many sectors in the absence of the workforce,” the MP quoted above said.A second MP from Maharashtra said that with the Covid-19 cases now being reported from at least two districts in the state, monitoring of migrant workers and movement of people needs to be further enhanced. The MP said the demand to ease restrictions have been made by the micro, small and medium enterprises, which has expressed inability to foot wages unless they are allowed to function.“The MSMEs have requested that in a phased manner, in regions where the spread is limited, production should be allowed after April 14, even if the lockdown is extended,” the second MP said.A group of BJP MPs have also given wide-ranging suggestions to cope with issues related to economy and job creation in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic to party president Jagat Prakash Nadda.According to a person aware of the details, these MPs presented first part of the report before the nation-wide lockdown was announced on March 24, which gave suggestions on how to mitigate the impact of the pandemic which has left 149 dead in India.Suggestions such as increasing liquidity, increasing the duration of MNREGA work and relaxations to the MSME sectors were also shared with the finance ministry that announced the Rs 1.70 lakh crore relief package.While three of the MPs who were part of making this report declined to comment, the person quoted above said the second part will have more focused suggestions on how to meet the challenge of job creation when the economy has taken a hit, ramping up agriculture produce and scaling production in the MSMEs.These suggestions will be shared with the government, which is working on an economic stimulus package expected soon.The All India Manufacturer’s Association has claimed that 70 per cent of the MSME establishments were unable to pay either partially or fully the wages for March. Sudrashan Sareen, president of the association said in the absence of generating revenue plus on account of unpaid dues from the government, MSMEs across the country are reeling under a financial crisis.Govind Lele, general secretary of the Laghu Ugyog Bharati (LUB), an affiliate of the RSS that works with the MSMSE sector said while it was true that small manufacturers are facing the brunt of the lockdown, easing restrictions to resume production cannot be done without assessing the impact it will have on checking the spread of the pandemic.“In smaller manufacturing units social distancing is not possible and there is no way to certify workers (to be free from the virus) so that production can be resumed without fear,” he said.“The fear that industries will come to a grinding halt if workers show unwillingness to move back is exaggerated,” said Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank Research and Information System for Developing Countries.“I think that the fear that migrant workers who have moved back to their villages may not return after three months, is a bit exaggerated. The total purchasing power in the rural areas is low and the demand for labour will come down significantly after this present season. These migrants are likely to return once the industries begin operations,” Kundu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-centre-considers-covid-19-lockdown-extension-demand-to-resume-industry/story-UZXUtDxvzcSUFfA2DpTvFO.html

He said all the infected employees were receiving treatment.Till last week, the number of infected Roscosmos employees at different locations of the corporation was four.The pilots began their training in Russia in February. However, routine activities at the Russian facility, such as the training programme, have been temporarily suspended by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Indians had made good progress in the training so far and cleared some tests, the people said.Russia, which has recorded more than 8,600 infections and 63 deaths, is currently under lockdown till April 30. The lockdown also applies to the cosmonaut training centre and medical teams are regularly screening and monitoring all personnel at the facility.The training programme for the Indian pilots, who were chosen from among hundreds of applicants, will last a year and focus on both basic astronaut training and issues specific to the Gaganyaan mission planned for 2022.The Human Space Flight Centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Russia’s state-run Glavkosmos signed a contract for the training programme in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-indian-pilots-training-in-russia-for-gaganyaan-mission-in-self-isolation-as-a-precautionary-measure/story-ccL7WeZAU21PZ6ZhudflRL.html

The Rajasthan medical and health department is facing challenge to contain the spread of Covid-19 in other hotspots such as Ramganj neighbourhood in Jaipur and Jhunjhunu.In an interview with Hindustan Times’ Rakesh Goswami, Rajasthan’s additional chief secretary of medical and health department Rohit Kumar Singh said that the model needs to be tweaked for other hotspots.Here are some excerpts from the interview:Q: How do you plan to use the Bhilwara model of containment in other hotspots such as Ramganj?Rohit Singh: The Bhilwara model is a typical containment strategy. It starts with lockdown, and lockdown means lockdown - no movement, no exemptions. Of course, you have to make arrangements for the essentials. For other hotspots, it needs to be tweaked. The principle will remain the same but will have to be adapted to local situation. For example, in Ramganj, social distancing is physically not possible because of population density. You need to quarantine a far larger number of people. As compared to Bhilwara, we are putting 10X more people from Ranganj in quarantine.Q: Why did Ramganj go out of hand?Rohit Singh: This happened because of the way the locality is structured, in term of population density, in terms of how people engage socially. Social distancing is culturally difficult to implement. The square feet of the houses is so low that if you advise someone home isolation, they cannot practice social distancing. It’s very cultural. So we decided to quarantine people en mass. If you compare with Bhilwara, we are putting 10 times more people in institutional quarantine facilities. After the police imposed a stricter curfew from Tuesday, we are now changing our strategy for testing. Now, we are going for cluster sampling for tests. We will collect around 500 samples from different clusters in Ramganj for testing from today (April 8). Until yesterday, we were testing 90-100 samples, so this is a 5X increase in testing to check if transmission is gone to the third stage of community spread. Besides Ramganj, we know that there are similar places outside the walled city such as Hasanpura and Jalupura where probably the cases are there but we don’t know. So we will also take samples from these areas as well.Q: Is there any similarity between Bhilwara and Ramganj?Rohit Singh: Yes. In both cases, negligence of one person caused the outbreak. In Bhilwara, this doctor continued to see patients despite having influenza-like illness. From him, the disease got transmitted to so many people. Similarly, in Ramganj, this gentleman comes from Oman and doesn’t tell anyone. When a local doctor advises him home isolation, he roams around the town with a friend. Out of 100-odd cases from Ramganj, almost all are because of him.Q: Centre has called for three-tier Covid-19 health facilities. What is the status in Rajasthan?Rohit Singh: In Rajasthan, every district has a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. In Jaipur, for example, SMS Hospital has a capacity of 1,000 Covid-19 beds - 650 beds are ready and the remaining can be readied in a matter of 24 hours. The government of India is very rightfully saying you plan for any eventuality, so that when it spreads only serious patients are handled in tertiary care. As advised by government of India, we will have different facilities for different types of patients.Q: As the cases rise, the need for more PCR tests will be felt. Are you prepared for that?Rohit Singh: Because of our advanced planning, and an early case - the first case was reported on March 2 - we have enough PCR kits. We are sourcing them from ICMR while Vaibhav (Galeria, secretary of medical education department) and his team are parallelly talking to private suppliers. We have PCR machines at eight medical colleges. One more machine has been installed at Bhilwara for which permission from ICMR is awaited. We are testing more people than most states. Our testing per million population is only behind Kerala. In statistical terms, if you plot number of cases against number of tests, we are in good quadrant - less positive and more testing.Q: What are newer challenges?Rohit Singh: Newer and emerging hotspots such as Pokaran in Jaisalmer and a small cluster in Kota are new challenges. Jhunjhunu is also a challenge. The good thing is that most of the patients are below 50-55 years, which is a very good thing because they have better immunity and the likelihood of them recovering is very high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tweaking-bhilwara-model-for-other-covid-19-hotspots-in-rajasthan-says-top-official/story-8HoqlmxMi4N5uZqsoY7z0M.html

The pilots from the Indian Air Force are all in good health and the self-isolation was part of the standard procedures for dealing with the situation, said the people who spoke on condition of anonymity. There was no official word from the Indian side. The pilots began their training in February. Routine activities at the Russian facility have been temporarily suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-indian-pilots-training-in-russia-go-into-isolation/story-M1bIsaCoP2KgSOnELZ7y8M.html
09-04-2020||India||Travel could come with social distancing measures in place||The authorities are planning a slew of restrictive measures on public transport to ensure passenger safety and social distancing in trains, planes and metros to combat the threat of the spread of the coronavirus disese (Covid-19). All passenger transport has been suspended for the three-week long lockdown period that began on March 25. The Indian Railways is considering making thermal screening mandatory at railway stations and ensuring social distancing inside trains when the Centre gives its nod for resuming passenger train services, according to officials aware of the development. “Space between passengers will have to be ensured inside coaches. There will be awareness measures to ensure masks are worn and thermal screening is done. We are also using the the Aarogya Setu app, [the government’s tracker app] to check the status of passengers,” a senior railway ministry official said. Aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is also preparing a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure social distancing among passengers and reducing contact with staff on board. This includes measures like leaving the middle seats empty. Airports will have to ensure that bunching of passengers is avoided while boarding and also that there is adequate spacing between passengers in queues.“We are holding consultations with stakeholders and with other similarly situated regulators around the world to develop an SOP which will kick in following the Union government’s order on resumption of passenger flights,” a senior civil aviation ministry official said. Even before the lockdown, the DGCA had issued guidelines on social distancing for airlines and airport operators. From requesting flyers to keep a distance of at lease a metre at check-in counters, waiting areas and during security checks, the regulatory body also asked authorities to provide sanitisers for staff and passengers. Similar measures on social distancing are also being planned for metros. “We will follow all self regulation directions on this issued by the Centre,” a spokesperson for the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said. While no announcement on resumption of passenger transport has yet been made, the Indian Railways had begun preparing to resume passenger and mail express train services. Train services will have to be resumed only on specific approval of each train from the Railway Board. The national carrier, which operates 13,523 passenger trains every day, ferrying nearly 22 million passengers, has been operating only freight and parcel trains since the lockdown. “My heart goes out to people who are facing problems due to restrictions put in place on domestic and international flights,” Union civil aviation minister, Hardeep Puri, said on Wednesday. “These restrictions will be lifted once we are confident that the spread of the virus has been controlled and it poses no danger to fellow Indians,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travel-could-come-with-social-distancing-measures-in-place/story-Y9ahRegv8IE1sl1vRN9NaM.html
09-04-2020||India||Keran encounter: 3 of 5 terrorists were locals||At least three terrorists gunned down by Indian special forces in the intense close-quarters encounter on April 5 in the Keran sector belonged to Jammu & Kashmir and were missing since 2018, according to people familiar with the investigations who spoke on condition of anonymity. The three had gone across the border in Pakistan for training, the people added. Five terrorists and five commandos from 4 Para (SF) were killed along the Line of Control on Sunday after a daring operation launched by the Indian Army.Five AK-47 rifles, grenades, and GPS and wireless sets were recovered from the encounter site at Shalbatoo, in the Jumgund area of the Keran sector in Kupwara in north Kashmir. The terrorists infiltrated across the LoC on April 1 from Qasim-II post in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and were headed to the Gulab Post of army, according senior Indian security agency officials.The three terrorists were identified as Sajjad Ahmad Hurrah of Daramdora, Shopian; Aadil Hussain Mir of Mallapora, Liver, Anantnag; and Umar Nazir Khan of Liver, Anantnag. Jammu & Kashmir Police records show that missing reports had been filed about Hurrah and Mir at local police stations. Security officials said that the two left for Pakistan separately via the Attari-Wagah border; Sajjid crossed over on April 12, 2018, and Aadil on April 27, 2018. The travel history of Umar Nazir Khan, who belonged to the same village as Aadil, is being probed. The investogators suspect that the three were radicalised by Ghulam Nabi Khan, the deputy leader of the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) based in PoK. Nabi Khan also belongs to Anantnag’s Liver village.The identities of the other two terrorists were yet established.Though the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spread is growing in Pakistan, with cases in the Punjab province crossing to over 2,000 according to some estimates, a recent spike in incidents across the LoC suggest that the operation to fomenting trouble in Kashmir -- by first radicalising locals in Valley; then getting them to cross over for weapons training with terror groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and HM; and then sending them back to wage war in India. Security officials also said there are attempts to smuggle assault rifles across LoC to supply to foreign and local terrorists in the Valley. On March 23, 13 AK-47 rifles, hand grenades and ammunition were seized by Indian security officials in Keran sector. The moves, which security officials say include propping up smaller indigenous armed groups, are linked with retaliating against India for the August 2019 nullification of Article 370.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keran-encounter-3-of-5-terrorists-were-locals/story-cFfqJmllXy5MHcbraR3SJI.html

Those who would get parole could be released on furnishing personal bonds, as moving bail petitions would be difficult due to lockdown. Also, the Jharkhand legal aid services association (JHALSA) will provide legal aid to the undertrials for furnishing bonds,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lalu-prasad-parole-matter-to-be-decided-upon-by-respective-courts-jharkhand/story-ycpcdQWWDZH9QsIt8ssZiN.html
09-04-2020||India||‘No intention of slowing down training and readying of people’: Mahender Nath Pandey||Union minister for skill development and entrepreneurship (SDE), Mahendra Nath Pandey spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran in an email interview about the roles of training, skilling, and entrepreneurial endeavour in facing the coronavirus disease challenge, and in a post-Covid world.Edited excerpts:How is the ministry meeting the challenges brought on by the pandemic?The ministry has aligned its efforts with the Centre and has extended support to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) by making their National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs), their hostels and the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in the country available for conversion into quarantine or isolation facilities so that we have enough wards to observe and treat those infected by the virus. We have also shared the details of nearly one lakh (100,000) candidates skilled in health care related sectors through various programmes under the Skill India Mission. These professionals will help in containing the spread of the infection and efficiently manage patients in quarantine and hospital facilities that will be set up in the coming days. Additionally, a list of 2,000 health care trainers and more than 500 health care assessors have also been shared with MoHFW, who can be utilised for services.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWe have also taken steps to ensure that candidates undergoing apprenticeship training across various establishments, do not suffer from the economic impact of the infection. MSDE has notified all establishments under designated and optional trade to pay full stipend to apprentices engaged with them. The government will reimburse stipends to these establishments under National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) for the lockdown period as per guidelines.What is the number of those who will be reimbursed?Currently there are 24,884 establishments engaging 2.42 lakh (242,000) apprentices in both designated and optional trade. As per the provision under NAPS, the government reimburses 25% of the stipend amount to be paid to apprentices per month subject to a maximum of Rs 1,500 per month. During the lockdown period due to Covid-19 pandemic, the government will be paying approximately Rs 36.30 crore to the establishments who would be claiming reimbursement for engaging apprentices under NAPS during this periodEvery sector is expected to reel under from the impact of the pandemic. There are projections of job losses. How will the ministry ramp up efforts at skilling so that people can be self-reliant?The virus will undoubtedly impact the economy and industries will see sluggish growth, especially in sectors like aviation, tourism and hospitality, and automobile. However, we do not intend to slow down the process of training and readying people especially in skills for Industry 4.0 that will definitely gain more in importance once we get over this crisis. We will continue to assess the situation and, in line with the directives provided by the central government, extend the necessary support.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakOur commitment to the people and to the economy remains unchanged; we will gradually pace the skilling efforts, impart trainings and ensure measures to re-skill and upskill young people. Some of our trainees in short-term training programmes and Jan Shikhsa Sansthans have committed themselves to the service of the nation by manufacturing and producing masks and sanitisers, operating from their homes.What is the feedback from your interaction with people on the ground, what is the initial assessment of the lockdown and what has emerged as areas that need focus?Members of both the public and industry feel that we need to first control the spread of this deadly virus and then go ahead with the revival work. So far, India has been successful in managing the spread of Covid-19 with measures such as the lockdown and underlining the importance of social distancing. Of course, there is the concern that the virus is outpacing the economy, and it is true to some extent. Industries have suffered, people are worried about their livelihoods and jobs. However, the government has taken deep and preventive measures to address some of these concerns and have promised that livelihoods will be protected.We have seen how even developed countries have been affected by this pandemic and we must learn from these examples and win again this outbreak. At this point, the government’s priority is to save lives and stop the virus from spreading and that is possible only through strict adherence to social distancing, by staying at home. Only then will we be able to flatten the curve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-intention-of-slowing-down-training-and-readying-of-people-mahender-nath-pandey/story-O0XVGJ3swBmkhjn92xNpKL.html

But the same day, thousands of miles away in Madrid, his uncle Mohan breathed his last after battling the same infection for nearly a week.Himanshu, 37, and his uncle last met in Turkey, where the entire family had gathered in the second week of March for a wedding. When Himanshu came back to India on March 18, accompanied by his mother, wife, daughter, uncle and aunt, he was examined at the airport but was cleared.Three days later, he went to the local hospital with his wife after a throat infection and submitted a throat swab. Later that night, the report came back positive for Covid-19 and his entire family was quarantined at the Institute of Infectious Diseases in Jodhpur.He was discharged on April 6.But Mohan, 71, was less lucky. “Mohan’s health check or screening was not done when he returned to Spain from Turkey. After 4-5 days, seeing symptoms like illness, the doctor came,” said Mohan’s brother and Himashu’s father, Shankar.The doctor asked Mohan to stay home instead of admitting him in the hospital and gave him medicines, but his health deteriorated. On March 31, Mohan was taken to a hospital where he was kept in the ICU, but his condition didn’t improve. “Patients are not being admitted unless the condition is very critical. Mohan’s funeral may have to wait for a month,” said Shankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jodhpur-s-first-covid-19-patient-recovers-uncle-dies-in-spain/story-aPTugarOVzq0Plm4lSPLTN.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Wednesday morning, some TV channels that use the health ministry’s data on Covid-19 put out an alarming number – that the number of cases had increased by 773 in the previous 24 hours, after increasing by only 354 in the 24 hours prior to that. This wasn’t entirely accurate, simply because, while the number of cases did increase by 773, not all cases were discovered in the previous 24 hours. Indeed, that’s the reason HT’s own numbers are usually different from the ministry’s. The HT number is based on two data sources – a tracker on Covid19india.org, a data resource site maintained by volunteers, and, more importantly, releases from state health departments. Some of the latter come out late in the evening, and HT collates all of them up at 10.30pm (sometimes 10.45pm). We started doing this after we realised that the health ministry was collating data with a lag. This may cause people to misinterpret the data. For instance, according to the numbers collated by HT, there were 526 new cases till late Tuesday evening. The corresponding number on Monday evening was 582, and Sunday 515. Clearly, there was no real spike on Tuesday as a jump from 354 new cases to 773 new cases would indicate.According to HT’s dashboard, the number of cases in India was 5,885 on Wednesday (with 178 deaths). In the previous 24 hours, 580 new cases were identified.The number of new cases in Maharashtra on Wednesday was 117, taking the state’s total to 1,135. The first case in Maharashtra was identified on March 9, and the spread of the disease in the state seems to have been driven, at least initially, by the lack of screening of travellers arriving in India by air. The western state sees a lot of people travelling to and from West Asia, and it is believed that the initial infection may have journeyed with travellers from the United Arab Emirates. The chief minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray, has also attributed the high number of cases in the state to more aggressive testing, including door-to-door surveys. Worryingly for Mumbai (and India), five more cases were identified in Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum, on Wednesday. Not surprisingly, Mumbai has made masks compulsory. Actually, given that many people infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and that the virus stays infectious in small particle aerosols (including, in some cases, mere exhalations), India should make masks compulsory, even if they are homemade from fabric.Maharashtra wasn’t the only state to get tough with such measures on Wednesday; Uttar Pradesh (361 cases and 4 deaths on Wednesday), has announced that 105 hot spots across 15 of the worst affected districts in the state (including Delhi’s satellite Noida) will see a hard lockdown, with comprehensive restrictions on movement of people. The state also made it mandatory for everyone to wear masks in public places (see page 4). Delhi named 13 new hot spots on Wednesday, to add to the existing 7. It too, made masks mandatory for anyone who is out. These restrictions are stricter than the ones already in place during the ongoing 21-day national lockdown.The national lockdown was set to end on April 14, but it is now clear that it won’t, at least not entirely. In a virtual meeting with floor leaders of various parties, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said as much. HT has previously reported on research at the University of Cambridge that used mathematical models built around India’s disease and demographic data to present two scenarios where the rate of new infections actually decreased – one lockdown of 49 days, or three lockdowns of 21, 28, and 18 days with a five-day break between each. Still, research looks at issues in isolation; policy makers and administrators have a far tougher job. At this point in time, as indicated by Prime Minister Modi’s comments in the meeting, India’s policy makers have decided that a “lockdown is the only way for us to save the lives of our citizens”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today-april-9-2020/story-mmr5RmGaIWDT9WSTRTe67O.html
09-04-2020||India||Jaish terrorist killed in Kashmir’s Sopore area||A 23-year-old Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) commander was killed after a day-long gunbattle with security forces as part of an ongoing counter-insurgency operation in Jammu & Kashmir’s Sopore town on Wednesday, a police spokesman said.The gunbattle is the latest in a series of firefights between militants and security forces in Jammu & Kashmir since Saturday. The escalation in violence has coincided with the lockdown in the region as part of the nationwide measures taken to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The spokesman cited above said Sajjad Nawab Dar, the commander, was killed a day after the army, police and paramilitary forces launched a joint operation in Sopore’s Gulabad Arampora locality following intelligence inputs about the militant presence thereHe said the locality was completely sealed and security forces ensured that it was well lighted to prevent militants from escaping the area under the cover of darkness. The exchange of fire between the security forces and militants began on Wednesday morning and continued till late in the evening. The spokesman said Dar was killed in the initial gunfight and was later identified as a local militant, who lived barely two to three kilometers away from the firefight site. He added while Dar was neutralised, the gunfight and the operation were underway. “The operation was launched on a credible input that two to four terrorists were present in the area.’’The spokesman said Dar threatened and intimidated peace-loving citizens of Sopore and its peripheral areas. “He explored the opportunities to assault security forces and VIP rallies through his OGWs [overground workers] and also motivated local youth for the execution of grenade attacks against monetary benefits,” he said. He added the militant used modern approaches of communication with other conduits of the outfit via social media apps.Police said Dar had joined militant ranks two years ago.Earlier, the mobile internet was also suspended in Sopore as a precautionary measure in view of the gunbattle, which left a house where the militants were holed up completely damaged.This was the third gunbattle between militants and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir since Saturday. Five commandos of an elite army special forces’ unit were killed in action along the Line of Control, the de facto border with Pakistan, in Jammu & Kashmir’s Keran sector on Sunday during an intense close-quarters battle with an equal number of infiltrators who were all eliminated. The bodies of the five infiltrators were buried in a nearby forest after their DNA samples were taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaish-terrorist-killed-in-kashmir-s-sopore-area/story-iAxpRZc7yVRKkQy9pK4OlM.html

It was a sharp contrast to his interaction with reporters this week when Trump threatened “retaliation” if the restrictions weren’t lifted.“Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Thank you Prime Minister @NarendraModi for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight!,” President Trump tweeted. Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Thank you Prime Minister @NarendraModi for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight!Trump’s tweet reflected the sentiment that he had expressed in an interview with Fox News a few hours earlier. In this one, he had spoken about buying more than 29 million tablets of the drug, his conversation with PM Modi on Saturday and India’s success in handling the pandemic.“I asked him (PM Modi) if he would release it? He was great. He was really good. You know they put a stop because they wanted it for India. But there is a lot of good things coming from that. Lot of people looking at it and saying, you know I don’t hear bad stories, I hear good stories. And I don’t hear anything where it was causing death,” he told the TV news channel in the interview.Covid-19 | Trump thanks Modi; India seeks US help on tech; tax refund: 10 updatesIndia is the world’s largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine, producing nearly 70 percent of the world’s supply. The demand for the drug, which is also used by patients of rheumatoid arthritis, was boosted after a small placebo-controlled clinical trial in China demonstrated that the anti-malarial drug shortened the duration and reduced the severity of cough, fever and pneumonia in patients with mild and moderate disease.India banned the export of hydroxychloroquine and any formulation containing it on March 25. Last week the ban was expanded to cover exports from special economic zones, blocking pending orders, including from the US.Also Read: In PM Modi’s hydroxychloroquine export order, a Covid-19 message to the worldDonald Trump spoke to PM Modi to lift the restrictions on Saturday. The same day, PM Modi received phone calls from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as well. In all, requests were received from 20 countries to lift this restriction.On Monday, a committee of bureaucrats which looked into the issue decided to rescind the restriction placed on Saturday by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade and let the department of pharmaceuticals decide.India’s National Taskforce for Covid-19 only recommends the use of hydroxychloroquine for infections among “asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19” and “asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases”.The Indian Council of Medical Research says hydroxychloroquine has been found to be effective against coronavirus in laboratory studies and in-vivo studies. “Its use in prophylaxis is derived from available evidence of benefit as treatment and supported by pre-clinical data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-be-forgotten-donald-trump-tweets-thank-you-to-pm-modi-indians-for-allowing-export-of-covid-19-drug/story-4jvYIBkiNBeJySuYSOEf7J.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Sabarimala may turn to digital offerings||The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), which runs temples in southern India including Kerala’s Sabarimala shrine, has informed its 3,500-odd employees that there could be a possible salary cut even as it plans to accept online offerings to overcome a shortage of funds amid the national lockdown imposed to check the coronavirus pandemic. It is deploying a skeleton staff for performing important rituals at the shrine for the purpose.“At Sabarimala, we do have a system for online offerings in a small way. We are planning to diversify it in a big way. For some of the offerings, a devotee’s presence is a must but for others including archana, ganapati homam, and neeranjanam, offerings can be made from anywhere. So, we are planning a campaign to popularise this,” said TDB president N Vasu. He said they have alerted the employees that they may have to forego at least one-month salary. “Earlier the government used to come to our rescue but now we cannot turn to it,” said Vasu.The TDB has made an announcement about online offerings on its website and plans to issue advertisements in this regard in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana, where Sabarimala temple gets the bulk of its devotees from.The Sabrimala Temple was closed after monthly puja on March 18 days before the lockdown was imposed on March 25. At least 14,000 devotees trekked to the hill shrine in Pathanamthitta district despite the government and TDB’s warnings against large gatherings at the temple in view of the pandemic, according to reports. The TDB later cancelled a 10-day temple festival that was scheduled in March end and Vishu festival celebrations on April 14. A large number of devotees flock to the hill temple on these two occasions. Kerala reported the first Covid-19 case in the country in January and Pathanamthitta collector PB Nooh had warned the government against opening the temple for the two events. Vasu said even after the lockdown is lifted, it will be difficult for them to allow devotees without any restrictions. “We have to take drastic measures to regulate their numbers and flow. During Vishu festival also only rituals will be there,” said Vasu. He added the TDB needs to popularise the online offering to restrict the number of pilgrims.During the last annual pilgrimage season from October to January, the Sabarimala temple earned a revenue of Rs 263. 57 crore, according to the TDB. TDB officials said the board has donated ₹1 crore to the chief minister’s relief fund for the fight against the pandemic despite the cash crunch. “We will be missing two major festivals in Sabarimala. So we are not in a position to offer anything more.”Sabarimala is among the richest temples in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-may-turn-o-digital-offerings/story-2iK6Z4AGzYEDr5NmOMiQpM.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Masks must in Delhi, 23 ‘zones’ sealed fully||Authorities in Delhi announced on Wednesday a hard lockdown of 23 neighbourhoods with large number of Covid-19 cases and ordered all citizens to wear masks while stepping out of their homes, tightening curbs to combat the outbreak even as 93 new cases took the total number of infections in the national capital to 669.In these zones, people will need to mandatorily keep indoors and all businesses – including grocery stores and banks that have been exempted from curbs as essential services – will be shut. Critical services such as food and medicine will be home-delivered by government personnel. “There are 20 areas that have become hot spots and are being turned into containment zones. These areas will be completely sealed while the administration will ensure door-to-door delivery of essential items. No one else will be allowed to enter or exit the area,” Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told reporters following an urgent meeting called by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal with his top officials. These include buildings (such as the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Nizamuddin), neighbourhoods (such as Mandi House, two blocks in Nizamuddin and one in Malviya Nagar), apartment complexes (three in east Delhi, one in Dwarka), and congested alleys in other parts of the city. The curbs will stay in place “till the potential threat of Covid-19 is not ruled out” in the areas, officials said. Shortly afterwards, three more zones were added to the list after cluster cases were discovered. The chief secretary of Delhi, who also attended the meeting, separately issued an order mandating wearing of masks by anyone who steps out of their home. The order specified that the rule will also apply while people are in any indoor area outside of their home – such as bank, hospital, or even their offices – or in any type of vehicle. “Wearing of facial masks can reduce the spread of coronavirus substantially. Therefore, it has been decided that facial masks will be compulsory for anyone stepping out of their house. Cloth mask shall be eligible too,” CM Kejriwal said.The tightening of measures comes at a time when officials are debating whether, and how, the unprecedented nationwide lockdown should be relaxed after April 14, the date when the three-week curbs are scheduled to end. A hard lockdown has been identified as the key containment strategy at this stage, when India is seeing a steady stream of cases that can still be interrupted by stringent tactics that force people into social distancing. The size of the containment zones announced on Wednesday, as suggested by the Union health ministry’s guidelines, is directly proportional to the population density of the cluster in question and the scale of the outbreak.At nine, east Delhi has the highest number of containment zones. The Mandi House emerged as the first containment zone in Lutyens’ Delhi after three people in Bengali Market tested positive. The order for containment plan of Bengali Market also included action against a bakery shop for keeping workers in “highly unhygienic conditions” with notes on social distancing not being followed. The district administration led by New Delhi DM Tanvi Garg screened 325 houses, two markets and about 2,000 people in the area. Another area that has been a containment zone but did not find a mention in the first list is the South Moti Bagh. slum. In another order by Garg later on Wednesday, she issued a fresh containment plan for the entire Shastri Market and the JJ cluster in South Moti Bagh, and its adjoining area.The CM also directed all government departments to stop any expense other than the salary of employees. “Any expense other than those related to relief work pertaining to the coronavirus lockdown will need special permission of the finance department. The government needs to cut down expenses,” said Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/masks-must-in-delhi-23-zones-sealed-fully/story-ECAVSzmu3KIiEL4Nis8eOP.html
09-04-2020||India||Medical officer shifted as Bhopal becomes Covid-19 hot spot||The Madhya Pradesh government on Wednesday shifted chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Sudhir Dehariya, preceded by the transfer of two IAS officers to the health department, as Bhopal has become another Covid-19 hot spot in a span of five days.An IAS officer of the 1989 batch and additional chief secretary (ACS) Mohd Suleiman will now head the department of health, while 2006-batch IAS officer Sudam Khade has been brought in as director of the department.Earlier, a principal secretary who was heading the department and a director in the department both tested positive for Covid-19, along with more than 40 other officials and employees in the department’s directorate over the past five days.The directorate is considered the disease hot spot in Bhopal now.Besides this rejig, the state government also invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) on Wednesday to prohibit government employees from refusing to work.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Wednesday, “There will be complete lockdown in 14 districts. It’s the responsibility of the district administration to ensure the supply of essential commodities. The police will lodge an FIR on those who conceal their illness.”As per the health department’s bulletin on Wednesday evening the number of Covid-19 positive cases went up to 341, with 51 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. Indore tops the list of 13 districts having Covid-19 positive cases with 173 cases followed by Bhopal with 94 cases. Twenty-four have died in the state of the deadly virus so far.Madhya Pradesh health services commissioner Faiz Ahmad Kidwai on Wednesday said, “As many as 4,056 samples have been tested so far, out of which 3,442 samples have shown negative results. Our testing capacity has increased. Now we are testing as many as 700 samples every day.”A poster boy of health department till Tuesday and appreciated by his commitment by none else than chief minister of the state besides hundreds others on social media chief medical and health officer (CMHO) at Bhopal Dr Sudhir Dehariya was shifted from Bhopal to neighbouring district Sehore on Wednesday, as per an administrative order.Shifted from Bhopal and brought back on the same post within a day earlier on March 26 Dr Dehariya became a poster boy for thousands of doctors across the country amid their fight against coronavirus, after a photo went viral on social media.Dr Dehariya who is an orthopedic surgeon reached his residence on March 30 for a few minutes to see his family after a gap of five days. However, to avoid any possibility of his family being affected by coronavirus he maintained a distance from the family members, sat outside the gate and have a cup of tea before returning to his office again.Dr Dehariya’s neighbour snapped a photo and he posted it on social media which went viral to draw a lot of appreciation for the doctor’s commitment and dedication.Meanwhile, former chief minister Kamal Nath and Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha have criticised the government over invoking of ESMA and demanded that the government should withdraw it in the interest of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-officer-shifted-as-bhopal-becomes-hot-spot/story-87FihuMJSxdfg71YgWa5TI.html
09-04-2020||India||In Ludhiana, tailors respond by switching from kurtas to masks||Till last month, the tailor shops in Ludhiana’s small towns were busy making ladies’ blouses and kurta-pajamas on order. In the past six days, their brief has undergone a swift revision.Since April 2, the tailors of at least three small towns, three towns of Payal, Doraha and Malout have been stitching at least 450 to 500 cotton masks a day, for which they are being paid Rs 15 a mask by the district administration. The authorities are funding the project through two agencies — the District Red Cross Society and the Local Bodies Department. Till date, an amount of Rs 1 lakh has been incurred by the administration for the project.Several individuals and even a gurudwara in Payal have offered donations to the project — money, fabric and elastic bands.“There was an acute shortage of masks in the market and so we decided to make best use of our talent. It takes us about 20 minutes to make a mask which can be washed and re-worn many times,” said 36-year-old Nihal Ahmad, one of the tailors in Payal, a nondescript town located close to the National Highway 44 that runs through the middle of Punjab and outskirts of Ludhiana city. The tailors themselves are taking precautions like using sanitiser and sitting at a distance from each other inside a shop, Ahmad said.The administration has sourced the fabric from suppliers in the city. One of the suppliers, Rajiv Grover of Ram Pal and Company in Payal, said he supplied five metres of cotton fabric to the tailors last week but it was a struggle as the shops are closed due to the lockdown. “We are getting in touch with traders and manufacturers who are donating, so that the work doesn’t stop,” he said.An advisory issued by the ministry of health and family affairs last week stated that homemade protective masks helped maintain “personal hygiene” and could be used by those who weren’t suffering from any medical condition or didn’t have any breathing difficulty, especially while stepping out. However, such masks were not recommended for Covid-19 patients or those involved in their care including healthcare workers and medical professionals.“The supply of fabric is not an issue,” sub divisional magistrate Sagar Setia said, adding that the district authorities have supplied the cloth required to make these masks — all of them are being made using three layers of cloth, covering the nose and mouth of a wearer. The authorities have given these masks to village authorities to distribute in villages.“We put the masks in the kits meant to supply ration to poor people so that these can reach all homes. At other places we are doing door to door distribution. At some places we are seeking help of the police who also supply it to the villagers and those in need of masks,” Pradeep Kumar Bains, tehsildaar of Payal sub division, said. Around 900 ration kits with these cotton masks in them have already been distributed.Across villages, it is usually the men who wear these masks.“Th­ese masks are of considerable benefit to the women who usually use a dupatta to cover their face. But a dupatta usually requires frequent handling which is not good,” said Sunita Kumari, one of the tailors making these cotton masks.“I got a mask with the ration kit but wore it only once. My son then took it and plays with it,” said Chanda, a 35-yearold resident of Doraha and the wife of a farm labourer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-ludhiana-tailors-respond-by-switching-from-kurtas-to-masks/story-iwe4ewenPXWDWrYfIrLtqM.html
09-04-2020||India||Malayalam actor teaches jail inmates mask-making||Acclaimed south Indian actor Indrans, known for his comic roles, on Tuesday displayed his life skills to the inmates of Thiruvananthapuram’s central jail by making personal protective equipment such as a mask in nine minutes amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak across the country.Indrans (64) rose to the occasion and unpacked his erstwhile professional skills --- he was a tailor before trying his hand as a comedian on the silver screen -- as he sought to train anyone who wants to make masks on a mass scale.“Anyone can make a mask. You don’t need crowd medicine stores and exhaust their stocks, especially when the frontline workers battling the Covid-19 pandemic need them desperately. The need of the hour is some basic tailoring skills and only nine minutes of your time,” he said.He urged people to make masks with old thick clothes and avoid non-woven fabric. “We can recycle some of our old clothes. Layers of clothes can be added to make a mask stronger,” he added.Indrans’ mask-making video has gone viral in social media after the Kerala Social Security Mission posted it online. In the video, Indrans is seen giving step-by-step instructions to make a mask, urging people to make it at home. He also gave tips on how to wear a mask.“Usually, people forget their roots after they attain superstardom. But you’re an exception,” wrote one of his fans, as Indrans has always been known for down-to-earth personality.The actor, who won the best actor’s award at the South Asian International Films last year for his stellar performance in the Malayalam movie, Veyilmarangal, said that he would impart tailoring lessons to the needy. In 2018, he won the best actor award for his role in the Malayalam movie, Aalorukkam.Indrans made his debut in films as a costume designer but later found his métier as a comedian. He has starred in over 500 films to date.The inmates at all three central and district jails have been engaged in making masks. Over one lakh masks were handed over to the state government two days ago and the jail authorities are planning to ramp up the production of masks and hand sanitisers to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak. Kerala has reported 336 Covid-19 positive cases and two deaths till Tuesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malayalam-actor-teaches-jail-inmates-mask-making/story-2iw9b5ID2N3Tnv1wA0fBlL.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Where relief falls short, groups of volunteers step in, plug gaps||Utpal Basumallik was on one of the last international flights to land in India, arriving in Kolkata on March 19 from New Jersey with a stopover in Abu Dhabi, three days before India suspended all inbound flights to stop the spread of the coronavirus infection (Covid-19). Basumallik, a 72-year-old diabetic, was taken to a quarantine facility and discharged nine days later with a certificate that bore the medical superintendent’s signature. None of this was harrowing for Basumallik who, together with some other senior citizens, made a video thanking the government for taking such good care of them. It was only when he reached his four-storey building on Bangur Avenue — where he was asked to spend the remaining five days of his quarantine — that his ordeal began. Basumallik didn’t have any supplies at home. Being under home quarantine, he couldn’t step out to buy them. And his neighbours didn’t even want him in the building.“I was totally exhausted,” Basumallik recounted. He had just lugged two large suitcases up the stairs — he lives on the top floor and the building doesn’t have an elevator. “I called my daughter and after hearing my ordeal, she started crying.”That same night, Pamul Joshi, a 32-year old marketing strategist, read about Basumallik’s experience on the Facebook page of a week-old volunteers group called Caremongers India, after Basumallik’s daughter put up a post on it seeking help. A resident of Kakurgachi, around four kilometres from Bangur Avenue, Joshi dropped off supplies, including vegetables, yogurt, a few groceries and water bottles at Basumallik’s apartment the following day.“I call him everyday to check on how he’s doing so he doesn’t feel alone,” Joshi said.As the coronavirus disease epidemic spreads, an army of volunteers in the form of groups like Caremongers has stepped up to come to the aid of people in need like Basumallik in a humanitarian endeavour supplementing the relief efforts of government institutions and established non-government organisations.They are volunteering their time, energy and money to help those who are helpless in the face of the global pandemic that has infected over 1 million people worldwide. On crowdfunding platform Ketto, a microsite has come up only for Covid-19 campaigns. Over Rs 3 crore has been raised since the first campaign was launched on March 6.Connecting people Caremongers’s founder, Bengaluru-based digital marketing professional Mahita Nagaraj, was running some errands on March 15 when she received a call from a friend in Birmingham, England, requesting her to deliver medicines to her elderly parents’ home in the city.That’s when it struck Nagaraj, 38, that the pandemic sweeping the world would hit vulnerable sections like the elderly harder than the others. On March 17, she made a Facebook group, Caremongers India. The idea was simple: Not everyone would be able to run errands to buy supplies like groceries or medicines, so connect them to people who would be willing to help them do so.“I can proudly say that there’s not one state or Union territory in the country where a person hasn’t signed up as a volunteer,” said Nagaraj. The network has grown to over 10,000 volunteers, who have organised themselves into Whatsapp groups based on the states they are in. Each volunteer is given responsibility for two people in need, based on their locations. A core team of eight, including Nagaraj, have divided up responsibilities among themselves: managing the requests being made on Facebook, answering the helpline, passing on requests to the relevant Whatsapp group, creating a database of vendors, and, finally, managing requests with city coordinators appointed in each group. “We’ve moved into a weekly schedule,” Nagaraj said. “We’re creating a database of people who need our help, and now our volunteers will call in on them once a week to find out their weekly requirements, groceries, essentials, medicines, purchase it on their behalf and make sure the delivery happens.” The person availing of this service would be required to pay for the supplies. The idea, Nagaraj said, is to promote physical distancing, prevent panic buying and hoarding as well as ensure that volunteers don’t step out more than once a week, given the national lockdown.Filling the gapsOn March 24, the prime minister announced a 21-day national lockdown that was to go into effect the following day, saying this was the only way to check the spread of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has infected over 1,000 people in India. Even before the lockdown was announced, several states announced relief packages: Uttar Pradesh promised to pay Rs 1,000 each to 3.5 million labourers, and a month’s free household rations to 16 million construction workers; Kerala offered loans and advance payment of pension in its Rs 20,000 crore package; Delhi announced free rations to 7.2 million beneficiaries, among other things; Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Bihar also promised free rations to beneficiaries of welfare schemes. Volunteers are trying to address the needs of communities that are not being met by the state.Jatin Kumar, 23, is one of 200 Gurugram residents who signed up last week to volunteer for the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, which has identified more than 50 spots in the city, such as in Sectors 9, 37 and 56, where people are in need of food supplies or cooked food.Kumar has been dropping off bundles comprising five kilograms of rice, one kilogram of lentils, a litre of oil, a kilogram of salt and sugar each, and 100 grams of turmeric, cumin and chilli powder, at the doorsteps of the needy since March.  Kumar, whose work in a UK-based firm starts only after 8pm, admits his parents are worried, but he is taking whatever precaution he can: he wears a face mask, he maintains a physical distance from everyone he meets, and he regularly sanitises his hands.Intekhab Alam, 41, runs a mechanic’s shop in Dwarka’s Sector 7, and lives in Mohan Garden, a low income group neighbourhood in Uttam Nagar. On March 25, he and an associate began to collect money to buy food for other residents of his area, many of whom are daily wagers. Anhad, a Delhi-based NGO to which Alam belongs, sent out a call for funds: hoping to raise Rs 87,500 to buy supplies that would be distributed among 100 people during the lockdown. Within a day, Alam said, Rs 1.8 lakh was raised The money was used to buy rice, lentils and flour, which they began to distribute daily starting on March 26. “The response to our call was overwhelming and we collected more than we asked for... We now have requests from over 900 families from various parts of Delhi and other states as well... the crisis is humongous,” said Shabnam Hashmi, who too is a member of Anhad.Face masksAlam and his team also prepare packages of rice, lentils, oil, milk powder and soap for rickshaw pullers living in Palam Extension. “They have no ration cards, because they’re migrants. So they can’t get any of the government’s rations,” he said. There is one thing that Alam wishes he could add in that package, and distribute to the people queuing up for the supplies in Mohan Garden: face masks. “We tried looking everywhere, but we couldn’t find any,” he said.To counter a similar shortage in Punjab, several families — and even members of self-help groups engaged in Phulkari embroidery — in Patiala have taken to making face masks using triple-layer cloth specific to such masks.Matisha Bansal, 25, a lawyer, together with other members of her family, including her father, Ambrish, who is a member of the Patiala Industry Association, has been making masks using the special triple-layer cloth. “We have stitched 6,000 masks in the last five days. I am doing my bit to fight against Covid-19,” she said. The material, bought by the association, was supplied by the local administration.“Self-help groups (engaged n Phulkari embroidery) have made 100,000 masks. Everyone, including businessmen (and their families), are contributing,” deputy commissioner Kumar Amit said. In Baripada town of Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district, Nirupama Sahoo has converted her tutorial institute into a mask-making unit — the masks are made of simple cotton. “I have already distributed more than 3,000 masks among people living on the streets, and I’ve also made them aware of the importance of self-hygiene,” Sahoo said.In Hyderabad, Khalida Parveen, a pharmacist from the Mehdipatnam area, has been cooking 25 kilograms of vegetable tahari — a preparation of rice, tomato, and spices — every morning since March 22, the day after Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced a lockdown of the state. Friends and relatives distribute the meal to the needy -- a homeless person or a daily wager or a migrant making his way back home.“My family is helping me, and so are many Hindu families in my neighbourhood. My sons and their friends have been supplying these food packets to different places every day,” Parveen said. -- With inputs from Dhamini Ratnam, Archana Mishra, Vishal Rambani, Debabrata Mohanty, Srinivasa Rao Apparasu||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-where-relief-falls-short-groups-of-volunteers-step-in-plug-gaps/story-IjSSwB7rNsbJPD3ChRXSqO.html

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked citizens to wear face masks when they are outside even if they are simple home-made ones. Any person who doesn’t wear a mask when outdoors will be punished with a fine or even arrested failing to wear mask can now be levied a fine or even face arrest under section 188 Indian Penal Code (disobeying a regulation made under the Epidemic Diseases Act.The circular issued by civic chief Praveen Pardeshi says, “Any person moving around in his personal or official vehicle must be wearing masks. No person/ officer will attend any meeting/ gathering, work place without wearing these masks.’’In Uttar Pradesh, additional chief secretary Awanish Awasthi told a press conference: “Wearing of masks has been made compulsory in the state. There can be legal action also for not wearing masks.” In Jammu and Kashmir, an order issued by the General Administration Department (GAD) said face masks had been made mandatory for all officers, staff and visitors in the civil secretariat as a preventive measure to stop the spread of the coronavirus.The Civil Secretariat is presently functional in Jammu as part of the bi-annual darbar move, under which the government functions six months each in Jammu and Srinagar during winter and summer months.“Accordingly, all the administrative secretaries are authorised to effect the purchase of masks, so as to provide three (3) reusable masks for each employee of his/her department in the civil secretariat. The expenditure on this account shall be defrayed from the office expenses (OE) head,” additional secretary, GAD, Rohit Sharma said.In Ladakh, Leh’s district magistrate Sachin Kumar Vaishya ordered the general public as well as government officials (both civilian and armed forces) to mandatorily wear the face masks at public places without any exception.“In case of any violation, penal action under rules shall be taken against the violators. This shall come into force with effect from April 9,” he said in his order.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-up-j-k-and-ladakh-make-mask-wearing-mandatory/story-G2i5ev87niL11SWWXq5Q0K.html
09-04-2020||India||Higher air pollution could increase Covid death rate||Air pollution is likely to be a major risk factor in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) mortality, scientists have contended -- a finding that could have serious implications for India.Prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory response even among the young and healthy, which makes people living in polluted areas more susceptible to developing chronic respiratory conditions. This is borne out by the high Covid-19-related death rates in northern Italy compared to the rest of the country, according to environmental scientists and physicians in Italy.And an analysis by Harvard University’s TH Chan School of Public Health, published in MedRxiv, a pre-print journal for health sciences, on April 5, of 3,080 counties in the US, an increase of only 1 microgram per cubic metre in PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter measuring 2.5 micrometres or less) concentrations is associated with a 15% increase in Covid-19 deaths.The US’s annual PM 2.5 average is around 9.9 micrograms per cubic metre (meets the World Health Organization’s annual air quality guideline of 10 micrograms per cubic metre) whereas India’s annual average PM 2.5 concentration was more than 80 micrograms per cubic metres in 2017, according to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study, indicating that Indians’ exposure to polluted air is about eight times higher.“Their analysis is robust.We need to estimate the same for India as it is not possible to extrapolate the impact at high pollution level linearly. Covid mortality rate also depends on pre-existing conditions (like diabetes, heart problems). So, the Indian context may be completely different. As of now we may not have enough Covid cases to perform the analysis and get the statistically significant result,” said Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi.In another paper titled “Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high-level of Sars-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?” published in Elsevier’s journal of Environmental Pollution on April 4, scientists said that the mortality was 12% in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, compared to 4.5% in the rest of the country. This region is one of Europe’s most polluted based on data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa)’s Aura satellite.The data indicates that there is stagnation of pollutants in the region because of geographical and climatic factors. A review of the air quality index (AQI), based on the concentrations of particulate matter and other gases, is also the worst in this region in Italy.“Air pollution represents one of the most well-known causes of prolonged inflammation, eventually leading to an innate immune system hyper-activation,” the study by scientists at the rheumatology unit of the University of Siena and departmental of environmental science at Arhaus University said. The paper concluded that pollution impairs the first line of defence of the upper airways called cilia (microscopic hair-like structures or organelles) which is why people in polluted areas are more likely to develop chronic respiratory conditions due to an infective agent like Sars-CoV-2.This was seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2002 too. A study by scientists of the Fielding School of Public Health analysed five regions with 100 or more Sars cases which showed that the fatality rate increased with the increment in AQI or air pollution levels. Moderate AQIs had an 84% increased risk of dying from Sars compared to those from regions with lower AQI.“When a population is chronically exposed to high levels of air pollution, the lung is compromised. The lung develops an inflammation. In short, the lung becomes ready for external attack. Those living in areas with cleaner air are more battle-ready,” said Dr Manas Ranjan Ray, former assistant director of Kolkata-based Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute. “There have bee high cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), rhinitis and other conditions, which have manifestations similar to Covid-19. Indian population is extremely vulnerable to rhinoviruses but we’ve grown immunity and come out of it within four to five days. But the unique feature of Sars-CoV-2 is that it can be fatal for some people. This is a great opportunity to study how the impact of a new virus is influenced by air pollution,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/higher-air-pollution-could-increase-covid-death-rate/story-YjQfKLPJ8VlKVWWOjfTRjI.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Govt issues advisory to stem social stigma||The backlash against health care and sanitation workers and police personnel at the frontline of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has prompted the government to release a set of guidelines for the general public titled “Addressing Social Stigma Associated with Covid-19”. The note also mentions the trend of people associating certain communities and areas with the disease, based on false reports , perhaps referring to the general targeting of Muslims in some parts of the country after around 426 of the 669 cases in Delhi were of people who attended a gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin in March. However, the thrust of the advisory is to prevent the discrimination of health care and sanitary workers and remove misconceptions about the disease -- and to point out that it is not patients’ fault that they got infected. The advisory prescribes a list of dos and don’ts . It asks them to appreciate the efforts of people providing essential services, share information authenticated by either the government, the ministry of health and family welfare, or the World Health Organisation, and share only positive stories. It also asks them to avoid spreading the names and identity of those affected or under quarantine, and not target healthcare and sanitary workers or police. “Sanitary workers and police are also doing selfless service and playing critical roles in addressing the challenge of COVID-19. They all deserve our support, praise and appreciation,” the advisory said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-advisory-to-stem-social-stigma/story-mc9PBhMgHaou8DBA8mtYUI.html
09-04-2020||India||No dearth of anti-malaria drug, say states amid local concerns||A day after India said it will allow limited exports of the anti-malaria hydroxychloroquine, officials across several states insisted there is no shortage of the drug. Hydroxychloroquine has emerged as the most sought-after medicine after preliminary trials in China suggested it boosted recovery and lowered the severity of the coronavirus disease.The limited exports were allowed after US president Donald Trump requested the supply of the drug from India in a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday. Trump also warned of retaliation if India did not take up his request. On Wednesday, HT did a reality check across states on the availability of the medicine amid complaints by patients about its shortage. Here, is a summary of reports from various states:KeralaThe Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd, the state’s medicine and medical equipment procurement agency, managing director Dr S R Dileep Kumar said they have enough stock of the hydroxychloroquine tablets. “We have got 1.2 million tablets last week and we placed the order for another five lakh that we will get next week. There is no shortage,” he said.But many retail medical outlets said their stocks have exhausted after people started buying in panic. Worried, the health department has asked medical shops to supply the tablets only to the people who come with prescriptions. RajasthanJaipur-resident, Ritesh Sharma, 44, who has been having hydroxycholoquinine for 10 years, said local chemists have run out of its stocks for 15 days. Sharma has rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and helps to slow down its progression.The shortage prompted the Rajasthan government to issue an order to acquire all stocks of hydroxycholoquine from stockists, wholesalers and retailers. It later asked officials to return 25% of the stocks to pharmacists. “The state government got 450,000 tablets from the government of India over the last two days. That was also the reason why we returned some of the tablets to be sold to people who have prescriptions,” he (WHO) said.“Total allocation of 4.5 million tablets has been made to the state [Rajasthan] and this will be delivered in phases until the end of April,” said Union health ministry officer on special duty Sudhansh Pant. In the last five days, 1.15 million tablets of hydroxycholoquinine have been delivered to Rajasthan, an official said.Madhya PradeshVikas Sadana, a chemist in Bhopal, said hydroxycholoquinine was unavailable as wholesale dealers have stopped supplying it citing a government restriction. “We are unable to provide it to patients,” he said. Madhya Pradesh’s additional director (health) Sapna Lovanshi said, “We have enough stock of hydroxycholoquinine in government hospitals across the state. There is no complaint from any hospital about shortage of the medicine.” OdishaChemists in Odisha said the medicine was in short supply after the government asked dealers not to supply it to retail pharmacies. Dibakar Sahu, a chemist in Bhubaneswar, said they are no longer giving it to people without prescriptions.Drugs controller Mamina Patnaik said so far the state government has diverted around 8 lakh of hydroxychloroquine tablets to state-owned Odisha State Medical Corporation so that it can be used for Covid-19 patients. “Only a small portion of the total stock is available with chemists,” Patnaik said.GoaDoctors in Goa said the medicine is unavailable even for private practitioners. “We have the stock but we are reserving it for those who really need it like doctors and have stopped selling it over the counter as the fresh stock has not arrived,” said Albert D’Sa, the president of the Chemists and Druggists Association of Goa.JharkhandChemists in Ranchi said hydroxycholoquinine was unavailable at shops. “The distributors started refusing its supply since March, citing government restrictions,” said Sandeep Rajgharia, a pharmacy owner. Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences superintendent Vivek Kashyap said, “We have enough stock of the medicine to meet demand irrespective of requirement.”AssamAssam’s food and drugs department officials said there is adequate stock of the medicine as of now. “Chemists are allowed to sell the drug to patients based on prescriptions and sale without any doctor’s advice is not allowed. We have enough stock of hydroxycholoquinine in the state right now,” said Harendra Nath Sarma, inspector of drugs, directorate of health service, Assam.BiharDr Amulya Kumar Singh, an orthopedician in Patna, said though there is no shortage of the drug at the manufacturing level, there are transportation issues during the lockdown, leading to an artificial scarcity, especially with some wholesalers hoarding the drug.Sanjaya Kumar Singh, managing director, Bihar Medical Services Infrastructure Company Limited, which procures medicines, said there is no shortage of the medicine and the state has enough buffer stock.Other statesThere were also reports of a shortage of the medicine at chemist shops from Uttarkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-dearth-of-anti-malaria-drug-say-states-amid-local-concerns/story-WmAIj9lbYRltenWaCYFyQN.html
09-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Supreme Court directs private labs to conduct tests free of cost||The Supreme Court on Wednesday made tests for the coronavirus disease Covid-19 in government and private laboratories free, and asked the government to pass the necessary orders so as to make this possible. The tests are already free in government laboratories. Private laboratories charge Rs 4,500 for the currently used RT-PCR tests. The antibody tests that many states will start using later this week are expected to cost less. Private labs, however, have not been allowed to do rapid testing. The tests should be free of cost and no person should be deprived of Covid-19 tests due to non-payment of money, the Supreme Court said in an interim order on Wednesday, noting that a large part of India’s population may not have the means to afford such tests.Union health ministry officials directed queries on testing towards the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as it is the organisation supervising everything related to Covid-19 testing in India.“Since ICMR handles testing and related matters, it would be appropriate to ask them about it,” said Preeti Sudan, the Union health secretary. Dr Balram Bhargava, the ICMR director general, did not respond to repeated calls and texts seeking comment. The apex court also directed that Covid-19 tests must be carried out only in laboratories accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) or Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The health ministry has already restricted testing to only such laboratories. There are 139 government laboratories and 65 private ones that currently carry out the test. The order was issued by justices Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat .“We find prima facie substance in the submission of petitioner that at this time of national calamity permitting private Labs to charge Rs.4500 for screening and confirmation test of COVID-19 may not be within means of a large part of population of this country and no person be deprived to undergo the COVID-19 test due to non-payment of capped amount of Rs 4500”, the court said.The petitioner, advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, submitted that government hospitals are packed to capacity making it difficult for the common man to get himself/herself tested in the government labs, and challenged ICMR’s March 17 advisory fixing the cost of Covid-19 tests in private laboratories and hospitals. He also sought directions on rapidly expanding testing. The private laboratories allowed to test for Covid-19 think free testing is not feasible. “We already doing it at a bare minimum cost, and making it free will ensure the system will collapse,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder, Dr Dangs Lab.“If you make Covid-19 testing free then even those who don’t need it will line up to get tested. It could lead to unnecessary testing. What we need for the government to do is help in bringing down the cost of testing. If kits are made cheaper then it will bring down the cost of testing,” said Dr DS Rana, chairman, board of governors, Ganga Ram Hospital.Other experts pointed out that the court’s order could stop private laboratories from stopping such tests altogether, hurting India’s effort to test more. To be sure, the court has asked the government to explore a way to reimburse private laboratories, although it did not pass any order to this effect. The Supreme Court in its order noted that in spite of various measures taken by the central and state governments to fight the pandemic, the number of patients and death caused by it were increasing with each passing day.Private hospitals and laboratories, the court said, have an important role to play in containing the scale of pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis.“We are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a case for issuing a direction to the respondents to issue necessary direction to accredited private Labs to conduct free of cost COVID-19 test”, the order said.“Create mechanism for reimbursement (of private labs) from the government,” justice Bhushan suggested.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, told the court that he will take instructions in this regard.“The question as to whether the private Laboratories carrying free of cost COVID-19 tests are entitled for any reimbursement of expenses incurred shall be considered later on”, the court stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-directs-pvt-labs-to-conduct-tests-free-of-cost/story-uq9sEHP4Js5gAPYdwV2IGN.html
09-04-2020||India||Supreme Court asks Centre, state governments to ensure security of doctors||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued directions urging the central and state governments to ensure the safety and well-being of of doctors and medical staff, calling them the real warriors and the “first line of defence” in India’s fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Three PILs, filed by two practicing doctors - Dr Jerryl Banait and Dr. Arushi Jain -- and lawyer Amit Sahni, apprised a bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Ravindra Bhatt of the challenges faced by medical professionals in discharge of their duties. The petitions also highlighted the crunch in supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, N-95 mask, three-layer medical mask, head covers, and gowns. This, they said, was putting the health of medical staff under huge risks. The petitions also highlighted the recent incidents of violence against doctors and nurses.The bench said, “Doctors and medical staff are the first line of defence of the country to combat with this pandemic and have to be protected by providing PPE as recommended by the World Health Organization on February 27, 2020.” The Court directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to make available PPE for all doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff.The bench further asked the government to explore alternatives like augmenting domestic production of masks and gowns.The Court took serious exception to the incident of stone-pelting on medical staff at Tatpatti Bakhal locality in Indore by miscreants on April 2. The bench said, “The pandemic which is engulfing the entire country is a national calamity….all citizens need to act in a responsible manner and extend a helping hand to medical staff to perform their duties.” With this, the court directed all states and police authorities to provide necessary security to the health care workers.The Court allowed states to take action against anyone who obstructs medical staff or government officials engaged with COVID-19 duties.Earlier in the day, when the matter was heard by Court through video conferencing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “The government will go the extra mile to augment security of doctors and hospitals.” Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for one of the petitioners raised concerns about a possible cut in doctors’ salary for procuring PPE. Mehta said that the Director General of Health Services will issue instructions to private hospitals directing against such measures. He assured that action will be taken against any hospitals found violating this order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asked-to-ensure-security-of-doctors/story-YHi1tVWW9EfyrCMd7ORmeL.html
09-04-2020||India||Newspaper Society opposes suggestion to suspend govt ads||The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) and the Association of Radio Operators (AROI) for India strongly opposed on Wednesday a suggestion by Congress president Sonia Gandhi that the government and public sector undertakings should not issue any print or electronic media advertisements for two years in order to save money.INS president Shailesh Gupta expressed disbelief at the suggestion, saying the proposal was tantamount to promoting the idea of financial censorship of media outlets. Gupta said the amount spent on advertisements was meagre for the government but was critical for the survival of the print media business, a key feature of any vibrant democracy.“In the age of fake news and distortion, print is the best platform to get news and views directly across to the people in every nook and corner of the country -- for both the government and the opposition,” Gupta said in a statement.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi said the government spent Rs 1,250 crore on media advertisements a year, an amount that could be utilised instead for Covid-19 relief measures.The AROI requested Gandhi to review and withdraw her suggestion and demonstrate her support for one of the crucial pillars of democracy -- the media.“The last year has been a very difficult one for radio, especially for radio stations in small towns, due to a huge drop in government advertising.Radio has been wholeheartedly supporting the national war on Covid-19, through 380 private FM stations across India,” Uday Chawla, AROI secretary-general, said in a release. “We request the government to restore its advertising on radio to normal levels.”Highlighting that newspaper personnel were risking their lives to ensure that readers received authentic news on the coronavirus pandemic, the INS asked Gandhi to withdraw the suggestion.Notably, Prime Minister Modi, during a recent interaction with newspaper publishers, hailed the high credibility of print media and praised the efforts that went into providing accurate information to countrymen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newspaper-society-opposes-suggestion-to-suspend-govt-ads/story-QhtBW4bZCgGnn1jOcAxW2K.html
09-04-2020||India||Coronavirus lockdown: Millions in migrant camps battle despair about uncertain future||In the past week, Ajay Mahto and Sanjay Mahor have learnt the value of patience.A truck driver, Mahto was in Punjab’s Ludhiana city when sweeping restrictions were announced to stop the spread of Covid-19. On the second day of the lockdown, he and some other stranded workers hitched a ride on a truck to get back to their villages in Bihar.But the vehicle was intercepted in Patna the next day, and the workers sent to a government school that was turned into a migrant shelter. With no friends or family around, and bland food every day, Mahto spends his days in a small room with strangers. “My village is just 20 kilometres from here. I can feel my village but cannot go,” he said.A high school dropout, Mahto had never seen the inside of a classroom before. “Now, I sleep on a bench every night,” said Mahto, pointing at the shabby classroom that is now home to six migrant workers.More than 1,700km away in Maharashtra, Mahor was caught by police officers on the same day as Mahto while walking back with a group from Mumbai to his village in Madhya Pradesh.He was put in a camp in Mumbai on March 27. Unlike the camp in Patna – where workers are allowed to walk outside and bathe in nearby rivers – no one is permitted to step out of the Mumbai camp. “It is like a prison,” said Mahor, adding that the same meal of rice and potatoes is served to workers every day. “My wife is pregnant and I wanted to be with her side,” said Mahor. “I call home to check on her now.”The toilets are not clean and four people share a small room, said his fellow camp dweller, Mohammed Asif Sajeebul, a rickshaw puller from Mumbra.Mahto, Mahor and Sajeebul are three of the roughly 10.55 million people who are currently living in 22,567 shelters that were set up to disperse the waves of migrant workers who swamped highways, bus stands and railway stations across India in order to get back home after the lockdown was imposed at midnight on March 25. The numbers were part of a document submitted by the government to the Supreme Court on Tuesday.Only a few of them were able to reach their villages. Many are either in shelter homes set up at check posts or big towns, or self-quarantine homes near their villages.Authorities swung into action to provide them food and shelter and to monitor their health. Around 8.5 million people have been given food by government with the help of non-government organisations in these camps, the home ministry told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.But despite the arrangements, many workers are desperate about separation from their families, the threat of the coronavirus disease and their financial future.In a camp in Patna, Ganghara Panchayat Bawan, labourers complained of no masks, soaps, sanitisers and the stench in toilets. “I am a poor person. But, still toilet in my village is better than this,” said a labourer, Udit Raj, who paid Rs 1,800 to a truck driver in Howrah in West Bengal.He and 44 other labourers hid themselves in the truck container and travelled for more than 24 hours to reach Patna. In the camp, he said the probability of catching Covid-19 in the shelter home was more than in his village.An Asha [Accredited Social Health Activist] worker, Anita Devi has been tasked with monitoring the body temperatures of the workers every day but said she did not have masks or sanitiser –two of the most basic requirements to protect one’s self from the deadly infection. “We are on the mercy of God here,” she added. The area’s block development officer and in-charge of the camps, Devendra Kumar, denied the charge that there were no masks, soaps or sanitisers. “If people steal them what can we do,” he said.In Uttar Pradesh’s Badholi, Tauheed Ahmed, 45, a migrant who owned a juice stall in Delhi, said he was strictly adhering to quarantine rules at the government senior secondary school he was staying in at present.He claimed he walked the first 250 km from Delhi to Badholi in Bahraich district and was lucky to get a lift on truck for the rest of the distance. The distance between Delhi and Bahraich is 680 kilometre. “We understand that soaking up the sun, eating a healthy diet, and taking rest is healthy in these times of coronavirus,” said Ahmed said.Dr Nikhil Singh, superintendent doctor, said a medical team was closely monitoring the area.“We send a doctor every two days, and our village level health volunteers are monitoring the migrants,” he added.In another tin-roofed labour camp, opposite high-rises in Lucknow’s affluent Gomti Nagar area, workers speculated when the lockdown will end. Most of the people housed in this camp are contractual labourers, mechanics, masons and electricians who were hired to construct a high-rise complex in the vicinity.Monu Mondal a resident of West Bengal who worked as a plumber on the construction site, attempted to travel back but was stuck after the lockdown. “We were not paid anything before the lockdown. I don’t have any money left,” he said, adding that many of the labourers left the camp looking for work in the city. “Some of them are now selling vegetables.”With many government employees engaged in Covid-19 duties, people from different walks of life are managing these camps – migrant worker Mohammad Hasib in Badholi, block development officer Devendra Kumar in Patna, and social worker Gurmeet Singh in Ludhiana are some of them.Hasib spends his day checking the health status of migrants and managing activities related to sensitisation of local residents, sanitization of the village, and coordinating with health and civic authorities.“Over 2,000 migrants have returned to their homes in Badholi and all are under home quarantine as advised by the government doctors,” said Hasib, whose daughter-in-law Salma is the village head.“I take care of everything, arranging food, monitoring their health and providing necessary hygiene. Sometimes, I provide my phone to them to call their family members,” said Hasib, who returned from Delhi, where he runs a fruit and vegetable juice shop, about two months ago.Kumar has been made in-charge of running three camps for workers in Patna. “These days I go home for just a couple of hours to sleep. Most of the days, I eat same food what the workers get at these camps. This helps to ensure some quality when the supplies are dwindling with the each passing day,” he said.Singh used to manage the kitchen at the local gurdwara. Now at a camp for labourers in Ludhiana, Singh’s day starts at 5 am with a visit to the local market to source vegetables and other essentials.“There were about 1,000 persons in the camp when the exodus started after March 25. We arranged everything for them with the help of locals and some factory owners who donated food and money. Now, most of the labourers have either gone to UP or Bihar or have returned to their rented accommodation,” he said.In Mahto’s former workplace, Ludhiana, there is just one per cent occupancy in 50 camps set up for labourers, said the local administration. An industrial powerhouse, Ludhiana is home to about two million migrant workers employed in the cycle, hosiery and textile industry.Ashok, who works in a cycle parts manufacturing unit, said living in factory run homes was better than the shelter. “We have our friends there and the factory owner says that some work will resume soon,” he said, adding that the factory owners have arranged for their food.Others are worried about their future. Suman Singh Das, a labourer from Raigarh in Chhattisgarh, said he had started looking for work in Lucknow, where he is currently in a camp. “I am desperate to send money back home. Can you tell me whether the lockdown will end on April 15?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/millions-in-migrant-camps-battle-despair-about-uncertain-future/story-05uM0Q1zEQQHWVE8x4OssN.html
09-04-2020||India||Delhi Covid-19 cases jump by 93 ahead of Anil Baijal’s big meet on lockdown||The Delhi State Disaster Management Committee headed by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is meeting on Thursday to review all measures taken, best and worst case scenarios, hospital infrastructure facilities and containment measures to counter the pandemic.With Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava, Chief Secretary Vijay Dev and General Officer Commanding Delhi Area in attendance, the committee will also deliberate on the city’s stand on extending the 21-day lockdown, and if so, for how long.This view will be largely communicated by Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the chief ministers’ conference via video on April 11.The 21-day lockdown is due to expire on April 14 if not extended further.The day before the meeting, Delhi government officials reported a spike in the number of people who have tested positive to coronavirus disease.The Covid-19 count, which stood at 576 last evening, ricocheted to 669 cases after 93 people tested positive in the last 24 hours, a home department official in the Delhi Government said.All the 93 people were already in state-run quarantine facilities after their evacuation from the Nizamuddin headquarters of the religious sect.  It is understood that the Delhi Lt-Governor has asked the administration to find out whether all the contacts to the Tablighi Jamaatis who attended the congregation at Markaz in Nizamuddin had been traced, quarantined and tested for the coronavirus.The administration has also been asked to inform the committee whether there were women accompanying the Tablighis had also been traced in order to plug any leakages.Officials said the national capital had been implementing a containment plan in areas where Covid-19 cases had been detected. By Wednesday evening, Delhi chief minister Manish Sisodia said there were 20 such hotspots where the containment plan was in force.The Markaz at Nizamuddin was one of the first places in the city to be notified as a Covid-19 hotspot.Complete List of Delhi Hotspots HereStreet near Gandhi Park, Malviya NagarGali No 6 , L1 Sangam Vihar, New Delhi.Shahajahanabad society, Plot no 1, Sector 11, DwarkaDinpur Village, Najafgarh, south-west DelhiMarkaz Masjid and Nizamuddin Basti, central DelhiNizamuddin West (G and D block) areas.

Already, a number of these people have picked up private loans to cater to their daily requirements in times of pandemic.Ahead of the review meeting, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced that the government had identified 20 hotspots in the national capital.

09-04-2020||India||Amid Covid-19, sugarcane taken off menu of Corbett’s patrol jumbos||Elephants used in patrol duty in the Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand will no longer be fed sugarcane bought from local markets in a bid to stop a possible transmission of coronavirus to animals, forest department officials said Wednesday.The decision was taken after a tiger in the Bronx zoo in New York tested positive for coronavirus.The elephants would be fed forest produce like bamboo, tree barks and leaves.Dr Dushyant Sharma, a senior veterinary doctor at Corbett Tiger Reserve said, “There are 16 patrol elephants in the park. Five elephants are in Kalagarh, three in Jhirna, two in Bijrani, four in Dhikala and two in Haldupadav range. These elephants are generally fed sugarcane purchased from the local market.”Follow coronavirus latest updates here.Dr Sharma said Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has given instructions to keep vigil on elephants in the park, especially the Kalagarh shelter camp of Corbett.“According to CZA instructions elephants will not be fed sugarcane purchased from the market. If sugarcane comes from the market then the risk of spreading coronavirus remains in these elephants. Restrictions have been imposed on mahouts also on coming out of the park,” he said.Dr Sharma said “Now these elephants will be given only leaves, bark of trees and jiggery so that they don’t come into contact with food touched by a lot of people in crowded markets.”But it is not only elephants that will be denied their favourite food. There are also four sniffer dogs in Corbett National Park and are used by the forest staff to patrol Corbett’ border with Uttar Pradesh. They are also fed meat purchased from the Ramnagar market.“Now they will not be fed meat purchased from the market, but dog food. Forest personnel have also been instructed to keep dogs away from dirty water and food lying on ground during patrolling at UP border,” said Dr Sharma.Corbett is one of the favourite destinations in the country for big cat lovers as it affords good sighting of tigers. It has around 260 tigers according to the last estimate. The park has a rich biodiversity including around 110 tree species, 50 species of mammals, 580 bird species, 33 species of reptiles, seven species of amphibians and so on. The park extends over 1288 sq km spread over three districts of Uttarakhand - Pauri Garhwal, Nainital and Almora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-sugarcane-taken-off-menu-of-corbett-s-patrol-jumbos/story-crYnYpkaCAVoZxy1Xq3AaL.html
09-04-2020||India||‘Financial censorship’: Indian Newspaper Society reacts to Sonia Gandhi suggestion||The Indian Newspaper Society on Wednesday urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi to withdraw her suggestion to the government to impose a two-year ban on media advertisements by the government and public sector undertakings. “Such a proposal tantamounts to financial censorship,” the society said in a statement on Thursday. The Congress president had on Tuesday given Prime Minister Narendra Modi five suggestions to step up the battle against the coronavirus pandemic. One of them was to stop advertising in print, electronic and radio. The Association of Radio Operators and the News Broadcasters’ Association have already issued statements criticising the suggestion. On Wednesday, the INS also lent its support to this demand.The amount of money spent by government on advertising is a small amount as far as government spend is concerned but it is a huge amount for the newspaper industry which is essential for a vibrant democracy, and is struggling to survive.In a statement by Mary Paul, the INS underscored: Print is the only industry, which has a wage board and the Government decides how much the employees should be paid. This being the only industry where market forces don’t decide salaries, the Government has a responsibility towards the industry”.In the age of fake news and distortion, “Print is the best platform to get news and views directly across to the people in every nook and corner of the country, for both - the Government and for the Opposition”.It also noted that advertisement and circulation revenue had already declined due to recession and the digital onslaught. “Further to add to the problem, we now face severe financial crisis due to the complete lockdown of industries and business,” the statement said.At a time like this when media personnel are risking their lives and bringing news on the pandemic situation, the suggestion of the congress president is deeply disturbing and demotivating for the entire media industry, it said, asking the Congress president to withdraw the suggestion about a complete ban on advertisements in media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/financial-censorship-indian-newspaper-society-reacts-to-sonia-gandhi-suggestion/story-0NkmOySR4TFkD2AgmNhC8N.html
09-04-2020||India||As alarm goes off in Indore, officials ask people to follow lockdown rules||In Indore, one of the worst-affected cities in the country as far as Covid-19 positive cases are concerned, 151 people have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the deadly infection, till Tuesday night. Of them, as many as 106, or 70%, belong to the 21-55 age bracket , according to officials. Administrative authorities are on their toes in order to ensure strict compliance of social distancing and prevent unnecessary movement of people and gatherings, officials said. “We’re at a stage where we can’t afford to give any kind of relaxation to the people. They (people) must understand that Covid-19 can infect anyone who doesn’t follow the safety norms as being advised by the government and the administration. We’re taking all possible measures to contain it effectively,” said Manish Singh, district collector, Indore.Seventy per cent of the patients in the city are men and 30% are women, the officials said. Of the first nine deaths in the city, six were aged between 33 and 50 years. The rest were 53, 65 and 80 years, respectively. According to central figures as of Monday evening, men accounted for 73% of the Covid-19 positive cases in India in comparison with the 24% infection rate in women. The Centre put the total number of cases at 4,067 as of that day. Forty-seven per cent of the total cases in India involved people who were aged below 40 years, 34% of the patients were between 40 and 60 years, and 19% of cases pertained to those above 60 years. “The number of patients starts diminishing gradually, as we go either above 60 or below 16 years,” said a Madhya Pradesh health department official, requesting anonymity. Analysis suggests that 80% of all cases in Indore have been reported from densely populated localities such as Ranipura, Chandan Nagar, Daudi Nagar, Khajrana, Daulatganj, Hathipala, Azad Nagar, Tatt Patti Bakhal, Tanjim Nagar and a few other neighbourhoods, he said.Data showed that 18 Covid-19 positive cases were traced to Tatt Patti Bakhal locality, where a team of doctors was attacked last week after they insisted on taking an elderly person to a hospital for her medical examination. “We’ve observed that people, who followed social distancing and home isolation, haven’t been infected. The spike in Covid-19 positive cases in densely-populated colonies can be attributed to the practical problems faced by the locals to be self-disciplined,” Pravin Jadia, chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Indore, said.Ulhas Mahajan, a retired doctor of the district hospital in Indore, said: “The alarming increase in the Covid-19 positive cases has also got to do with the reckless behaviour of the people, as they believe that only the young and old are more prone to be infected. Besides, the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, which was enforced on March 25 to contain the spread of the viral outbreak, was initially violated with impunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-over-70-of-covid-19-patients-in-the-age-group-between-21-and-55-years/story-2Y2shy3Krjt1s4zOhdxrmL.html
09-04-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: Will containment zones work?||State governments have begun experimenting with the idea of containment zones to deal with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The mechanism is straightforward. Those clusters which have seen a rise in cases — and have shown traces of rapid transmission — are sealed. This can be in the form of a housing society, a neighbourhood, or even a district. Not only is the lockdown in the identified cluster enforced more strictly, there is also a complete ban on the movement of residents. Even essential supplies are delivered at home. Movement into these zones is limited to a small set of officials and health care workers. There is also aggressive screening and enhanced testing in these clusters. The strategy is based on the belief that this would allow authorities to identify each person who is infected, offer isolation and treatment, and reduce their interface — and the interface of all those they may have come in contact with — with the outside world. This would, thus, contain, the infection to a specific geography and eventually diminish its spread. It is broadly inspired by what has come to be known as the Bhilwara model of “ruthless containment”. In Rajasthan, the state government pioneered this method to tame the infection after health workers in a hospital first got infected. The containment zones cause inconvenience to citizens, by restricting their mobility almost entirely and making them dependent on state officials and select private vendors for supplies. But this inconvenience, and the temporary curtailment of rights, is worth it for the larger objective of containing the disease. The fact that this model has now been expanded will also help the government judge its efficacy beyond Bhilwara. It will need time. But if, within a fortnight, cases in these select clusters diminish, those who have got infected get treated, deaths are avoided or kept to a minimal, and the chain of transmission is broken, it will emerge as a model whenever the lockdown is eventually lifted. It must be acknowledged that Covid-19 is a new threat, and therefore, public health strategies are still relying on experiments. This makes it incumbent on governments to emulate best practices.

09-04-2020||Editorials||Covid-19, and Washington’s handling of it, will determine the poll outcome||With Bernie Sanders announcing the end of his bid to be the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, the United States (US) President Donald Trump now knows he will be facing Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden in the upcoming presidential election. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) may be the third candidate in the race. The US election is not until November and seven months is an eternity in politics. Mr Trump was never assured of re-election. The US electoral college system means victory or defeat will be determined by less than 10 states. The crisis initially increased the President’s approval ratings, a rally-around-the-flag effect experienced by most world leaders when the crisis hit their respective countries. But such surges are sustainable only if they are backed by credible governance and strong leadership. Both these are lacking in Mr Trump’s slow and haphazard response to Covid-19. The viral variable in all of this is that the infections are still spreading. At present, the bulk of American victims is concentrated in the North-east and Pacific coastal states and is disproportionately from ethnic minorities. These are all Democratic strongholds. Mr Trump’s real test will be when the virus begins to take a toll in the south, and midwest regions and moves beyond large cities — striking at his still-loyal voter base. This would explain the Trump administration’s obsession with quick and scientifically questionable fixes, as well as his attacks on China and the World Health Organization. It would also explain the Republican Party’s use of voter suppression tactics such as questioning the validity of mail ballots. Infections in the US are not expected to peak for a few more weeks. The medical and economic aftermath may be the real determiner of who will be the next US president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid-19-and-washington-s-handling-of-it-will-determine-the-poll-outcome/story-GlfQmcX3E4Lr9vfiGNWF1H.html
