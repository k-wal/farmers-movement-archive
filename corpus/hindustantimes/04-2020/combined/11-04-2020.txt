11-04-2020||News||What we have learnt from the Covid-19 lockdown||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to everyone to light a candle on April 5 to show solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus attracted a remarkable response. The lockdown has allowed, even forced, us to turn the searchlight inwards. Based on conversations I have had, anecdotes I have heard, social media posts I have read, and emotions I have experienced, there appear to be three crises confronting society. The first is the crisis of purpose. One of my political friends wrote on his Facebook wall: “I was scared of the emptiness initially. But soon I realised the power of doing nothing. And in the process, questions cropped up in my mind: Was my remaining busy genuinely productive ? Were the meetings I attended, events I ‘graced’, and the series of formal interactions truly designed to be result-oriented? Were the ‘hectic schedules’ fundamentally purposeful at all ?”The time that we have all got to ourselves in this period has actually made us redefine the nature of our life’s goals and ambitions. It has made us realise that there is a greater common good, which is beyond temporary individual achievements. This period forces us to introspect on the broader purpose we have in life. The second is the crisis of relationships. This has two separate elements, of authenticity and depth. The current situation has made people realise the need for relationships that are based on confidence, trust and integrity. This is possible when there is authenticity. Otherwise, as a journalist friend wrote, on her social media post, suspicion and scepticism creep in. If you want social institutions, including the idea of family, to stay intact, there is no substitute for authenticity. An inter-related element of this is the depth of the relationships. A popular film personality told me that he made it a point to make at least a dozen calls every day to cultivate relationships. He claimed that the lockdown had taught him the futility of artificial emotions, and the futility of keeping up ties with individuals who were not important or were “spurious”. “I have realised the sheer hollowness of hundreds of hellos,” he emphasised. The third is the crisis of ownership and responsibility. A government official, interacting in a video conference, spoke of how the situation has made him look within. “I am ashamed of my habit of refusing to consider things in their entirety. We are accustomed to shrug responsibilities and to that end always think only compartmentally,” he confessed. The pandemic has made us realise the inter-connectedness of everything around us. It has made us realise that till we take responsibility and ownership of our actions, across spheres, we are all at risk. Some individuals and groups were irresponsible; they did not take ownership of their actions, and, in the process, put everyone at risk. The three aspects of this challenge — the crisis of purpose, the crisis of authentic and deep relationships, and the crisis of ownership and responsibility — are important in shaping the future of our society. This is an opportunity for all of us to consider a set of questions; why do we do what we do; why do we work in the manner that we do; how do we channel our time and energies; what are the relationships which have some value, and which we must continue to invest in; what are our roles and responsibilities and are we prepared to take full responsibility for them? The lockdown will end, and the pandemic will be contained. But the questions these trying times have raised merit introspection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-i-have-learnt-from-the-covid-19-lockdown/story-IGlHk2HQyLgkTSTNb0uu8K.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||One in every 25 infected persons is a healthcare worker||: One in every 25 people with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi is a health care worker, with at least 42 doctors, nurses or hospital staff infected, according to data from the state health department — a statistic that once again highlights the risks faced by front-line responders and concerns over adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) kits.Delhi reported a total of 1,069 cases till Saturday.In addition, more than 400 health care workers across the city have been quarantined after coming in contact with people who later tested positive.Two nurses tested positive for the infection Friday night -- one of them was posted in Lok Nayak hospital, making her the first health care worker testing positive in what is the biggest Covid-19 treatment centre in the city where at least 651 Covid-19 confirmed or suspected cases are admitted. Around 25 others who came in contact with the nurse have been asked to go into quarantine. “She did not come in direct contact with any of the suspected patients. She has more of a managerial role and supervises the wards. And, we make sure anyone entering the wards dons personal protective equipment,” said a hospital official who asked not to be named.The other nurse to test positive worked at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital -- also the first from the centre to test positive.Doctors from across the country have been complaining about the shortage and poor quality of PPE gear, such as masks, face shields, coveralls and gloves.“When health care workers are affected, it takes away active people from the service and also results in clusters around hospitals. It can paralyse the health system in pockets, with hospital after hospital being closed down because of infections,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.With 22 of its staff testing positive, the highest number of health care workers have tested positive at the Delhi State Cancer Institute, which has now been closed. Two of the first doctors to have tested positive were from mohalla clinics in north-east Delhi.“This trend is more than worrying. And, not only in Delhi, this is happening across India. And the problem lies in government denying community transmission. There are some universal precautions to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth that must be taken by all health care workers in primary, secondary or tertiary settings. But because the government kept denying community transmission, we kept screening people depending on their history of travel or contact,” said Dr Jacob John.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic. India has maintained that the disease is in the second stage, or between stage two and stage three with “limited community transmission” in some clusters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/one-in-every-25-infected-persons-is-a-healthcare-worker/story-onidM7DucaQCiHwWPg6nzH.html

11-04-2020||Mumbai||Dharavi reports 4th death; BMC starts screening 7L locals||Eleven days after the first case of Covid-19 was reported in Dharavi on April 1, four people from India’s largest slum have succumbed to the disease. While the number of positive cases stood at 28, with no new cases on Saturday, an 80-year-old man died at Kasturba Hospital on Saturday. His 35-year-old daughter, too, had tested positive for Covid-19.Responding to the spread of the Sars-cov-2 virus in Dharavi, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started screening around 7 lakh residents of the area – an exercise that is expected to take around two weeks to complete.The 240-hectare slum pocket has 850,000 residents and a population density of 66,000 per square kilometre, making it one of the more congested spaces in Mumbai, the world’s fifth-most densely-populated city. Activists and health workers had expressed concerns over how social distancing is practically impossible in an area where an average of 10-12 people live in each of 57,000 housing units measuring around 250 sqft.The civic body has already planned a 1,000-bed quarantine facility in Dharavi, where those wanting institutional quarantine will be kept. Of these, 300 beds will be available at the Rajiv Gandhi District Sports Club and the remaining 700 are being planned at the Dharavi transit camp municipal school.Explaining the action plan for Dharavi, Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G/North ward under which Dharavi is located, said, “We have formed 10 teams to conduct screening of all residents in Dharavi. We are using 500 sets of personal protection equipment (PPE), 2,000 masks, and 18 thermal scanners for this purpose. Screenings are being done at Kalyanwadi, Mukund Nagar, Social Nagar, Muslim Nagar, Madina Nagar, etc.”According to BMC officials, they are looking to screen around 7 lakh citizens in the coming two weeks for cough, cold and fever.Dharavi has around 225 public or community toilets that are also being disinfected daily for which a special treatment solution and machine has been imported from New Zealand.Two more individuals from Dharavi who had attended the Tablighi Jammat event in Delhi in March tested positive on Friday. Overall, the BMC has traced 25 people who had attended the event, however, in many of the cases, reports are still being awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dharavi-reports-4th-death-bmc-starts-screening-7l-locals/story-64iVTW9esihE4ibBJOAF1J.html

11-04-2020||Mumbai||479 violators caught; police book some, shame others||With lockdown violations continuing across the city, the Mumbai Police has registered 265 FIRs against 479 people on Friday. However, as a large number of people are violating lockdown orders the police are not finding it practical to book all of them, and hence they are dealing with violators by giving them different types of punishments such as making them do sit-ups or hen-punishment in public. There have been instances of lathi charge as well. 4,617 booked for lockdown violation till dateOf the 265 FIRs registered on Friday, 170 are for gathering in public and 75 are for unnecessary use of vehicles. Of the 479 people booked, 311 have been arrested. Majority of the cases were registered in parts where most of the containment zones are located. 86 cases were reported from central region and 63 in western. Since March 20, a total of 2,470 FIRs have been registered including 1,709 for gathering in one place and 4,617 people have been booked across the city with 3,485 arrests. The Mumbai Police on their Twitter handle are receiving complaints from across the city about gatherings. Cops take to shaming violators As the number of violators has increased, police are cautiously booking the violators in a bid to avoid crowd gathering at police station. A police officer from western suburbs said, “We are making announcements regularly, but some people will never listen. As it’s not practical to register FIR against all of them, we have to resort to other tactics like hen punishment.”Sangramsinh Nishandar, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, carried out a parade on Friday in Dongri, Pydhonie and JJ Marg urging people to stay home. Nishandar said, “Several people are not ready to listen and come out of their buildings making false excuses that they want to buy onions or oil. This is misuse of lockdown rules. Youngsters who are coming down may contract the disease and spread it among their family members. Even parents convince their children not to venture out in such testing times. We have started taking action against youngsters found roaming unnecessarily.” 87 cases of hate speech related to Covid-19 “Till Saturday a total of 172 cases have been registered for fake news, rumours and hate speech on social media sites across the state including 87 cases for hate speech related to Covid-19. Of these cases, What App had 85 cases, Facebook 49 cases, Tiktok 3 cases and twitter 2 cases. 32 people have been arrested while another 108 accused have been identified,” said Balsing Rajput, SP, Maharashtra Cyber. Trio booked for murder attempt on cop Bangur Nagar police on Friday arrested two men and detained a minor on charges of attempt to murder after they knocked down a 54-year-old on-duty policeman when he tried to stop them on Friday. Assistant sub inspector Uttam Raut, 54, suffered a maxillary bone fracture on his jaw and minor injuries above his eye and face in the incident.Cops restrict hawker movementAbhishek Trimukhe, DCP of zone 9 which has 57 confirmed Covid-19 cases, said, “We have stopped all hawkers and vendors to operate even outside containment zones so people do not venture out. At the same time, measures are being taken to ensure people get their essential supplies.”Meanwhile, the number of policemen who tested positive for Covid-19 rose to three.(With inputs from Faisal Tandel)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/479-violators-caught-police-book-some-shame-others/story-0VcKL8HSYaYseFOXm3LXMM.html
11-04-2020||Lucknow||Nine Covid patients test negative, discharged from hospital in Meerut||After hectic schedule of treating over 50 Covid-19 patients in past two weeks, doctors and nursing staff shared a moment of joy and happiness with the discharge of nine patients after their successful treatment, on Saturday.The nine patients include the first Covid patient, who was tested positive on March 27, his seven relatives, and a student who has been pursuing her medical studies in Philippines.

11-04-2020||Mumbai||FDA permits industrial manufacturers to produce medical oxygen||The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has permitted manufacturers of industrial oxygen to produce medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients, anticipating a rise in the number of cases in the state. As the number of coronavirus cases in the state has increased to over 1,500, FDA is trying to boost oxygen production for critical patients. They have already issued a circular allowing industrial oxygen manufacturers to approach the apex drug regulatory body for approval to produce medical oxygen. “Once a manufacturer approaches us, within 24 hours our officer will inspect the factory. We will give approval if the producer has adequate safety mechanism in place,” said Vikas Biyani, joint commissioner (drugs), FDA.Covid-19 often leads to breathing complications leading to patients needing oxygen support, according to doctors. Currently, Maharashtra has 82 licensed medical oxygen manufacturers. Medical oxygen maintains sufficient oxygen level needed in our blood, while industrial oxygen is used in applications such as welding. “As industrial oxygen manufacturers don’t come under our umbrella, we don’t have the exact data on the number of producers. But we hope to soon be able to double up oxygen production in the state,” added Biyani. In India, around 6,500 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen is produced every year of which 5,500 MT is used for industrial use and the remaining 1,000 MT for medical purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fda-permits-industrial-manufacturers-to-produce-medical-oxygen/story-IqHzATvovGJB6d4uq2rJiL.html

According to the police, the incident took place around 7am when the victim, identified as Anita, was at her house. The police said her husband runs a local eatery in Farrukhnagar. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that the woman told them that her husband had refused to close down his eatery during the lockdown and had been serving alcohol illegally. In the FIR, she said that she had been scared about the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and had repeatedly pleaded with her husband to wear a mask. “He refused to wear a mask and said that the virus would not spread in the area. When I told him to wear a mask, he rebuked me and hurled abuses. On Thursday night and Friday morning, he and my mother-in-law assaulted me with a belt after an argument over wearing the mask and shutting down his shop,” she said.The police said the woman alleged that her husband, Rajbir, kicked her out of the house and threatened to kill her, following which she filed a police complaint.“The man was arrested on Friday and released on bail. We are verifying the allegations that he had violated the lockdown orders,” said a police officer.A case was registered against the man under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at Farrukhnagar police station on Friday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-held-for-assaulting-wife-after-she-asked-him-to-wear-a-mask/story-6aJoRV0zxX2Vf65CJpEHZN.html
11-04-2020||Gurugram||With dwindling rations, Rohingya refugees on the verge of starvation||For the past two days, Mohammad Hussain, a Rohingya Muslim refugee, has been largely surviving on cucumbers and other raw vegetables that he can source from his neighbours. The 23-year-old who lives in a refugee camp in Nangli, Nuh, says that his family of three finished whatever little ration they had and is at the mercy of neighbours. “The rations dried up two-three days ago. Since then, we have been surviving on cucumbers or tomatoes, which some refugees continue to have. Neither can we step out to buy anything nor do we have enough money to buy more vegetables,” Hussain, who lives with his wife and mother, says.Before the lockdown, he used to work as a labourer at construction sites across Nuh. However, with the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the national lockdown, he has been out of work for over a month now. “I haven’t been able to work for the past month. Earlier, there used to be some opportunity for work at construction sites or houses, but there has been a lull on that front for over a month. Due to the lack of money, we could not stock up or buy anything before the ban,” Hussain says, adding that he is scared of venturing out due to the heavy police presence on the streets.Besides the lockdown, the Nuh district administration has sealed 36 villages as containment zones. Like Hussain, other refugees too are struggling to make ends meet and secure food for the day. The national lockdown has dealt a blow to Rohingya refugees living across all seven camps in Nuh district. While some refugee camps have run out of rations, residents in the other camps are surviving on the bare minimum and fear that supplies will only last for a day or two. Residents of these camps said that they had not received any food or ration from the administration since the lockdown started.“Food is drying up now. We had received some ration from the UNHCR’s implementing partner 10 days ago but most families have exhausted their supply. There are 5-6 members in each family and even with judicious consumption, food hardly lasts beyond a few days now. We don’t know how we will survive through the next few days,” a camp coordinator says on condition of anonymity. He says that similar conditions were prevailing across all the camps in Nuh, with some camps surviving on supplies from do-gooders. “In certain locations such as Chandeni, some people from the neighbourhood step forward to help once in a while but circumstances in three camps in Nuh are particularly grim. Rations in all the camps are either over or on the cusp of drying up,” says the coordinator.According to Pankaj (known by his first name), deputy commissioner, Nuh, the administration is committed to providing food to everyone. Following HT’s call, the administration has also reached out to the camp residents. “The supply will be sent to them. They want dry ration whereas we can only provide cooked food to them. The administration can help with food packets twice a day,” Pankaj says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/with-dwindling-rations-rohingya-refugees-on-the-verge-of-starvation/story-K2vYwy2AXdUUl2D1NTpRuM.html
11-04-2020||Gurugram||MCG launches mist machines for sanitising city roads and highways||The Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) on Saturday launched eight mist machines that spray sanitising solution for disinfecting streets, lanes, national highways, and arterial roads across the city.Each machine is mounted on a truck, and according to MCG officials, will carry a solution of isopropyl alcohol hydrochloride that will be discharged in the form of mist for disinfecting and sanitising purposes. While five machines have a capacity of 10,000 litres each, three machines have a capacity of 5,000 litres each.These machines were launched by Mayor Madhu Azad and MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh outside the MCG office in Civil Lines and subsequently covered areas nearby and Mini Secretariat, Rajiv Chowk.The MCG commissioner said the civic body already has a mechanism in place for cleaning public places such as residential areas, parks, community centres, medical and grocery shops, bank branches, ATM kiosks, government offices, police stations, and hospitals with hand-held sprays.“It was realised that for covering bigger spaces such as national highways, arterial roads, streets, and lanes, we needed machines that could disinfect and sanitise larger surface areas. The MCG has been working on a war footing to contain Covid-19. The aim of the MCG is to ensure that no area of the city remains untouched in any of the sanitization operations,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.MCG has so far carried out two rounds of sanitisation in over 650 residential areas as well as 600 bank branches and ATM kiosks, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-launches-mist-machines-for-sanitising-city-roads-and-highways/story-cdonLNz4iiUliZhqiY2daL.html
11-04-2020||City||Gurugram: Sector 51’s Blossom II society makes sure residents spend minimum time outside||Gurugram Blossoms II residential society in Gurugram’s Sector 51 has taken several measures to combat the spread of Covid-19. With the 21-day nationwide lockdown in place to curb the spread of the virus, the residents say they have been complying with rules of temperature screening and hand washing at gates, social distancing and are staying at home to make sure their society remains infection free. The society installed a wash basin at its main gate and has mandated all residents and staff to wash and sanitise their hands. Guards have also been equipped with infrared thermal thermometers to detect anyone with a high temperature. “No outsiders are allowed inside. We have installed a wash basin and hand sanitisers have been provided,” said Amit Tyagi, president of the Resident Welfare Association (RWA). He added that skeletal staffs of 15 have been coming in for cleaning and upkeep on alternate days. “We try not to make them work for more than six hours,” said Tyagi. The society, which has approximately 1,400 residents, also has a temple inside its perimeter. The temple for now is shut as no gatherings are being allowed. On alternate days, though, a resident volunteer cleans the temple.The society has also formed a “think tank” of close to seven resident doctors to share information on latest developments surrounding the pandemic and also for advice on the best course of action to be taken to keep residents safe.“All the doctors living in the society were roped in for this group. We keep sharing information on the group as we come across it. We also helped give shape to the measures to be taken inside the society,” said Dr Rita Prakash, an ENT surgeon who has been living here for the past five years. She adds that having a group like this ensures residents are not in the dark on the latest development, which often leads to residents coming forward to help each other out. In one instance, she said the neighbours had come forward to cook for a resident who had undergone emergency surgery and was unable to do so. “It helps us manage the situation without letting people from outside get involved,” she said. The group, from time to time, also shares lifestyle tips to best tackle the virus at home with habits such as healthy eating, workouts and yoga. Prakash adds that the group recently suggested that residents opt for vegetables like cabbage, mustard, cauliflower, broccoli and kale to keep themselves fit.The society has a grocery store that has been catering to the essential item requirements of the residents; they place their orders ahead of visiting the store and get it delivered to their homes. Alternatively, residents visiting the store have been asked to prepare a list beforehand so as to cut down on time spent outside. “At the grocery store, residents have to queue up, wait at the markings made six feet apart and ideally have a list ready. No resident is allowed to enter the store; they can read out the items from the list and the employees ready their order. This has been done to reduce as much contact as possible,” said Tyagi. The shopkeeper of the store is also helping residents distribute home cooked meals to the underprivileged. Residents can cook meals as per their choice and pack them, and the packets are collected by him. “My wife cooks the meal. It is usually rice or puri sabzi. One packet is a complete meal for an individual. We usually provide five to six packets. They get collected once a day by the storekeeper and are distributed by him to those in need,” said Nitin Sharma, a resident. The society discourages residents taking morning or evening walks outside, unless they are to go out for essential needs. The RWA insists on minimum time spent outdoors.“The symptoms are not shown by all. At the gate, we can screen for temperature but fever as a symptom is not displayed by a majority of cases. How do you know who has been infected by the virus and who hasn’t? In such a scenario, the best way is to limit time spent outside and contact. It is not safe to step out even if fresh air is good for your health,” said Dr Prakash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-sector-51-s-blossom-ii-society-makes-sure-residents-spend-minimum-time-outside/story-QdXB3oIjRBr2PF3uCQGwOL.html
11-04-2020||Gurugram||Condo residents complain of problems relating to supply of essentials||Confusion prevailed among residents of the containment areas within the city over the supply of vegetables, fruits, milk and other daily essentials on Saturday, after the Gurugram Police and district administration started barricading these colonies to prevent the movement of people outside their homes. Nine areas in the district were declared as containment zones on Friday to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).With the movement of people restricted in these areas, residents complained that they were not able to visit the markets to buy fruits, vegetables, milk and other essential commodities. What made things more complicated was that the movement of vendors and online suppliers was also restricted. Locals said suppliers were being allowed only up to the main gates in sealed areas. This meant that senior citizens, women and those living alone found it difficult to fetch these essential supplies from the gates.In Palam Vihar’s Park View Apartment,which has been sealed, the movement of residents was completely restricted by the administration and the residents’ welfare association (RWA). “We are allowing moving out only in case of emergencies and no movement is allowed in common areas. Tower six has been completely sealed with no one being allowed to get inside or move outside the tower,” said SC Kumar, president of the RWA.As a result of the sealing, the residents of tower six have been totally dependent on the maintenance staff and guards, who are supplying them essential commodities. “This is a difficult situation but we have to manage it,” said Kumar.In Palam Vihar, residents resorted to panic buying to ensure that they had enough food during the lockdown. “Some people bought ration for the next three months after the sealing was announced. Around 300 families bought supplies from me and situation was same in most shops,” said Samar Bahadur Singh, a resident of Block-C and the owner of a store.A similar situation prevailed in Sector-9, where availability of medicines and access to medical facilities emerged as the main concerns for the residents.“Effectively, the administration restricted people’s movement from Friday evening onwards. We were worried about the supply of milk, fruits, vegetables etc for Saturday. Nonetheless, the milk and vegetable vendors did come on Saturday. However, things are going to get difficult from Monday . We do not how and who will provide us essential goods,” said Prashant Chauhan, a resident.An elderly couple, who was not keeping good health and needed access to medical facilities and medicines, told HT that a medical shop should have remained opened with facility of doctors.Sarla Devi, who has a breathing problem, said, “We pray all goes well for all of us. We hope that the administration and our RWA take care of our needs. We cannot visit market inside the sector but we need medicines frequently.”Naresh Kataria, RWA president, said, “Today, vendors were allowed as it was first day of containment zone order. From Sunday onwards, our volunteers will be supplying fruit, vegetables etc to every doorstep. In the market within sector, one shop each for fruits, vegetables, medicines etc will remain open. We are working with the administration and the police to tide over this crisis.” Situation was the same in the upscale Nirvana Country on the eastern side of the highway, as residents were apprehensive about the lockdown effect. “There are 15,000 residents in this society living in villas, floors and apartments. As such, it would be difficult to provide home supply in an area spread over 300 acres. We have had discussions with the authorities to ensure that supplies are available at the gate and residents can come in their vehicles to collect the same,” said Ashok Bhaskar, a resident. The society had faced some issues in the morning as the supply of milk, food and other essentials got disrupted due to barricading by the police.In Suncity residential colony on Golf Course Road the availability of food, milk and other essentials was low, said residents, who said ban on entry of online providers had further caused problems. “Very few things are available in the market inside the complex and milk vendors, vegetable carts and other suppliers are not allowed entry as all gates are closed,” said Rajesh Malik, president of the RWA. There is a need for the authorities to reassess the situation as the only two Covid-19 positive cases found here have been treated. No new cases have been reported.”In Palm Garden society in Sector 83, the residents faced similar issues as main gate of the complex was closed and entry was banned by the police for both residents and outsiders. The shops inside the complex have also been closed and supplies like milk, vegetables, and other things are being managed through maintenance staff and security guards. “No one is allowed to venture outside the apartments and we are now getting supplies through the maintenance staff, who collects the essentials at the gate and hands them over to the residents,” said Pankaj Gupta, a resident.There are around 500 families living in the complex located in Sector 83.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/condo-residents-complain-of-problems-relating-to-supply-of-essentials/story-AbY4PyIv5TUB5DX8HMEBgM.html
11-04-2020||Gurugram||Amid lockdown, pastors take Easter sermon online||This Easter will be like no other, ever. As the faithful fold their hands in prayer on Sunday, they will be doing so facing their phones and computers as churches in the city said they would livestream the service because of the 21-day lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). While there is some dismay, many pastors have taken the opportunity to utilise technology well and bring joy to the congregation in such difficult times. “There will not be any Easter procession like the church members take out every year at sunrise. The service will be online and congregation members will not be in the church; Easter service will not be the same,” Rev Danny George from the Church of Immaculate Conception in Sector 45 said.However, some churches “hacked” a way out to bring some much needed cheer with songs and performances which would all be woven into a joyous video of the complete Easter Service. “We recorded the entire service on Saturday where I have shot my part of the sermon; a singer recorded the song, different people who contribute to the worship service shot their part and sent it to us and then we put it all in a video. The compiled video will be sent out to the people through Facebook on Sunday,” said Rev Daniel Nazareth of the New Life Church in Sector 43 said. Given the circumstance, pastors said, a Facebook Live or YouTube Live was the best way to listen to the word of God. However, the pastors did admit that preaching to empty chairs would not be the same as addressing a gathering. Rev Joy Gill of the DBF Central Gurgaon Church in Sector 14 said, “It surely doesn’t feel quite the same because the whole idea of worship service is so people can meet one another.”Understanding this need for interaction, an important aspect of worship service, few churches logged on to Zoom, a web conferencing app, for the Good Friday service and said it did bring smiles to everyone’s face. “Meeting people is an important part of a church service. So, for the Good Friday service we did a Zoom call with congregation members. We were able to interact online, as a group, through a video conference call,” Rev Nazareth said. Pastors said conducting a service in front of a camera was something many of them hadn’t done before, but were encouraged by the positive response. “Doing an FB Live was something new for us, but we have adjusted well,” Rev Daman Rodgers of the Epiphany Church in Civil Lines said. Like Christmas, Easter Sunday is a day when even those who do not go to the church each Sunday make it a point to attend the mass. While they were grateful for the safety of their homes, devotees said they would miss the gaiety of gathering in celebration. “This is for the first time in my life that I will not be attending the Easter service in church. Having an online worship service is not the same, but in the circumstances this is the best option,” Anthony Masih, resident of Sector 14, said. Staying at home also meant that Christians won’t be able to interact with their loved ones, friends or have an Easter egg. “All churches give egg as a symbolic gesture of resurrection so we are certainly going to miss that part. However, the situation has also helped us move our focus from symbolic things like the Easter egg to the resurrection of Jesus Christ,” said Jayan Matthews, resident of Sector 49.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/amid-lockdown-pastors-take-easter-sermon-online/story-gBbm6DyqydYoMETRVspwKN.html
11-04-2020||Noida||Landlords to be booked if found evicting, harassing medical personnel over transmission scare||The Gautam Buddh Nagar Police has decided to book landlords under the National Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Act, if it is proven that they are harassing or evicting medical personnel and their families over the transmission scare of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The order came on Saturday and will be applicable till April 30, after which it will be reviewed depending on the health situation in the district.“This order is for medical personnel, their families and anyone working at the ground level in this ongoing crisis. We have not had many complaints against landlords. However, we don’t want a repeat of the incidents that have occurred in other districts or states. This is why this decision has been taken,” said Akhilesh Kumar, additional commissioner of police (law and order).The order, signed by additional deputy commissioner of police Ashutosh Dwivedi talks about harassment of the medical community at the hands of landlords.“Medical staff and paramedical personnel are playing an essential role in combating the current crisis and are offering their services to take care of patients at great risk to their own safety. It is coming to our attention from various sources that landlords and society management are pressuring these medical personnel to empty their houses for fear of transmission. In the ongoing scenario putting such pressure will hamper with the work and safety of the community(sic),” said the order from Dwivedi.The order further said that in case evidence is found of such actions on the part of landlords or residential management, then such people will be booked under Section 51 of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 and relevant sections of the Epidemic act, 1897. Officials also said that action can also be taken under the provisions of the National Security Act, 1980.“I believe that these personnel are integral to the system, and creating any hindrances at their homes will negatively their services. Hence under Section 144, we are ordering people to avoid any such acts in the entire district,” said Dwivedi.Families of medical personnel and foreign travellers had earlier alleged ostracization at the hands of neighbours and residential bodies. The commissioner of police had also said that action will be taken against RWAs imposing restrictions on residents that are not approved by the government.The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration had earlier ordered on March 28 that landlords will not force their tenants to pay rent for the month (or till the issuance of further orders) in an attempt to stop migrants from leaving after they were forced out of their jobs after the lockdown was announced on March 24.Under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, a person can be imprisoned up to one year along with a fine and it can reach up to two years if any life or loss of assets takes place following the act of the defaulter.Officials also said that on April 14, when the three-week lockdown officially ends, they will also review whether or not the imposition of Section 144 in the district has to be extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/landlords-to-be-booked-if-found-evicting-harassing-medical-personnel-over-transmission-scare/story-2e6r1KVU8bnBj22Z3GJtbN.html

11-04-2020||Gurugram||Two drive-through testing centres launched in Gurugram||To minimise the chances of contracting infection, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and two private health sector companies launched two drive-through testing centres for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday at the Tau Devi Lal Sports Complex and the Leisure Valley Park in Sector 29.At both the centres, people with symptoms can simply roll down their car windows and a technician wearing a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kit will take a swab sample from them and subsequently send them their test report via email a few days later, MCG officials said.The centre located at the parking lot of the cricket stadium in the Tau Devi Lal Sports Complex near Rajiv Chowk was opened by Healthians, a home-health test company while the centre at Leisure Valley Park in Sector 29 was opened by SRL Diagnostics, a private diagnostic chain.As per MCG officials, in a normal medical testing facility, despite precautions, there remains a possibility of the virus being transmitted onto surfaces or through respiratory droplets.By minimising human interaction through this drive-through concept, wherein people are tested while seated inside their own vehicles, chances of infection being spread to another person are minimised.“The drive-through concept that started in South Korea is quickly spreading across the rest of the world. It is one of the safer options for use as it not only minimises human interaction with suspected Covid-19 patients but also prevents it from being spread to others. Hence, we are looking to introduce these centres in as many places as possible to ensure a higher number of people are tested for the infection and faster-containing measures can be subsequently adopted,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.MCG officials added that a similar centre would soon also be opened at the ground opposite Police Lines in Sadar Bazar by Healthians while at the Leisure Valley Park, they would also be opening their own centre.As per Healthians officials, their drive-through collection centre is equipped to conduct 150 tests per day and the capacity can be doubled in 48 hours if needed.They further said that they were conducting trial runs at the centre on Saturday and it will soon be opened for residents, after which detailed instructions for booking and the process for getting tested will be shared. They, however, did not elaborate on the expected timeline.Healthians’ officials further said that they are in discussion with the MCG for launching a URL from where bookings can be made.The drive-through facility of SRL diagnostics is situated in the parking area of Leisure Valley Park next to gate number two.As per SRL officials, at their centre, the patient can sit in the passenger seat – next to the driver or in the left rear seat, the nasal or throat swab sample will be taken through the car window and the entire process from entry to the centre and exit will take under 10 minutes. This swab will then be sent to a laboratory for testing and the patient can receive the report the same day, provided the sample is taken before noon.To book an appointment at their centre, a person needs to call their toll-free number -1800 222000- and subsequently send a prescription from a doctor along with identification documents online through the SRL website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-drive-through-testing-centres-launched-in-gurugram/story-yON43fBlFfeXbiBddUzlvL.html

The officials said that high-rise tower, Skardi Green near NH-9, where the doctor resides, will be sealed by Saturday night.With this, the number of hot spots in Ghaziabad is 14. The 13 other hot spots are Nandgram near mosque; KDP Grand Savana, Raj Nagar Extension; Savoir Park society, Mohan Nagar; B-77/G-5, Shalimar Garden Extension 2; Pasonda; Oxy Home highrise, Bhopra; Vasundhara sector-2B; Sector-6, Vaishali; Girnar society, Kaushambi; Naipura, Loni; Masuri; Khatu Shyam Colony, Duhai and Covid-19 Level 1 hospital, Muradnagar.According to fficial figures, the 13 hot spots have a population of 74,208 persons.“The officials are working at the tower where the doctor resided and it will be sealed by Saturday night. One other area near Sahibabad, from where a nurse who tested positive hailed, will not be declared a hot spot as she had stayed at a Delhi hospital where she worked and has been admitted there,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.“She is working at a hospital in Delhi and her count is added to overall count of Delhi. Due to her duties, she did not visit her home, so the area will not become a hot spot. But we have taken up containment measures and sanitised the area. The building tower where the Ghaziabad doctor resided has also been sanitised and it will be a new hot spot area. The recommendation has been sent to the district magistrate,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.According to state officials, the number of hot spots in the state has gone up to 125 across 15 districts as against the previous tally of 104 when the intensive lockdown was announced on April 9.“The hot spots have 14,1110 houses and a population of about 8.95 lakh. These hot spots have a total of 329 Covid-19 positive cases of a total of 448 cases as on Saturday evening. There are 55 other areas where the respective district magistrates are taking up measures. These areas have one or more cases. The Covid-19 cases in these 55 areas are 68. So, through the intensive lockdown of hot spots we are trying to contain the spread of the disease,” Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), Uttar Pradesh, said.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey on Saturday said he has roped in several government and private counsellors for psychological counselling of Covid-19 patients and their families.“The counsellors will visit patients at hospitals and will also meet their families at home or in quarantine centres. They will take up counselling sessions with the patients. The team will also provide Information about Covid-19, address current problems of patients besides addressing issues relating to stress and anxiety, irritation and anger outburst, depression, impulsiveness and behaviour,” Pandey said.For the purpose a team of five specialised doctors has been formed and it has already started the work.“The counsellors will also take up individual and group sessions, identify those suffering from psychological issues and will also inform authorities about their needs. It is generally seen that Covid-19 patients are already fearful about the outbreak and need to be motivated to take up treatment and keep themselves well,” he said.For patients in isolation wards and quarantine centres, the eighth battalion of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in Ghaziabad on Saturday provided 650 ‘dignity kits’ to the district health department.“The kits include 20 items for both men and women. The kits include clothes and other daily use items which a person requires. The kits have been prepared and items stored in sealed buckets. They are meant for patients who are in isolation wards or in quarantine. The health department will distribute the kits to patients,” an official from NDRF said. The battalion is based at Govindpuram in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-more-hot-spot-in-ghaziabad-psychological-counselling-of-patients-begins/story-IPrVgNgo7r14U8wcdcqbmI.html
11-04-2020||Noida||Noida garment industry set to produce 50,000 PPE kits a day||In what comes as a breather for workers associated with the garment industry in Gautam Budh Nagar, some companies have decided to make personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and face masks to meet the rising demand for protective gear due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Some garment companies have already started manufacturing the PPE kits and masks after getting a nod from the district administration and the state government, officials said, adding that the state industries department has received 39 applications for producing PPE kits, N-95 masks and three-layered masks. According to the Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), a representative body of manufacturers and exporters of apparel products, around 20 garment companies are ready to make 50,000 PPE kits and masks daily, and will employ at least 3,000 tailors and supporting staff. “As per the directions given by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Union textiles minister Smriti Irani, the garment industry in Gautam Budh Nagar is all set to fulfil the requirement of PPE kits and masks in the country at the time of coronavirus crisis. The government has agreed to give relaxation to our workers during the lockdown. We have been asked to maintain social distancing and provide healthy environment to our workers. Only four workers will be working in a 20 feet by 20 feet room,” said Lalit Thukral, president of NAEC.He further said that the companies will soon begin manufacturing PPE kits and masks after getting the administrative approval. Giving details about materials of a PPE kit, Thukral said it will be made of laminated non-woven fabric, which will be light and water-repellent. It will be synthetic and blood-penetration resistant. Besides, it will have good air permeability. “The seams of PPE kits are covered by special sealing tape, which effectively blocks viruses, bacteria and micro-organisms. Meeting ISO16603 class 3 exposure pressure, the PPE kits are of high strength and tensity, which can be used by medical staff at isolation and quarantine wards, as such kits help health care workers protect themselves from the deadly virus,” he said.Anil Kumar, deputy commissioner of the District Industries Centre (DIC), said 39 firms have sought approval for making PPE kits and masks so far, and they will get approval in a couple of working days. “Some of them have already got the approval and started the production of PPE kits and masks on a large scale. A company in the district is already making 50,000 kits per week. It will open a new unit in Sector 63 soon. After that, this company will start production of 1.5 lakh kits per week. All companies have been asked to supply the kits and masks, as per the government approved rates,” Kumar said.Thukral of the NAEC said that five companies in the district have already arranged the machines and workers for the production of PPE kits and masks. “Besides, six other companies, after making proper arrangements of machines and manpower, have also applied for the production of the PPE kits, consisting of masks, gloves, apron, face protector, face shield, special helmet, eye protector and shoe cover. If the administration approves their applications, the ready-made garment companies, under NAEC, will start producing at least 50,000 PPE kits per day,” he said.The NAEC president also said that these companies will supply masks as per the government rates for A+ quality. “The ministry of health has fixed the price at ₹900 (excluding taxes) for the best qualities. For the medium range, the price will be ₹700 plus taxes and the rate of a simple PPE kit has been determined ₹600 plus taxes. Our units will supply the PPE kits at these rates to the government and the private hospitals,” he added.Pallavi Agarwal, who runs a garment export company in Noida Phase 2 that has recently started making PPE kits, said that the garment companies will be able to earn only about 5% profit on a kit. “In the production of a ₹900 PPE kit, our workers will get ₹200 and the material, manufacturing and transportation cost will be around ₹625. We have started the production of kits so that workers can earn some money,” she said.She also said all manufacturing units are following social distancing parameters, providing proper ambience and other facilities like safe drinking water and toilets to workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-garment-industry-set-to-produce-50-000-ppe-kits-a-day/story-QRq9cx4fLutVReSr6Iz16K.html
11-04-2020||Noida||Cremations in Noida affected as wood availability low due to lockdown||The cremation ground in Sector 94, Noida, is running low on wood needed for cremation owing to the ongoing lockdown. The lack of labour is also hampering its operations.According to the management, they now have stock only for another 15 days with no foreseeable solution in sight.“The ground comes under the Noida authority but we have been managing it for years now. These days, we also have a problem of not enough workers due to social distancing norms, and most of them are staying away anyway. However, we are managing for now but the real problem is that we have limited supplies left and have already dipped into our wood reserves which may hod out for another two weeks at the most,” Mahesh Saxena, general secretary, Noida Lok Manch, the social organisation managing the ground, said.He said they have two wood vendors who supply from Bulandshahr. “There is also a shortage of labour for chopping the wood. They have the requisite permissions from Noida, but they face problems at the border as there is a severe lack of coordination. The reserve wood we are using these days is dry and so we end up using more of it as dry wood burns fast,” Saxena said.He said they now use about five quintals of wood per body, up from the earlier three. On average, the ground uses 1,000 quintals of wood a month and the management hopes that they get support from the government officials.“Maybe, the forest department could chip in and contribute. We have to prepare ourselves mentally. What if the situation becomes worse going forward? We can’t keep using more fuel also. There are two CNG machines here, one of which has been defunct for a while. The authorities need to come up with alternative plans to supply us with fuel,” he said.Saxena said he has written to the national fuel suppliers to provide fuel at a subsidised price but has not heard back from them yet.“This is a national crisis and every state will face this problem. The government has to prepare a contingency plan. We are still awaiting instructions on how bodies of Covid-19 patients have to be disposed of. Our staff should also receive the necessary protective gear. A few more days and operations will come to a halt,” Saxena said.Police said that they have given passes to wood vendors. “We will speak with our counterparts in Bulandshahr and try to resolve any border issues,” Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, said.Noida authority officials said they are prepared for all scenarios.“We have already instructed the horticulture department to supply the required wood in the next 10 days. We also have a surplus CNG machine and we are working on repairing the defunct one. The firm that does the maintenance is under lockdown currently. A few bodies are cremated using wood and while the others are burned using the CNG machine. There will be no problems in this regard,” Vijay Rawal, senior manager, circle 9, civil department, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cremations-in-noida-affected-as-wood-availability-low-due-to-lockdown/story-8EfllG6VN0Cfb9wf6bhUwM.html
11-04-2020||Noida||Noida Authority starts using drones for scanning people, disinfecting slums||In order to prevent the possibility of community transmission in some of the slum clusters in the city, the Noida Authority, on Saturday, started using a multi-purpose corona combat drone (CCD) for scanning people venturing out their houses and to disinfect the slum areas. So far, the health department of the Noida Authority has disinfected slums located along the Shahdara drain that originates from Delhi’s Chilla and ends in Sector 94 merging into the Yamuna river. Thousands of people live in these slums located in sectors 16, 17, 14, 15 and near the DLF Mall of India. The drone has the facility to carry a thermal camera, a night vision camera, a disinfectant tank, a loudspeaker and spotlight, said officials of the Noida Authority.“This CCD will help in scanning of people, who have higher temperature than normal and also disinfect the areas, which are densely populated. If it works properly, then we will use this facility in other slum clusters and densely populated areas of the city,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO, Noida Authority.The Noida Authority has a staff of around 5,000 workers and around 300 senior officials, who are engaged in sanitation and food distribution to homeless people across the city spread over an area of 20,000 hectares of land adjoining Delhi. They are finding it very tough to disinfect slum clusters, which are located along city’s polluted drains, vacant plots and in flood plains of the Hindon river, among other areas. The authority officials fear that if Covid-19 disease spreads in slum areas, then the risk of community spread will increase manifold. The authority decided to disinfect slum clusters after a positive case surfaced in Sector 5 slum area, where at least 200 suspected cases have been kept in quarantine in a university in Greater Noida. According to the health department, 64 positive cases of Covid-19 have been found in Gautam Buddha Nagar, out of which 12 have been discharged, while the remaining are under treatment. Apart from this, the authority teams are disinfecting sealed hotspots and other areas in order to contain the spread of the virus causing Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-starts-using-drones-for-scanning-people-disinfecting-slums/story-68gZMPMswohamKrgfrmRoO.html

Villagers feared that he was a covid victim. Dhillon was a resident of a Tricone City on the Patiala-Sirhind Road and had died due to complications arising out of diabetes, his family and police said. “Dhillon possessed the voter identity card of Kassiana village and his family members wanted to cremate him there. When the villagers objected, we were informed,” Aman Mandi SHO Gurnam Singh said, adding that when they reached Kassian, the family had shifted the body to Hardaspur village, 2km from Kassian, where too the panchayat was not willing to allow the cremation. “A team from Faggan Majra police station was rushed to Hardaspur village and convinced the panchayat, following which the last rites were performed there,” the SHO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patiala-village-refuses-to-allow-cremation-of-native/story-IpFi0Nv23JO7i4A6iZ4pUJ.html

Kapurthala civil surgeon Jasmit Kaur Bawa said the girl was suffering from fever and the varsity authorities informed the health department and a team from Phagwara civil hospital took her blood sample and she was found positive. “We have shifted her to the isolation ward,” Bawa said. Varsity officials said “they will provide all cooperation to district administration to avoid spread of the virus”. Deputy commissioner Dipti Uppal said the university has been sealed and “no one will be allowed to move out of the campus till all the people are screened”. “There are around 2,000 students, who are from different states and countries, staying on the campus.

11-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus patient made to wait under tree at KEM for 13 hours||A 33-year-old woman suffering from a kidney ailment and who has tested positive for coronavirus had to wait under a tree for close to 13 hours at the city’s biggest civic-run hospital, King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, owing to “unavailability of a bed for a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patient”, on Friday. The civic body’s health department is holding an inquiry into the matter, which counts as a violation of safety of the patient and others during a pandemic as the woman may have transmitted the virus to people at the hospital premises. The patient was waiting near the entrance of the old KEM building, where many doctors, patients and their kin usually walk by.On Friday, the patient from Vile Parle, who has been on dialysis for the past four years, was diagnosed with Covid-19 after a swab test at a private laboratory. The Shanti Charitable Trust, based in Vile Parle, which helped her undergo the test, sent the patient to Nehru Nagar Health Post, Vile Parle. The doctor-in-charge referred the patient to KEM Hospital with a letter that read, “She (the patient) has done her last dialysis on April 9...her test was done on April 8 and came positive of Covid-19 on April 10. So, kindly admit the patient.”As per protocol, the police dropped the patient at KEM around 12 noon on Friday. But she was refused admission due to unavailability of beds for coronavirus patients. The has 16 isolation beds under emergency medical service and another 30 beds in ward 4A. All these beds are occupied most days, said doctors.“We weren’t even allowed to sit inside the hospital when the guard got to know that my wife is a Covid-19 patient. Since they asked us to wait outside, we waited under a tree at a tea stall inside the hospital premises,” said the patient’s husband. After waiting till 11.30pm, the hospital’s guards started forcing them out of the hospital. “They abused us and accused us of spreading the infection by sitting on the ground,” he added. When the patient asked for an ambulance, the hospital refused to provide one. “I couldn’t take her to Kasturba Hospital without an ambulance. They didn’t provide us one and the police there also refused to help us,” he said.When HT got to know of the incident, this reporter informed Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, who immediately jumped into action to transport the patient to Kasturba Hospital. The ambulance service refused to get to the hospital until they got a direct call from a staff member to ferry the patient. Despite repeated calls, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of the hospital, did not respond for a comment. It was around 12.30am that Dr Shah got an ambulance sent from Kasturba. In the meantime, KEM Hospital agreed to admit the patient and she was finally admitted to the Covid-19 ward. But due to unavailability of beds, the patient was kept on a stretcher. “They have run two more tests on me and have put me on saline. So far, [till Saturday 4pm], I haven’t been given any medicines. They have kept me on a stretcher until they can avail a bed,” said the patient on phone. Dr Shah said she has initiated an inquiry against the hospital staff . Patients with comorbidities such as kidney failure are most vulnerable to the virus. Despite this, keeping a patient waiting without providing basic protective gear outside a hospital is a gross violation of safety of the patient and others at the hospital, said activists. “If the hospital didn’t have any bed, they could have sent the patient to another one in an ambulance. Not all hospitals have Covid-19-specific dialysis centres, so the patient was referred to KEM Hospital. The staffers risked so many lives by keeping patients exposed inside hospital premises,” said Jitendra Tandel a counsellor at Runga Kalyan Seva Samajik Sanstha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-patient-made-to-wait-under-tree-at-kem-for-13-hours/story-onECi7eLliK1kzweBbTifL.html
11-04-2020||City||Increase in cases with no contact history adds to Punjab’s worries||CHANDIGARH Even as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has denied the start of ‘community transmission’ of Covid-19 in the country so far, Punjab has witnessed at least 25 cases till date, out of its total tally of 157, in which the source of infection is not known yet to health officials.The fact that at least eight such cases were detected in the current week and most of them belong to densely populated city areas has added to the worries of state health officials.On Saturday, seven new positive cases surfaced in Punjab and the health department does not have any contact history in two of these.While one man, who tested positive in Patiala, was working as gardener at the house of a Punjab Civil Service (PCS) officer, the second is a truck driver from Dhar block of Pathankot district, who had returned from Gurugram to his village after the lockdown.The Pathankot administration is also clueless about the original source of infection to 14 positive cases in Sujanpur town of the district. Seven out of these belonged to one family.In this case, one young boy from the affected family had come from Chandigarh after the lockdown and initially, the health officials suspected him as the ‘main carrier’, but during the tests, the boy’s report came negative.Later, the health officials even floated the theory that one NRI from Canada had visited the family in January this year and the family may have got the virus from the guest. In Ludhiana district also, two such cases belong to city areas -- a woman from an influential family and a housewife who died on March 30. The source of infection is not known in both these cases.In Jalandhar city too, health officials do not have any information about the source of the virus in three positive cases, in which the patients are a housewife, a hakeem and a youth working in a private hospital.All these cases have been reported from densely populated city areas. One of these patients, Parveen Kumar who was working as hakeem, lost his life. Three family members of the deceased also tested positive later.In Mohali, the worst-affected district of Punjab, the source of infection in two patients who have died is not known. One of these patients belonged to the Nayagaon area on the outskirts of Chandigarh and the second was from densely populated Kharar town. In the latter case, a 78-year-old woman was tested positive for coronavirus after her death.Even as Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday stated that there was no trace of source of infection in at least 23 cases in the state, a senior health department official, however, downplayed the figures.“We have 13 to 15 cases where the source of infection is not known yet. Still we can say that it’s the start of the first phase of the community spread,” the official said, seeking anonymity.However, Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said it would be too early to comment on the ‘community spread’ stage. “Things would be clear in the coming eight to 10 days. Few cases in which the source of infection is not known is a cause of concern for all of us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/increase-in-cases-with-no-contact-history-adds-to-punjab-s-worries/story-kd2JOyiJ0L3PjRnCPddTKK.html
11-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus outbreak: Victims’ families refuse to collect ashes after last rites||Families and relatives of coronavirus patients, who have died, have not been returning to crematoriums after the final rites to collect the ashes of their loved ones. At the city’s three major crematoriums — Vaikunt Dham Hindu Electric Crematorium at Reay Road; Municipal Electric Crematorium at Chandanwadi; and Electric Crematorium at Worli — the ashes of 10 victims have not been collected by their families 10 days after the final rites had been performed. The staffers at the crematoriums told Hindustan Times that the victims’ families fear virus transmission through the ashes and so have not returned to collect them. “As per protocol, we call the families to collect the ashes, but most of them refuse and ask us to immerse them in a water body because they are afraid of contracting the disease,” a staffer at the Chandanwadi crematorium said. Some families have also been apprehensive about paying their final respects. Prakash Salave, one of the staffers at the Reay Road crematorium, said, “The families and relatives of the victims are in so much fear that several of them even abstain from paying their final respects to the patient. I am witnessing such a scenario for the first time in 25 years since I’ve worked here.”The civic body said it has issued guidelines to its health department to be followed during the cremation of patients who have died due to coronavirus. As per the guidelines, health staffers have to wrap the bodies in a plastic bag. The health department also has to ensure that the crematorium staffers follow all the guidelines to prevent transmission among them or those present for the final rites. “Through your newspaper, I want to appeal to the citizens that there is no possibility of the infection transmitting after the cremation of the body. It is safe to collect the ashes as it does not carry any infection,” said a civic official, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-outbreak-victims-families-refuse-to-collect-ashes-after-last-rites/story-WmejjSfyDMWAuoehX3qRqO.html
11-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown stress for couples expecting kids||Vaibhav Joshi, 31, a resident of Kharghar, had planned to reach Hubli, Karnataka to be with his pregnant wife, Krithika, on March 25. However, since the national lockdown was imposed, Joshi has been stuck in the city, trying to reach out to different authorities for permission to travel and be with his wife at this crucial juncture.“She is expected to deliver anytime now,” said a worried Joshi. “Her parents are above 60 and both are diabetic. She is anxious that they may be at risk of contracting the virus if they accompany her to the hospital. All our relatives also stay in Bengaluru and can’t make it to Hubli during the lockdown,” he said.Living under the pandemic lockdown could pose great stress for pregnant women, with concerns for health safety and the availability of medical aid. The World Health Organization has released guidelines to address issues related to pregnancy and childbirth during the pandemic.In Virar, 31-year-old Archana Periera has been checking travel websites to see if her husband, 36-year-old Robin can take a flight from Barcelona after April 14. Pereira is eight months pregnant and lives alone in their flat.“I have not been able to step out for my tetanus injection or get groceries and medicines,” said Periera. Her family members have not been able to help and since they shifted to a new apartment, she does not know people living nearby. “I have had a miscarriage before. I just want to be careful,” she said.“Expectant mothers are very anxious about the availability of doctors and more importantly, reaching the hospital during the lockdown, as everyone does not have a personal vehicle,” said Sapna Krishnan, a lactation counsellor who has been running a pan-India mother-child helpline to counsel expectant mothers during the lockdown.“We get a lot of calls from anxious mothers. Those who have gone to stay with their mothers are stressed because older parents will not be allowed in hospitals as they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus. And in cases where the mother has an older child, the grandparents need to take care of that child too,” Krishnan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-stress-for-couples-expecting-kids/story-2G4QFsiw8gf6VQjzKVhuuJ.html
11-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown: IIT-B platform to streamline relief work||A group of students of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), with the help of alumni, have created a platform to connect those providing relief aid during the Covid-19 outbreak to the volunteers who have resources or manpower.There are various organisations and support groups across the country lending a helping hand to those who are worst affected by the global pandemic and the subsequent nationwide lockdown. While many are providing food and shelter to migrant workers and daily wage labourers, others are providing essential commodities and medical supplies. There are a host of volunteers, too, who are helping with the relief work. An online platform or interface called ‘URHope’, designed by the students of IIT-B will help in bringing these organisations and volunteers together.“If any of us want to help by volunteering or providing resources, we can use this interface to find an organisation that may need help. It will act as a connecting bridge between those who can provide help to those who may need it,” said a student involved in the project.The first step is to get registered on the interface through https://bit.ly/coronareliefindia.Here, one can register as an individual or organisation and provide details of the services one wishes to provide or requires. Once registered, you can find a match based on the database.“There are people who wish to volunteer in the relief process, but don’t know where to go. So, to ease the process of accessing, as well as providing relief, some of us [students and working professionals] have come together to create an online platform/interface called URHope. One can register: if one needs help [for food, medicine, accommodation etc.], if one is providing help or if one wishes to volunteer with someone who has already initiated a relief process,” read a statement by the student group, IIT-B for Justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-iit-b-platform-to-streamline-relief-work/story-KyTbuxsS1QFYO39UbuV8LP.html

11-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Staff anxious as parts of 2 Tarn Taran rehabs turned into isolation wards||The Tarn Taran district administration’s decision to turn parts of two government-run drug rehabilitation-cum-out patient opioid assisted treatment (OOAT) centres into isolation wards for quarantining those with symptoms of Covid-19 has caused anxiety and fear among their staff. It is not only the fear of the coronavirus infection but also their concern for hundreds of drug addicts getting themselves treated at these centres. The 40- and 30-bedded isolation wards at these centres are situated at Tharu and Bhagupur villages of the district. Even as the district has 13 OOAT centres, the Tharu and Bhagupur facilities not only take care of the rehabilitation of drug dependents, but also of registration of new patients. The two are registering more than 400 addicts on daily basis. “Soon after an isolation ward was created in our centre, some of the admitted addicts left saying they could not stay here as suspected Covid-19 patients were to be isolated. There is only one entrance to the centre. It is not only making us as well the addicts vulnerable,” said Dr Paramvir Singh Sidhu, medical officer of the Tharu centre. Another doctor said, “This will not only hamper the anti-drug drive, but also increase chances of cross-infection that can be catastrophic. Experts have been advising complete separation of healthy and suspected individuals. The administration should shift both the OOAT centres elsewhere as it was done in Amritsar.”Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Anoop Singh said, “The two centres are among 15 Covid care isolation centres. We will try not to use these two until others are filled to capacity.” Deputy commissioner (DC) Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal said, “If there is a danger of infection spread, the two centres will not be used as Covid isolation wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-staff-anxious-as-parts-of-2-tarn-taran-rehabs-turned-into-isolation-wards/story-6vb2s8Mb9wBpYlw5B4t4yH.html

The matter has been seriously viewed by the state government,” Jain wrote to the schools and advised the schools to “restrain from enhancing school fees during the current academic year.”Significantly, a number of part-time lecturers in different colleges have alleged that they did not receive their remuneration for the month of March (due in April) and the college authorities told them that the payments were not made because no classes were held during the lockdown.Part time lecturers are employed on contract, usually to make up for posts of permanent lecturers that are lying vacant, and paid a fixed amount. These lecturers were appointed by college management committees and not the state government.On Saturday, state education minister Partha Chatterjee said, “It has come to our notice that some colleges who had appointed part-time lecturers on their own have stopped paying them. We have received several complaints. We are telling the colleges not to stop payment of remuneration until the government announces some measures.” The education department will also give these instructions in writing, said Chatterjee. “I did not receive this month’s payment. When I inquired, the college authorities said no part-time lecturer is being given remuneration because only a few classes were held in March and the college will be closed in April,” said a part-time lecturer in physics who teaches in a college in North 24-Parganas district.No college authority could be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bengal-schools-hike-fees-colleges-stop-paying-part-time-lecturers-amid-coronavirus-crisis/story-KITFnOrparQCWaGKy0ZeGM.html

The girl is a resident of Dhandra Road in Dugri Phase-2 locality and this hospital was around 6km from her home. The civil hospital is around 20km from her home. Her covid-19 report is awaited. Dr Harleen Kaur, in-charge of the emergency ward of the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, when the girl’s father, Joginder Singh, rushed her there, said, “We have dedicated one bed for treatment of covid-19. This bed was occupied, so we referred the girl to the civil hospital.” Joginder said, “The on duty-doctor told us that they did not have a paediatric ventilator. On seeing the symptoms of my daughter, the staff and the doctors did not even let us enter the emergency and maintained distance.” Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that the matter of refusal of admission by the private hospital was being looked into. “We tried to resuscitate the girl, but couldn’t save her,” he added.Incidentally, reports of over 100 samples collected on Thursday and Friday were also pending till the time of the filing of this report. The girl’s body has not been handed over to the family, which has been asked to home quarantine till the report comes.

The state government in its reply in the House had said that no request was made to the Centre to provide funds to tackle any exigency arising out of the spread of coronavirus in the state.Meanwhile, Singha said that if the government was serious about the crisis, it would not have made such a casual reply in the session.“I had sent a letter seeking the government’s reply in the matter. It is easy to blame others. The state government didn’t understand the gravity of such a pandemic,” said Singha.The central government too made a statement on March 13 that virus was not a health hazard, Singha said.“Now, instead of strengthening the infrastructure, pace up tests and contact tracing, the government is resorting to unusual gimmicks to divert the attention of the public,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-govt-treated-coronavirus-threat-casually-cpi-m-legislator/story-O1NeL8FrnBaF0tKB6SAEfN.html

At present, 520 people, including migrant workers, are staying at the nine shelter homes in Rohtak. Razban, a cotton mill labourer from Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly, says, “We get timely meals three times a day. The shelter has become our second home.” However, worried about the economic fallout of the lockdown, he says, “We don’t have money and our family members in the village are running out of cash, too. The government should provide us work in crop procurement at the earliest.” While appreciative of the efforts of the district administration and NGOs, Man Singh, a manual labourer from Rajasthan’s Nagor said that he felt the government had ignored them and had not drafted any plan to ensure their families’ survival before implementing the nationwide lockdown: “I am getting food here but my family of six in Nagor is struggling. They are unable to have two square meals. I am the sole breadwinner in my family. I don’t know how long the lockdown will continue. How shall we survive?” Raju, a construction worker from Bihar, says he had boarded a bus from Narnaul to go Delhi but was stranded in Rohtak due to the lockdown: “The government should have ensured that we were sent home, before issuing the lockdown,” he said. Washrooms not up to the mark, say women However, a group of women staying in another shelter on Bhiwani-Rohtak road say they were not satisfied with the facilities at the shelter homes. “The condition of washrooms is not up to the mark. The government should arrange for us to go to our homes because we cannot live in shelter homes for any linger,” they said.Rohtak deputy commissioner RS Verma said 45 shelter homes had been established in Rohtak to accommodate 14,694 people. “The 520 migrant labourers have been provided accommodation and food facility. A team of doctors also visits regularly to enquire after their health. The people living in shelter homes are maintaining social distancing. These homes are operated by the administration in collaboration with some NGOs and social organisations,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rohtak-shelters-have-become-second-home-say-migrant-workers/story-UZ0N7D2oV5AdjQZo0vPC9K.html

While rejecting the objections of the BJP MP, justice Ramesh Sinha fixed May 6 as the next date for framing of the issues in the matter. Former MP from Badaun Lok Sabha seat, Dharmendra Yadav had filed the election petition challenging the election of Samghmitra Maurya who had defeated Yadav in the last general election.“In my considered opinion, the contention advanced by counsel for Sanghmitra Maurya that the petitioner Dharmendra Yadav’s statement in the election petition raises no cause of action, is wholly unfounded. It is well settled law that if the election petition speaks about the material facts and concise statement on which the election petitioner relies upon are stated in the election petition, the same should not be thrown at the threshold,” the court observed.The petitioner had challenged the election of Sanghmitra Maurya, who is daughter of UP cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya, on the ground that it was a case of improper acceptance of her nomination. It was also contended that in the nomination, there was no disclosure of her marital status and other facts and also there was no disclosure of the assets of her spouse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/allahabad-hc-rejects-objections-of-bjp-mp-in-petition-challenging-her-election/story-c1Po8tEcRnBjvCVSVMaF3L.html

11-04-2020||Pune||Authorities, experts call for mass testing in Pune as mortality rate nears 12%||With a population of 94 lakh Pune district has tested 2,914 samples since the outbreak of Covid-19, till April 9.Of these, 209 cases have been positive, 25 of whom have died. This puts the mortality rate for Pune district at close to 12 per cent, while Mumbai, with a population of 1.84 crore, has 876 positive cases and 54 deaths, and a mortality rate of 6.16 per cent.Experts say that now is the time for Pune to test every symptomatic patient as the infection is no more restricted to close contacts of positive patients, or those with a travel history.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and other district authorities are still continuing with the protocol to only test those who show symptoms from high-risk areas, which include the recently earmarked containment areas. Pune is the second hotspot in the state after Mumbai. A senior doctor from a well-known chain of hospitals, requesting anonymity, said, “Of course the number of cases in the city will be low. The city administration tests only if a person shows symptoms and is from a high-risk area. At this stage anyone is likely to be infected.” Dr Abhijit More, public health expert, said, “At this stage the infection is not just restricted to travel history, or close contact with a positive patient. Many positive cases are coming forward wherein the patient does not know how s/he caught the infection. Every symptomatic patient, with a cold, cough, fever or difficulty in breathing, must be tested. Those going for door-to-door surveys must be given the immunoglobulin-M kits, which is easy to test, cheap and the sample collection needs minimum training. This can be followed by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which requires a lot of training for swab collection, packaging and transporting to the labs. It is time Pune does mass testing” Currently, the PMC has sent out teams for door-to- door surveys of people with flu-like symptoms and those in the high-risk groups, with diabetes and high blood pressure. Those found with symptoms are then sent to the nearest PMC clinic or referred to Naidu hospital or Sassoon hospital, depending on the seriousness of the symptoms. Pune district collector Naval Kishor Ram agreed that mass testing needs to be started. He said, “Currently we are testing about 30-40 samples everyday which is why we are seeing such a rise in the number of cases in recent days, but I am strongly in favour of mass testing. About 300-400 samples should be tested everyday if we want to contain the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/authorities-experts-call-for-mass-testing-in-pune-as-mortality-rate-nears-12/story-yM7Ta8oFcpb2hTP55cve4N.html
11-04-2020||Lucknow||UP police caution people about cyber fraudsters||At a time when people are contributing to government relief funds for the fight against Sars-Cov-2, cyber fraudsters are busy duping using fake IDs. The cybercrime wing of Uttar Pradesh police has cautioned people to not transfer money on random addresses.Several identical IDs have been doing the rounds on social media and sometimes people are getting messages to donate or fund one-time food. The moment they clicked on the link, they lost all the money to the fraudsters, said the cyber cops.One popular UPI address is ‘pmcares@sbi’ and cybercriminals have made several identical IDs with little spelling changes to cheat the people. SP Cybercrime Rohan P Kanay said people were falling into the trap sans accurate information.“Cyber police are coming across such cases across the country, including Uttar Pradesh. We are sensitising people to not fell prey to such tactics,” he said. The government has blocked some such IDs but there are several other portals.The cybercrime wing of the UP police has issued a communique, explaining about the modus operandi of cyber fraudsters. “Most of the cases are about identical fake IDs. People do not check IDs properly and donate amount on wrong IDs created by fraudsters,” Kanay added. Such cases were reported mainly in urban areas, said cops.Sometimes people get a message about funding one-time meal of a poor person. “The message has a link and when someone clicks that link, his or her phone goes on remote control mode. A remote access software is automatically installed on your phone. It is like someone else can see your screen and activities. And when you pay a small amount with the intention to fund one time meal, they may copy your UPI password and steal all your money,” said Kanay.“People are advised to use only the government websites to donate money instead of opting for other options,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-police-caution-people-about-cyber-fraudsters/story-0zJZXSPfkYu90BFvmTDYJJ.html

We are in turn working with a number of other social organisations and well-wishers who have helped with food, food grains and financial assistance to feed the poor. Now we have set up a community kitchen which is serving lunch and dinner to at least 750 daily wage workers in the area. My job is to coordinate the food distribution operations and ensure that nobody goes to sleep without food.How does your day begin, and roll out?I wake up early in the morning and take stock of the situation on the ground. After that, along with a close group of social workers we go to the market to buy vegetables and necessary essentials. The cook is briefed and the cooking starts at 10 am and by 1 pm , we deploy the food packets to the distribution area. The evening session for dinner preparations begins at 5 pm and ends at 8 pm.What precautions are you taking?We are following all the guidelines of the district collector and state health department. Everyone observes social distancing and it is compulsory for everyone in the kitchen to wear masks. We have sanitisers to keep hands clean.What is your view of the Covid-19 situation in Pune?The situation in the city appears to be serious and citizens must follow social distancing and stay indoors. We are all concerned but the government and the local police are doing good work in preventing the spread. The Kondhwa police officials and people on the ground have put in special efforts to help us.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?We need more residents to come out and help the government and the people in this crisis. The corporate sector in Pune must donate more for the city through their corporate social responsibility initiatives so that poor people can be fed during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-i-ensure-that-nobody-sleeps-hungry-in-my-area-says-saleem-mulla-chief-coordinator-hadiya-social-foundation/story-ETPAKZeF756f9jGQBvuQ4H.html

11-04-2020||City||Punjab CM suggests extension of national lockdown by at least a fortnight||CHANDIGARH: The national lockdown should be extended by at least a fortnight, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh suggested during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with chief ministers on Saturday.As India battles the Covid-19 crisis, the Prime Minister held a video conference with chief ministers primarily to take their feedback on whether or not the 21-day nationwide lockdown should be extended beyond April 14 to stem the tide of infections.Though the restrictions are causing a lot of hardship to the people, India cannot afford to take any chances, Capt Amarinder Singh said, a day after extending curfew in his state to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus.The disease has claimed 11 lives and infected 151 people so far in Punjab.Capt Singh suggested health and relief measures and asked for special concessions for the industrial and agricultural sectors.The chief minister said there is huge uncertainty over the incidence rate of the disease and that the nation is in for a long fight. Given the trend in China and several European countries, it is necessary to continue the lockdown, he said.The chief minister informed the meeting that the Punjab government had already decided to go for curfew or complete lockdown till May 1, with all educational institutions to be closed till June 30.State board examinations have also been deferred till further orders, he said.Prohibitory orders that prevent the assembly of five or more people at one spot remains in place, along with prohibition of public service vehicles till May 1, a state government statement said.SPECIAL RISK INSURANCE COVER SOUGHTHe also sought a special risk insurance for all government employees, including police personnel, sanitation workers and all other employees, who are working day and night to help mitigate the miseries and stress of people in these trying times, it said.He also said there was a need to substantially increase the number of tests being done for Covid-19 and to go for rapid testing.RS 500 CRORE FOR HOSPITAL INFRA UPGRADEThe chief minister requested Rs 500 crore for quick upgrade of infrastructure of government hospitals in Punjab, which is currently at Stage-2 of the pandemic, the statement said.He also called for speedy approval by the Centre to the state’s proposal for a Rs 550-crore Advanced Centre for Virology.On urgent relief measures for Punjab, Capt Amarinder Singh urged the Government of India to defer the recovery or waive interest and penalties on industrial loans for six months.WANTS RELIEF FOR DAILY-WAGERS, LABOURERSEmphasising that industrial establishments cannot continue to look after their workers for a long time, he asked the Centre to think of innovative solutions for relief to daily wage workers and industrial labour either through ESIC funds or under MGNREGA.The government of India can allow village panchayats and municipalities to utilise the 14th Finance Commission grants for emergency relief, including food and medicines for the poor and needy, Capt Amarinder Singh suggested.WANTS ONE-TIME INCREASE IN BORROWING LIMITThe statement, quoting Singh, said he asked for a one-time increase in borrowing limit from 3% to 4% of the state’s GDP by amending the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Amendment (FRBM) Act, 2003.The Punjab government is sending a complete proposal in this regard to the Union finance ministry.SEEKS BONUS FOR FARMERSReferring to the harvesting and procurement operations set to begin in Punjab next week, the chief minister reiterated his demand for a bonus to farmers to incentivise staggered and delayed procurement of wheat.He also called for quicker movement of food grains lying in Food Corporation of India godowns in Punjab, along with waiver of three months’ interest on crop loans and deferment of recovery of crops loans by commercial banks.Thanking the Centre for releasing substantial funds since the last meeting with chief ministers, Capt Amarinder Singh stressed on the need for early release of pending arrears of GST on priority to help the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-suggests-extension-of-national-lockdown-by-at-least-a-fortnight/story-GsuBzyHMQqrxAdscJT4lXP.html

11-04-2020||City||Haryana govt rules out community spread; contact history of only three patients untraced||CHANDIGARH: Haryana’s health authorities have ruled out the community spread of the coronavirus disease in the state so far, though they admit they are yet to ascertain the contact history in three (2%) of the 162 positive cases in the state.For instance, a 38-year-old woman, who tested positive for Covid-19 on March 30, did not have any travel history. Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Dhruva Chaudhary says that the woman’s contact history is yet to be traced. Her two children had also caught the infection from her.The woman runs a paying guest (PG) facility in Sirsa, while her husband owns a similar business in Chandigarh and visited Rajasthan, Punjab and Union territory recently. Doctors suspect the woman’s husband contracted the infection and passed it on to his wife. He is healthy due to better immunity.FAMILY FUNCTION ATTENDED BY NRIsIn Ambala, the health department is yet to ascertain how a 67-year-old heart patient, who died at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on April 1, caught the infection. His 65-year-old woman relative has also tested positive.Ambala chief medical officer Dr Kuldeep Singh says a family function was held on March 20 at their residence which was attended by non-resident Indians (NRIs). Though the woman’s daughter-in-law, who works at a bank in Patiala and deals with NRI accounts, tested negative, the woman could have got infected due to low immunity.SOURCE OF INFECTION A MYSTERYThe source of infection of the 58-year-old first Covid-19 patient of Karnal district, who had died at PGI, Chandigarh, is yet to be ascertained. On April 2, he tested positive for Covid-19 and died two days later. He, however, left his son, a doctor and a staff nurse of Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital infected.Ruling out chances of community spread in Haryana, the director general, health services, Dr SB Kamboj said the Karnal village resident was a chronic diabetic and was frequenting hospitals in Gurugram and Panipat before getting admitted to the Karnal hospital.“A case qualifies to be a case of community spread when we fail to get absolutely no traces of the contact history. In all these cases of Ambala, Sirsa and Karnal, we at least know the possible route of the contact,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-govt-rules-out-community-spread-contact-history-of-only-three-patients-untraced/story-cF915LzXZXZAwX7hYmHeIM.html

After preliminary medical examinations, 52 of them tested Covid-19 positive, the official said.All of them were sent to different quarantine centres.Many of these 102 people had attended the congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat at the Nizamuddin Markaz last month.The authorities have launched a sanitisation drive in Chandni Mahal and introduced a containment plan after the detection of such a large number of people living in religious places.Those who came into contact with the three people who died and those who tested positive have been put under home quarantine.No resident of the locality is allowed to go out of their homes and essential items are being delivered at home, another official said.So far, over 500 Covid-19 positive cases and about 20 deaths in the country have been found to have links to the Nizamuddin congregation.Over 2,300 activists, including 250 foreigners of the Islamic organisation Tablighi Jamaat, were found to be living at its headquarters at the Markaz building in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in the later part of March, despite the 21-day lockdown imposed from March 25 to check the spread of the coronavirus.At least 9,000 people had participated at the congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz last month after which many have travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works.Among the participants include citizens of 41 nationalities. They are 379 Indonesians, 110 Bangladeshi, 77 Kyrgyzstan, 75 Malaysian, 65 Thai, 63 Myanmarese and 33 Sri Lankan citizens besides others.The home ministry had also asked Delhi Police and police chiefs of other states, where these foreigners are currently living, to take legal action under the Foreigners Act and the Disaster Management Act.The ministry had said that about 2,100 foreigners have come to India since January 1 and indulged in Tablighi activities in different parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/52-people-at-delhi-s-chandni-mahal-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-SkYQTahrMyhtyA6m6tGbtI.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Exiled in self-isolation||There is nobody else in his Lajpat Nagar pad. The young man is alone in this prolonged lockdown following the coronavirus pandemic.Actually, he is totally alone in the world, in a manner of speaking.Kalsang Jigme laughs at the suggestion. He is talking on WhatsApp — the photos are taken on the phone screen that connects him to this reporter.“But I have John Berger with me,” he says, showing his half-read copy of the said author’s Understanding a Photograph. Mr Jigme, 29, is a freelancer photographer, in fact. And he’s also a documentary filmmaker.Just before the lockdown began, his three roomies—all Tibetans like him—went to their families in the hill town of Mussoorie.Mr Jigme doesn’t have the luxury to return to his family in this period of crisis. “My folks are in Lhasa,” he says, chuckling, referring to the the Tibetan capital. He left his family when he was just six. Mr Jigme explains that his parents realised that education opportunities for Tibetans were far more superior in India where their spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, already ran the Tibetan government in exile. He was smuggled across the international border with a group of forty kids. “The journey took two months,” Mr Jigme recalls. Though time has passed, he clearly recalls the hardships. “We would walk at night and sleep during the day in secluded places… beside the rivers, inside the caves, under the blue sky.” Many a times he would cry on thinking of his parents—he would miss them more when hungry. It was true of other kids, too. “Then the brokers who would be in charge of us would hush us up saying that the Chinese soldiers would hear us!”The trip ended in Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government. Mr Jigme later finished his schooling in a Tibetan institution in Mussoorie. Later he graduated in a Bangalore college and learned photography in a Delhi institute.“I have never met my parents or my siblings since the time I left Lhasa,” he replies calmly. Not even a single phone call has been exchanged between them. “Because the Chinese government eavesdrop on phone calls and that might put them in trouble.”Nevertheless, Mr Jigme believes that his parents sent him to India “for the sake of my better future and also because I was the middle child, so I could be spared.”He keeps up with the contemporary life in his homeland through literature. “I read a lot of modern Tibetan fiction... about people in the small towns of Tibet and their daily struggles.”Mr Jigme now moves about his phone, showing the nooks and corners of his cozy apartment. Books lie stacked against statues of Buddha. A thick mattress on the floor serves as his bed. A table is placed beside a long window covered in white curtains—the scene looks serene.“And that’s my country’s flag!”These days Mr Jigme is learning to write the Urdu Inquilab in Urdu script. “I came across it on YouTube. Inquilab denotes a struggle for freedom, and the conditions in my country is like India before 1947...” He goes on to talk of his inspirations, who include icons of India’s freedom struggle such as Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad.Smiling radiantly throughout the course of this chat, Mr Jigme appears to have an optimistic temperament. He is hopeful that the pandemic shall end sooner than later. And then he’ll be back doing what he loves most—“walking around the lanes of (Delhi’s Tibetan refugee enclave) Majnu ka Teela with my camera.”And obviously he will also meet his parents. “One day, yes, I’m sure,” he says, looking pleased. Perhaps visualising that distant prospect in his heart’s eye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-exiled-in-self-isolation/story-my8JpXlrwRf9IYa4y35YjM.html

11-04-2020||Lucknow||Coronavirus: UP Forest dept plans isolation enclosures at tiger sanctuaries after Bronx Zoo scare||The Uttar Pradesh Forest department has identified isolation enclosures and quarantine areas for wild cats in the two zoos, tiger reserves and sanctuaries in the state after reports of a tiger testing positive for coronavirus in New York’s Bronx zoo.Besides this, places have also been identified to set up quarantine facilities for the Forest department staff attending to the wildlife, in case of any requirement or emergency, Chief Conservator of Forests and Zoo Authority in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Dr Ramesh Pandey said.Following directives to maintain a state of highest alert and monitor wild cats and animals round the clock, almost half of the staff of the two zoos in Lucknow and Kanpur have been sent on leave to maintain social distancing and those attending to the animals asked to take all necessary precautions like using gloves, face masks and sanitisation before entering the cages, he said.“Soon after getting the news of a tiger in Bronx zoo in New York testing positive for the COVID-19, clear directives have been issued to the two zoos, tiger reserves and sanctuaries of the state, as per the guidelines of Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) Bareilly, to maintain highest alert for safeguarding the wildlife,” Pandey said.Special care has been taken to conduct regular health checks of the staff attending to the wild animals in the zoological gardens and those deployed in the areas falling along the path of movement of tigers, leopards or other endangered species in the forests, he added.Instructions are clear that staff complaining of normal cold, cough or fever are to be promptly removed as well. In the Katarniyaghat sanctuary, a place has already been earmarked to quarantine the departmental staff, Pandey said.Though animals have far better immunity than humans and there are far lesser chances of the spread of the virus among them, the state Forest Department is taking no chances after the New York incident and has initiated all steps necessary to ward off any problem, he said.Directives have been issued to take extra care in all the zoological gardens of the state, Pandey said, adding that roads, boards and railings were being sanitised regularly.Regular spraying of sodium hypochlorite as well as sprinkling of limestone powder and Vircon S is underway, he added.In the tiger reserves and sanctuaries, all security norms are being followed for sanitisation and detailed monitoring of the wildlife, Pandey said.Entry to all zoos, tiger reserves and sanctuaries are currently restricted.The Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Bahraich district and the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur district had been closed for tourists even before the lockdown was imposed.Arrangements have been made for round-the-clock monitoring of the areas with the help of CCTV cameras and staff, Pandey said.Thermal cameras installed in the tiger reserves and sanctuaries have been checked and activated. Instructions have been issued to install CCTV cameras in the cages and enclosures of the zoos and check those already in place, he said.The Central Zoo Authority of India and the National Tiger Conservation Authority have also issued instructions for the same, Pandey added.According to reports, a four-year-old Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York has tested positive for the coronavirus infection.The female tiger, named Nadia, is believed to be the first known case of an animal infected with COVID-19 in the US. It is suspected that she contracted the virus from a caretaker who was asymptomatic at that time.Besides two zoos, Uttar Pradesh has a lion safari and a national park, three tiger reserves and 14 wildlife sanctuaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/coronavirus-up-forest-dept-plans-isolation-enclosures-at-tiger-sanctuaries-after-bronx-zoo-scare/story-cOW2ng8F6CvRPaT6Vg6p8J.html

This graveyard may be used for the burial of Covid-19 victims,” the letter added.Ali mentioned that the letter has been issued with the approval of PR Secretary (Revenue) and in consultation with the members of Delhi Waqf Board.With 40 deaths and 1,035 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, India on Saturday witnessed the sharpest ever increase in coronavirus cases, taking the tally of the infected people in the country to 7,447, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-waqf-board-designates-graveyard-for-covid-19-victims/story-6tEdJsTW5IS2URKgT99L0J.html

11-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Experts say repeated screening must to pick asymptomatic coronavirus cases||With the UT health department starting screening of around 12 lakh population of the city to combat the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19), experts believe such an exercise will be successful only if “accompanied with testing” and “repeated”, as the first round is likely to leave out a large number of asymptomatic people.On Thursday, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the department to screen the population, and by Friday, 2.19 lakh people were screened by multipurpose health workers and samples of two people were taken for testing.However, Dr Digamber Behra, senior pulmonologist from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said, “This practice is called active case finding, which is done in hotspots. Provided the UT health department has enough manpower to screen every house, there is a good possibility that more number of positive cases will be detected.”However, screening has its own limitations, Dr Behra said. “Firstly, it is highly likely that some people will not reveal the truth regarding their symptoms. Secondly, there will be those who are asymptomatic, unaware of carrying the infection. So to detect such cases, it is important to do repeated screening.”An epidemiologist from PGIMER, wishing not to be named, said, “The screening will only serve the purpose if those with symptoms are tested. As the incubation period of the infection is 14 days, the exercise must be repeated to make it a success.”UT home-cum-health secretary Arun Gupta said, “Around 50 teams of multi-purpose health workers screened over two lakh people. Out of these, some who showed mild symptoms were screened by doctors and two fit the criteria for testing. The report of one is negative and that of the other is awaited.”Gupta said, “We cannot take samples of everyone with mild symptoms, as they do not fit the criteria set by the central government.”MAX HOSPITAL GETS NOD TO COLLECT SAMPLES  Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan on Friday granted permission to Max Super Specialty Hospital, Phase 6, to collect samples for Covid-19 testing, making it the first such facility in the district. Dayalan said the management of the hospital has been told to comply with the directions issued by the Punjab government and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in this regard. The hospital will collect samples and send them to Max Super Specialty Hospital, Smart, New Delhi, for testing as per government guidelines at rates as fixed by the ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-experts-say-repeated-screening-must-to-pick-asymptomatic-coronavirus-cases/story-cfwCMWVR2BLZd4D7ORrcQM.html
11-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s arrest move: Homemade masks in focus||A day after UT’s decision to arrest people not wearing face masks to stave off Covid-19, health experts, including those from the PGIMER, apprehending panic buying of medical-grade masks, have asked people to go for homemade cloth masks. Notably, UT adviser Manoj Parida in a tweet on Wednesday suggested that cloth masks were least effective in containing the virus while Punjab CM Amarinder Singh tweeted on Thursday that a piece of clean cloth was all that one required to stay safe. However, medical experts whom HT contacted on Friday say that cloth masks may not be fully protective but offer a certain degree of safety from the coronavirus to relatively healthier persons, provided that it is properly used.Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) director Dr Jagat Ram said that surgical or N-95 masks should better be left for frontline health workers as they are more exposed to the risk than healthy persons staying in a safe environment. It is advisable that the latter make masks at home, preferably with cotton fabric and use it properly, he said. “Medical-grade masks are already scarce, forcing our health workers to use homemade masks who are repeatedly exposed to the virus greatly,” Ram said.Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor, environmental health, School of Public Health, PGIMER, too said that homemade masks protect the wearer from unknowingly spreading the virus to others. “The masks are useful when several people who have Covid-19 are showing no symptoms. Any face covering is better than nothing,” he added.What government advisories say?A document issued by the office of the principal scientific adviser to the Government of India on April 3 said that although social distancing and personal hygiene are key to prevent Covid-19 infections, certain countries have claimed benefits of homemade face covers for the general public. But this face cover is not recommended for either health workers or Covid-19 patients.“A normal healthy person must make two sets of homemade face covers so that one can be washed while the other is in use... Such face covers should also not be thrown anywhere but kept safely, washed properly with soap and hot water and dried properly before they are used everyday,” it added.US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends two layers of tightly woven 100 percent cotton fabric, such as bedsheets with a high thread count to increase the protection level of homemade masks.Box: USE IT RIGHTThe mask should be made out of clean cloth available at homeWash the fabric well and dry it well before making the face coverIt must cover mouth and noseEach member in family should have a separate face coverBefore reuse, wash the face cover in soap and warm water and leave it to dry in hot sunSuch face covers should also not be thrown anywhere but kept safelyFollow the link (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Advisory&ManualonuseofHomemadeProtectiveCoverforFace&Mouth.pdf) to know how to stitch homemade masks(Source: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-arrest-move-homemade-masks-in-focus/story-Ky85UyB7tiGXtfK4K261UI.html
11-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Chandigarh admn to hike pay of frontline health workers||The UT administration will increase the salaries of the frontline health workers as a token of gratitude for their service amid the coronavirus pandemic.The move comes a day after the Haryana government announced to pay double salary to doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and others at the forefront of the fight against coronavirus.Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said, “We will be writing to the central government for considering an increase in the pay of the frontline health workers in the city.”The quantum of the pay increase, Parida said, is yet to be finalised.Chandigarh has so far recorded 19 positive cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Recently, an insurance cover of ₹50 lakh was also given to Chandigarh’s health workers involved in handling of Covid-19 cases at the PGIMER and GMCH-32, in case of loss of life due to the infection. APPRAISALS FOR UT EMPLOYEES TO WAITMeanwhile, the UT administration extended the last date for filing of appraisal by UT employees by three months. Due to the lockdown imposed in the city in the wake of coronavirus outbreak, the administration has decided to revise the timelines for writing the annual performance appraisal report (APAR) online (through e-HRMS Manav Sampada Portal) of Group A, B and C officials for the year 2019-2020, as a one-time measure.The cadre controlling authority will generate APAR form online for the reporting officer by June 1 and the official will submit the form online to the reporting officer by June 30. Earlier this date was April 10. The reporting authority will have to submit APAR to the next higher authority by July 31.

The accused has been identified as Agrim, who is in his mid-30s. Police said Surjewala has a house in Kaithal and the accused lives near his house there.Sector 5 station house officer inspector Lalit Kumar said that Surjewala submitted a complaint online stating that the caller, claiming to be from a gang in Uttar Pradesh, threatened to kill him and his cousin Sudeep.The SHO said Surjewala received three calls between 9.50am to 10.15am on his landline on April 1. “The caller identified himself as a member of a gang headed by Mukhtar Ansari, Raja Bhaiya and Pappu Yadav from Uttar Pradesh. He threatened to kill my cousin Sudeep Surjewala and me and disconnected the call. He called a minute later and said that he knew where I lived, had complete details of where I go and my vehicles. He called again, extended the same threat, and identified himself as Agrim,” the complaint stated.The Sector 19 crime branch team of Panchkula then started investigating the matter. Officials privy to the investigation said the mobile number from which calls were made was traced to Kaithal and the caller was arrested. A case has been registered under Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 5 police station.

11-04-2020||Mumbai||Maha records over 200 cases for a second day; toll is 110||Maharashtra recorded more than 200 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for a second consecutive day on Friday, with 210 new infections taking the state’s tally to 1,574. The state had reported 229 cases, highest in a single day, on Thursday. The death toll, too, rose by 13 to 110 on Friday. The number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra has recorded a 147.8% jump since April 4 – a week – when there were 635 infections. Mumbai has also seen a spike of 167% (377 to 1,008) in the number of cases during the same period. State health department officials attributed the rise in cases to more testing across the state, especially in Mumbai. “We are not waiting for people to come forward… we track contacts of infected persons and those in containment zones and test them. Private laboratories have been given permission to test too. The rise in figures is because there is more testing,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.Maharashtra, as per the health department data, has conducted 33,093 tests so far – the highest in India. However, with the number of cases rising rapidly, the state government is mulling extending the lockdown in urban areas, while it may ease a few restrictions in rural areas, especially at locations where there are not many cases. A decision on this is expected on Saturday, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference meeting with chief ministers of all states.State health minister Rajesh Tope had earlier indicated that the situation “would not come back to normal after the 21-day lockdown ends on April 14”. Senior Mantralaya officials, on condition of anonymity, said the government is looking at various options, including keeping Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad – the areas with most of cases – under lockdown, while relaxing restrictions in other parts of the state. However, movement of people between districts and curb on transportation is likely to continue, said the officials. The government has also decided to use technology to carry out “surveillance and sanitisation” in Mumbai, which is the worst-hit in state. Tope said drones will be used by Mumbai Police for “effective” implementation of the lockdown in densely populated areas and by the civic body to spray disinfectants in Dharavi. “The number of cases in Mumbai is increasing and it is a cause of concern. However, the state government is implementing measures under the containment survey action plan,” Tope said, in a statement, adding that the state would deploy State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) in densely populated areas and near containment zones. “The rise in the number of cases in Mumbai is worrying. Therefore to reduce crowding in densely populated areas, SRPF will be deployed. A request has already been made to the home department. Reducing crowding in areas is crucial. The control room will monitor [crowding] through CCTVs, and drones will be used for surveillance in these areas. Drones will also be used to spray disinfectants by the BMC in Dharavi. We have also asked BMC to increase sanitisation in public toilets in Dharavi.”The minister also held a meeting with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan via video conferencing on Friday and sought quicker standardisation for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, so that its manufacturing can begin. The state sought additional testing facilities in five cities – Nanded, Aurangabad, Jalna, Latur and Amravati.Tope said the state has 3.25 lakh PPE kits, 8.25 lakh N95 masks, 2125 ventilators, but it needs more such equipment. “Maharashtra has five to six manufacturers, but the standardisation has to come from the Centre. The chief minister has already written to Government of India seeking a timeframe to provide additional PPE, masks and ventilators,” he said. State health department officials said that chief minister Thackeray would take up the issue with the Prime Minister during the meeting on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-records-over-200-cases-for-a-second-day-toll-is-110/story-I9CRUUwwh3XRbatGESZLOJ.html
11-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records 1,008 coronavirus cases, 64 Covid-19 deaths in a month||A month since the first infection of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was reported in Mumbai, the city’s case count crossed the 1,000-mark on Friday. Mumbai reported 132 new cases and 10 deaths on Friday, taking its tally to 1,008 and toll to 64. Mumbai breached the 100-patient mark on March 31, almost three weeks after an Andheri couple were identified as the first to be infected by the disease in the city. On April 2, the city’s tally crossed 200 and since then cases have tripled in the past week.Follow live updates on coronvirus The number of fatalities, too, have spiked in the past four days, with the city reporting 24 deaths. The first Covid-19 death in Mumbai was recorded on March 17, when a 64-year-old man succumbed to the infection at Kasturba Hospital. The G South ward, which comprises areas of Worli and Prabhadevi, has been the worst-hit in Mumbai with 199 cases. E ward (Byculla, Mazagaon) has 69 cases, followed by D ward (Malabar Hill, Grant Road) that has 61 cases.For complete coverage of coronavirus crisis, click hereBrihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Praveen Pardeshi said rise in the number of cases was directly proportional to the number of tests being conducted in the city. “High level of testing is our weapon. It’s through testing that we have identified many positive cases at an early stage, thereby, reducing the chances of community transmission. We are tracing more and more cases before the 14-day cycle of the virus, so that the numbers don’t grow and emerge as community spread,” said Pardeshi.Also Read: Covid-19 cases near 2,000 in Maharashtra, cross 900 in Delhi and Tamil Nadu: A statewise tallyTo increase testing, the BMC has given temporary permission to Suburban Diagnostics, a private laboratory, to set up Covid-19 testing booths at public parking lots.The civic body has also decided to procure 50,000 rapid testing kits, which will help it deal with the outbreak in densely populated areas. “This antibody test will be made available in the next three-four days,” said a senior officer from the civic health department.However, medical experts said instead of high level of testing, the government should opt for random community testing. “It is necessary to do testing on a large scale, but it is not enough. In addition to that the government should go for random testing in an area such as Dharavi and Worli to get information about community spread of virus,” said Dr Shashikant Ahankari, a community health specialist, and president of Halo Medical Foundation. Meanwhile, on Friday, six more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Dharavi, taking the total cases in India’s largest slum to 28, a BMC official said. The state health department, however, was yet to confirm these cases. Two of the six, who tested positive, had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat event held in Delhi. “One of them is from Dr Baliga Nagar and the other one from PMGP Colony. We have already started tracing their high risk contacts,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North Ward.Two nurses, aged 27 years and 42 years, of Dadar’s Shushrusha Hospital, too, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, after which authorities asked the hospital to stop taking in new patients. The BMC asked the hospital to quarantine around 28 nurses.With inputs from Sagar Pillai||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-008-cases-of-coronavirus-in-maharashtra-64-deaths-in-mumbai-in-a-month/story-OcScJUXwTR5jzr5tQ9iWBP.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Fear, concern at South Delhi’s residential hub of doctors||Thirty-two-year-old Sushil Kumar rubs clean the last orange from his bag and places it on top to pinnacle his pyramid of oranges. Finally looking up after completing this elaborate exercise, Kumar tends to a group of customers waiting patiently for him to dole out their orders.Despite the national capital’s lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19, the lanes of South Delhi’s Gautam Nagar are busy with people going out to buy medicines, fruits, vegetables and basic groceries. Some are seen just walking around with large bags over their shoulders.“Many doctors and nurses live here. They are either coming back from their duties or going to them. This place is usually bustling with activity despite movement restrictions,” said Kumar, adjusting his face mask.With central government hospitals such as Safdarjung and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) just a kilometre away, Gautam Nagar, a middle-class neighbourhood adjacent to several posh south Delhi neighbourhoods, has become a hub of young doctors and nurses looking for cheap housing near their workplace.Residents say house owners have been renting out to healthcare professionals for years now. However, over the last two days, many medicos living in the area have been gripped with fear. Videos of two doctors narrating their horrors of being roughed up by a local while they were out buying oranges, has been circulating all over. In hospital groups, doctors residing in these areas have been asked to “lay low” and “not engage with the general public”.“We are out there risking our lives to save people and when we come home, this is what we have to face?” said Sheeba Panamketty, a junior resident at Safdarjung Hospital, who lives in Gautam Nagar with four other doctors.While Panamketty voices her fear, the owner of a grocery shop where she has placed an order for two water cans, clarifies that the incident with the doctors took place at the neighbouring Gulmohar Enclave.Carefully maintaining distance while talking, Panamketty says, “The shift timings are so erratic that we have no other option but to shop for essential items whenever we find the time. We do everything we can to ensure our own safety and of the people around us.”Other healthcare professionals living nearby too say that they do feel threatened since the attack on the two doctors at the marketplace. “There is confusion among the general public that any doctor nearby is on the Covid-19 team, which is not the case. Besides, there is anxiety among people here, which is understandable, but it’s equally difficult for us,” said Akanksha Nidhi, a doctor who lives here.Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti, employed with a private medical facility and a resident of Gautam Nagar, said that people by and large do have apprehensions about living in the same neighbourhood as those from the medical fraternity at this time, as the latter has a greater degree of exposure to the contagious Sars-Cov-2. “This has emerged as a common sentiment, that people look at doctors with a suspicion of being infected. While some hospitals are planning for make-shift arrangements for their Covid-19 teams within the hospital compound or at a place nearby, proper facilities are required for an extended stay to ensure the medical personnel don’t have to come back home during this period,” said Bhatti.Dhriti Singla, a resident of the area, said the hospital administration or the government should provide doctors with alternative accommodation until the Covid-19 outbreak is brought under control. “We are not against doctors; they are doing a great job by saving so many lives in the time of this pandemic. However, there is a fear that the community could suffer. There are old people and children living here,” she said.Amid uncertainty on both sides, the administration is trying to assure residents of their safety while they stay at home during the lockdown, in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said the area is being patrolled intensively and announcements are being made urging people to not panic or take the law in their hands in any situation. “We are urging people to maintain social distancing norms and will ensure strict action against anyone breaching the rules of the lockdown,” the DCP said. The municipal body is also ensuring that residents are at peace with each other. Anil Kumar Sharma, a local councillor, said the incident of violence against the doctors was a “one-off” case. “This colony’s main income is rent from tenants, many of whom are medical professionals. Why would anyone want to upset their tenants and ruin their income? This area is safe; women can walk in and out without fear at any time of the night. We assure them (doctors) that we will keep them safe while they fight for everyone’s safety,” Sharma said.While many shop owners, especially after Wednesday’s incident, have been supportive and are ensuring that essential items reach the doorsteps of medical professionals living here, there are some who are hesitant about living in close proximity with healthcare professionals who are at a greater risk of contracting the virus.“Doctors in our society are treated like gods. I have told all my delivery agents to ensure that orders from medical professionals are delivered on priority. We are all with them in fighting this pandemic,” said Manohar Lal, the owner of a grocery store in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fear-concern-in-south-delhi-s-gautam-nagar-a-residential-hub-of-medicos/story-KTnR4t0p0WKa0JRPz5pkZM.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Drones drive surveillance in Delhi’s containment zones||As a drone hovered over a narrow lane in east Delhi’s Dilshad Garden, a group of men loitering the lanes ran inside their houses, while those standing outside a ration shop quickly queued up ensuring adequate distance among one another.Parts of Dilshad Garden, one of the first coronavirus (Covid-19) hot spots in the country, have been sealed to contain the spread of the pandemic.From chasing violators of the prohibitory orders, enforcing social distancing on the roads and spraying disinfectants, the city police and civic agencies have adopted drones as an extension of their forces.The world has taken a cue from China’s use of drones for surveys and deliveries, and agricultural drones for a variety of purposes during the Covid-19 pandemic, as early as February 2020. Several European and central Asian countries, such as France, Italy and Kazakhstan have since modified drones to remotely identify lockdown violators in crowded areas and also installed public announcement (PA) systems on drones. In India, Madhya Pradesh’s Indore was among the first to use drones to spray disinfectant, followed by Hyderabad and Bengaluru.In central Delhi’s Karol Bagh, civic officials were busy filling a drone with disinfectant to conduct an “aerial spray”, as the corporation’s large 3,000-litre tankers could not easily be manoeuvred in the narrow by-lanes.Officials of the Delhi Police and civic agencies say the drones are a success.The deputy commissioner of police, Shahdara, Dinesh Gupta, said that drones come in handy at locations with high population density, where keeping a watch on residents is not easy.“At present, there are at least 12 coronavirus positive cases from my area. Because it is a sensitive area, with five containment zones (two in Dilshad Garden and one each in GTB Enclave, Dilshad Colony and Vivek Vihar), at least 12 people had to be prosecuted for violating the lockdown in the last five days, due to which we started surveillance using drones. We have three drones that cover these five areas. We are also using the drones to make public announcements,” Gupta said.He said because congested and densely populated areas like Seemapuri and Shahdara also come under his jurisdiction, keeping a watch on residents in every lane isn’t an easy task. “This is where our drones take charge. We have seen that the moment a drone takes flight, people start returning to their houses. Those who are sitting on terraces get inside, people at shops start maintaining a queue at an adequate distance and those loitering also hurry indoors. ,” Gupta said.Police are using drones extensively to watch at ration shops, banks and religious places in every subdivision, where people gather.Deputy commissioner of police, central, Sanjay Bhatia, who is using a drone to keep a vigil on dense pockets of Daryaganj, Chawri Bazar, Chandi Mahal, Karol Bagh, Rajindra Nagar, Paharganj and Kamla Market, said that they have not prosecuted anyone, based on drone surveillance, but detain 100-150 people every day.“Our police teams accompany the drone handler, who is a civilian, for his security. Once the drone captures a violation, we either take a screenshot and alert local staff or immediately rush our Covid Bike Patrol squad to the spot. Those caught out on the streets are sent home with a warning, after proper verification. Roughly, since Day one, we have detained more than 2,000 violators,” Bhatia said.Even in south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar, one of Delhi’s largest unauthorised colonies, where lane number 5, 6 and 7 in block L1 have been declared as one of the two containment zones in south Delhi, police are detaining at least 200-300 lockdown violators every day. “On Thursday, we detained more than 200 violators who were caught in our drone cameras. Since Day one of the lockdown, we have detained at least 3,000 violators in Sangam Vihar alone. Roughly, around the same number of people were caught in Hauz Rani, the second containment zone. The number of detainees who were caught solely with the help of a drone is much higher for the entire district. Action under the DP Act, IPC sections and DM Act is ensured against the violators,” Thakur said.Flying drones is prohibited in Delhi because of security risks. Only government agencies are allowed to use it. “Initially, some of our officers complained that children threw stones. But now, everyone knows that if the flying objects is used by the government,” a police official said.The police and civic agencies used the drones in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, another containment zone. A six-storey building in the area, the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, has emerged as the largest Covid -19 hot spot, with cases from across India being traced back to gatherings at the Markaz. While Nizamuddin Basti and Nizamuddin West have been cordoned off by the police, the civic agency is continuing its work of aerially spraying disinfectants.“The solution (1% Sodium Hypochlorite in water) is strong enough to emulsify the lipid (fatty) outer layer of the coronavirus, which is 900 times smaller than the width of human hair, through its soap-like action. However, it’s too weak to harm humans,” said Dr Deepak Mittal, deputy health officer (DHO) with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).Dr Ashok Rawat, municipal health officer (MHO) of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that using drones for aerial spraying is better because the nozzle of the drone turns it into mist form, due to which no significant quantity of the liquid falls on any one person. “It will only effectively sanitise the air and kill any coronavirus particles on surfaces like tin sheds, doors and walls.”The private company that has lent its drones to the north civic body said these were originally ‘agricultural application drones’ used to spray pesticide on crops. Prashant Pillai, co-founder of the Indian Robotics Solution Pvt. Ltd, said, “There are few food crops like sugarcane, which go up to 20 feet in height. Spraying pesticide on them manually is not possible. That’s where these drones, with carrier boxes of up to 10 litres capacity, help. In the Covid-19 scenario, China first modified these drones to carry disinfectants, followed by South Korea and then other countries.”Explaining how the civic agency used drones in Nizamuddin, the SDMC’s leader of the house, Kamaljeet Sehrawat, said, “We were under tremendous pressure to sanitise the entire area in a short span of time. Besides, many by-lanes of the Nizamuddin Basti are narrow and our large tankers could not enter. We have deployed hundreds of backpack sprayers; but for them to do it manually, it would have taken ages. That’s why we went for drones.”Ujjawal Kumar Mishra, who works for Idea Forge Tech Pvt Ltd, which helps Delhi Police operate drones, said that when fully charged, a drone can fly for up to 30 to 40 minutes on one battery. “We keep spare batteries depending on the duration it is needed for. From one spot, we can cover up to 800 metres in high-definition, and drones can reach a height of 400 metres. We use cameras with 10x optical feature, through which we can zoom from one spot and capture high definition images without lowering the drone.”Delhi Police said that while they are currently hiring drones, they plan to buy the machines and train personnel as handlers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/eye-in-the-sky-drones-drive-surveillance-in-delhi-s-containment-zones/story-uD2n3ZLLmgNRabOEEMHo8M.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||SDMC councillor’s husband booked for ‘misleading’ police, man claims political conspiracy||The police on Friday booked south corporation councillor Santosh Shokeen’s husband, saying that despite being tested positive for Covid-19 and infecting two family members (including the councillor) , he misled authorities about having visited the cheadquarters in Nizamuddin last month. The man, Sukhbir Shokeen has denied the claims, and labelled the charges a “political conspiracy”. He tested positive for Covid-19 on April 1.A case under the Epidemic Diseases Act and sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against him at Chhawla police station. Santosh Shokeen is the South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s councillor from Nangli Sakrawati municipal ward.The six-storey headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat has emerged as the biggest hot spot for Covid-19 across the country, after a March congregation attended by hundreds of foreigners (some infected) and a few thousand Indians has been identified as the source of several infections around the country.Shokeen’s family lives in Deenpur village, which is among the 23 areas in the city that have been declared “containment zones” by the Delhi government after cases of the contagious virus surfaced in those neighbourhoods.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said the village was declared a containment zone after Shokeen and two of his family members were tested positive for Covid-19. A kilometre-wide radius around the village has been sealed completely.“The man (Shokeen) was placed in home quarantine by health authorities around two weeks ago. He was not home when a physical verification of people in home quarantine was being carried out. When questioned later, he hid the facts about his past travel and movements,” read a statement released by the Delhi Police on Friday. A police officer said that after Shokeen’s medical tests confirmed he had Covid-19, he was shifted to a hospital. Later, two of his family members also tested positive. Since the health and police authorities were not able to ascertain how the man got infected with the disease, his cellphone’s call detail records were analysed, and the location data tracked, the officer said.“The technical investigation confirmed his visit to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin. But the man withheld this fact during the repeated medical and police enquiries,” Alphonse said.However, inn a phone call with Hindustan Times, Sukhbir Shokeen — who is being treated at Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini — claimed he has never visited the Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters at Nizamuddin.“I’m a practising Hindu. I have no connection with the Markaz and I have never been there. It is a political conspiracy as my wife is the only Congress councillor from among the 25 municipal wards in Najafgarh zone. I’m being framed.”Shokeen said he has been distributing food and essential items to needy people in his ward, ever since the lockdown. “I have been travelling to different areas. I could have contracted the infection from anywhere. I got my test done from a private laboratory, and got admitted to the hospital on April 1 after testing positive. My wife and daughter have also tested positive and are recovering in hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-councillor-s-husband-booked-for-misleading-police-man-claims-political-conspiracy/story-qJcmg2bd0CmoMD9TyvZuYI.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus: Operation SHIELD a success as Dilshad Garden now declared Covid-free||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said east Delhi’s Dilshad Garden is “coronavirus free”, with no new cases reported in the last 10 days from the area, which he said was due to measures taken under the government’s ‘Operation SHIELD’. Dilshad Garden, which emerged as one of the hot spots for the coronavirus disease in the national Capital, was declared a containment zone on April 8. The government’s medical teams screened the entire area under Operation SHIELD (Sealing, Home quarantine, Isolation, Essential supplies, Local sanitation and disinfection, and Door-to-door checking) — a strategy of contact tracing to contain the spread of Covid-19, announced by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. Jain said, “Under Operation SHIELD, 123 medical teams screened more than 15,000 people living in 4,032 houses. Thousands of people were quarantined and tests were done. The hard work of the health officials and the successful implementation of the Operation SHIELD have made Dilshad Garden coronavirus free.”Dr SK Nayak, a district administration officer in Shahdara, said: “By working round-the-clock in the last 15 days, Operation SHIELD has been successful at Dilshad Garden. Not a single positive case has come from the area in more than 10 days from the area.”Dilshad Garden, which was declared one of the first 10 Covid-19 hot spots in the country, saw a spike in coronavirus cases after a 38-year-old woman tested positive. Five of those she had come in contact with, including a mohalla clinic doctor, subsequently tested positive. “I feared a massive Covid-19 outbreak in the Dilshad Garden area after seven people were found positive. It was transmitted from the woman who had returned from Saudi Arabia and was found Covid-19 positive. Thereafter, chief minister Kejriwal instructed to implement Operation SHIELD at Dilshad Garden. It was the first such implementation,” said Jain. In a massive exercise, 81 people who had come in contact with the woman were traced in the area and quarantined. The woman’s son, two daughters and mother had also tested positive. The Delhi government took the help of CCTV cameras to find out the movement of her son and traced the places or the people he visited, said a Delhi health department official.“When the woman tested positive, we rushed to her residence to ask her family for names and addresses of the people who had visited them since March 10, the date of her return from Dubai. Her son was not very cooperative, so we had to seek the help of the local police to get information. We also used footage from the CCTV cameras installed near their home to identify those who needed to be put under surveillance,” said Dr Nayak. While strict enforcement measures have been in place since March 18, when the woman tested positive, the area was declared a containment zone only on April 8, along with 22 other locations. The state government, with the help of the Delhi Police, had imposed a curfew in Dilshad Garden and Old Seemapuri, said the senior official. The whole area was sealed, along with Old Seemapuri, after a Mohalla clinic doctor tested positive. “The state government is still tracking the people of the area and if there are symptoms then they are being quarantined. The Delhi government will also initiate random testing of the residents soon,” said Dr Nayak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/operation-shield-a-success-as-dilshad-garden-a-hot-spot-now-declared-coronavirus-free/story-8Gwr0MrHciIBtAQqMIF1GM.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||Coronavirus in Delhi: Govt sets up buffer zones around 19 sealed pockets of the city||After naming 30 areas as containment zones and sealing them, the Delhi administration has set up buffer zones in 19 of these to prevent transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), senior government officials said Friday.Buffer zones are geographical areas immediately surrounding containment zones, as described by the Union health ministry in a document — Containment Plan for Large Outbreaks — released earlier this week.Officials said it is not necessary to set up buffer zones around four apartments and gated colonies — three in east Delhi and one in south-west Delhi.Work on demarcating buffer zones in the seven additional areas notified on Friday was ongoing and will be announced soon, the officials said.The buffer zones will also be under constant surveillance, with residents being directed to maintain a strict quarantine. Even business establishments dealing in essential goods and services have been advised to stagger their timings in these zones.The modalities of setting up such zones were discussed in a meeting chaired by Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Thursday. In the blueprint sent to the chief minister’s office, seen by HT, the periphery of each containment zone is marked in red, while that of the buffer zones is marked in purple.The containment zones comprise apartment blocks, gated communities, slums, streets, even entire neighbourhoods. “Similarly, every buffer zone is different in its own way. It can range from a few adjoining lanes and roads to few adjoining buildings and shanties,” a district magistrate who did not wish to be identified said.Tanvi Garg, district magistrate (New Delhi), who has two containment zones under her jurisdiction, said: “Buffer zones are created for enhancing enforcement of surveillance and quarantine norms in the core containment zones. They are an essential part of the policy.”“The size, perimeter and other specifics of buffer zones depend on the core containment zones in question, in terms of its population density, the scale of the outbreak and potential rate of transmission,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate (South Delhi), who has two containment zones under his jurisdiction.Rahul Singh, district magistrate (South-West Delhi), who has two containment zones under his jurisdiction, said: “The basic idea is to create a graded progression between the normal lockdown, which is in place, and stricter containment policy. Health officials are playing a major role in the demarcation of these zones.”In terms of enforcement of surveillance, sanitation and other measures, a buffer zone is a semi-quarantine zone, a senior government official said.Another official said that similar to containment zones, all roads and lanes connecting the buffer zones with arterial roads are blocked by the police. These areas are disinfected but at longer intervals compared to the containment zonesNobody other than residents, the police, health officials, sanitation workers and essential goods and services providers are legally allowed to cross the barricades.Those delivering essentials have to wait at the last barricade, and are not allowed to venture further.Unlike containment zones, residents in buffer zones can step out of their homes wearing face masks, but might be questioned by police, who will patrol the areas around the clock and also be deployed in temporary pickets. So far, there are no door-to-door drives being conducted by health workers in the buffer zones, to check residents’ health for flu-like symptoms but this exercise is soon likely to be added in the protocol, the official added.In containment zones, all shops are closed and essentials, including medicines, are procured through orders routed though appointed community leaders and residents’ welfare association office-bearers. These are delivered to common collection points by health workers and sanitation workers.In buffer zones, shops dealing in essentials — medicines, milk, fruits, vegetables and groceries — are open but have been subjected to staggered timings. Police and government officials personally monitor social distancing norms outside these shops, when open, the official said.According to Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department at Safdarjung Hospital, creating buffer zones around containment zones is a conventional policy approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) years ago. “It is a welcome move. In India, it was successfully implemented to prevent cases of H1N1 and Zika viruses.” While some RWAs said that they were briefed by the district administration in the last 48 hours about the buffer zones, others said that they are still awaiting clear instructions.“Proper briefings were conducted by the subdivisional magistrates (SDMs). It is a good move. Safety comes first. After the briefings, pamphlets with contact details of RWA members are being published and distributed in the buffer zones. This has already been done in the containment zones,” said BS Vohra, president of the Joint Front RWA in East Delhi, where there are nine containment zones, the most in the city.KC Rana, general secretary of Khirki village, which is a buffer zone, said, “It is a welcome move, but we are awaiting a briefing. We have been getting a lot of calls from anxious neighbours and there is panic shopping happening. That has to be controlled.”Five sub divisional magistrates individually confirmed that briefings in the containment zones are almost done and are likely to be completed in buffer zones by Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-sets-up-buffer-zones-around-19-sealed-pockets-of-the-city/story-ObOzSk9SKpe755v64ZQejJ.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: Three test positive, one dies at ‘hotspot’ Delhi State Cancer Institute||The Delhi government-run cancer hospital – the Delhi State Cancer Institute – has emerged as one of the hot spots of Covid-19 with 22 healthcare workers and three patients testing positive for the infection. One of the three patients who tested positive for Covid-19 late Thursday night succumbed on Friday afternoon.The hospital had shut its out-patient clinic after one of its doctors – a 35-year-old senior resident – tested positive for the infection on March 31. When three of the 19 staff members who had come in contact with the doctor also tested positive, the hospital decided to move around 48 of its patients to other facilities.“We were waiting for the test results of the patients before moving them to other facilities. Three of the 19 patients we tested turned out to be positive. One person died. Now, we have asked all our staff members to get tested,” said Dr Ravinder Singh, Joint Director, Delhi State Cancer Institute.So far, at least 40 hospital staff from the city have tested positive for the disease.Accidental exposure to patients who later developed symptoms has resulted in around 130 staff members being quarantined at Max Hospital, Saket. “All of them tested negative and will soon be out of quarantine and ready to join back,” said a hospital personnel. Another 114 people have been quarantined and two have tested positive at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Around 81 staff members are under quarantine from Maharaja Agrasen hospital, against which action was initiated for not following protocols.Around 60 to 70 of the staff members from the DSCI have been tested so far. The 100-bed hospital has already been sanitised twice and will again be sanitised on Saturday. “However, the hospital will not start working immediately; not until all authorities agree that there is no chance of people getting infected. The hospital treats cancer patients, who are all immuno-compromised and are likely to get severe infection,” according to an official from the hospital. Teams from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme are still looking for a source of the spread of the infection. Two family members of the first doctor to have tested positive had visited him in February. However they have not tested positive for the infection.“The authorities are doing detailed contact-tracing to see how the infection came to the hospital. We are looking at whether the staff had some get-togethers or cultural gathering,” according to a hospital personnel. On Friday, Delhi recorded the highest number of cases in a day -- 183 -- taking the total to 903. Two deaths were reported -- one of an 80-year-old man from Daryaganj admitted to Venkateshwara hospital in Dwarka. He had chronic kidney disease and was undergoing dialysis when he had a cardiac arrest. His sample tested positive on Thursday when he died.Details of the other death are awaited. The Delhi State Cancer Institute death is likely to be added to Delhi’s toll on Saturday.“The death is added after proper review and it will likely be added only by tomorrow only after all details are received,” said an official from Delhi’s health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-test-positive-one-dies-at-hotspot-delhi-state-cancer-institute/story-caCHoRGkwNkTMCTeCgN2cP.html
11-04-2020||Delhi||In Delhi, the faithful ‘worship from home’ this Good Friday and Easter||In preparation for the Good Friday and Easter Sunday in the time of lockdown, Reverend Prateek Pillai of the St James’s Church in Kashmere Gate, the oldest in Delhi, took inspiration from the life of Jesus Christ.“Jesus had his Last Supper indoors, together with his disciples with whom he shared bread,” Pillai said. “So, this year, we, too, encouraged our laity to observe Good Friday at home with their families. With so much talk of “work from home” happening, we told our congregation to “worship from home” this time.”One of the most sacred days of the Christian calendar, the Good Friday, or the day Christ was crucified, was observed across homes in the national capital and suburban towns. The occasion was made even more sombre for the over 2 billion followers of Christ as the world reels under the Covid-19 pandemic. Churches adhered to all instructions from the government, their diocese and, in the case of Catholics , the Vatican.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEver since the Delhi government had banned the congregation of people in the city for any purpose, churches had informed their members of timings when sermons, services and mass will be broadcast online so that the faithful could virtually be a part of the service.But for Leelamma Mathew, 52, of west Delhi’s Janakpuri, who had not missed a single Good Friday service at church till now, says the virtual experience was “not to her liking”.Mathew’s daughter had helped her tune in to their local church’s service over phone. “But the church gave us a feeling of being in the presence of the lord,” she said. “Normally, it is also the time that we would break the fast by receiving the Holy Communion followed by some gruel. This time, we had to make do with whatever we had prepared at home.”Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHer feelings were echoed by others as well. “Due to the lockdown, we are stuck at home,” said Amol Benny, a resident of Noida. “Other times, we would meet our relatives and have food together. This time, it was in front of the TV with family.”Ceremonies during the Holy Week were cut short, as several of the rituals such as the washing of the feet, the Holy Communion and touching of the cross would have required violating social distancing norms.For priests too, the experience was a novel one, not to mention a lonely one.“Several priests, including myself, had gone to the church to officiate the mass,” Father Christopher of the Rosary Church at Kingsway Camp said. “It was surreal to do it before empty pews.” “For those who did not have access to the live streaming of the Good Friday service, we sent out PDF files in advance, so that they could get them printed and hold the Good Friday service at home,” Reverend Pillai said.On Easter Sunday, which will also mark the culmination of the Holy Week, Catholics across the globe will tune in to listen to Pope Francis, who will lead the virtual prayers. In India, where the Easter prayers would have been completed by then, watching the Pope on TV would give many strength during this difficult time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/the-faithful-worship-from-home-this-good-friday-and-easter/story-22Mi3AEZthVMTFYwzX6BgO.html
11-04-2020||Gurugram||Smart City centre turned into Covid-19 war room||The Gurugram police has started using the Integrated Control And Command Centre (I-CCC)—developed by the GMDA under the smart cities mission so that technology could be used for more efficient management of utilities—as a designated war room for Covid-19 surveillance, monitoring the movement of people and supplies, its distribution, and maintaining law and order, the police said.Through the 350 closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs), the police are keeping an eye on vehicular movement and gathering of people at sensitive locations, including some containment zones. The district has nine containment zones. All containment zones are not connected to the I-CCC as cameras were yet to be installed, the police said.The I-CCC is mainly being used to ensure social distancing in crowded areas such as Chakkarpur, Jharsa, Nathupur, Sadar market, Sohna Road, Wazirabad, Khanda Mandi, Mohammadpur Jharsa and places with higher population density.The war room is also being used for tracking people under quarantine and suspected cases, said police. The teams are also coordinating with the district administration and health teams for doing real-time tracking of ambulances and disinfection services. “We are using wireless phones to pass on messages. A daily record is maintained which is sent to the commissioner of police. We are also checking of anyone is misusing the passes issued and loitering,” said Chander Mohan, DCP (East) who is also the chief executive officer, mobility. Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said another prime focus of the centre is to track the movement of food supply and to check if it is being delivered at the right places. “Our call centre (100, 112, 0124-2316100, 1091 and 1098) is operational and most of the calls we receive are for supply of food and ration. We are taking serious note of all calls and a rescue team is being sent to the spot from where the call is received. Many people in distress are reaching out to these helplines to check the symptoms of coronavirus,” he said. The I-CCC also helps monitor whether the police personnel deployed across the city are conducting checks properly, Mohan said.“It is important to keep a check on the police working as they have to check each vehicle before allowing them to cross a checkpost. We monitor each vehicle and take down their registration number and if we find any suspicious activity we immediately report to concerned SHO or duty officer of that area,” the DCP said.Police said that through the war room they were keeping a close watch on all traffic junctions and vehicles on the road to ensure no violation takes places. Mohan said that there are 350 cameras and locations which are tracked by them round-the-clock. “A team of 12 police personnel is working in eight-hour shifts. They are coordinating with all the station house officers and traffic inspectors to ensure better functioning across the city,” he said.He said that a team was also in touch with the Delhi Police to update them about the situation in areas close to the border so that if any group is seen walking or rushing of vehicles towards the border, they are informed well in advance.I-CCC is a single dashboard system and as many as 12 operators are working on it at any point of time with a team of 10 additional people who refer complaints to the officials concerned, within seconds after the system displays it.Two technical members of NIC are also deployed in the centre for any technical support if required, said police.The I-CCC, which was created for improved efficiency of various departments (water, electricity, parking, streetlights, agriculture, sewerage, roads, garbage disposal, traffic, crime tracking, GIS mapping), earlier synchronized with the centre, are currently on hold and all the focus is on the ground situation during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/smart-city-centre-turned-into-covid-19-war-room/story-8IDQ2MOCu7oQhG4iYeZdCJ.html
11-04-2020||Gurugram||RWAs to restrict movement within nine Gurugram containment zones||After the district administration declared nine areas as “containment zones”, the police on Friday ordered the respective residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to keep a close watch on the movement of the residents.The RWAs will have to maintain a register to record the reasons for why residents would be moving out of the containment area and this will be routinely checked by the local police. Residents will be allowed to move out of the area only once a day. Further, if a resident wished to leave the containment area for personal reasons, they will be free to do so, but will not be allowed back until the lockdown measures are lifted. Online food services too would not be allowed.The administration on Thursday had declared Bestech Park View Residency in Palam Vihar, Laburnum in Sushant Lok phase 1, Suncity in sector 54, Emaar Palm Gardens in sector 83, Close South in Nirvana country, Abhinav apartments in sector 9, sector 39, ward number 11 in Pataudi and Raipur village in Sohna as the nine containment zones in the district. Police commissioner Muhammad Akil, who held a meeting with RWAs on Friday, said, “It is left to the discretion of the RWAs to allow its residents for morning or evening walks in the containment zones. Any unnecessary movement to nearby markets will be prohibited by the police. RWAs can allow pet owners to take their pets early morning at designated areas. But as a part of the order, no online food services like Swiggy or Zomato will be allowed to enter any residential areas.” The district administration also clarified that grocery stores in condominiums and nearby market areas falling under the containment zones will remain operational. This is unlike in Delhi where the movement of people in the containment zones is strictly prohibited. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said, “Essential services will be provided by the administration.” All security guards have been instructed to wear all safety equipment while dealing with delivery men and have to sanitise themselves thrice a day. Their medical checkups are mandatory before the deployment in the area.The authorities, however, said that RWAs cannot harass their residents in the wake of current orders. Akil said that people can approach his office if they face any harassment.Nilesh tandon, RWA president, Fresco apartment in Nirvana Country said, “We will share details with police weekly. We have passed strict instructions that no one will move out as our area is declared as containment zone and we have to take all precautionary measures,” he said.On Friday, the administration also revised its containment zone order stating that Sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) in coordination with the police will define the boundaries of the containment area, along with the entry and exit point to ensure that all the necessary essential services, emergency movements and authorized pass movements may be facilitated.“In the last three-four days, our teams have screened almost 15,000 people in the areas where Covid-19 cases have been reported. Maximum screening has been done in Pataudi where five coronavirus cases have been reported,” said Dr Sudha Garg, district surveillance officer. “In sector 39, we found 4 cases with flu like symptoms and we have asked them to quarantine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rwas-to-restrict-movement-within-nine-ggm-containment-zones/story-g6vSuVO4Y3cUhigbG1MczL.html
11-04-2020||Gurugram||Concerns prevail among residents over supply of essentials, containment area||Residents in Gurugram’s nine containment zones on Friday said that they were awaiting clear instructions from the administration regarding the supply of essentials in their areas. They said they had no idea when and how the administration would start supplying essentials, and how they were supposed to function until then. Residents in Sector 9 and Palam Vihar also complained that these areas were plotted colonies spread over a vast area and blanket sealing of them was not needed. Nilesh Tandon, RWA president of Fresco Apartments in Nirvana Country, said that while the containment plan was good for curbing unnecessary travel, it was clouded in ambiguity with little clarity over supply of essentials. Tandon said that he learned about the containment plan via news reports and no prior intimation regarding the sealing had been shared with the RWAs.“The update about the creation of containment zones reached us via the media last night. The administration didn’t reach out to us. Ideally, the administration should have written to the RWA about the sealing and given us time to make arrangements. In the absence of clear instructions, we are at a loss,” said Tandon.Asha Johari, a Nirvana Country resident, said that panic was created after it became clear that a hard lockdown was being put in place. “There was panic for a few hours in the afternoon when the RWA communicated the message regarding the sealing. Items started flying off the shelves in shops within the complex. Later, when the MCG bus for supply of essentials came, there were huge queues. I also heard that some residents had ordered food and the delivery persons were not allowed to enter Nirvana,” said Johari.Tandon added that residents had been going out to the nearby markets to buy essential items till Friday morning. But, with police barricading the locality later in the day, people were dependent on shops within the complex. “Barricades have been placed all around. Residents are being compelled to buy items from shops within the complex which are selling essentials at inflated prices. How will the residents survive till the administration kicks into action? We even wrote to the deputy commissioner, who said that he’d share detailed instructions with us but that hasn’t happened so far,” said Tandon.He added that the initial containment order had created confusion, since it mentioned Nirvana Country and Sector 54 together where as the township is located in Sector 50. On Friday, the administration re-released the order again that listed Nirvana Country and Sector 54 separately but clubbed them as one of the nine containment zones. Tandon also said that the inclusion of Nirvana County in the containment zones didn’t seem prudent since Covid-19 cases in Nirvana Country had emerged last month and the affected individuals had recovered two weeks ago. “If there is no positive cases right now, what is the point of including Nirvana Country in the containment zones? Even if they were making a containment zone, they should have first made arrangements for supplies. The administration is not doing anything due to which we are forced to take steps,” said Tandon. The Fresco RWA had tied up with a milk delivery service for the supply of milk from Saturday, but there is little clarity if these services will be allowed to function.Naresh Kataria, RWA president of Sector 9 — a plotted township developed by Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran, 20 years ago — said that earmarking the whole area under a containment zone was unfair. “There are some gated group housing societies in the sector which are separate from the plotted areas. A virus-positive case had emerged in one such high-rise, Abhinav Apartment, last month and that person has returned home after getting cured. Specific condominiums could have been earmarked instead of the whole sector,” said Kataria.RWA members of Laburnum Society, another containment zone, said that they were awaiting clarification from the administration regarding the containment zones. “We don’t have details or instructions regarding what these containment zones mean. Till we are clear about what is happening, we can’t say much. There are shops within the complex that are catering to our need of essentials as of now,” said Ashok Tankha, president of Laburnum Society.Sunil Yadav, former president of the Palam Vihar RWA, said that he was surprised by the inclusion of Palam Vihar among the containment zones. He said that Covid-19 cases were traced from a specific condominium that should have been sealed instead of the whole of Palam Vihar. “Areas close to the affected condominiums were left out while the whole colony was put in the containment zone. We will obey the roles in place but there should have been better earmarking of zones. Palam Vihar is a colony spread over 650 acres. How will essentials reach the whole plotted colony? We don’t know. Implementation should have been done based on ground realities,” said Yadav.“Delivery of essential items from online delivery retailers will be allowed in the nine containment zones provided all necessary safety precautions are undertaken by the agent delivering the items as well as the residents taking them,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/concerns-prevail-among-residents-over-supply-of-essentials-containment-area/story-wwA3OZlCUDzHMJxSPJqaCI.html

11-04-2020||City||In Hisar, women enrolled under NRLM are churning out 70 PPE kits daily||In five small villages of Hisar, at least 25 women are spending hours on their sewing machines. They are playing their part in the fight against coronavirus by preparing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for the medics working on the frontline. These women from Rawat Khera, Tayal, Kheri Jalab, Koth Kalan and Kanwari villages are enrolled under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) and are churning out up to 70 kits everyday. So far, the local administration has received 250 such kits, which will be distributed to the doctors who are testing the samples of Covid-19 patients. NRLM project manager Virender Sheoran said they bought the raw material for PPE kits from three different places with consent of a team of doctors and local administration. “We brought the material from Hansi, Rohtak and Bhiwani. The material is quite robust in terms of prevention from the virus. A team of principal medical officer selected the best material available,” he added.“We faced some hiccups initially as our previous model got rejected. But, after a thorough discussion, we prepared another fresh model, which even doctors accepted. Our target is to make at least 3,000 such kits,” Sheoran said. He said the total production cost is ₹610 and the retail price would be ₹850. “The women who are making these kits are also getting paid,” he added. Hisar deputy commissioner (DC) Priyanka Sonia said, “Though we have sufficient PPE kits for the doctors, to rule out any possibility of shortage, we have enrolled NRLM women to make more such kits. After a few hurdles, they finally came up with a prototype. One single woman is making about four to five PPE kits daily. These kits will help the doctors if the number of Covid-19 patients shoots up in Hisar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/women-enrolled-under-nrlm-churning-out-70-ppe-kits-daily-in-hisar/story-Y0cJAcz4Mduncm1P5ALGQJ.html

11-04-2020||Pune||Pune Inc fears serious disruption in cash flows, fresh orders: MCCIA||A serious disruption in cash flows and fear of future business are the top two concerns for more than 95 per cent of the 398 companies surveyed by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), director-general Prashant Girbane said on Friday.Addressing a press conference over the internet, Girbane said: “Out of the 398 companies that we surveyed ( 231 manufacturing companies and 166 services companies), we understand that cash flow and fear of future business are the top two concerns for over 95 per cent of the companies. The other major concerns were lack of transport and inventory management,” he said.While the 45 percent of the respondents were confident about not cutting the salaries of their employees, another 40 per cent were uncertain about it, he said.The press conference was called to share the details of a survey conducted in about 400 companies during the lockdown.Based on the results, the MCCIA said, most Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have accounted for salaries and wages to be paid until the lockdown ending on April 14. They were uncertain about the same thereafter.The survey revealed that while 64 per cent of respondents were worried about the impending reduction in orders from their costumers and another 23 per cent were already feeling the pricing pressure from their costumers; 77 per cent of respondents believed that their trade receivables were under high risk.Girbane said MCCIA plans to write to the government for waiver of electricity duty and fixed charges by MSEDCL for MSMEs, with the industries stopping work with effect from March 21.“It is also recommended that the same should be waived off for next three months and that MSEDCL should also extend the payment date of the electricity bills by 15 days during next three months. Similarly, MIDC’s fixed water charges should be waived off or the demand charges collected through monthly water bills. Further, all other service charges for the next 3 months should be waived off and bills should be raised for actual consumption of the water by the MSMEs,” the MCCIA said in a statement.While making a note of the waiver of property tax for MSMEs by the local body for the next three months, the MCCIA has written to the government seeking an increase in cash credit limit with the banks by 20% and release of MSME dues from PSUs.“It is understood the PSUs owe about Rs One Lakh Crores to the MSMEs towards purchase of goods and services from them. This amount needs to be release on priority,” said Girbane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-inc-fears-serious-disruption-in-cash-flows-fresh-orders-mccia/story-E9mHLUibMbClVJiwLFyWuI.html

11-04-2020||Mumbai||Fundamental duties as important as rights during the Covid-19 pandemic : Bombay HC||Holding that it is the constitutional right of migrants, labourers and citizens to get their basic needs fulfilled, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) stated that it was also their duty to maintain peace, harmony and the spirit of brotherhood, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The bench made the observations while hearing reports of various authorities on facilities being provided to the needy during the lockdown period. The court had initiated suo-moto public interest litigation (PIL) after taking cognizance of news reports about the plight of some labourers, who were on their way to their hometowns in Madhya Pradesh but were stopped and kept in a zilla parishad school, where they were not being provided proper facilities. The bench of justice Prasanna Varale on April 3 had directed the district authorities, including the collector and Aurangabad municipal corporation, to respond to news reports highlighting the plight of around 50-60 migrant workers and labourers who were kept in a zilla parishad school. The court had also dealt with instances of health workers being obstructed from checking residents of temporary camps for the coronavirus infection and a social media message which stated that some coronavirus-infected foreign nationals were being treated in a private hospital and exposing the entire city of Aurangabad to the infection.On Thursday, the collector and municipal authorities informed the court that the total 43 labourers, who had been initially kept at the school, were later shifted to a polytechnic institution where they were being provided with proper food, milk for small children, sanitization, entertainment facilities, spiritual and motivational discourses etc. The authorities also submitted that they had roped in Members of Parliament and Members of the Legislative Assembly to address the labourers and ensure that they cooperate with the health workers.Advocate Amol Joshi who was appointed as amicus curiae and represented the labourers confirmed the same.After hearing the submissions, the court appreciated the efforts of the Aurangabad administration as well as the work being done by NGO’s, voluntary organisations and radio jockeys to create awareness about the Covid 19 pandemic. “In my opinion, this is right time to remind ourselves the fundamental duties of the citizen. Often, citizens show serious concern about fundamental rights but they forget about the duties,” stated the bench.The court further observed, “While this court expects effective measures from the respondent state authorities and corporation, it also expects that citizens would remind themselves fundamental duties and would discharge them to deal with the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.” The PIL has been posted for further consideration on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fundamental-duties-as-important-as-rights-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-hc/story-ojv4FD2a0OFdrRr7hC1MCL.html
11-04-2020||Pune||Lockdown gameplan: Extra hour of sleep, healthy cooking, circuit training - all at home for footballer Ishan Dey||Dey started playing football at the age of 7 with the Naaz Academy, Kalyaninagar. Aged 11, he joined the Pune FC academy in 2011 and became the youngest player to get selected for the under-15 Pune FC team via an open trial. During his stint at Pune FC, the striker got scouted for the AIFF Indian National Under-14 team and attended a six-month camp in 2014. After returning from the camp, Dey returned to the Pune FC U-15 and finished as the joint top-scorer in the second division of the I-League that season.After Pune FC, Dey joined the Indian Super League club FC Pune City’s under-16 academy in 2016. Playing for the under-16 and under-18 teams of the ISL club, he old played all the major youth level tournaments which included the I-League second division. At the end of the 2017/18 season, Dey won FC Pune City’s Best Emerging Talent of the Year award. After FC Pune City’s closure, the teenager has moved to Hyderabad FC reserves this season and currently plays for the second division I-League side.Pre-Covid...I play football professionally for Hyderbad FC (reserves). I am a striker, but can also play on the wings. My daily regime starts at 6:30 am and six hours are dedicated to team training and gym sessions. I cannot disclose the details of the training because we are supposed to keep that knowledge to ourselves. However, I can tell you that it consists of plenty of tactical sessions. Everything is obviously game related so there are a lot of transition sessions with the usual passing, tackling, crossing and finishing. In the gym, we mainly focus on injury resistance and mobility training. We do not train in the evening as that time is exclusively reserved for recovering and replenishing our energy, game analysis and preparing for our next match.I am pursuing my education through Global University which is affiliated with Delhi University.Lockdown routine – morning, afternoon, and evening With the lockdown imposed, I get 90 minutes of extra sleep, as I get up at 8am. The day starts with yoga and various stretching exercises before joining my family at the dining table for breakfast. Since I have a lot of time to spare, I have taken this opportunity to learn some healthy recipes from my mother and I am always up for cleaning the house. I train my younger brother with strength and technical aspects of the game.After I finish lunch, I either watch a movie with my family or rest for a while. In the evenings, I either get in touch with my friends on a Zoom call or chat with them. If I am doing neither, I usually work on some basic ball work or indulge in strength training at home. As the gyms are shut…I am focusing more on yoga and mobility exercises and divide my session into two parts - one in the morning, which includes strengthening the circuit; and the other in the evening to maintain my muscle endurance (burpees, jumping jacks, clap push-ups, jumping squats and lunges, on-spot high knees for 1 min, pull-ups and core twisters; repeating this circuit four-five times). Even if you are unable to hit the gym, believe me, these exercises will get your muscles burning. It’s the best way to be agile and flexible and at the same time target those muscles to grow.The hobbyYes, I love cooking, so I am learning new recipes and try to make healthy preparations more delicious. I always like to educate myself about dieting, fitness, and nutrition. I like to study about supplements and how important they are in an athlete’s life. That aside, I can play some very amateur chords on my guitar and I also love watching some inspirational content based on true events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-gameplan-extra-hour-of-sleep-healthy-cooking-circuit-training-all-at-home-for-footballer-ishan-dey/story-QbZOSJmwoGW5RWw8AZJVXO.html

Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said the test report of the patient, Raj Kumari, was received on Friday, taking the count of coronavirus cases in the district to 48. This is the second death due to Covid-19 in Mohali. Earlier, a 65-year-old man from Nayagaon had died due to Covid-19 at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, on March 31.The elderly woman collapsed and died on reaching the Kharar civil hospital on April 7. She was brought to the hospital due to acute hypertension and diabetes, but as a precautionary measure, her samples were taken and the reports received on Friday confirmed that she had Covid-19, the civil surgeon said. Her husband alleged that she had been feeling sick for 10 days before her death, and during their visits to the hospital, they requested the doctors to take her sample for Covid-19 testing, but they turned down their appeals as she did not have any travel history. “We again requested them on April 7, but they only got her blood tests done, and she died 15 minutes later,” he alleged.On the allegations, Dr Singh said the patient visited the hospital with no symptoms of coronavirus. “She was suffering from acute hypertension and diabetes. We took her sample of Covid-19 just as a precautionary measure,” he added.FAMILY IN ISOLATION, WOMAN CREMATEDDr Singh said the woman was cremated following the protocol under the observation of health officials. Her family was provided with protection kits and are in isolation. A health department team collected their samples and the area around their house was sealed. The area is being sanitised. Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said samples of some doctors at the Kharar civil hospital were also taken.DEAD BIHAR MAN’S SAMPLE COLLECTEDA 27-year-old Bihar man was found dead in Bhaggomajra village in Kharar on Friday. Suspecting him of being infected with coronavirus, the health department collected his sample after his death. The report is awaited. According to the deceased’s neighbours, the youth had been complaining of breathlessness for several days and had also made multiple visits to the Kharar civil hospital, but was given treatment for common flu. On Thursday night, his condition deteriorated and he died on Friday morning, following which the police were informed. The youth was living in the village on rent for the past three months. He was cremated by the district administration in line with the protocol for suspected patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/74-year-old-woman-is-second-casualty-due-to-covid-19-in-mohali/story-qZ8mARpqW5JGuTpJD8nghL.html

11-04-2020||World||US set to overtake Italy in toll, Donald Trump to set up body to reopen country||The United States has become the first country to report more than 2,000 fatalities from the coronavirus disease in a single day and President Donald Trump said he will name a task force next week to decide when to reopen the country, and it does not have to be May 1, a date he has been reportedly considering.The president also continued his feud with the World Health Organization (WHO) and said he will have an announcement abut US funding for it. He has accused the world body of getting the pandemic wrong and then being “China-centric” and siding with it to help conceal the true extent of their outbreak.The United States continued to be hammered by the pandemic with the toll, which stood at 18,770 Saturday morning, set to overtake Italy’s 18,849. New York, the epicenter of the American outbreak, accounted for nearly half the country’s fatalities with 7,887; most of them in New York City, 5,820.The number of confirmed cases in the United States went past the half-million mark in the same period to 501,560; the world total of cases was 1.7 million effecting 184 countries, and 103,800 deaths.Despite the rising numbers of cases and fatalities US officials have said there are signs of an improvement in the situations, specially in the hotspots, geographies with high incidence of cases. New York, for instance, has seen a drop in hospitalization; adjoining states of New Jersey and Connecticut have stabilized and cities such as Boston and Chicago that continue to report cases, the rate of increase has stabilized.But the country has not yet reached the peak, health officials have said. “As encouraging as they are,” Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak, said at the daily briefing Friday, “we have not reached the peak.” April 16 is the projected peak day.The current strategy of social-distancing is working, she and other experts have said as they caution against easing up. “It’s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation, that we need to be pulling back at all,” said Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading epidemiologist and a member of the task force Americans have come to trust the most.President Trump has seemed in a hurry to open the the country and put it back to business as the economy is getting pummeled by the virus. Unemployment has shot up into double digits, with more than 16 million filing for unemployment benefits in the last three weeks, and experts are warning of the return of the Great Depression of 1929.Trump is concerned about implications for his re-elections prospects and has reportedly sought a plan from aides to reopen the country by May 1. Asked if he is determined to remove the restriction by that date, he said, “I’m not -- I am -- I would love to open it. I’m not determined anything. The facts are going to determine what I do.”The president then went on to announce he will be naming a task force or a council to decide when the country should be reopened. “This is really -- I call it, ‘The Opening Our Country Task Force’ or ‘Opening Our Country Council’, so we don’t get it confused with Mike’s task force (the White House task on coronavirus headed by Vice-President Mike Pence), which has done so great. And we’re going to have the great business leaders, great doctors. We’re going to have a great group of people.” The president, who expects to name the embers of the body on Tuesday. also assured reporters he will abide by the advice of his experts on this issue. Also next week, the American leader expects to announce his decision on continued funding of the WHO, with whom he has been carrying on a very public spat.”We’re paying them more than 10 times more than China,” he said Friday, referring to the annual contributions of the two countries, which he added, were around $450 million and $42 million respectively.“They are very, very China-centric … China always seems the to get the better of the -- the argument, and I don’t like that.”WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu has hit back and called on Trump to “quarantine politicizing COVID” earlier in the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-set-to-overtake-italy-in-toll-donald-trump-to-set-up-body-to-reopen-country/story-qGRfXaV8rWJuLRWSboguGM.html
11-04-2020||World||Russia space chief spars with Elon Musk over launch pricing||The head of Russia’s space agency on Saturday accused Elon Musk’s SpaceX of predatory pricing for space launches, which is pushing Russia to cut its own prices.“Instead of honest competition on the market for space launches, they are lobbying for sanctions against us and use price dumping with impunity,” Rogozin wrote on Twitter.Rogozin, who is often outspoken on Twitter and previously engaged in online banter with Elon Musk, on Friday raised the issue during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.He said the Roscosmos space agency “is working to lower prices by more than 30 percent on launch services to increase our share on the international markets.”“This is our answer to dumping by American companies financed by the US budget,” he said.The market price of a SpaceX launch is $60 million, but NASA pays up to four times that amount, he said.Musk responded to the criticism Saturday by saying on Twitter: “SpaceX rockets are 80% reusable, theirs are 0%. This is the actual problem.”SpaceX plans to send astronauts to the International Space Station next month for the first time on board its Falcon 9, a rocket that can be reused, lowering the cost of missions.Musk also announced last month that SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsules will start transporting tourists to the ISS next year.Rogozin has claimed, however, that SpaceX’s low pricing is only possible due to lavish funding from the Pentagon.After NASA retired its space shuttles in 2011, Russia became the sole carrier of humans to space, charging NASA for launching US astronauts to the ISS at reportedly $70 million each.Rogozin last year congratulated Musk on Crew Dragon’s successful launch, and Musk has tweeted jokes in Russian, with the banter a source of delight for Russian media.In 2014, Rogozin mocked the lack of a US manned flight programme, saying it might as well “deliver its astronauts to the ISS by using a trampoline”, after Washington announced new sanctions against Moscow which included some space industries.ma/spmISS A/S||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-space-chief-spars-with-elon-musk-over-launch-pricing/story-2WQIL59yQiG7XeP0nJWhnO.html
11-04-2020||World||Italy plans more coronavirus testing, contact tracing post lockdown||Italy plans to increase testing for the coronavirus and use voluntary contact tracing whenever it exits from a lockdown that’s currently in effect until at least May 3. Italy’s special commissioner for the virus emergency Domenico Arcuri told SKYTG 24 there will be mandatory blood tests to set up a system of ‘‘immunity passports.’‘ The voluntary contact tracing mobile apps will allow people to know if they have come in contact with someone who is positive for the virus. Then they can be tested in an effort to limit further spread of the virus. The blood tests identifying anti-bodies are still being developed. Virologists have cautioned the tests will not prove immunity but will give a snapshot whether a person has been in contact with the virus. If an anti-body test is positive, more testing would be needed to know if the virus is still active. The goal of public health officials is to determine how long immunity to the virus lasts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-plans-more-coronavirus-testing-contact-tracing-post-lockdown/story-MR56zfSuGL0cHKF1mGlH2J.html
11-04-2020||World||Why Africa’s coronavirus outbreak appears slower than anticipated||When Africa’s first case of coronavirus was detected in Egypt in February, the rest of the continent prepared for the brunt of a pandemic that has engulfed Europe and spread to the United States, infecting more than 1.6 million worldwide.Health experts warned of the devastation the deadly virus could cause in Africa, where most hospitals are desperately short of equipment and trained staff. Coronavirus has since spread to 52 African countries, but despite a steady rise in the number of confirmed cases, the continent continues to lag behind the global curve for infections and deaths.Still, the World Health Organization last month warned Africa faced a dramatic evolution of the pandemic even as governments imposed restrictions to help curb the spread. The continent appears poorly equipt to manage a major health crisis and is struggling to test enough to monitor virus cases. Where does Africa stand?To date the novel respiratory disease has infected more than 12,800 people on the continent and killed at least 692, according to a tally compiled by AFP. Only the Comoros archipelago and the tiny kingdom of Lesotho have not yet detected any cases.South Africa is the worst-affected country, with over 2,000 confirmed cases and 24 recorded deaths so far -- well behind the more than 871,000 cases and 71,000 deaths counted in Europe to date. Experts, however, warn that the tide is rising.“During the last four days we can see that the numbers have already doubled,” said Michel Yao, the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa’s emergency response programme manager.“If the trend continues... some countries may face a huge peak very soon,” Yao told AFP.WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti echoed the concern, adding that the spread of COVID-19 outside major cities opened “a new front in our fight against this virus”.Are numbers underestimated?Possibly the greatest question mark in analyses of coronavirus in Africa, compounded by a global lack of testing capacity.Despite a donation of more than one million coronavirus testing kits by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, most African countries lack the equipment needed to detect the disease.South Africa -- which has the most advanced healthcare system in sub-Saharan Africa -- has so far only managed to test around 73,000 of its 57 million inhabitants. “This is way too low for the kind of challenges South Africa is facing,” said the country’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who is aiming to scale up to 30,000 tests per day.Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy, has only carried out 5,000 coronavirus tests to date for a country of 190 million people.“The testing system is quite overloaded,” admitted a doctor working at a private clinic in Lagos, who asked not to be identified.“It takes time for... the results,” he added. “And are they accurate? We don’t know.”Inability to test for the virus has forced several countries to work with vague and sometimes misleading estimates. Kenya, for instance, has predicted its number of coronavirus cases to reach 10,000 by the end of April.Ten days into the month, the number of detected infections remained lower than 200.“The reason is we have not gone to do community-based testing,” explained the Director General of Kenya’s health ministry, Patrick Amoth.“So we still stand by our earlier projections. We don’t know what is going to happen.”The head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, admitted that Africa’s coronavirus statistics were far from “perfect”.“We just lack the means,” he told AFP.But Nkengasong also dismissed claims that a high number of infections had slipped under the radar, pointing out that hospitals “would be flooded with people” if that was the case. Have lockdowns, curfews worked? The delayed spread of coronavirus gave African countries some leeway to roll out the same measures implemented in Europe to stem the disease. Governments across the continent reacted ahead of time, closing borders and imposing lockdowns and curfews when just a handful of cases had been detected. Those measures have been tricky to enforce in impoverished and densely populated neighbourhoods, where houses are overcrowded and most survive off informal work -- making it almost impossible to remain home.The WHO’s Moeti cautioned that it was “too early to say” whether anti-coronavirus measures were slowing the epidemic in Africa.Meanwhile, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said earlier this week that there was “sufficient evidence” to show that a nation-wide lockdown was “working”.“In the two weeks before the lockdown, the average daily increase in new cases was around 42 percent. Since the start of the lockdown, the average daily increase has been around 4 percent,” Ramaphosa said on Thursday, as he announced an extension of the 21-day shutdown. Has Africa had enough time to prepare?The time gained by African governments could be offset by a lack of means.“There is a severe shortage of treatment facilities for critical cases of Covid-19,” said a WHO statement. There are barely five intensive care unit beds per one million people in Africa, compared to 4,000 in Europe, according to the organisation.Public hospitals only have 2,000 medical ventilators between them to serve the whole continent. Still no one dares make any predictions on the proportions the novel coronavirus could reach in Africa.The WHO noted that 31 countries on the continent had less than 100 confirmed cases and believed “containment was possible”.Yet the threat remains.“Covid-19 has the potential to cause thousands of deaths,” said the WHO’s Moeti. “To also unleash economic and social devastation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-africa-s-coronavirus-outbreak-appears-slower-than-anticipated/story-AX4htJnh418YRefV29MbUP.html
11-04-2020||World||Africans harassed in southern China amid Covid-19 and fear of imported cases||The US embassy in China issued a security alert on Saturday for African-Americans living and working in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou after several reports said members of the large black community in the city were being targeted and harassed amid Covid-19 fears.Diplomats from several African countries have also taken up the matter of their citizens being harassed with the Chinese embassies.Reports of Africans being targeted in Guangzhou comes in the backdrop of rising number of imported Covid-19 cases in China.On Saturday, health authorities said it had received reports of 46 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Friday, of which 42 were imported.Three deaths, all in Hubei, and eight new suspected cases, all imported ones, were reported Friday on the mainland.As of Friday, the mainland had reported a total of 1,183 imported cases, the national health commission (NHC) said Saturday in its daily report.The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 81,953 by Friday with 3,339 deaths.The US Embassy security alert on Saturday said that “police ordered bars and restaurants not to serve clients who appear to be of African origin” and local officials have launched mandatory testing and self-quarantine for “anyone with ‘African contacts.’”That’s in response to a rise in virus infections in Guangzhou, the US said, adding that “African-Americans have also reported that some businesses and hotels refuse to do business with them.”According to CNN, which said it interviewed more than two dozen Africans living in Guangzhou, many had been left without a home, being subject to random testing for Covid-19, and being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients.There are about 80,000 foreign nationals living in Guangzhou, capital of south China’s industrial powerhouse Guangdong province.According to official numbers, there were 15,000 Africans living in the city. However, thousands more travel in and out of the city. Egypt, Mali, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the major sources of African expatriates. Most are engaged in trade or study in the city.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday told reporters that China’s most urgent task is to prevent “overseas imports” of the virus but acknowledged that “there might be some misunderstandings in the implementation of measures.”China treats all foreigners equally, Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africans-harassed-in-southern-china-amid-covid-19-and-fear-of-imported-cases/story-4faJmVjIcYUNIuZVRKtAJO.html

Health secretary Matt Hancock believes the peak is yet to come.Downing Street issued a brief update on Johnson: “The Prime Minister continues to make very good progress.”Hancock faced mounting criticism from health professionals and others over “dangerously low” levels of person protection equipment in some hospitals, despite the military and others involved in delivering millions of pieces across the UK.Chaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association said: “No doctor should ever have to be in harm’s way when they go to work, and in these unprecedented times, this has never been more important”.“This is not the flu. We are dealing with an unknown, highly-infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers. It is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected – and without them, we face real disaster”.Hancock revealed that 19 health professionals had died of coronavirus in recent days, most of them from Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern and Afro-Caribbean communities. They include Indian-origin Jitendra Kumar Rathod.Nagpaul said: “This is absolutely tragic. In terms of doctors who I represent, it’s extremely concerning that 10 of the 11 doctors are from black and Asian minority backgrounds, almost all of them having come from overseas having given their lives to the health service”.Ministers and health officials reiterated the core message to stay at home, to resist visiting local beach or park despite the warm weather, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 26°C (78.80°F) in some areas over the Easter holidays weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-increases-by-917-set-to-cross-10-000/story-gVLlEVuMm6P33qDKsH4GnI.html

A massive effort to move instruction online has met with mixed success in the city, where many low-income students lack Wi-Fi and devices for connecting to their virtual classrooms.De Blasio resisted closing schools even as the city recorded its first deaths from the coronavirus, saying he feared that health care workers would have to stay home to care for children and that hundreds of thousands of poor students would go hungry without their free school meals.Authorities in some other locales, including the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, have previously announced that schools will be shuttered for the rest of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-schools-closed-for-rest-of-year-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-kjkAC2wx7ikDUwmjOmegGM.html

A day later he was transferred to intensive care as his condition deteriorated.He was taken out of the care unit and into a normal ward at London’s St Thomas’ Hospital on Thursday evening, waving at staff “in gratitude”, his spokesman has said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here On Friday he was able to do short walks, between periods of rest, according to Downing Street, which said he was in “very good spirits”.“The Prime Minister continues to make very good progress,” a Downing Street spokeswoman said in a short statement.Johnson’s time in hospital was unprecedented for a British prime minister during a national emergency in modern times, rattling the country and sending shockwaves around the world.Britain, which went into lockdown on March 23, continues to be hit hard by COVID-19, recording nearly 1,000 daily deaths from the virus for the first time on Friday.It brings the total number of fatalities from coronavirus in British hospitals to nearly 9,000, while the number of confirmed cases in the country climbed close to 74,000.That is thought to reflect only a fraction of the actual number of people infected because not everyone has been tested for the virus.Despite Johnson’s improving condition, it remains unclear when he might be discharged from hospital and how quickly he would return to work once out.His spokesman stressed Friday that his recovery was “at an early stage” and he would act only “on the advice of his medical team”.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe Sun tabloid reported his spirits had been lifted this week by his pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds, who sent him daily “love letters” and scans of their unborn child.Symonds, who has also suffered from coronavirus symptoms in recent weeks, and the British leader have reportedly not seen each other for nearly a month.Their baby is due this summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-british-pm-boris-johnson-making-very-good-progress-in-coronavirus-recovery/story-uC4MVHtxjb9uJE8VfXYABO.html

Women who have young children were given priority in deciding who works remotely. Businesses outside the capital were also allowed to reopen Saturday, the first day of the work week.Businesses in Tehran will be allowed to reopen next Saturday, provided they register with authorities and follow guidelines on social distancing set out by the Health Ministry. Government offices in the capital will reopen with two-thirds of employees coming in and the rest working remotely.The ministry meanwhile reported another 125 deaths, bringing the overall toll to 4,357. The country has reported more than 70,000 confirmed cases, and authorities say more than 40,000 have recovered.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in elderly patients or those with underlying health problems.For weeks, Iran declined to impose the kind of wide-scale lockdowns adopted by other Middle Eastern countries, even as the number of confirmed cases and fatalities steadily climbed. The virus has also infected and killed a number of senior Iranian officials.Authorities have defended their response, saying they have to consider the economic impact of any quarantine measures since the country is under severe U.S. sanctions. President Donald Trump imposed heavy sanctions, including on oil exports, after withdrawing the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.The U.S. has offered humanitarian aid to help Iran combat the outbreak, but Iran’s leaders have rejected it, instead demanding that the sanctions be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-begins-lifting-restrictions-after-brief-virus-lockdown/story-awSn16ELGpNpfbPNLxmfjK.html
11-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Donald Trump faces dilemma on reopening US economy, says ‘biggest decision ever’||President Donald Trump said on Friday he faced his biggest decision yet with regard to when to re-open the US economy from its coronavirus shutdown and pledged to listen to health experts when making that determination.Speaking at a White House coronavirus briefing, Trump said he would unveil a new advisory group next week that would focus on the process of economic opening.The president, who faced criticism for playing down the threat from the virus in its early stages, has chafed at the devastating economic impact of the strict social distancing measures his administration has recommended. The guidelines are set to stay in place through the end of April. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The president will then have to decide whether to extend them or start encouraging people to go back to work and a more normal way of life.“I’m going to have to make a decision, and I ... hope to God that it’s the right decision,” Trump said. “It’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make.”Trump said the facts would determine the next move, though he reiterated his desire to re-open the economy. Asked what metrics he would use to make his judgment, he pointed at his forehead: “The metrics right here, that’s my metrics.”Trump suggested the number of new infections was flattening and the death toll would be lower than initial projections of more than 100,000.Also read: A quiet Easter expected as global Covid-19 deaths top 100,000He said he would announce the members of the new advisory council possibly on Tuesday. Some state governors will be appointed.Trump said the aggressive social distancing and stay-at-home measures taken to combat the coronavirus were showing signs of success, and situations in hot spots such as New Orleans, Louisiana, and Detroit, Michigan, were stabilizing.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage US deaths from the virus topped 18,100 on Friday, according to a Reuters tally.But administration officials cautioned it was still too early to ease restrictions, and said the faithful should not gather in churches on the Easter Sunday holiday.“We know it’s difficult in this time of year in particular to avoid gatherings of more than 10, but we’re grateful that so many churches, synagogues and places of worship have done just that,” Vice President Mike Pence said, urging worshipers “to continue to heed the guidelines.”New U.S. government figures show coronavirus infections will spike during the summer if stay-at-home orders are lifted after 30 days as planned, according to projections first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by a Department of Homeland Security official.If shelter-in-place orders are lifted after 30 days, the death toll is estimated to reach 200,000, according to the projections, obtained from DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump said at the briefing that he and his advisers have not seen the new projections.Trump said he was getting fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.“We’re in great shape with ventilators, we’re in great shape with protective clothing, we have additional planeloads coming in. But we’re not getting any calls from governors at this moment,” he said.Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House task force on the coronavirus, said the United States was starting to flatten the curve the way Italy did, with a lot of the success coming from progress in New York City.Officials have pointed to declining rates of coronavirus hospitalizations and need for intensive care in hard-hit New York as signs that social distancing measures are paying off.“But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak. And so every day we need to continue to do what we did yesterday, and the week before and the week before that because that’s what in the end is going to take us across the peak and down the other side,” Birx said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-donald-trump-faces-dilemma-on-reopening-us-economy-says-biggest-decision-ever/story-68jQcUmV30e7CQROOw9agK.html

He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.The peace deal is aimed at paving the way for the US to extricate itself from the 19-year war, America’s longest.The spokesman confirmed that Gen. Scott Miller met with the Taliban “as part of the military channel established in the agreement” to discuss ways to reduce the violence.Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said the meeting was held late Friday in the Gulf nation of Qatar, where the insurgent group maintains a political office. Shaheen tweeted Saturday that the two sides held “serious” discussions. He said the Taliban called for a halt to attacks against civilians. The US military says it does not target non-combatants.The US -Taliban deal, touted as Afghanistan’s best chance at ending decades of war, is holding, but progress toward a broader political settlement has been slowed by squabbling within the Afghan government. That has frustrated Washington and delayed the start of the next phase of negotiations, among Afghans themselves.The Taliban say they have reduced their attacks on Afghan forces and have not attacked US or NATO troops since the agreement was signed on Feb. 29. Most of the recent Taliban attacks have been against Afghan forces posted in remote areas.The Afghan government meanwhile said its air force struck Taliban positions in the northeastern Badakhshan province, killing up to 27 insurgents.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said civilians were killed and wounded, blaming US and Afghan forces. The US military spokesman declined to respond to the allegation but said that the Taliban often falsely accuse the US of carrying out bombing raids launched by Afghan forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-meet-head-of-us-forces-in-afghanistan-amid-tensions-over-peace-deal/story-iMI2uOt9IsdYp9oKZsBX7M.html

Donald Trump has ramped up the embargo since assuming the US presidency, making it harder for other countries to send supplies there.Cuba complained recently that a shipment of test kits, masks and respirators donated by the Chinese Alibaba group didn’t arrive because the American company tasked with transportation feared breaching US sanction rules.“It’s very difficult to buy equipment, supplies, medicines. We’re forced to buy them in far away markets that double, triple the costs and on many occasions they arrive late,” said Marimon.He said the sanctions caused “$160 million in damages to the health ministry” between April 2019 and March 2020, $60 million more than the year before.He said the total losses since the sanctions began in 1962 was three billion dollars.Recently, the Oxfam charity blasted the US over the sanctions and called for them to be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cuba-hits-out-at-cruel-us-sanctions-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-QPXOhZMFlbiAowIDF7frLI.html
11-04-2020||World||New York buries unclaimed bodies at fast pace to clear space in morgues for Covid-19 victims||Authorities in New York, the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, are burying unclaimed bodies quickly to clear space in the city’s morgues, where mortal remains of Covid-19 patients are piling up, according to a media report.A report in The New York Times said every Thursday was burial day on Hart Island, the final resting place off the Bronx for New York City’s unclaimed dead.“But as with many things, coronavirus has changed all that,” it said.Burials are now being done five days a week at Hart Island, with roughly 25 bodies lowered into trenches each day, according to a city official. “That is as many burials as would typically be done in a week before the virus hit,” the report said.Drone footage and images of burial crews in freshly dug muddy trenches burying body after body in bare wooden boxes are circulating in social media. New York, which has emerged as the epicenter of Covid-19 deaths, has registered over 1.7 lakh positive cases, which is more than any other country. More than 7,800 people in New York have died due to coronavirus, several times more than the total number of people killed in the devastating 9/11 terror attacks.The NYT report quoted a city official as saying that the only people being buried at the island for now are those for whom the city has been unable to contact next of kin for some time.“We understand extenuating circumstances,” the official said, noting that bodies that have not been claimed because their families are under quarantine or on lockdown or for some other reason will not be buried on Hart Island.The report said the city’s morgues used to have adequate space to hold unclaimed bodies for 30 to 60 days before they were buried on Hart island. But now, with the pace of the coronavirus death toll increasing, the city is moving to bury more of those people to clear space in the morgues.“Because we didn’t have pressure on the system, we didn’t have to move them quickly,” the official said, adding, “We are now burying people who have been sitting with us for quite some time.” The official said it is possible that the burial of the unclaimed bodies of Covid-19 victims has already begun, because people have been dying of the virus for weeks. “We know that if it didn’t happen yesterday, it’s only a matter of days until people are buried because of the time that has passed,” the official said on Friday morning, referring to victims of the disease.Contract workers are now doing the burials, rather than the Rikers Island inmates who normally do them, the official said.The US has become the world’s first country to have registered more than 2,000 Covid-19 deaths in a single day with 2,108 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of infections in America has crossed 500,000, the highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-buries-unclaimed-bodies-at-fast-pace-to-clear-space-in-morgues-for-covid-19-victims/story-gpGL8osr8CoVOHulrrt5gP.html

London as you know has the largest number of cases in the UK”, he says despairingly.The bigger picture of nearly 9,000 deaths and tens of thousands of cases in UK hospitals is played out at the micro level in individual stories of frustration, adjustments in everyday life, cancellations, and strategies to dodge others in supermarkets and queues.Also Watch |UK PM Boris Johnson hospitalised; Queen Elizabeth II addresses nation Almost everyone in the Indian community knows someone who has had the virus, is in quarantine at home, or in hospital. Social distancing is relatively easier in western societies, which even before the virus struck were much more formal in their interactions than Indians, which is reflected in the ‘Indian’ areas in London.It is significant that London boroughs with the highest cases are those with large concentrations of people of Indian origin: Ealing Southall, Brent, Barnet and Harrow. “It is frustrating to remain at home, but there is no option”, says Maidenhead-based Ravi Singh.Everyday life in India and the UK is more integrated than ever, with news channels, internet and social media ensuring close connectivity. Singh quips that in India it is no longer a matter of prestige to say that one is ‘London-returned’; some may even hide the fact.Writer Mihir Bose, a long-time London resident, says social distancing is the main problem, but adds that the elderly have discovered the benefits of social media and video-conferencing that enable connectivity in the time of isolation.“Many of my elderly British friends now meet in virtual drinking sessions. We had several of these; the calendar is booked up.”It is said that if you are tired of London, you are tired of life, but Samuel Johnson never faced such a lockdown. London no longer looks and feels like the London everyone knows; it is as if a giant hoover has sucked life out of its throbbing streets.The scene is particularly dystopic in central London buzz-spots such as Oxford Street, Piccadilly, and Trafalgar Square.Traffic lights are on, but there is hardly any traffic, except for police cars, ambulances and vans of electricians, plumbers and road maintenance staff. The price of petrol has come down to nearly a pound, but cars in residential areas have hardly moved an inch.The BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden is closed since March 13, streaming its daily ‘arti’ online to followers across London and the UK. Other places of worship have made similar arrangements to prevent gathering of large number of people.Medical experts of Indian origin such as Kamlesh Khunti of the University Leicester worry that the ethnicity-wise figures when released will show a disproportionate high incidence of the virus in the community. Initial data has already suggested this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-ll-come-now-covid-19-hotspot-london-no-longer-holiday-choice-of-indians/story-q1ADNNEw5yL0fQNz9ab2nL.html
11-04-2020||World||African community in Chinese city allege being targeted in coronavirus crackdown||Africans in southern China’s largest city say they have become targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing as the country steps up its fight against imported infections.China says it has largely curbed its COVID-19 outbreak but a recent cluster of cases linked to the Nigerian community in Guangzhou sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and virus prevention officials.Local authorities in the industrial centre of 15 million said at least eight people diagnosed with the illness had spent time in the city’s Yuexiu district, known as “Little Africa”.Five were Nigerian nationals who faced widespread anger after reports surfaced that they had broken a mandatory quarantine and been to eight restaurants and other public places instead of staying home.As a result, nearly 2,000 people they came into contact with had to be tested for COVID-19 or undergo quarantine, state media said.Guangzhou had confirmed 114 imported coronavirus cases as of Thursday -- 16 of which were Africans. The rest were returning Chinese nationals. It has led to Africans becoming targets of suspicion, distrust and racism in China.Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels. “I’ve been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat... I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me,” said Tony Mathias, an exchange student from Uganda who was forced from his apartment on Monday.“We’re like beggars on the street,” the 24-year-old said.Mathias added that police had given him no information about testing or quarantine but instead told him “to go to another city”.Police in Guangzhou declined to comment when contacted by AFP.A Nigerian businessman said he was evicted from his apartment earlier this week.“Everywhere the police see us, they will come and pursue us and tell us to go home. But where can we go?” he said.Growing tensions Other Africans said the community had been subject to mass COVID-19 testing even though many had not left China recently, and placed under arbitrary quarantine at home or in hotels. China has banned foreign nationals from entering the country and many travellers are being sent into 14-day quarantines either in their own accommodation or at centralised facilities.Thiam, an exchange student from Guinea, said police ordered him to stay home on Tuesday even after he tested negative for COVID-19 and told officers he had not left China in almost four years.He believes the measures are specifically and unfairly targeting Africans. “All the people I’ve seen tested are Africans. Chinese are walking around freely but if you’re black you can’t go out,” he said.Denny, a Nigerian trader evicted from his flat on Tuesday, said police moved him to a hotel for quarantine after he spent several days sleeping on the streets. “Even if we have a negative test result, police don’t let us stay (in our accommodation) and they don’t give a reason why,” he said.  ‘Crazy fear’ The infections in Guangzhou have sparked a torrent of abuse online, with many Chinese internet users posting racist comments and calling for all Africans to be deported.Last week a controversial cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media. “There’s just this crazy fear that anybody who’s African might have been in contact with somebody who was sick,” said David, a Canadian living in Guangzhou who did not want to give his full name.China’s foreign ministry acknowledged this week that there had been some “misunderstandings” with the African community.“I want to emphasise that the Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally,” said spokesman Zhao Lijian on Thursday, urging local officials to “improve their working mechanisms”.The complaints in Guangzhou contrast with a welcome reception to Chinese efforts in battling the coronavirus across the African continent, where Beijing this week donated medical supplies to 18 countries.“When China engages Africa it’s the central government that does that, but when it comes to immigration enforcement that happens at the local level,” said Eric Olander, managing editor of the China Africa Project.“That explains why there’s an inconsistency in the more upbeat messaging we hear about Chinese diplomacy on the continent and the increasingly difficult realities that African traders, students and other expatriates face in their day-to-day lives in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-community-in-chinese-city-allege-being-targeted-in-coronavirus-crackdown/story-Sz9lkBdLX3rKUuEEtNuNPM.html
11-04-2020||World||US first country to record over 2,000 Covid-19 deaths in one day: Report||The US has become the world’s first country to have registered more than 2,000 COVID-19 deaths in a single day with 2,108 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of infections in America has crossed 500,000, the highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data. China, where the deadly coronavirus disease started in December last year before spreading across Europe and America killing more than 100,000, has so far recorded 81,000 cases of positive infections and 3,339 deaths. In terms of fatalities, the US might soon overtake Italy where 18,848 COVID-19 deaths have happened so far. By Friday night, the US had 1,8679 recorded deaths, closely behind Italy. More than 16,000 people have died in Spain and over 13,000 in Germany, the university data said. By Friday night more than 2,108 Americans had died due to the novel coronavirus and 500,399 people had tested positive with the dreaded disease, it said. The COVID-19 positive cases in the United States are now more than the other top countries taken together: Spain (158,000), Italy (147,000), Germany (122,000) and France (112,000). New York, which has emerged as the epicenter of COVID-19 deaths, has registered over 1.7 lakh positive cases, which is more than any other country. More than 7,800 people in New York have died due to coronavirus. New Jersey has has nearly 2,000 deaths and more than 54,000 confirmed cases. Before the start of the week, members of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus had projected between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in the US. While President Donald Trump had said that this was going to be a “terrible, terrible” week in terms of death, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the week was going to be 9/11 and Pearl Harbour moment for the country. On Friday, Trump told reporters that as per the new projections the death toll was expected to be below 60,000. “Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 (deaths), you could never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking. So they said between 100 and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn’t do anything. But it showed a just tremendous resolve by the people,” he said. Trump has declared a national emergency, has notified major disaster declaration for almost all of the 50 States and more than 95 per cent of the 330 million population are under stay-at-home order. The American economy is headed for a recession, experts say. New York, the epicenter, he said is showing signs of a “downward curve,” Trump said. “A lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives. We’re saving so many lives compared to what it could have been,” he said. “In New York, we’re seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially. And nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening substantially, suggesting that we are near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working,” Trump said. Over time, the guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions, he added. According to Dr Deborah Brix, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, the mortality rate in the United States is significantly less than many other countries. “That is really solely the work of our frontline healthcare providers,” she said, but cautioned that the country has still not reached the peak. “But as encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak. And so, every day, we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that’s what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side,” Brix said. Globally, 102,669 people have died due to coronavirus and over 1.6 million people have been infected, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-country-to-record-over-2-000-covid-19-deaths-in-one-day-report/story-QmvRoFHyRxQaVJEksH65lO.html
11-04-2020||World||A quiet Easter expected as global Covid-19 deaths top 100,000||The global death toll from the coronavirus topped 100,000 as Christians around the world marked the Good Friday in front of computer screens instead of churches and some countries tiptoed toward reopening s battered economies.Public health officials warned people against violating the social distancing rules over Easter. In Italy, officials used helicopters, drones and stepped-up police checks to make sure people don’t slip out over the holiday.Even such hallowed traditions as the pope’s Easter message are being revamped -- Pope Francis will live-stream from the seclusion of his private library.Some churches held services online, while others arranged prayers at drive-in theatres. Fire-scarred Notre Dame Cathedral came back to life briefly in locked-down Paris. Services were broadcast from the nearly empty, closed-to-the-public cathedral.France on Friday reported 987 more deaths in hospitals and nursing homes in 24 hours, but the number of patients in intensive care fell for the second day in a row.Health secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday that Britain had recorded 980 deaths in 24 hours, the highest daily toll yet, bringing total fatalities to nearly 8,000. Confirmed cases in the UK climbed to more than 65,000.A Downing Street spokesman said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was moved out of intensive care after being hit with the virus, “has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery.” Stanley Johnson, the prime minister’s father, expressed relief that his son is out of the ICU and wanted him to rest.In the US, the death toll surged to more than 17,900 as of Friday morning, with more than 478,000 cases. New York state, the worst-hit, had nearly half of fatalities at 7,800 — with 779 in 24 hours on Thursday, a rate of 33 an hour.New York City reported 5,150 deaths, becoming the city with highest number fatalities anywhere in the world.City officials are now considering mass, temporary burial sites. Such internments would likely be at Hart Island off the Bronx, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.Still, there were signs of hope. Hospitalisation numbers in New York fell to their lowers on Thursday since the state was put “on pause” by the state authorities.Anthony Fauci, the epidemiologist in President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, cited the improvement in New York to acknowledge a turnaround has started. But, he told CNN on Friday, he would like to see clearer and stronger signs before getting “out there prematurely and winding back in the same situation.” New York governor Andrew Cuomo counselled caution, citing cities and countries hit by a second wave because they rushed to it.US Senate, meantime, failed to pass on Thursday a request of $250 billion more in relief for small businesses sought by the Trump administration in addition to the overall package of $2.2 trillion cleared last month. Democrats wanted a matching amount to be set aside for healthcare workers. US lawmakers appealed to China to shut down all its operating ‘wet markets’, where fresh produce including meat and vegetables are sold.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians should get accustomed to the “new normal” of living with restrictions even after the first wave of the pandemic has peaked. He said social distancing or remaining at home may be necessary over a period longer than the expected peak of the infections in the country.In some of the worst-hit countries, Italy and Spain, new infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off. But the daily tolls remain shocking.Spain, after a two-week freeze on all non-essential economic activity, decided to allow factories and construction sites to resume work on Monday, while schools, most shops and offices will remain closed.Spanish authorities said they trust that the move won’t cause a significant surge in infections.In Italy, the industrial lobbies in regions representing 45% of the country’s economic output urged the government to ease its two-week lockdown on all non-essential manufacturing, saying the country “risks definitively shutting down its own motor, and every day that passes the risk grows not to be able to restart it.’’A hasty lifting of restrictions imposed to control the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to a fatal resurgence of the new coronavirus, the World Health Organization warned on Friday.Malaysia’s prime minister announced a two-week extension to the country’s lockdown but said selected economic sectors can reopen in phases.China’s Wuhan city, where the pandemic began, is still testing residents regularly despite relaxing its tough two-month lockdown. China has also ordered all hotels in the capital Beijing to ensure all guests provide negative coronavirus report. Beijing will require all arrivals to provide a negative nucleic acid report and green health code before checking in to hotels starting Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-to-livestream-his-easter-message-as-global-covid-19-deaths-top-100-000/story-wG1Qy4kuAapyqJioRXQAjL.html

Shopping malls, hairdressers and larger stores should reopen from May 1, though the plan could change if infections accelerate. Restaurants and hotels could reopen step by step from mid-May, although details have yet to be announced. As the country, governed by right-wing Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, is planning to resume its economic activity amid reports that it likely had at least twice as many new coronavirus infections than officially reported.The SORA institute-led study found that 0.32% of those surveyed in the first week of April tested positive for the new coronavirus, with more than three per 1,000 people thought to have caught the virus.SORA said it was the first such study in the EU to better understand the virus’s prevalence.The result means some 28,500 of Austria’s close to nine million people were likely affected, the institute said, compared to the official statistic of up to 12,200 coronavirus infections for that April week. The total of known infections stood at more than 13,000 on Friday , of which 7,021 were active.

But I would say without question, it’s the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make,” Trump told a press conference.Trump, who faces a tight reelection in November, is keen to get the US economy back open after weeks of tough measures that shut down businesses and dramatically cut down on transport across the country to slow the virus’s spread.The previously strong economy was the biggest selling point in his campaign platform.However, he also faces warnings that a premature opening would put lives at risk by allowing the virus to take a new hold.“I have to make the biggest decision of my life,” he said.With current federal guidelines on social distancing set to expire at the end of the month, expectations are growing that Trump will tell Americans they can start resuming normal activity from May -- at least in parts of the country.The decision will be partly based on medical data, but also heavily swayed by political considerations and advice from the business community which has been devastated by the shutdown, with an abrupt drop in revenues and mass unemployment claims.In what will mark an important step in the process, Trump says he will be announcing members of a new task force on Tuesday.“I call it the opening our country task force or opening our country council,” he said.The group will include “very great doctors and business people,” as well as probably governors of states.In a sign that Trump will seek broad support for what could be a politically dangerous decision, he said he wanted bipartisan representation from politicians on the council.“I want to put on both parties,” he said.Reassuring critics who say he risks rushing, Trump insisted medical opinion will be key.“We’re looking at a date, we hope we’ll be able to fulfill a certain date, but we’re not doing anything until we know this country is going to be healthy,” he said.“We don’t want to go back and start doing it over again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-says-when-to-reopen-us-economy-biggest-decision-of-presidency/story-uRL0wGA6ELB9I0OXzJXfHK.html
11-04-2020||World||Coronavirus found in air samples up to 13 feet from patients: Study||A new study examining air samples from hospital wards with COVID-19 patients has found the virus can travel up to 13 feet (four meters) -- twice the distance current guidelines say people should leave between themselves in public.The preliminary results of the investigation by Chinese researchers were published Friday in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).They add to a growing debate on how the disease is transmitted, with the scientists themselves cautioning that the small quantities of virus they found at this distance are not necessarily infectious.The researchers, led by a team at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, tested surface and air samples from an intensive care unit and a general COVID-19 ward at Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan. They housed a total of 24 patients between February 19 and March 2.Follow full Covid-19 coverage hereThey found that the virus was most heavily concentrated on the floors of the wards, “perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground.”High levels were also found on frequently touched surfaces like computer mice, trashcans, bed rails and door knobs.“Furthermore, half of the samples from the soles of the ICU medical staff shoes tested positive,” the team wrote. “Therefore, the soles of medical staff shoes might function as carriers.”Airborne threat?The team also looked at so-called aerosol transmission -- when the droplets of the virus are so fine they become suspended and remain airborne for several hours, unlike cough or sneeze droplets that fall to the ground within seconds.They found that virus-laden aerosols were mainly concentrated near and downstream from patients at up to 13 feet -- though smaller quantities were found upstream, up to eight feet.Encouragingly, no members of the hospital staff were infected, “indicating that appropriate precautions could effectively prevent infection,” the authors wrote.They also offered advice that bucks orthodox guidelines: “Our findings suggest that home isolation of persons with suspected COVID-19 might not be a good control strategy” given the levels of environmental contamination.Aerosolization of the coronavirus is a contentious area for scientists who study it, because it is not clear how infectious the disease is in the tiny quantities found in ultrafine mist.The World Health Organization has so far downplayed the risk.US health authorities have adopted a more cautious line and urged people to cover their faces when out in public in case the virus can be transmitted through normal breathing and speaking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-found-in-air-samples-up-to-13-feet-from-patients/story-GybSvpPVHkY47rSCmr0fGN.html
11-04-2020||World||How false negative results are complicating Covid-19 testing||As COVID-19 tests become more widely available across the US, scientists have warned about a growing concern: Many people with negative results might actually have the virus.That could have devastating implications as a global recession looms and governments wrangle with the question of when to reopen economies shuttered as billions of people were ordered to stay home in an effort to break transmission of the deadly disease.The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.But “there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,” Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.“It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,” she said.The virus has only been spreading among humans for four months and therefore studies about test reliability are still considered preliminary.Early reports from China suggest its sensitivity, meaning how well it is able to return positive results when the virus is present, is somewhere around 60 to 70 percent. Different companies around the world are now producing slightly different tests, so it’s hard to have a precise overall figure. But even if it were possible to increase the sensitivity to 90 percent, the magnitude of risk remains substantial as the number of people tested grows, Sampathkumar argued in a paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.“In California, estimates say the rate of COVID-19 infection may exceed 50 percent by mid-May 2020,” she said. With 40 million people, “even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected.” This makes it critical for clinicians to base their diagnosis on more than just the test: they must also examine a patient’s symptoms, their potential exposure history, imaging and other lab work. Timing is everything Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.The main nasal swab tests examine the nasopharynx, where the back of the nose meets the top of the throat. This requires a trained hand to perform and some portion of the false negatives arises from improper procedure.But even if done correctly, the swab may produce a false negative. That’s because as the disease progresses, the virus passes from the upper to the lower respiratory system.In these cases, the patient may be asked to try to cough up sputum -- mucus from the lower lungs -- or doctors may need to take a sample more invasively, when a patient is under sedation. Daniel Brenner, an emergency physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, described to AFP taking a test after performing a procedure called a bronchoalveolar lavage.This was done on a patient whose nasal swab returned negative three times, but who showed all the signs of COVID-19.Eventually, the patient’s medical team placed a camera down his windpipe to examine the lungs, then sprayed fluid in and sucked out the secretions, which were then tested, resulting in a positive.No perfect test Uncertainty in clinical diagnoses is not new, and clinicians are well aware that no type of test for any condition can be considered perfect.What makes COVID-19 different is its newness, said Sampathkumar.“Most of the time when you have tests, you have test characteristics outlined carefully and warnings about tests interpretation,” she said.“We had no test for so long, and when we got the test, we started using it widely and sort of forgot the basics.”After being slow to start mass testing, the US has ramped up production and has tested almost 2.5 million people, with pharmacists now authorized to carry out the procedure. But “the real fear of that is people who are given a false negative test and then decide that they’re safe to go around their daily life and go out and expose people,” said Brenner.Much hope is placed on newly available serological tests which look for antibodies produced by a person’s body in response to the virus and can tell whether a person was infected, long after they recovered.They could also be used to help diagnose a person who is currently infected but whose PCR test results showed a false negative, by waiting a week or so for the body to produce its immune response.“We are excited about the serologic test, but we don’t know how well it will work and we are starting to study it,” said Sampathkumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-false-negative-results-are-complicating-covid-19-testing/story-OUb9172j8D5izwEQLWj98O.html

11-04-2020||World||Coronavirus: Why have so many died in New York?||New York has more coronavirus cases than any country and accounts for around half of all deaths in the United States. Why was is so badly hit and could its leaders have done anything differently?Was New York more vulnerable? As of Friday, New York state has almost 160,000 confirmed COVID-19 infections, more than Europe’s worst-hit countries of Spain and Italy, and over 7,800 deaths.Governor Andrew Cuomo has said repeatedly that density and number of foreign visitors made New York City, which has almost 93,000 confirmed cases, an ideal breeding ground for infectious disease.America’s financial capital has 8.6 million inhabitants. There are 10,000 people per square kilometer, making it the densest city in the US.Millions of commuters brush up against each other on its packed subway system every day, while keeping distance on its sometimes narrow sidewalks can be difficult.NYC gets more than 60 million tourists a year and is the entry point to America for many travelers, meaning anyone carrying the virus is likely to start infecting others there first. American geneticists estimate that it started spreading there from Europe in February, before New York’s first confirmed case on March 1. The Big Apple is also characterized by massive socioeconomic inequality. Overcrowded, deprived areas -- particularly in the Bronx and Queens, where many people already suffer health problems and lack medical care -- have experienced the highest rate of infections.“New York City had all the preconditions that would support the idea that it was going to be hit very hard,” said Irwin Redlener, public health professor and expert in disaster preparedness at Columbia University.Did officials underestimate risk? On March 2, as the state’s second case was confirmed in New Rochelle, just north of New York City, Cuomo said the health care system was the best “on the planet.”“We don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries,” he added.After much hesitation, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the closure of public schools, bars and restaurants from March 16.The governor ordered all non-essential businesses to close and residents to stay at home a week later on March 22.Experts hesitate to say that they waited too long.“The mayor and the governor were being pushed and pulled by two opposing forces. “One was saying we have to close schools and restaurants as quickly as possible, the other saying there were lots of economic and social consequences of shutting down everything early,” said Redlener.“Everyone was getting mixed messages, including from the federal government, from (President Donald) Trump,” he added. Have other states reacted better? California, America’s most populous state, is often cited as a good example for the speed of its response to the outbreak. Its confirmed cases as of Friday were just 20,200, with 550 deaths.On March 16, six counties in the San Francisco Bay area issued a stay-at-home order followed by the whole state three days later.“One thing that I think is significant is that six neighboring counties got together and issued the same (confinement) order for all six counties, and they did it early,” said Meghan McGinty, associate at school of public health of Johns Hopkins University.“There was consistency, as opposed to NYC taking one measure, and Westchester (county) taking another, and Long Island taking another,” she told AFP.Six days passed between New York’s school closure order and its order confining residents to their homes.“In epidemic terms, six days is light years and can really make a difference in the control and spread of the epidemic, so I think it is possible to say that perhaps, in retrospect, New York waited too long,” said McGinty.Is anyone to blame? When the crisis passes, the blame game may begin.Democrats Cuomo and de Blasio deplored for weeks the Trump administration’s delay in getting tests to states, which to this day are still not arriving in sufficient numbers.The New York officials also targeted the federal government for dragging its heels in implementing emergency powers to manufacture lifesaving ventilators.With the toll far exceeding the numbers killed on 9/11, Phil Murphy, the governor of neighboring New Jersey, which has also been badly affected, has called for a commission similar to the one set up to investigate the September 11, 2001 attacks.“The warning signs were there... what happened? If you don’t know the answer, how are you going to make sure it’s not going to happen again?” Cuomo asked Friday.Given the number of dead and millions of unemployed, “we have a moral obligation to study this pandemic,” concluded McGinty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-why-have-so-many-died-in-new-york/story-UN9mHjwGI46DMEr82cg6FL.html
11-04-2020||World||If China is a developing nation, make US one, too: Trump hits out at Beijing||If China is considered a developing country, make the United States too a developing one, US President Donald Trump said on Friday, alleging that Beijing has taken advantage of his country.“China has been unbelievably taken advantage of us and other countries. You know, for instance, they are considered a developing nation. I said well then make us a developing nation too,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus.The president was responding to a question on China. “They get big advantages because they are a developing nation. India, a developing nation. The United States is the big developed nation. Well, we have plenty of development to do,” he said.Reiterating that United States was taken advantage of by the World Trade Organization, Trump said the Chinese economy started booming after it joined WTO with the help of the US.“If you look at the history of China, it was only since they went into the WTO that they became a rocket ship with their economy. They were flatlined for years and years,” he said.“Frankly, for many, many decades. And it was only when they came into the WTO that they became a rocket ship because they took advantage of all -- I’m not even blaming them. I’m saying how stupid were the people that stood here and allowed it to happen,” he said.The Trump Administration will now allow that to happen, he said.“If they don’t treat us fairly, will leave. But now we’re starting to win cases,” he said. Alleging that China has taken advantage of the United States for 30 years, he said, China has taken advantage of the US through WTO and using rules that are unfair to the United States. “They should have never been allowed it, this should have never been allowed to happen”, he added.“When China joined and was allowed to join under those circumstances the WTO, that was a very bad day for the United States because they have rules and regulations that were far different and far easier than our rules and regulations,” he said.“Plus. They took advantage of them down to the last. China took advantage of them like few people would even think to take advantage of them and again they are considered right a developing nation,” he added.The United States, he rued, is not considered a developing nation. “The were given advantages (for being a developing nation). For many years China has ripped off the United States. Then I came along and right now, as you know, China is paying 25 percent,” said Trump, adding that the US is now gaining “billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China”. The US is not paying, he asserted. “Not every country is China but China would devalue their currency and they would also pour out money and they essentially were paying most of those tariffs not us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-china-is-a-developing-nation-make-us-one-too-trump-hits-out-at-beijing/story-Kql2EuhVpPvN0Pu0vQ7sKJ.html
11-04-2020||World||US, China trade blame at UNSC’s first Covid-19 meet||The United States on Thursday called for “complete transparency” in the reporting of coronavirus data at the UN Security Council’s first meeting on the pandemic, in an unmistakable reference to China, which it did not name but has previously accused of concealing the true extent of its outbreak.China hit back calling for the need to oppose “stigmatization” of the crisis and “racial discrimination” in a clear reference to US efforts to pin the epidemic on China, calling it the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus”, which is said to have fueled a spate hate crimes against Asian Americans.The Security Council had been largely missing from action as the coronavirus tore through the world. China, which held the body’s rotating presidency for March, did not allow a debate or a meeting arguing the pandemic was outside the mandate of the Security Council; it was backed by Russia and South Africa.The UNSC finally met Thursday, virtually, at the request of nine of the 10 non-permanent members of the body, but failed to even consider two resolutions that it had expected to take up this week. The UN general assembly passed a resolution last week calling for “intensified international cooperation”.  The UN’s top decision-making clearly remains divided on its mandate and role in dealing with the pandemic that had killed more than 97,000 people worldwide and infected more than 1.6 million, with the United States and China, two of the body’s five permanent members, hit the hardest.“The United States reiterates today the need for complete transparency and the timely sharing of public health data and information within the international community,” said Kelly Craft, the US ambassador to the UN.She added that “accurate, science-based data collection and analysis of the origins, characteristics, and spread of the virus” was the most effective way to tackle the epidemic.While the start of the epidemic in Wuhan, China last December is well documented, its spread around the world has been as a consequence of a combination of factors, with the urgency, or the lack of it, of the response of respective nations playing a key role; how soon they initiated mitigation measures, when they close their borders or shut down travel from affected areas.The Trump administration has been criticized at home for responding late and inadequately, despite the president’s claims to the contrary. And it has been seen to be trying to deflect responsibility by pinning it on China and, lately, the WHO, accusing it of aiding Beijing hide the extent of the outbreak. Trump has he re-evaluating US contribution to the WHO, which is the highest of all at more than $450 million.Trump began calling the virus the “Chinese virus” and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo named it the “Wuhan virus”. Trump has since stopped after he was widely criticized for fanning racial backlash against Asian Americans, who have been subjected to verbal abuse and whose businesses have faced boycott calls. Calling for the international community to “act with solidarity” against the pandemic, Chinese ambassador to the UN Chen Xu, focussed on the Trump administration. “All parties should jointly oppose stigmatization and politicization of public health issue,” he said. “The virus is common enemy for all mankind, which respects no borders and hurts all ethnic groups. Instigating racial discrimination and xenophobia, and creating divisions and confrontations deliberately should be abandoned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-trade-blame-at-unsc-s-first-covid-19-meet/story-msuDWe6FHzildlheUjlfjJ.html

The children will attend the classes from the comfort of their homes, he said.Sisodia also holds the education portfolio in the Delhi government and is widely credited with reforming the state of government schools in the capital and with the introduction of happiness class in the curriculum, which has won international recognition.“Happiness class to be conducted at home for Delhi Govt. school kids. 8 lakh students to join special classes on Happiness Curriculum and Mission Buniyaad at their homes from tomorrow,” said Siodia, in a tweet put out on the Aam Aadmi Party social media account.The classes will likely be held through video conferencing since the schools in the capital are shut due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak necessitating a nationwide lockdown forcing people including the students to stay at home.Sisodia said happiness classes had a role to play in these turbulent times“In these turbulent times, happiness classes will be instrumental in helping us create a positive environment for our kids at home,” he was quoted as saying.Happiness class is conducted in over 1,000 Delhi government schools from Nursery to Class 8. The Happiness period lasts 45 minutes and it is based on human-centric education which includes meditation, value education and mental exercises aimed to reduce anxiety, depression, and intolerance among students.Sisodia also held discussions with Delhi government school teachers on “transforming homes into engaging classrooms” on Saturday.Delhi has recorded a total of 942 cases till Saturday as per the figures made available on the health ministry website.

While participating in the video conference of chief ministers of various states with the Prime Minister, Gehlot said that the decision on the extension of the lockdown should be taken after taking all the states into confidence. The CM pointed out that the ongoing lockdown poses a threat to the livelihood of the ragpickers, hawkers/rickshaw pullers, nomads and other helpless people. In such a situation, the Centre should consider revamping a scheme on the lines of ‘Food for Work’. Food grains are available in bulk with the central government for the operation of such a scheme, he said in a statement. Gehlot said that the proposed scheme was earlier introduced during a famine-drought under the tenure of then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2002 and proved to be very popular and successful. Gehlot said that the Rajasthan government has provided an ex-gratia amount of Rs 2,500 to more than 31 lakh families of the poorer sections who do not come under the purview of social security pensions. The Centre should also devise a similar scheme of ex-gratia payment for this category of people so that they can get financial support, he said. The CM suggested the Centre give concessions in central GST and incentive packages for industries. He requested permission for the state to increase the borrowing capacity and increase fiscal deficit limit mentioned in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). He called for making available Rs 1 lakh crore grant to the state governments at the earliest. After listing out various steps taken by the state government during the ongoing lockdown, the CM emphasised on taking a collective decision by looking to the situation of the individual states and taking the respective state governments into confidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-come-up-with-food-for-work-scheme-for-poor-rajasthan-cm-urges-pm/story-yUWpMO33j4GdVO9XFT4ieK.html

These were called the “Markaz Masjid” cases in the city government’s health bulletins so far.These “special operations” cases (712) account for two-thirds of the 1,069 Covid-19 cases confirmed in Delhi.Of the 166 cases that tested positive in the last 24 hours, 128 cases - or 77 per cent -- were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation.There has been no official word why the Arvind Kejriwal government decided to revise the classification.According to one version, there had been some objection from some people at the government’s description of the cases. The Delhi Minorities Commission, according to news agency ANI, had insisted that the mention of the masjid in the bulletins had led to muslims being attacked and calls made for their social boycott.Also read | 3 more Delhi areas under Covid-19 hard lockdown over Tablighi Jamaat cases“It was felt that the government’s descriptor might be seen to communalise what is essentially a health crisis,” a government official told Hindustan Times.Second, he explained, the change was meant to reflect that the Tablighi Jamaat cases weren’t just restricted to the 2,000-plus people who were evacuated from the Markaz, the seven-storey headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat in central Delhi’s Nizamuddin.The initial burst of Tablighi Jamaat-linked Covid-19 cases were driven by infections among people who had been found at the multi-storey building.But as the days went by, the government figured that the real super spreaders may be people who may have picked up the infection during a visit to the Markaz and headed back home.

It’s a message||Union ministers and all senior officials will again start going to office from Monday, government functionaries told HT, marking a step towards normalcy in the government establishment even as the lockdown is all set to be extended.According to two officials, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked all ministers to start working from office from Monday, a move that is also aimed to instil confidence among the people about how the government establishments are limping back to normalcy even as social distancing and other health norms will remain firmly in place.Senior functionaries said that officers of joint secretary and above ranks will be mandatorily working from office.“In addition, one-third of essential staff will come,” said a secretary-level officer.While the non-essential staff has not been asked to come, the essential staff who stay near the office will be asked to come, according to the official. There will also be a rotation system for the essential staff to ensure everyone gets a chance to stay at home and also meet the obligation of coming to office.Since the lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Modi on March 24, many ministries have been working with just 3-5% of their actual strength, with employees unable to come, and followed the health guidelines.While most of the staff had to remain confined to their homes, top officials often came to office especially since the financial year was coming to an end.Ministries had to file their expenses and submit vouchers to the virtual expenditure logbook of the finance ministry to show how much money they have actually spent in the FY19-20. “The closure of accounts is of vital importance in the government system. Otherwise, release of money would get stuck. So, only a handful of officials would come to office — which is hardly 3-5% of our usual strength to primarily work on the annual closure of accounts,” said an official.Another officer added that while the top brass of the ministries was physically not present, all of them have been working from home and had a pressing schedule especially in handling the crisis situation and ensuring that government’s aid and help reaches the right beneficiaries.Officers held their meetings through the NIA-promoted video conference and files were moved and cleared through the e-office tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-officials-return-to-work-from-monday-as-lockdown-extension-looms/story-GEeDNRsysiK4CW614hDiPM.html

That will save livelihoods,” he said on Twitter.During the interaction via video conference, the prime minister underlined that the motto of the government earlier was ‘jaan hai to jahaan hai’ but now it is ‘jaan bhi jahaan bhi’.Ahead of Modi’s meeting with chief ministers, Chidambaram had urged party-ruled chief ministers to unanimously demand transfer of cash to every poor family.He said the poor have lost their jobs and exhausted their savings and are now standing in lines to get free food.Remonetising the poor would cost only Rs 65,000 crore, which was economically viable, he said.“Chief Ministers - Amarinder Singh, Ashok Gehlot, Bhupesh Baghel,  V Narayanasami, Uddhav Thackeray and E  Palaniswani should tell the Prime Minister today that just as LIVES are important LIVELIHOOD of the poor is important.“The poor have lost their jobs or self-employment in the last 18 days. They have exhausted their meagre savings. Many are standing in line for food,”  he said on Twitter.“Can the State stand by and watch them go hungry,” he asked, noting that CMs should demand that cash be transferred to every poor family immediately. “‘Remonetise the poor’ should be their unanimous demand,” Chidambaram said.

11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Flight services, railway travel may be suspended till month-end||The suspension of commercial flights and railway travel may be extended till month-end as all indications point towards an extension of the nationwide lockdown, which ends on April 14, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with chief ministers on Sunday. While both the civil aviation ministry and the railway ministry have prepared plans on enabling movement once the travel restrictions are lifted, officials aware of the developments said the government is likely to resume transport only after reviewing the number of cases after 15 days. “The sense is that both passenger rail and flight services will have to remain suspended for another 15 days. We had initially estimated the curve would flatten but an unfortunate event occurred and, according to estimates, we would require an extended lockdown. In such a scenario you can’t have flights and trains running to undo all the progress else we might be looking at an ever more prolonged lockdown,” a senior government official said requesting anonymity.An order on the same may soon be issued by the DGCA, a second official said. Hindustan Times on Friday had reported the government is considering dividing the country into a red zone in which no transport will immediately be allowed, a yellow zone where restricted services will resume and a green zone where transport will be allowed free movement.Once restrictions are lifted, the national carrier is planning to ensure strict social distancing norms in trains, which includes mandatory thermal screening and no allotment of middle berth in sleeper. India’s airport sector has also prepared a ‘business continuity plan’ for probable opening of commercial flight operations post lockdown. In a letter written to the civil aviation ministry, which has been reviewed by the Hindustan Times, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has asked for extra security measures to be implemented for the safety of its personnel. “After completion of the lockdown period, if commercial aircraft operations resume in the domestic sector, there will be challenges to keep the CISF personnel and other stakeholders safe from the Covid-19 infections. The CISF has prepared a ‘Business Continuity Plan’ for opening of commercial aircraft operations from the security perspective of aircraft operators, airline operators and CISF personnel,” the CISF wrote to the civil aviation ministry. The plan includes setting up of separate earmarked, isolated security checking facilities across airports for carrying out security check of passengers, crew and others, who have undergone home quarantine or hospital quarantine during the last one month. It also proposes airlines should spread out the flight timings, to avoid gathering of a large number of passengers. “Reporting time for passengers to the airport should be increased up to 120 minutes, so that passengers may smoothly pass through all the channels like access control, random screening, check-in, Immigration (in case of International passengers) by maintaining appropriate distance,” the letter said. Aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is also preparing a standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure social distancing among passengers and reducing contact with staff on board. This includes measures like leaving the middle seats empty. Airports will have to ensure that bunching of passengers is avoided while boarding and also that there is adequate spacing between passengers in queues.All passenger transport has been suspended for the three-week long lockdown period that began on March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-flight-services-railway-travel-may-be-suspended-till-month-end/story-qiwx3mdplWhEYcb0341euK.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19 Update: Goa is quietly scripting a success story with declining active cases||Goa’s tally of active Covid-19 positive patients dropped further to two on Saturday after four patients tested negative for a second time in 24 hours and were declared to have recovered from all symptoms, ready for discharge from the hospital. The development brings good news for state administrators at a time when positive cases in other states, including neighbouring Maharashtra, are on a steady rise. Health Minister Vishwajit Rane said Goa was left with only two Covid-19 positive patients.“We are happy to inform that samples of 4 patients were tested again as per protocol and reported negative. We are following all the guidelines of ICMR and as per the procedure, we have conducted all the necessary tests,” Rane said. Rane went ahead to congratulate the team of state doctors who provided medical care to the patients.“My heartiest congratulations to the team of doctors at ESI Hospital (the state’s dedicated Covid-19 hospital) under the guidance of Dr. Edwin Gomes and his team for doing a commendable job by providing state-of-art patient care and ensuring complete recovery. Kudos to the entire team & their dedication in these difficult times,” Rane said. Goa had seven positive patients in total including the one who recovered earlier and was discharged. The Goa government has, however, recommended to the Prime Minister that the lockdown be continued until April 30, while allowing the resumption of some economic activity within the state, but without interstate movement of people. The state government has also rolled out a community survey that will begin from April 13, in which enumerators will fan out across the state asking residents for their travel history and presence of any influenza-like symptoms. “The data of this survey will help us roll out mass testing if certain hotspots of influenza-like illness are found or alternatively it will help us declare that Goa is in the safe zone,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-goa-is-quietly-scripting-a-success-story-with-declining-active-cases/story-KfJ7iZT9KfUvQH79oKDhrI.html

As per health department’s statistics, over 90 per cent of the cases are asymptomatic—without the symptoms of Coronavirus such as sore throat, high fever and diarrhea.Director of National Health Mission in Odisha, Shalini Pandit said till now, the state was testing just about 400 samples a day, in three laboratories including Regional Medical Research Centre in Bhubaneswar. “With the installation of a Cobas 6800 machine, the second such machine in India, at least 600 additional samples can be tested using the PCR method, taking the total to more than 1000,” said Pandit. Till Friday night, Odisha had tested 3547 samples while Maharashtra had tested 32051, the highest in the country.She, however, clarified that the increased sample testing may happen from Monday as the team was getting ready. “There is a particular style of mixing and extracting chemicals. The team is getting trained on it,” she said.Officials said apart from testing people who had returned from abroad as well as those who had attended the religious congregation of Tablighi Jamaat last month, the government is doing random sampling for asymptomatic as well as symptomatic cases.“We are bringing random people in containment zones as well as from outside the zones to sample collection centres opened in schools for collecting their nasal swabs. Before the lockdown ends, we want to be sure that there is zero community transmission of Covid-19. The frontline health workers who are going house to house are also being tested. For all positive cases, we are testing 40-60 people who came in contact with them on flights or trains. So far none of them have tested positive,” said Pandit.Director of medical education, Dr CBK Mohanty said the state has sought two lakh testing kits, including rapid testing kits, to cover a large number of migrants who will return to the state after the lockdown ends. The antibody testing mechanism with 80-90 per cent accuracy would reduce the load on the State Government to screen and quarantine people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-machine-to-help-odisha-in-race-against-time-to-rule-out-community-transmissions/story-CLZxPbSXPpOUg6wSceBeON.html

All the other districts have also crossed the double-digit mark.“It is a pleasant surprise to witness Srikakulam and Vizianagaram reporting zero positive cases for Covid-19. Apparently, both the districts were alerted much earlier than the other districts and have been able to contain the spread of the disease,” state health and family welfare commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar said.The Tablighi Jamaat congregation held in Nizamuddin, New Delhi, which had resulted in a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in many parts of the country, had a severe impact on entire Andhra Pradesh, but not in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram.“We, too, have traced 27 people connected with the Jamaat directly and indirectly, and all of them had been kept in isolation. Similarly, there were 1,445 people who had returned from abroad and another 4,271 people who had been in direct contact with them. Only four of them had some symptoms but none of them tested positive. Now, everybody is in quarantine,” Srikakulam district medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr M Chenchaiah said.He attributed the zero positive cases in the district to the early intervention by the district authorities, including the police and the medical department staff. “We have taken up surveillance activities much earlier than any other part of the state. We ensured that none of the foreign returnees and their contacts came out of their homes by pasting posters on the gates and alerted their neighbours to inform the cops if anybody came out,” Chenchaiah said.The district authorities also enforced the lockdown strictly and arrested people who deliberately violated the restrictions. “Fortunately, the awareness levels in the district are very high and they are fully cooperating with the authorities. Our medical and police surveillance teams are conducting door to door surveys to see that there is not a single suspect,” he said.The DMHO said the authorities were vigilant over the reports that there was a possibility of some suspects from Nellore, Guntur and Visakhapatnam entering Srikakulam. “We are sending any suspicious case to the isolation centre,” he said.Vizianagaram DMHO S V Ramana Kumari said swift and prompt action was taken by the district authorities to quarantine 434 foreign returnees and for the monitoring of their health.She, however, added that luckily, there was not a single case of Tablighi Jamaat returnees in the district. “That perhaps saved us. We have no problem from other people, who are fully cooperating with us in the quarantine centres and none of them tested positive,” she said.Click here for live and latest updates on Coronavirus||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-andhra-districts-with-zero-covid-19-cases-are-setting-an-example/story-eHQZlYgXVZe641ObZqQMsO.html

Out of ten new cases, seven have been reported from Kannur in north Kerala and 1,23, 490 people are under observation in the state, he said.In Kannur, a cured woman gave birth to a baby after C-section surgery and both are in good health, he said. The doctors performed the operation wearing PPE kits and the baby will be kept away from the mother for a few days, said doctors of the Kannur medical college hospital. In an advanced stage of pregnancy she had tested positive last month and was shifted to an isolation ward. Later she tested negative.There is a little confusion over the death of the latest victim, a 71-year-old resident of Mahe which is part of Puducherry. Admitted in the Pariyaram Medical College in Kannur he died in the early hours of Saturday. He was suffering from multiple complications and was on ventilator support for the last two weeks, health minister K K Shailaja said. Later, his body was buried under strict protocol in Kannur and only four family members were allowed.Kerala was the first state in the country to report coronavirus cases and has the least number of deaths and a good recovery rate. The CM said the recovery of a large number of people was a good sign but it was too early to relax norms.“Recovery of many patients and less number of people turning positive are good signs. It shows we have a good grip on the disease but if some lapses take place things will change. So we have to keep our surveillance up,” he said. He gave enough hint that the state was in favour of extending the lockdown but least affected areas will have to be eased. The CM said in the meeting with the Prime Minister that the state sought more financial help and food grains. The state has also asked for non-stop trains to ferry migrant workers who are camping in 10,000- odd camps in the state. He sought special flights to bring back stranded expatriates in the middle-eastern countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-records-third-covid-19-death-10-more-people-test-positive/story-E3iUPHt3wtAVMmeoEOTdcL.html

A total of 586 hospitals in India have been identified as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals with a capacity of over one lakh isolation beds and 11,500 ICU beds reserved for coronavirus patients, according to Union Health Ministry data.At least 1,035 fresh Covid-19 cases and 40 deaths due to the deadly disease have been reported in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 7,529 and the number of deaths to 242 nationwide. “The government has taken early pre-emptive action to identify Covid-19 hotspots in the country.

The lockdown was scheduled to be lifted on Tuesday. PM Modi also marked a shift in tackling the pandemic, from saving lives to saving both lives and livelihoods.Soon after the meeting with the PM, the Maharashtra government on Saturday decided to extend the Covid-19 lockdown till April 30 with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray underlining that it may be further extended if people did not cooperate.The chief minister said it looks like the situation is under control, but one will have to be cautious. Maharashtra is the third state to extend the lockdown after Odisha and Punjab.In Karanataka, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa announced that the statewide lockdown will be extended for another fortnight after April 14, but with certain relaxations for agricultural and industrial sectors to ensure minimal impact on the economy. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday suggested to the Centre to lift the lockdown and confine it only to the red zones which have reported a larger number of Covid-19 positive cases.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, however, pitched for extension of the nationwide lockdown for two more weeks to ensure that the Covid-19 crisis remains under control.The chief ministers of both the Telugu states-- Jagan Mohan Reddy and KCR expressed their views to the Prime Minister during the video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-242-coronavirus-deaths-total-number-of-positive-cases-touch-7-529/story-cERoESocgfW3Zq38ESnosN.html

The railways has set a target of converting 20,000 coaches to counter the pandemic, of which 5,000 coaches with 80,000 beds are ready to be deployed, the ministry said. “The idea of converting these coaches was to ensure that in rural areas, in regions where medical facilities were not available, care for Covid-19 patients could be provided. The health ministry would guide us and we will deploy these trains. We will maintain them and make sure they are in good condition,” an official said. He also said that if required railways could also provide the linen to be used in such coaches, but they will be for one time use only. The official also said that the railways is also contemplating how the train, which will be non-air conditioned, can be insulated against the summer heat. Officials say that there there were discussions within the railways to see if trains like the Lifeline Express can be produced where doctors would take care of all kinds of patients or something like the accident relief trains which are equipped with operation theatre. However, the ideas were dropped because producing such trains would take more time and it was pointed out that the railway isolation units had been prepared as Level 1 Covid-19 Care Centre facilities. There will be 10 coaches in each of these trains with the capacity to hold 16 patients in each. Officials say one airconditioned coach could be attached to these trains for doctors and other medical staff. The death toll due to the novel coronavirus rose to 239 and the number of cases to 7,447 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry. While the number of active Covid-19 cases is 6,565, as many as 642 people were cured and discharged and one had migrated, it said. As many as 33 new deaths have been reported since Friday evening, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-railways-converts-5-000-coaches-into-isolation-wards-awaits-govt-direction-on-deployment/story-QL8CQyGZMgZOFmX2qPOVzN.html

Agricultural and industrial sectors will be given relaxation. Government offices will function with partial strength and the additional guidelines stated by the PM would be issued in the next couple of days,” the CM told mediapersons after a nearly four-hour long video conference that PM Modi has with all CMs.Karnataka becomes the first BJP-ruled state to extend the lockdown. It is also the fourth state after Odisha, Punjab and Maharashtra to do so.Karnataka recorded eight new positive cases bringing the total to 215, with six deaths. Bulk of the new cases were recorded in the Mysore district.Even as the CM appealed to the citizens to follow the lockdown strictly, his own party MLA from Turuvekere Masale Jayaram celebrated his birthday grandly on Friday with about 100 children and adults being served biryani. An FIR has been registered by the local administration against the legislator for not maintaining social distance during the event. On Saturday five policemen, including an SP and four others, attached to Kamaripete police station were home quarantined after they had gone to collect the details of a Covid-19 suspect.Former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda today donated Rs 1 lakh each to the PM Cares Fund, the Karnataka CM Relief Fund and Kerala CM Distress Relief Fund, according to a tweet from his official handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-karnataka-extends-lockdown-by-2-weeks-throws-in-some-relaxations/story-03KKPWk1Hu6Xe2ThcFhBWI.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid heroes: 500km apart with no phone, postman connects elderly brother and sister||Two days before the nationwide lockdown began on March 24, Anupama Byatnal, 60, received a text message from her 65-year-old brother who lives in Hubli, Karnataka – “My phone is not working, can’t make calls.” A few days into the lockdown aimed at curtailing the spread of Covid-19, even the text messages stopped. Then for the next 10 days, there was no word from Satyapriya Vaidya, who lives by himself in rented accommodation in Hubli. Anupama, who too lives alone at Ahmednagar in Maharashtra, couldn’t help but worry about whether he was okay and he had enough rations to get by. Having exhausted all options to contact him, Anupama turned to what is often considered a relic of the past — the local postman. Anupama, a former postal department official, was aware postal services were functional as they fall under the Essential Service Maintenance Act. “For three days, I called the BVB Engineering College post office’s landline but no one answered,” she said. “It was on Thursday that I got through and they gave me the local postman’s number.” Within half an hour, the postman reached the address given by Anupama. At first, Vaidya was confused why a postman had come looking for him. “I’m okay,” he told his sister as the postman explained she was worried sick about him. “I’ve been trying to reach you too but hadn’t written down your number so I could not call.”The postman was 43-year-old Bharamappa Kaddi, who has been working in the area for the past decade. Kaddi, who usually works eight hours a day, has been putting in longer shifts ever since the lockdown began.“We work on a rotational basis,” he said. “I come to work three to four days a week and don’t leave till all tasks are finished. When ma’am called me, I was about to leave for distribution.” Using a bicycle, Kaddi traverses four areas, covering 18km a day. According to him, since Prime Minister Narendar Modi announced the lockdown, distribution of letters and parcels has reduced. But whenever a mail carrier was allowed across the border, work increased. “Earlier this week, I got a call at around 11pm to come to work the next day to distribute the mail,” he said. For him, however, the call from Anupama was out of the ordinary. “It was the only such request I have received. Madam called the office and they gave her my number. She was so happy to speak to him, that it made me feel overjoyed. I even told him to make sure he stays in touch with madam in future,” he said. Kaddi lives in a village 43km from the post office. He uses a scooter, borrowed from one of his neighbours, to reach work. “Many of the people in the area I work for are poor, some are handicapped. It’s tough to get to work during the lockdown, but how can I not come to serve my country,” he said. For Anupama, the incident holds a lesson. “We depend so much on technology, but that can fail us too,” she said. “I have now written down all important numbers in a diary and sent my daughter, Amruta, who lives in Delhi, my neighbour’s number.” She feels content knowing her brother is doing fine and adds, “As a former employee, I’m so proud of the work being done by the postal department in these trying times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-heroes-500km-apart-with-no-phone-postman-connects-elderly-brother-and-sister/story-cLWkT92OzFJNhsJoBtUDMO.html
11-04-2020||India||Odisha ambulance driver alleges he is being ostracised by villagers for carrying Covid-19 patient||A private ambulance driver, who brought a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive patient from Odisha’s Kalahandi district to a hospital in Cuttack, has been forcibly quarantined by his family members and villagers at a state government-run facility in disregard to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plea to support frontline healthcare workers combating the viral outbreak.On April 5, Banamali Sethi, a private ambulance driver of Dadpur village in Kalahandi district, had taken the 29-year-old Covid-19 patient to a hospital in Cuttack. His family members and the villagers denied him entry to the village on April 6, as they were afraid that he might have contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and ensured that he stays in quarantine for 14 days.“I was meted out this harsh treatment because I had taken the Covid-19 positive patient to a hospital in Cuttack in the ambulance,” said Sethi. He has been staying in the quarantine facility on the outskirts of his village since April 6. The villagers refused to be convinced by the healthcare workers, who tried to reason with them that Sethi had taken all precautionary measures, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) units such as masks and gloves, while ferrying the Covid-19 positive patient to Cuttack.Kalahandi district collector (DC) Dr Gavalli Prashad weighed in on the villagers’ unreasonable behaviour. “Sethi couldn’t have contracted the infection because of the partition between him and the patient. We booked a private ambulance, as the one owned by the government doesn’t have a partition. He was given all the PPE units in line with the World Health Organisation (WHO) protocol. The vehicle was sanitised after it came back to Kalahandi from Cuttack. There is no cause for concern,” Prashad said. Initially, the DC said, Sethi refused to ferry the Covid-19 patient to Cuttack, but he relented after much coaxing. “We had sent another driver as a back up to Sethi. We’ve spoken to his family members and have convinced them that his health is not at risk,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-ambulance-driver-alleges-he-is-being-ostracised-by-villagers-for-carrying-covid-19-patient/story-SwPEiJ3Ninw4EkQEgmrFiO.html

While cutting vegetables for sambhar or cooking rice workers of Sewa Bharati, social wing of the RSS and Democratic Youth Federation of India, CPI(M) youth wing, rub shoulders. Workers of Youth League and Youth Congress are also there. In certain pockets of Thalassery both RSS and CPI (M) fiercely guard their villages affiliated to them and their political opponents are unwelcome here.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.“It is no time for politics. Our CM has given an open call to engage everyone in the community kitchen. Our only concern is to feed empty stomachs. We don’t go by the colour of the flags here,” said Thalassery MLA A N Shamseer. Sub-collector Asif K Yousef is co-ordinating everything in the gigantic effort to rope in groups of different ideologies in the fight against coronavirus.“Feeding poor is a national movement. Prime Minister Modi said helping others is the best thing to do in trying times,” said BJP leader M P Sumesh.Meanwhile, Kerala police on Saturday arrested three more workers of the ruling CPI(M) for allegedly vandalising the house of a girl who was in quarantine in Thannithod in Pathanamthitta district. Earlier police had arrested three persons while three others were absconding.They attacked the house alleging that her father violated quarantine norms and came out frequently. The incident which happened on Tuesday had embarrassed the government and Chief Minister Vijayan had promised strict action against offenders.Police said the girl who studies in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu had returned home recently and was in home quarantine as instructed by health officials. Her father, a cable TV operator, had isolated her in a room and he used to go out to collect food which angered many people in the area. Initially they sent a message on WhatsApp threatening them but when he filed a complaint their house was attacked, police said.After the attack the girl filed a complaint with the CM and sought police protection for her family. “It should not have happened in a state like Kerala. Offenders never deserve any sympathy,” the CM had said. Later the Pathanamthitta district committee of the CPI (M) had suspended all from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-pandemic-brings-sworn-enemies-together-in-north-kerala/story-8ZgsN36D1wplP65KZosGEK.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19 halts J&K’s annual ‘Darbar Move’ for the first time in 144 years||The annual “Darbar Move” in Jammu and Kashmir – the shifting of the administrative machinery from Jammu to Srinagar in the spring that has a history of 144 years – won’t be fully completed this year due to concerns related to the Covid-19 outbreak. The union territory’s government has accorded sanction for the formal opening of offices for the summer session in Srinagar from May 4 following their move to Jammu for the winter. However, only employees from Kashmir will make the move once offices close in Jammu later this month.According to the order issued by the general administration department (GAD), the Civil Secretariat in Jammu will remain functional in view of the extraordinary circumstances arising from the pandemic. Besides, employees who had moved to Jammu will work on an “as is where is” basis – Kashmir-based staff will work from Srinagar and Jammu-based staff will work from there.“Further, Move offices outside the Civil Secretariat shall also continue to remain functional at Jammu/Srinagar, as per the aforementioned mechanism. Administrative Secretaries shall make necessary arrangements to ensure the functionality in their respective departments, both at Srinagar and Jammu,” the order said, adding similar arrangements will be put in place by heads of Departments affected by the “Darbar Move”.The Civil Secretariat Treasury and the J&K Bank’s moving branch at the Civil Secretariat will function at both Jammu and Srinagar. The finance department will put in place a suitable mechanism for this purpose.Employees of the Kashmir Division affected by the move and who now need to travel to Srinagar for the “Darbar Move” during April 25-26 will be provided transport by the Jammu and Kashmir Road Transport Corporation. They will also be issued passes for movement on the national highway.The administration intends to review these arrangements after assessing the extent and spread of Covid-19 after June 15, the order said.However, the order has raised many eyebrows, with former chief minister Omar Abdullah questioning the decision in a series of tweets. “If it is safe for Kashmiri employees to move to Srinagar why not Jammuites?” he said.He also tweeted: “If the files remain in Jammu what work will the Kashmiri employees do in the Srinagar secretariat? If the files move to Srinagar what work will be done in Jammu?”Describing the order as mindless, he tweeted, “This order regarding the bi-annual ‘durbar move’ is just mindless rubbish at worst & needless tokenism at best. So the offices can’t shift to Srinagar because of #Covid_19, I get that. What I don’t get is what Srinagar secretariat will do without files or senior officers?”He noted most Kashmir-based employees are currently in Jammu as the secretariat was functioning in that city during winter. “If Srinagar Secretariat has no employees, no officers & no files what is it being opened for?” he asked.Abdullah contended the order would only lead to confusion and demanded its withdrawal. He also said the “Darbar Move” should be put off till the threat posed by Covid-19 has passed. “This order of two ‘functioning secretariats’ will just create confusion because no one will know which secretariat to approach to get their work done,” he tweeted.He also questioned why non-J&K employees and officers led by the lieutenant governor don’t move to the Kashmir Valley as scheduled.The annual “Darbar Move” was started by the erstwhile Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Ranbir Singh, in 1972. However, 33 years ago, when former chief minister Farooq Abdullah tried to end the annual shifting, protests by a cross-section of society in Jammu forced him to change his mind.After the revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution last August, there is a strong feeling in the Kashmir Valley that efforts are being made to disempower the local people. The Jammu and Kashmir high court on Saturday sought information about the implications of the Darbar Move amid the pandemic after two Kashmir-based lawyers questioned the “advisability” of the annual exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-halts-j-k-s-annual-darbar-move-for-the-first-time-in-144-years/story-0V3TASFRh5FuLrTIejpDYI.html
11-04-2020||India||From Covid-19 lockdown extension to exit, what chief ministers told PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a virtual meeting of chief ministers on Saturday to decide on the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown that ends on April 14. PM Modi didn’t elaborate on the mechanics of the plan that he had in mind but spent most of the meeting listening the chief ministers. A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office later said chief ministers of most states were in the favour of extending the lockdown. Some also spoke about allowing the resumption of economic activities in a manner that is not counter-productive to the united fight against the coronavirus disease. The prime minister has also indicated that the government’s motto had changed in the last two weeks from ‘Jaan hai to Jahaan hai’ (life is above all) to ‘Jaan bhi, jahaan bhi” (lives and livelihoods, both matter).Several chief ministers spoke their mind on the Covid-19 pandemic and how their state intended to move forward. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that PM had decided to extend the lockdown and added that it was the right decision to make.“PM has taken the correct decision to extend lockdown. Today, India’s position is better than many developed countries because we started lockdown early. If it is stopped now, all gains would be lost. To consolidate, it is imp to extend it,” he twitted.Karnataka’s BS Yediyurappa said PM Modi “told us that we must not compromise on lockdown and we are receiving suggestions for extending it for next 15 days”. According to news agency ANI, Yediyurappa said the prime minister had told them that the central government will announce guidelines for next 15 days in a day or two. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that while PM had spoken about extending the lockdown, “it could be relaxed in some places and made more stringent in some others”. She added that her government was on the “same page” as the prime minister.“We are also on the same page with PM, want lockdown extended till April 30,” she said, according to PTI.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who heads the state with the most number of coronavirus cases in the country, said he had informed PM Modi that his state will extend the lockdown till April 30.Puducherry CM Narayanasamy said that while PM Modi agreed with the majority view to extend the lockdown, he also spoke of a graded resumption in commercial activity in some sectors of the economy.“PM felt farm activity should continue and said guidelines would be issued by Centre on the construction industry in a graded manner,” Narayanasamy said.Click here for live and latest updates on CoronavirusChhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel suggested that the restriction on the interstate road, rail and air travel should continue. However, he sought resumption of economic activity within the borders of the state.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is reported to be one among the very few heads of states to have demanded that the lockdown be confined only to the ‘red zones’ that have reported a large number of Covid-19 positive cases.“While I support the steps being taken by the Centre to contain the Covid-19 situation, I also feel that the wheel of the economy should continue to run, if not with full speed, but to the extent of providing basic necessities to people,” Jagan said.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was not in favour of any relaxations and sought an extension to the nationwide lockdown for two more weeks.For all latest stories on coronavirus“The lockdown has helped contain the spread of the virus to a large extent and there is no other way but to extend it for another two weeks to flatten the curve,” KCR said.Similarly, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh asked the PM to extend the national lockdown. Punjab has already decided to extend the restrictions for another fortnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-lockdown-extension-here-s-what-chief-ministers-advised-pm-modi/story-KJmvuFSIk63yJKhRotxRnL.html
11-04-2020||India||Delhi-based doctor appeals to Supreme Court, urges it to tweak order on free Covid-19 tests||Burdening private laboratories to offer free Covid-19 tests will disincentivise their continued functioning posing a grave risk to people’s health, a plea filed before the Supreme Court on Friday stated seeking modification of the apex court’s April 8 order directing private laboratories to offer free coronavirus tests.The plea by a Delhi based doctor, Kaushal Kant Mishra submitted that only economically weaker sections of the society should be allowed to test for coronavirus free-of-cost in private laboratories and the government should reimburse the labs immediately after such a test is conducted.“If the Government does not provide immediate reimbursement to the private laboratories, there is a real risk that the laboratories may stop testing for Covid-19, thus posing a direct and inevitable risk to the health of people across India through unknown transmission and contraction of the disease,” the application filed by Dr. Mishra said.Besides seeking modification of the April 8 order, Dr. Mishra also sought establishment of pathogen laboratories in local municipal and panchayat areas so that free testing by the government can be increased.The Supreme Court had on Wednesday made tests for Covid-19 in private laboratories free, and asked the government to pass the necessary orders so as to make this possible. The tests are already free in government laboratories.According to a March 17 advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, private laboratories were allowed to charge upto Rs. 4,500 to test for Covid-19.Advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi had moved the Supreme Court seeking free testing for Covid-19. He had pointed out that government hospitals are packed to capacity making it difficult for the common man to get himself/herself tested in the government labs.With no alternative in sight, they are forced to pay money to get the tests done at private labs, Sudhi said, adding that saddling ordinary citizens with such financial burden effectively deprives them of their accessibility to medical facilities and is violative of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.“We find prima facie substance in the submission of petitioner that at this time of national calamity permitting private labs to charge Rs.4500 for screening and confirmation test of Covid-19may not be within means of a large part of population of this country and no person should be deprived from undergoing the Covid-19 test due to nonpayment of capped amount of Rs.4500,” the court had ordered on Wednesday.The apex court, during the hearing that day, also asked the government to explore a way to reimburse private laboratories, although it did not pass any order to this effect.Dr. Mishra, who is a senior Orthopedic surgeon, formerly at AIIMS, and presently at the super-specialty Primus Hospital, in Chanakyapuri submitted that several citizens have now been admitted and confined to hospitals and other facilities as Covid-19 suspects, but their test results remain pending for long periods, putting a strain on the system.“Even the present capacity of the labs, both government and private appear to be woefully insufficient to obtain accurate data and control the pandemic”It was his plea that in such a scenario, casting the additional burden of offering tests for free could lead to private labs stopping their functioning altogether.“..at a time when testing across the country has to be ramped up and the nation enters the most critical phase, the private labs have been burdened with offering free testing, ignoring the fact that the few pathogen labs which are well equipped at the time of the disaster would be actually disincentivized to continue to function,” the plea said.Few of the private laboratories, he submitted, have reservations about going ahead with testing unless it is clear about where the funding for the same would come from.“There does not appear to be a clear commitment from the governments, either Central or State to take on any extent of the burden…Mumbai based Thyrocare has already said that it is putting its Covid-19 testing on hold until there is further clarity on the finances,” Dr. Mishra submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-based-doctor-appeals-to-supreme-court-urges-it-to-tweak-order-on-free-covid-19-tests/story-qfbmjCdejKn7djEKYT5MNL.html
11-04-2020||India||In one line, PM Modi hints at his stand on conditional lockdown extension||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday tweaked the government’s approach to the 21-day lockdown ordered last month to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus disease. The prime minister, who interacted with chief ministers, stressed that the new challenge was not only to save lives, but livelihoods also.PM Modi underlined that the motto of the government earlier was ‘jaan hai to jahaan hai’ [when you have life, you have the world].“Now it is ‘jaan bhi jahaan bhi’ [save life, and livelihood],” he said, signalling a shift in the Centre’s approach. PM Modi didn’t elaborate. An official in the Prime Minister’s Office later said he would finalise the country’s strategy closer to April 14 after some more deliberations.Incidentally, chief ministers of several opposition-ruled states such as Punjab and Maharashtra have gone ahead to extend the lockdown. In contrast, NDA chief ministers have left the decision to PM Modi who is expected to take a more nuanced approach.“The extension of lockdown this time will be conditional so that the economy also gets kickstarted in crucial areas,” said another PMO official.Also watch | PM Modi interacts with chief ministers of states: Key takeaways India was one of the few countries in the world to have imposed a national lockdown long before the disease started spreading in the country. A study by the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government says India was quicker than almost every other country in imposing a lockdown on March 25.Also read | Considering request, says Centre on CMs’ pitch to extend Covid-19 lockdownThis approach, the Health Ministry said after the prime minister’s video conference, had helped control the spread of the disease. The government pointed to estimates that had projected 8.2 lakh Covid-19 cases in the country by April 15 if the government had not implemented the containment or nationwide lockdown. The cases were projected to drop to 1.2 lakh cases if India only took containment measures but did not enforce the lockdown.Since the government has acted, India only has 7,447 cases on April 11, the health ministry said. Having seen the efficacy of the lockdown to stop the spread of the disease that has killed more than 100,000 people across the world, most chief ministers advocated extending the lockdown by another two weeks.At Saturday’s meeting, PM Modi, according to an official statement, “emphasised the criticality of coming 3-4 weeks” to determine the impact of the steps taken till now to contain the virus.But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is deeply conscious of the impact that the lockdown is having on the poor, and the economy in the long run, a senior government official familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.At this stage, there is a view in the government that a blanket extension of the lockdown by another two weeks would be the easier thing to do. The more difficult would be getting the country, economy and the lives of people back on track without compromising lives.This is the blueprint that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been working on.The broad principle that has been underlined at many of the meetings being held to firm up the lockdown strategy is to recognise that there are many parts of the country that do not have a single case of coronavirus, or even a suspected case. The lockdown could be eased in such areas. “You need to recognise the fact that nearly half of all the Covid-19 cases in the country are reported from just three states: Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu,” a government official said.Besides, when PM Modi takes the call on the national lockdown, the official said, he will account for the fact that the harvesting season begins from April 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-one-line-pm-modi-hints-his-stand-on-conditional-lockdown-extension/story-GI9GSuJQQYO1miVdNwBYKI.html
11-04-2020||India||India sends rapid response team to Kuwait to fight Covid-19||India on Saturday despatched a medical rapid response team to Kuwait to boost the West Asian country’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic by helping in the testing and treatment of infected people.The Indian government has created several rapid response teams following the Covid-19 outbreak and it recently offered to send them to friendly countries to help in efforts to prevent and control the spread of the Coronavirus. The 15-member Indian team was sent at the request of the Kuwait government.The team of Indian doctors and healthcare professionals will “supplement the efforts of the government of…Kuwait in the collective fight against global Covid-19 pandemic”, the external affairs ministry said in a statement.The team, which was flown to Kuwait in an Indian Air Force aircraft, is expected to stay there for two weeks, during which it will “render medical assistance in testing and treatment of the afflicted persons and training [Kuwaiti] personnel”, the statement said.“India’s RAPID RESPONSE TEAM arrives in Kuwait. Follow up to the discussion between our two Prime Ministers on #COVID19. Underlines the special friendship between India and Kuwait,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted.“India is reaching out to Kuwait in the extended neighbourhood to further complement its efforts to fight the menace effectively,” the statement said.India earlier sent a similar team to the Maldives and has plans to send another to Nepal.The deputation of the Indian experts followed the phone call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Sabah al-Khaled al-Hamad al-Sabah on April 1, when the leaders agreed on concerted and coordinated efforts against the pandemic.Jaishankar and his Kuwaiti counterpart also had a telephone conversation to discuss the situation in Kuwait and to explore ways to strengthen cooperation during these challenging times, the ministry said.India and Kuwait have a strong partnership based on historical, cultural, economic and people-to-people-contacts. Indians constitute the largest group of expatriates in Kuwait, with an estimated population of about 1 million and their annual remittances are estimated at $4.8 billion. India has also been among Kuwait’s top 10 trading partners, with bilateral trade worth $6.2 billion during 2015-16 despite a drop in the value of India’s imports due to the fall in oil prices and a cut in the volume of oil imports from Kuwait.During his conversation with Modi, the Kuwaiti prime minister said his country greatly values the contributions of the Indian community and will continue to ensure their safety and welfare in the current situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-rapid-response-team-to-kuwait-to-fight-covid-19/story-umTw0fYhrqnsAdo7kBJfFK.html
11-04-2020||India||Third ash-pond disaster in Singrauli in one year||The ash dyke breach on Friday at Sasan Ultra Mega Power Plant in Madhya Pradesh’s (MP) Singrauli is the third ash pond disaster in a year in the district, which is a “severely polluted” area as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) assessment. The CPCB has asked Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) to investigate the incident that allegedly damaged large tracts of agricultural land and killed two villagers. Four other villagers are still missing.The CPCB is yet to release its 2018 assessment of critically polluted industrial clusters and act on them.“We’ve asked the MPPCB authorities to investigate the case. There was an ash dyke leakage and low-lying areas were flooded with slurry. The investigation can conclusively prove whether was any negligence that caused the incident,” said Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB.Reliance Power, which runs the plant, said in a statement on Friday evening: “We are deeply anguished by the incident involving the break in the ash dump yard wall at our Sasan power plant. The break-in ash dump yard wall pushed the water leading to break … we are closely working with locals and district administration in relief and restoration work.”Last August there was a fly ash pond breach at Essar’s Mahan Power Plant in Singrauli district, leading to damage of crops of about 500 farmers in three villages. On August 8, 2019, Essar had said that the ash dyke was breached by an act of sabotage and the land that was damaged was non-agricultural. Last October, a fly ash pond of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had breached, damaging 30 acres of land and several cattle were also found missing. “Assessments were made of earlier incidents as well. We’re checking if compensation was paid for the losses incurred by the villagers,” Gargava said.“This time the extent of the damage is massive. The ash pond broke around 5:30 pm on Friday and the slurry entered around 40 houses. Those (four) missing may have died. The mud wall around the pond was weak and gave way. Prime facie it appears that negligence caused the incident. People are already suffering because of loss of livelihoods amid the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Who will compensate for the huge loss of farmland?” asked Jagat Narayan Vishwakarma, an environmental activist from Vanavasi Seva Ashram in Singrauli.These successive incidents ring a warning bell for Singrauli, said experts. “Singrauli as a region has nearly 23 GW (gigawatts) installed coal-based capacity, which is more than 11% of the total installed capacity in the country. This dirty energy source has become a curse for the people living in the region. The air they breathe is polluted, the water they drink is contaminated and their traditional livelihood, which was heavily depended on forests, has been destroyed by rampant coal mining,” said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).“The ash dyke breach should not be considered as a one-off accident or a minor incident of non-compliance. Singrauli, like many other areas in the country, is a critically polluted area, with acute land, air and water contamination. Several regulatory agencies and court-based monitoring mechanism are in place to ensure exiting illegalities are acted upon and impacts redressed. This breach has taken place, despite the mechanisms,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.Earlier, the CPCB had submitted a list of 100 critically and severely polluted industrial clusters, which were monitored in 2018, in Singrauli, which straddles both MP and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, to the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Later, the tribunal referred to the list on July 10, 2019. The NGT in its order had directed that “the CPCB in coordination with state pollution control boards to take steps in the exercise of its statutory powers under air Act, water Act and environment protection Act or any other law to prohibit the operation of polluting activities in critically and severely polluted clusters within three months.”But neither the CBCB nor the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) made the list public.The findings of the assessment are being considered by the ministry and are likely to be released soon, said Gargava. The assessment of industrial clusters is based on the CPCB’s comprehensive environmental pollution index (CEPI), a framework for identifying critically and severely polluted industrial clusters in the country. The score is calculated based on the scale of industrial activity and scale of compliance of environmental standards such as air, water and soil pollution.Singrauli has a score of 62.59 as per the latest assessment. Tarapur in Maharashtra, Najafgarh drain, Anand Parbat and Okhla in Delhi and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh are the three most critically polluted clusters in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-ash-pond-disaster-in-singrauli-in-one-year/story-w9mksJAao8DcsTrkJijUbN.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Slum dwellers at risk, experts suggest enhanced monitoring||Cases of slum dwellers in two urban centres in Maharashtra and West Bengal testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have raised concerns s about the vulnerability of the inhabitants of these areas, short on space and basic amenities.Of the 116 fresh Covid-19 cases reported from Mumbai on Tuesday, two were from Dharavi, one of the world’s most densely populated slums. In Kolkata, too, two pavement dwellers were detected positive for Covid-19.While authorities are tracing their travel and contact history, experts suggest there is a need to revisit how social distancing is being imposed in these slum clusters during the ongoing lockdown, which may be extended well beyond April 14.Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based think tank, Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said the lockdown has been largely successful in urban areas, among the middle and the upper classes because of a lot of social vigilantism, but the same cannot be said for those living in slum clusters or in areas inhabited by lower income groups.“Residents’ welfare associations are taking extra care; there is limited entry of people, quarantine notices were put up on houses with members having travel history and effective monitoring is being done, often at the irritation and violation of privacy of the affected households. But we are really worried that the hot spots should not extend to the rural areas, low income areas and slums in towns and cities,” he said.The union health ministry on Tuesday cited an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study that claims a Covid-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures such as lockdown and social distancing are not implemented.But is social distancing conceivable in slum dwellings where an average family has four to five people living in a single room?Kundu said the concept of social distancing is difficult in lower income groups because of the lockdown, since most of them spend more time in confined spaces.“As per Census 2011, about 25% of the people living in urban slums still have to go out for toilet and drinking water; for them the lockdown means standing in long queues (where social distancing is not possible). About 45% of these people are workers mostly employed in informal sector. They are not allowed to go out unless they are part of the essential services,” he said. Lack of amenities, such as potable water and toilet facilities, also forces these people to break the social distancing protocol.“The sense of hygiene maintenance in India is already compromised. For people in slums, access to space, safe water and privacy is a daily struggle that has been heightened by the lockdown, so the immediate steps that can be taken now are focusing on the most susceptible in this group, those above 60,” said Manoj Misra, head of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, a non government organisation that works for the revival of the Yamuna.Another aspect that threatens to weaken the social distancing protocol has been the movement of migrant workers, most of whom live in slums.While the union government has asked all states to ensure that manufacture, production, transportation and other related activities in the chain of supply of food, medicine and medical equipment are maintained, and instructed industries not to cut jobs or withhold wages, many slum dwellers have moved back or are wanting to head back to their own villages.“Based on the data of the 2011 Census and two rounds of NSS data, one would estimate the total number of interstate migrants as 67 million of which 20 million are workers. As per estimates of this, 6 to 7 million are those who are employed in the casual sector and face the threat of losing their jobs; another 6 to 7 million are what are classified known as a ‘regular” workers by NSS but they’re in the informal sector. So in all, about 12 million are likely to face job cuts. Then, there are the ‘self employed’ small vendors -about 8 million of them; half of them are interstate migrants and many of them would want to go back to their homes,” said Kundu.He said while the government works out the details of whether to extend the lockdown, it should consider certain relaxation for travel and work for these migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-slum-dwellers-at-risk-experts-suggest-enhanced-monitoring/story-mQuodw7igpLwtsG6nHxVjN.html
11-04-2020||India||I swear, I won’t||Sonakshi SinhaThis lockdown should be a huge wakeup call to every human being on this planet. Environmental issues such as climate change have happened because of us. There are certain changes that we can make in our lifestyle when it comes to saving water and power and not using private vehicles and take care of the entertainment. We need to think about these things and keep them in our minds once the lockdown is over and we start going out again.Sanya MalhotraHuman beings can quickly adapt to any change. I’m positive that once we’re up and about, we’re going to lead life differently. I’m sure that we will ensure that the pollution levels don’t rise again, be mindful of the food we’re eating and ensure sustainable use of our resources. I’ll keep it in my mind about how the world around me changed for good when we were inside our houses.Sobhita DhulipalaIn the initial days of the lockdown, I was scared that my life was over and I was frantically thinking about how we’ll accommodate the days later on. But I reminded myself that I shouldn’t let my work consume me so much. Who’re we if work is taken away from us? I’m very much obsessed with productivity. I don’t like the feeling of just whiling my time away. I go to the other extreme where I become a workaholic even if I’ve a free slot, I’ll make myself busy. I will change that part of my life and be good to myself henceforth.Aparshakti KhuranaI don’t think I have ever taken work or relations or any aspect of my blessed life for granted. If there’s something that I didn’t pay much attention to, but now am taking into account, would be the need to warm up pre-workout and cool down post. This is the only time I’ve been able to do that and now I can actually see the positive effects it has. So once the lockdown is over, I am not going to take warming up and cooling down for granted, having said that, very few people will be able to feel one with this thought.Jacqueline FernandezDuring this period of lockdown, I have realised that you should never take your near and dear ones for granted. My family is scattered across different parts of the world, and I so wish to be with them right now but unfortunately, can’t. I think we should make the most out of the moments we have with our family so that we have memories to cherish when we can’t be together.Pankaj TripathiThrough this lockdown I have realised that we used to take nature for granted. I don’t know how many people are aware of this, but in cities like Mumbai, we have seen a 80% drop in pollution levels. I have noticed that we can see the stars more clearly in the night sky. After this lockdown, I will make sure I don’t take nature for granted any more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-swear-i-won-t/story-8zGAIRoscOVVkE9d4ve8mL.html

There had been speculation that the PM could address the nation following his video conference with chief ministers where many of them suggested that the lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus be extended by two weeks.In March, Modi had addressed the nation twice. The first time was on March 19 when he called for a “janta curfew” for March 22. The second was on March 24 when he announced the 21-day lockdown that was to end on April 14.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.The end of the lockdown now seems unlikely with most chief ministers batting for an extension. PM Modi has agreed that continuing the lockdown is a must.He emphasized the criticality of coming 3-4 weeks for determining the impact of the steps taken till now to contain the virus, adding that teamwork is the key to facing the challenge, the PMO said in a statement.Watch| PM Modi interacts with Chief Ministers of states: Key takeaways On Friday, Punjab and Odisha had already extended the lockdown till April 30. At Saturday’s video conference, chief ministers of Punjab and Delhi were among those who strongly pitched for extending the lockdown.After the video conference, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that the state will remain in lockdown till April 30. Maharashtra has recorded the highest number of coronavirus positive cases.More than 7,500 people have been affected by coronavirus in the country so far while 242 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-address-to-the-nation-by-pm-modi-today-says-govt-official/story-G6cNKpHqm93XqihfbLBedK.html
11-04-2020||India||Andhra wants lockdown restricted to red zones; KCR demands 2-week extension||Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday suggested to the Centre to lift the lockdown and confine it only to the red zones which have reported a larger number of Covid-19 positive cases.On the other hand, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao pitched for extension of the nationwide lockdown for two more weeks to ensure that the Covid-19 situation remains under control.Both Jagan and KCR expressed their divergent views during the video conference held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with all the chief ministers of the state.Jagan said the continuance of the lockdown would have serious long-term impact on the state economy and the lives of common people. “While I support the steps being taken by the Centre to contain the Covid-19 situation, I also feel that the wheel of economy should continue to run, if not with full speed, but to the extent of providing basic necessities to people,” he said.Several crucial sectors like agriculture, aquaculture and industries will suffer heavily resulting in large scale unemployment. Out of 1,03,986 industrial units in the state, only 7,250 units are running and the distribution network has been badly hit due to complete halting of rail and road transport systems.“Millions of workers will not get salaries due to lack of industrial operations and the revenues of the state will see a steep fall, as a result of which it cannot implement any development and welfare schemes,” the Andhra chief minister said.Jagan pointed out that out of 676 mandals (revenue blocks) in the state, 37 mandals are in red zone, another 44 in orange zone and the remaining 595 mandals are in green zone. “I suggest that the lockdown should be confined only to the red zone mandals,” he said.He also pointed out that places of mass gatherings like malls, cinema halls, and places of worship, public transport and educational institutions could continue to be in lockdown. “In other places, steps should be taken to ensure that people maintain social distance,” he said.The Telangana chief minister said at a time when the entire country was together fighting against the Sars-Cov2 virus, there should be no let-up in the spirit. “The lockdown has helped contain the spread of the virus to a large extent and there is no other way but to extend it for another two weeks to flatten the curve,” he said.KCR, however, appealed to the Prime Minister to see that food processing industries run without any hurdles and to ensure that farmers did not face losses and the supply chain of essential commodities would continue. “Steps should be taken to run rice mills, oil mills and other agro-based industries,” he said.He also called for linking agriculture with the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme for at least two months to provide wages to agriculture labourers, so that it would reduce the wage burden on the farmers.He also suggested distribution of three-month quota of food grains to ration card holders at a time, so that it would free the warehouses to accommodate new arrival of food grains from the markets.The Telangana chief minister also recommended release of more funds to the states to the extent of five per cent of the GSDP by adopting “quantitative easing” method so that the states could get out of the financial crisis.He appealed to the Centre to take initiatives in extending a moratorium on loan repayments by the states for a period of at least six weeks and increase the borrowing limit of the states by raising the cap of FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management) limit from three per cent to five per cent of the GSDP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-wants-lockdown-restricted-to-red-zones-kcr-demands-2-week-extension/story-EOk2xCmZNnFh3T1DBLII1I.html
11-04-2020||India||No betting, kids||As children are confined to their homes due to the corona virus pandemic,they are discovering ways to spend time with friends so that they fill the long hours of the day. Classic board games with classics like Ludo, Uno and Monopoly, among others are back from the brink to beat lock down boredom but with a twist. Online versions of the game had already made it popular among millennials. But one of the things that it has led to is illegal betting which has become a cause of concern for many parents. Rohit Gupta, a 37-year-old software expert reveals that the found out that his eight-year-old son Parth was playing ludo and placing bets via paytm, “My son casually asked me to transfer his pocket money to Paytm like every month. I decided to give him only Rs one thousand as he didn’t have school or any activities to attend. In just two days, I saw that Rs 300 had already gone and I realised that he was playing online games with actual money. I couldn’t believe these kids have taken up on betting. I have taken the remaining money back.”Punit Shah a businessman from suburban Mumbai discovered that his 13 year old son Aarav was playing Monoploy with real money, “He came to me and asked for Rs 500 which he said he owed to his friend who stays in the same building. At first he told me that he had borrowed money but later he revealed the real reason and said he lost while playing the game. I asked him to immediately uninstall all the games from his phone.”On the other hand, Aarav feels that it’s just for fun and are also collecting money for donations, “We just place friendly bets. We keep aside some money from each game that we play. My friends and I have collectively decided that at the end of 21-days we will donate the entire amount. Aarav’s friend Palash Mehta argues that they are anyway saving money by not going out, “How does it matter if we spend a few bucks? We aren’t going to any coffee shops or restaurants. We are doing it just for fun.”Child psychologist Vijay Kamath feels that this behaviour could also led to bullying, “If any child loses, and isn’t a position to pay money, it can have an adverse effect. Also, I believe most children pick up these habits from their parents and we have seen how Diwali card parties have become a common trend in today’s time. Monitoring what the child plays or watches is also very important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/no-betting-kids/story-A5qTtT7GivSIYiLdG06lkI.html
11-04-2020||India||Without containment and lockdown, Covid-19 may have spiraled to 8.2 lakh cases by now: Govt||The government on Saturday said that the country’s response to coronavirus pandemic has been pre-emptive and proactive to the extent of being over-prepared which has helped in preventing a ballooning in number of positive cases, which could have even reached a figure of 8.2 lakh by April 15 in the worst-case scenario.The health ministry presented two different hypothetical scenarios of the growth of coronavirus in India if steps were not taken to contain it.According to the first scenario, if India had not implemented either containment or nationwide lockdown, allowing for a 41% growth rate of Covid-19, then the positive cases could have spiraled to 8.2 lakh as on today.“A statistical analysis of rate of growth suggests that if there was no lockdown or containment measure then the cases growing at 41 per cent rate could have resulted in 8.2 lakh cases by Apr 15,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry.The second scenario measures the efficacy of containment measures alone, without taking into account the additional benefit accrued from the implementation of the three-week-long national lockdown, to say that a total of 1.2 lakh positive cases could have been reported by April 15 if the peak growth rate of the disease (28.9%) seen before the implementation of lockdown had sustained.“Before lockdown, the highest rate of growth of cases was at around 28.9 % and at that rate perhaps the numbers could have risen to 1.2 lakh cases by April 15, and if we compare it to the situation after the implementation of lockdown and containment measures after March 25 then we have seen a significant reduction in the number of cases,” Agarwal added.The third scenario is the current situation which is not hypothetical projection but the reality of 7447 positive cases in India on April 15. The health ministry official said this reduced figure (compared to the other two scenarios) has been made possible only due to the twin impact of containment measures and the nationwide lockdown. Click here for live and latest updates on CoronavirusThe ministry clarified that the first two scenarios are based purely on a statistical analysis involving the rate of growth of coronavirus cases. The data is then projected using variables to arrive at the possible number of positive cases in two different situations. It is implicit that several other variables that have an impact on the spread of the contagion have not been considered for this analysis. The purpose of this exercise is to underline the importance of containment measures and the nationwide lockdown in keeping the number of infections in India from growing exponentially, like seen in Europe and the US. The discussion on the analysis came on a day when prime minister is expected to decide if the lockdown period has to be extended beyond April 14. Most chief ministers have suggested an extension of the lockdown. The prime minister is said to be considering their suggestions.

Thackeray also said that while making the implementation stricter in the second phase, some of the sectors will be excluded and the government is working on it. The CM further said that 60 to 70 per cent positive patients in Mumbai have mild symptoms.Maharastra is the worst-hit state by coronavirus, with 110 dead and 1,574 casesEarlier in the day, several chief ministers impressed upon Prime Minister Modi to extend the national lockdown, which ends on April 14, to contain the highly contagious coronavirus disease.The PM not spell out his decision on the lockdown at the meeting. An official spokesperson confirmed that most states had requested the Centre to extend the national lockdown.“The Central Government is considering this request,” KS Dhatwalia, the government’s principal spokesperson KS Dhatiwala, said.Thackeray said that the issue of the extension of the lockdown was discussed in the review meeting with the PM. “I was asked to speak first about the Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra and ongoing lockdown. I informed the PM that Maharashtra is going to extend the lockdown by two weeks. The second phase of the lockdown will need to be strictly followed with more restrictions on the movement of the people. But there is not other way out to fight the war against the pandemic,” he said.Mumbai breached the 100-patient mark on March 31, almost three weeks after a couple from Andheri were identified as the first to be infected by the disease in the city. On April 2, the city’s tally crossed 200 and since then cases have tripled in the past week. The first Covid-19 death in Mumbai was recorded on March 17, when a 64-year-old man succumbed to the infection at Kasturba Hospital.Health officials in the state, which has been the worst hit in the country, have said the number of Covid-19 cases has recorded a 147.8% jump since April 4 – a week – when there were 635 infections.More than 500 cases of coronavirus disease were reported in India in the last 12 hours, bringing the number of Covid-19 patients to 7447 on Saturday, the Union home ministry data showed.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-extends-covid-19-lockdown-till-april-30-3rd-state-to-do-so/story-eoi5kMzcIapCg9R5pS8oKO.html

And so, the actor has offered his hotel in Juhu, Mumbai for healthcare workers where they can stay. “They’re the real healers. They are staying away from their families and are risking their lives. They’ll continuously be exposed to the danger until we finally get rid of this virus. They don’t have any place to rest in the hospitals,” he says.The Happy New Year (2014) actor feels that it was important to extend a helping hand to those who’re working on the field round the clock. He says, “I offered my hotel to them so that they could rest, save their travel time and spend more time serving the society. Breakfast and dinner will also be provided to them. The idea is to make them feel comfortable.”Stressing on how doctors and nurses are being ill-treated by the society who fear contracting the virus from them, he elaborates, “It’s really unfortunate that people don’t respect the kind of sacrifice that they’re making. It’s time to recognise the hard work that they put in. They, along with their families, should be provided with the best of the facilities. Doctors and other healthcare staffs are the only walls that exist between us and the virus. The only way to help them is by being kind.”Sood feels that the health crisis should call for a better healthcare infrastructure so that the infected is given the best possible care. “It’s time to build more hospitals than temples. We need to get a good healthcare system for the country and I hope that our efforts towards that continue even after the COVID-19 situation,” he signs off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-offered-my-hotel-to-health-care-staff-so-that-they-could-rest-sonu-sood/story-60pt8CC0LB5GT04zxGudCI.html

He, however, said the labs can do the testing for the EWS categories with immediate reimbursement by the government.The senior surgeon has also sought a direction to the authorities to “forthwith set up testing labs in all municipalities and panchayat areas”.Issuing the no-charge order, the Supreme Court had observed that private labs need to be philanthropic during a national crisis. Prior to this, the government allowed some private labs to charge Rs 4,500 for screening and confirmation tests for Covid-19. Mishra’s plea said the apex court’s order has “disincentivised” the labs to continue to function “at a time when testing across the country has to be ramped up”.“In the UK, private labs are charging as much as $425 per test, which is equal to Rs.32,500,” the pleas aid.It said forcing private entities shall create a sharp dip in an “already below par testing rate for Covid-19” and if the government does not provide immediate reimbursement, there is a real risk that the private labs may stop testing for Covid-19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “The message that has been sent out by the WHO Chief as early as the middle of March is to ‘test, test, test’...

The secretary of state is allowed to exceptions consistent with US foreign policy interests, the memorandum states.The visa sanctions will no longer be applicable if the secretary of homeland security declares that the foreign country has “resumed accepting aliens without unreasonable delay”.The memorandum will be valid till December 31, unless it is extended.The memorandum emphasised the need for cooperation between the State Department and the department of homeland security in view of the “profound and unique public health risks posed by the novel (new) coronavirus”.The move comes at a time when the Indian government has asked the US to extend the validity of visas, including H-1B and other types of visas, held by Indian nationals who have been hit by the Covid-19-related economic slump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-threatens-visa-sanctions-on-countries-who-refuse-to-accept-repatriation-of-nationals/story-cPgislpFUxPN8MpSNOyNYK.html

11-04-2020||India||Afghanistan rejects Pakistan’s demand to hand over ISKP leader Aslam Farooqi||The Afghanistan government has rejected Pakistan’s demand for handing over Islamic State of Khorsan Province (ISKP) leader Aslam Farooqi, saying he will be tried under Afghan laws for crimes committed in the country.Pakistan had on Thursday demanded the handing over of Farooqi, a Pakistani national with long-standing ties to the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. Farooqi was captured with 19 other members of ISKP during an operation by Afghan troops on April 5.The Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement in Dari issued on Friday: “Aslam Farooqi is the leader of the ISIS group who has committed many crimes in Afghanistan. He is accused of leading a series of operations that have resulted in the deaths of many civilian Afghans and soldiers. He will be treated according to the laws of Afghanistan.”The statement said another reason for treating Farooqi under Afghan laws is that “there is no agreement between Pakistan and Afghanistan on the extradition of criminals”.“Afghanistan does not discriminate against terrorists [and] unlawful behaviour and is committed to all anti-terrorism commitments,” the statement added.The foreign ministry statement suggested there could be exchanges of information under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS), “which will help fight terrorism”.Several of the terrorists captured with Farooqi are Pakistani nationals, Afghanistan’s spy agency or National Directorate of Security (NDS) has said.Farooqi has been linked to the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed more than 25 people, including an Indian national. Indian security officials have said the ISKP targeted the Sikhs after being unable to attack the heavily fortified Indian mission in Kabul.Pakistan’s Foreign Office had demanded that Farooqi be handed over as he “was involved in anti-Pakistan activities in Afghanistan”.Indian and Afghan security officials have been sceptical about Pakistan’s demand. They said it appeared the Pakistani side was more worried about what Farooqi could divulge about his long-standing links to the Pakistani military establishment during his interrogation.The ISKP has claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Afghanistan’s minorities such as Hazara Shias and Sikhs. However, it has been put on the backfoot after coordinated operations by Afghan forces in Nangarhar province since November led to the surrender of hundreds of the group’s fighters and sympathisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghanistan-rejects-pakistan-s-demand-to-hand-over-iskp-leader-aslam-farooqi/story-GAmWKefrCohEPbocmFPHoO.html

11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Centre exempts fisheries sector from lockdown||The Union government on Saturday exempted the fisheries and the marine food industry from the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The government issued a fresh list of exemptions as they form a part of the farm-to-fork supply chain. Fisheries is a part of the agriculture sector and along with aquaculture production contribute around 1% to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and over 5% to the agricultural GDP. The exemptions include feeding and maintenance of fisheries, harvesting, processing, and packaging. It also covers cold chain, sale and marketing, hatcheries and movement of fish and marine food products.“As specified in the lockdown measures, social distancing and proper hygiene practices must be maintained in each of the above activities,” an order of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) stated while exempting the fisheries sector.An official of the animal husbandry department said keeping in view of the potential fisheries resources in the aquaculture, inland fisheries, coastal and marine fisheries, the Centre will continue administering schemes under the umbrella “Blue Revolution Scheme” for the overall development of the sector.The Centre has over the past week has taken a series of steps to shore up the agriculture sector in view of the lockdown.The Centre on Friday recommended states to suspend certain provisions of their respective Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts for three months to allow farmers to sell their harvest from multiple locations and to any buyer.The APMC Act regulates buying and selling of farm produce in about 5,000 mandis or markets across the country, which fall squarely in the domain of the state. The Act empowers states to notify markets to cater to a specific area and farmers can sell in their designated markets only.“Farmers should be able to sell to any buyer. Otherwise, all farmers of an area will converge on a single market, which will obstruct the principle of social distancing,” Union Minister of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar had said in a press conference held via video link. “States have been requested to sidestep this mandi Act for three months,” the minister added.Procurement of wheat is slated to start on April 15. The Centre has also asked states to start procuring 25% of pulses and oilseeds under its price support scheme.On April 9, the agriculture ministry issued orders, invoking the market intervention scheme, which will allow the Centre to compensate horticulture farmers for a dip in wholesale prices and damages to harvested fruits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-exempts-fisheries-sector-from-lockdown/story-u2Vx8asl2mpuDKlDwtlDdO.html
11-04-2020||India||At PM’s video conference, Capt Amarinder moots extending Covid-19 lockdown||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday recommended extension of the national lockdown by at least a fortnight in addition to special concessions for industry and agriculture sectors urgently amid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.He also asked for faster supply of rapid testing kits during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference with chief ministers, the chief minister’s office said in a statement.The chief minister also suggested a slew of health and relief measures.“There was huge uncertainty about the likely incidence of disease and the nation was in for a long fight. Given the trend in China and several European countries, it was necessary to continue the lockdown,” Captain Amarinder said.Click here for full coronavirus coverage.“Though the restrictions were causing a lot of hardship to the people, India could not afford to take any chances. The people of Punjab have a high morale, and will continue to support government efforts to combat the pandemic,” he added.The lockdown which came into force on March 25 was intended for 21 days but many states now want it extended. He said the state government had already decided to go for curfew/complete lockdown till May 1, with all educational institutions to be closed till June 30, with state Board examinations also deferred till further orders. Section 144 remains in place, along with prohibition of public service vehicles till May 1.With harvesting and procurement operations set to begin in Punjab next week, the Chief Minister reiterated his demand for bonus to farmers to incentivize staggered/delayed procurement of wheat. He also called for quicker movement of food grains lying in FCI godowns in Punjab, along with waiver of three months’ interest on crop loans and deferment of recovery of crops loans by commercial banks.The Punjab CM sought a Special Risk Insurance for all government employees, including police personnel, sanitation workers and all other employees, who are working day and night in these trying times. “It was important for the Centre and States to keep the morale of people and frontline workers (Health staff, police. Sanitation workers, etc) high,” he stressed.Underlining the need to substantially increase the number of tests being done and go for rapid testing, at least in the state’s hotspot areas of Nawanshahar, Dera Bassi and Mohali, the Chief Minister said the Central Government should hasten supplies of required testing kits.Punjab has already ordered 10 lakh such kits from ICMR, while raising inquiry about another 10000 in the open market.The Chief Minister further requested Rs 500 crore for quick upgradation of infrastructure of government hospitals in Punjab, which is currently at stage 2 of the pandemic and has a large NRI population. He also called for speedy approval, on priority basis, by the Centre to the state’s proposal for Rs 550- crore project to set up an Advanced Centre for Virology in Punjab.On the relief measures needed urgently, the Chief Minister urged the Centre to defer recovery, and waiver of interest and penalties, on industrial loans for six months. Emphasising that the industrial establishments could not continue to look after their workers, and even pay their salaries for the period of lockdown, for a long time, he asked the Centre to think of some innovative solutions for Relief to Daily Wage Workers and Industrial Labour either through ESIC funds or under MNREGA. “The Government of India may allow village Panchayats and Municipalities to utilize the 14th Finance Commission Grants for emergency relief including food and medicines for the poor and needy”, he suggested.Thanking the Centre for releasing substantial funds since the last meeting, Captain Amarinder stressed the need for early release of pending arrears of GST on priority to help the state.Punjab has recorded 151 positive cases of coronavirus so far. Eleven people have died so far, with 17 of the 22 districts affected and 15 having more than 3 cases each. Mohali has the maximum of 48 positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-pm-s-video-conference-capt-amarinder-moots-extending-covid-19-lockdown/story-IddtYo3mS4NXqIvzjs5UNI.html
11-04-2020||India||MSME ministry suggests opening of units in areas that aren’t classified as Covid-19 hotspots||Manufacturers should be allowed to resume operations in areas that aren’t classified as coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots and where the virus hasn’t spread widely, subject to the condition that they strictly follow sanitation and social distancing norms to curb the spread of the outbreak, says the ministry micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) .The suggestion was put forward by the ministry to the Prime Minister’s Office for consideration. Nitin Gadkari, who is in charge of the MSME portfolio, said on Saturday that the ministry was also working out guidelines in collaboration with state governments on how to bring back migrant workers to restart production in the MSME sector. Tens of thousands of migrant workers have returned home to the countryside because of the coronavirus lockdown.The minister, who also oversees road transport, highways and shipping, said in a video chat that his departments had responded positively to the suggestion that production as well as construction of roads and highways be resumed in areas that are not affected by the pandemic so that the impact of the lockdown is blunted. Gadkari, however, stressed that the onus will be on the owners of MSME and construction units and contractors to ensure that their facilities are safe for workers and that there are provisions for food, shelter and healthcare. “There are nearly 20 lakh migrant workers in government-run camps, many are stuck midway. We have to bring them back and district collectors will have to give permission for that. We are working to removed bottlenecks with the help of state governments; but the factory owners will have to ensure that workers are looked after,” the minister said.He said over 600,000 MSMES had been restructured before March and he is hopeful that another 800,000-1 million more will be restructured in the coming months.Since the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 to check the spread of the coronavirus; only industries that are involved in the production of essential goods services are allowed to function.The sector with 6.33 crore MSMEs that together employ an estimated 11 crore people is staring at an acute financial crisis after production came to a grinding halt and has urged the union government to announce a financial package similar to the PM-Kisan scheme, reopening industries where work from home is impossible and complete waiver of bank charges to help them recover.The ministry of MSME is working on steps to get industries Covid-ready; which means making changes that will allow workers to resume work even as they stick to the norms of social distancing and do not violate the conditions laid down for maintaining hygiene.On the financial front, the ministry has drawn up a proposal to expand the reach of its Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) scheme that offers guarantee cover for the portion of credit facility not covered by collateral.In the partial collateral security model, micro and small industries are allowed to obtain collateral security for a part of the credit facility. The remaining part of the credit facility, up to a maximum of Rs2 crore, can be covered by the credit guarantee scheme.“So far Rs90,000 crore has been insured under the scheme by the trust that has a base capital of Rs10,000 crore,” said a government functionary. “The revival plan will also look at how MSMEs can reinvent to improve productivity. The ministry is working out the details of how to help the productions units adapt to change and the challenges imposed by the pandemic. There could be consultations using IT-enabled platforms to help the MSMEs evaluate their productivity and make changes that can lead to growth and enhanced capacity. We can share best practices with them to help them meet global standards, produce cheap and world class products,” the person said.Gadkari expressed the hope that manufacturing will pick up pace and India will be in a position to not just export more but also cut its dependence on China.Also on the agenda is pacing the sanctions under the Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries or SFURTI, that supports traditional village industries by offering financial assistance of up to Rs2 crore.The ministry wants to alter the slow pace of getting projects off the ground under SFURTI; apart from relaxing norms such as doing away with the need for permission from the states to kick-start projects; it will put the onus on implementing agencies to cut delays.“We will have more technological intervention and webcams on the site to see where delays are taking place. We are also making use of technological centres or tool rooms across the country where high-end machinery is installed that can be used by smaller producers or for skilling purposes. For instance the leather tool room in Chennai is being used to stitch PPEs {personal protective equipment} for healthcare workers,” the functionary cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msme-ministry-suggests-opening-of-units-in-areas-that-aren-t-classified-as-covid-19-hotspots/story-8FPwSugNNDnEPUS1BipeiL.html
11-04-2020||India||Exercising, running: Craze for army recruitment beats Covid-19 fears in west UP villages||The nasty and infectious coronavirus may have brought cities to a halt and sent people scurrying indoors but has failed to dampen the fervour of hundreds of youngsters in west Uttar Pradesh villages who aspire for recruitment in the armed forces and police.To them, it is of no consequence that the recruitment rallies have been postponed due to corona outbreak. Fascinated with the ‘uniformed job’, they are using the time to prepare for the fitness test so that their dream may come true.Groups of youths can be seen working on their exercise regimen and running on village roads every morning, some taking adequate precautions while others are nonchalant.Fitness and completing a run of 1600 metres ahead of other competitors is the first key to success. And to succeed in their efforts, they are out to even beat the looming danger of corona. Every morning and evening, the youth come out of their houses to do their exercises and running practice to keep their chance of getting selected in the next recruitment rally alive. These high spirited youngsters can be seen stretching, jogging and running on all roads passing through villages. Their concentration is solely on recruitment, with no thought to spare about corona times.Titu Pehalwan of Syal village heads a group of 20 to 25 youngsters of his village which is dominated by the Gujar community. On being asked about the danger of corona, he carelessly says,” Corona will do nothing to us. We are Gujars and will beat it off.” His disciples burst into laughter in unison.Almost 20 kms away from here on the outskirts of Amhera village, Shoaib Ali, Paritosh Sharma, Akash Siwach and Sumit are stretching to prepare for the 1600- metre run. But unlike Syal youths, they are taking all precautions during their exercise. “We are educated and pursuing bachelor’s course. So we are aware of the importance of social distancing and sanitization. We wear masks, keep bottles of sanitizer and maintain a safe distance from each other,” explains Shoaib who had participated in two recruitment rallies of the army in the past but couldn’t qualify. Explaining the recruitment procedure, Paritosh Sharma clarifies that all aspirants gather on a ground and are asked to run 1600 metres. The authorities get a few frontrunners separated from others. These lucky separated aspirants then undergo a written test followed by a medical test and other formalities.Prince, Abhishek and Saurabh of Gawdi village say, “That is why a run of 1600 metres is key to open the lock of our luck and we are aiming at the next recruitment rally without fearing corona.”Luvkush Gujar and Anuj Kumar of Syal say,” We can’t ruin our preparation for corona. The recruitment rally was to be organized in May which would be delayed because of lock-down but we need to keep ourselves prepared for a tough competition “. In fact, youngsters in villages of the entire region which includes Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Meerut, Baghpat, Hapur, Bulandshahr and Ghaziabad districts, are fascinated with recruitment in the army, paramilitary forces and police. Recruitment rallies draw a heavy influx of youngsters who prepare throughout the year to get their dream job.Shoaib Ali says, “Getting a uniformed job elevates the status of the youths and their families in villages.”An 18-year-old of Gawri village has another explanation. “These jobs suit us after getting substandard education in colleges and schools of villages and nearby towns”. His friend Abhishek explains further, “Most parents can’t afford costly education and so they encourage their wards to try for these jobs which require more physical fitness than good educational profile. And it also fulfills the wish of getting a government job.” The fascination for the ‘uniform’ has existed here since decades. Sandeep Pradhan of Sial village claims that over 300 to 400 people of his village are either in the army, paramilitary forces or UP and Delhi police. It has become an undeclared tradition in the village for youngsters to get themselves recruited and those who are in such jobs have turned their role models.Saidpur in Bulandshahr district is a village which not only has a reputation of being a patriotic village but its military legacy is also a matter of pride for its residents. It has a history of serving the armed force since the First World War (1914-1919). A group of 155 soldiers of this village participated in the First World War and 29 of them laid down their lives for the motherland during British rule. The village has an inter college which has been named Military Heroes Memorial Inter College. The villagers claim that at least 2,500 people of the village are still serving in the armed forces and police and almost every house has an ex- serviceman. Lt General (retd) Kapil Agarwal, who belongs to Meerut, digs into history to explain the reason behind the fascination for the armed forces in the region. He reminds that Meerut has a big Cantonment since British period and was a centre of Punjab, Sikh and Dogra regiments till 1980. Recruitments in these regiments were carried out in large numbers through recruitment rallies. These regiments have been shifted but the Cantonment still has two major fighting formations, which have officials and jawans in big numbers.He says,”Youths watch them doing physical training and running and find their lifestyle fascinating. Besides, many of their elders had served in the armed forces since decades and they also encourage young members of their families to join the forces, which offer one of the finest jobs in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exercising-running-craze-for-army-recruitment-beats-covid-19-fears-in-west-up-villages/story-ujUOzvvZirseX8zyXbP2iJ.html

The Central government is understood to have also obtained views on the issue from all the relevant agencies and stakeholders involved in the efforts to contain the spread of the pandemic.The video conference, which began at 11am, comes amidst indications that the central government may extend the nationwide lockdown with some possible relaxations even as Punjab and Odisha have already announced extending the lockdown beyond April 14 when the current spell of 21-day shutdown across the country ends on Tuesday.The Union Home Ministry has sought views of state governments on various aspects, including whether more categories of people and services need to be exempted. In the current lockdown only essential services are exempted.This is for the second time the prime minister is interacting with the chief ministers via video link after the lockdown was imposed.During his April 2 interaction with chief ministers, Modi had pitched for a “staggered” exit from the ongoing lockdown.A PTI tally of numbers reported by various states as on Thursday at 9.30pm showed a total of 7,510 having been affected by the virus nationwide so far with at least 251 deaths. More than 700 have been cured and discharged. However, the last update from the Union Health Ministry put the number of confirmed infections at 7,447 and the death toll at 239.Addressing floor leaders of various parties who have representation in Parliament, Modi had on Wednesday made it clear that the lockdown cannot be lifted in one go, asserting that the priority of his government is to “save each and every life”.According to an official statement after the Wednesday interaction, the prime minister told these leaders that states, district administrations and experts have suggested extension of the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.Before the lockdown was announced on March 24, the prime minister had interacted with the chief ministers on March 20 to discuss ways and means to check the spread of the novel coronavirus.

11-04-2020||India||Transgenders dip into their savings to feed the poor in West Bengal||Sajani Devi, a transgender person, earned their livelihood by begging from Majhpara villagers in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district until the state reported its first coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive case on March 17.Devi and her four disciples’ lives have undergone a radical change since then. They have become providers to the villagers, who gave them alms for all these years, in the district’s Beldanga-1block.They are dipping into their meagre resources to buy food for these villagers amid the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown that started on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. They are distributing 3 kilograms of rice, 1.5 kg of potato, 500 grams of onion and an equal quantity of salt, 200 grams of puffed rice and a packet of soybean to each villager. The distribution is being held in strict adherence to social distancing norms.“The lockdown has hit us hard. We’ve been deprived of our daily income, as we can’t go out to beg. I’m giving back what I got from the villagers for long. We’ve helped 300 villagers so far,” said Devi.“Most of these villagers are poor. Though the state government’s ration shops are distributing rice and essential items for free, unfortunately, the quantity isn’t sufficient for many families,” Devi added.“We started buying the provisions for the people from Majhpara, Sahebpara and Paharipara villages after some of them approached us if we could organise dry food through our community, which is known for its wide network,” Devi said.“Most people in our society look down upon us, suspect us and call us all kinds of names. I hope our initiative will encourage the rich to contribute more to the vulnerable sections of the society during this unprecedented emergency,” Devi added.Rahamat Sheikh, a villager who received dry food packets from Devi, agreed with the transgender person’s perception. “We used to treat them harshly before the Covid-19 outbreak. The crisis has made me realise how sympathetic and sensitive the transgender people can be. It’s a lesson we should never forget,” Sheikh saidBeldanga-1 community block development officer (BDO) Birupakshya Mitra, who was present during the food distribution programme, praised the transgender community members’ generosity amid the healthcare crisis. “It’s a laudable initiative. I hope more people will come forward to help the poor during this crisis,” the BDO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transgenders-dip-into-their-savings-to-feed-the-poor-in-west-bengal/story-I79jMtBlKEiVkyihC455gJ.html

India is among 18 countries with a score of 100, the highest value on the Government Response Stringency Index, which records the number and strictness of government policies to contain the spread of Covid-19. The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) collects data from 73 countries, tracks and compares government responses to the outbreak worldwide.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The United States scored 66.7, lowest among the five worst hit countries. Italy, Spain, and France have scored 95.2. India was quicker to take strict measures as by the time there were 500 cases its stringency index score was 90.5, which is more than many countries at that stage. India scored 100 by the time there were 1,000 cases and on the contrary, Italy touched 95 when cases touched nearly 50,000.  Also read: ‘I am always available’, PM Modi tells chief ministers during Covid-19 meetThis ‘Stringency Index’ is a score assigned to countries by researchers at the University of Oxford based on seven indicators of government response — school closure, workplace closures, public event cancellation, public transport closure, public information campaigns, restriction on internal movement, and international travel controls. A higher score means a country has strict measures. Countries worst-hit by the epidemic have a lower score. The study also looks into the government’s fiscal and monetary measures and emergency investment in healthcare.Also read: On Covid-19 lockdown, PM Modi to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoodAccording to the Union health ministry, the number of Covid-19 infections in India crossed 7,400 whereas the death toll from the disease touched 239 on Saturday morning.

Five buffaloes have been rescued. An NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) team of 30 people from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh), a SDRF (State Disaster Response Force) team and also district administration teams are involved in the search operation to trace other four persons missing. Boats and drone cameras are being used for search operations,” said KVS Chaudhary, district collector of Singrauli.He said the bodies were identified as those of 8-year-old Abhishek Kumar Shah and 35-year-old Dinesh Kumar. Search operations were continuing to find the other four persons missing. The four who are missing include Abhishek’s mother Choonkumari Shah, 27, a resident of Siddhikala village and his sister Seema Kumari (9), Dinesh Kumar’s son Ankit (3) of Bhamaura village and Rajjad Ali, 28, a resident of Waidhan.Reena Kumar, wife of Dinesh Kumar, and another person named Keshpati were injured. “The dyke at Reliance Power Plant (Sasan) premises near village Harrahva developed a breach on Friday evening…The injured have been hospitalised and their condition is stable,” Chaudhary said earlier on Friday evening.The project is 780 kilometres northeast of the state capital of Bhopal.Sasan Power Limited said in a statement on Friday evening that the breach in the ash dump yard wall pushed the water causing a break in the boundary wall and affected some thatched houses and minor land parcel.“We are deeply anguished by the incident involving the break in the ash dump yard wall at our Sasan Power Plant… We are investigating the reasons underlying the incident. Power Plant operations will continue as the relief and restoration work is not affected by the same,” it said.“We are closely working with locals and the District Administration in relief and restoration work,” it added.Environment expert Ashwani Kumar Dubey accused officials of Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project of negligence.“Due to negligent act of officials of Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project, the fly ash dyke breached and toxic residue and fly ash-laden water entered the houses of villagers and damaged their crops and also entered the Rihand reservoir,” Dubey said.Dubey pointed out that this was not the first such incident in Singrauli.“Earlier, the fly ash dyke of Essar breached. Then the dyke of Vindhyachal super thermal power plant breached. Now, this is the third such incident just within a year. Only a few months back the officials of the power plant told a team of National Green Tribunal (NGT) that their fly ash dyke was in a good condition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-found-dead-day-after-reliance-power-plant-dyke-breached-4-still-missing/story-mOSj2K4Xv44MuJAetJXNxH.html
11-04-2020||India||Ex-Madras HC judge V Kanagaraj appointed Andhra Pradesh election commissioner||Former judge of Madras High Court V Kanagaraj was on Saturday appointed as the election commissioner of Andhra Pradesh in place of retired bureaucrat N Ramesh Kumar, who was removed from the post by the state government through an ordinance on Friday evening.Kanagaraj, 75, assumed charge within hours of his appointment in the state election commission thereby pre-empting his predecessor from moving the court challenging his removal.The Jaganmohan Reddy government on Friday promulgated an ordinance amending the AP Panchayat Raj Act seeking to reduce the term of state election commissioner from five years to three years.It also proposed that the election commissioner would be a judicial officer of a high court judge rank. The ordinance would be replaced by a bill in the next assembly session.A government order issued late in the night declared that Ramesh Kumar, who assumed charge as SEC on April 1, 2016, ceased to continue as SEC, as he had completed four years in service.Kanagaraj served as a judge of Madras High Court for nine years from February 24, 1997, and after his retirement, he had been working as a senior advocate in the Supreme Court.According to an official release from the chief minister’s office, Kanagaraj delivered several landmark judgements both in Madras and Madurai benches of the high court. The judgements covered various subjects of national importance such as education, social justice with special reference to women and children, weaker sections and minorities.He was also nominated to the syndicate and senate of Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University. He was also engaged as a senior counsel in a number of cases by Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments.The sudden removal of Ramesh Kumar from the post of SEC through an ordinance incurred the criticism of the opposition parties. They alleged that the chief minister had developed a personal grudge against Ramesh Kumar for postponing the elections to urban and rural local body scheduled to be held in the last week of March in the wake of the coronavirus threat.Jagan Reddy had also objected to SEC ordering the transfer of two collectors and superintendents of police, besides disciplinary action against police officials in Macherla and some other parts of the state for alleged malpractices during the nomination process. He alleged that Ramesh Kumar was indirectly favouring the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) led by N Chandrababu Naidu as both belonged to the same caste.Subsequently, Ramesh Kumar wrote to the Centre seeking additional security to him and his family, as he alleged there was a threat to his life from the ruling party leaders.The high court and the Supreme Court upheld Ramesh Kumar’s decision to postpone the elections because of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the top court relaxed the poll code until the announcement of the next schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-madras-hc-judge-v-kanagaraj-appointed-andhra-pradesh-election-commissioner/story-E70OUDwDNeRpbbLj8ImgoI.html

A handful of policemen, headed by two officers, somehow managed to disperse the crowd.This happened on a day when the state administration announced, for the first time, that it had identified around 10 coronavirus hotspots in the state where a complete lockdown has been ordered.More than 170 people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month have been kept in quarantine at a location near Kolkata. Many of these are foreign nationals.On Friday, the police received the information that more than 100 people had gathered for Friday namaz in Gopinathpur.Sub-divisional police officer of Kandi, Kumar Sani Raj, and officer-in-charge of Barwan police station Nirmal Das rushed to the spot with a small force to vacate the mosque. Though the policemen did not encounter any physical resistance, people started arguing that they had the right to offer prayers. They demanded that the police must leave.Locals told the police that in normal times not less than 300 people gather at the mosque on Fridays and the crowd was much less because of the lockdown. The police found that nobody at the mosque was wearing any mask.Kumar Sani Raj said, “We got assistance from the Imam (main cleric) of the mosque. The people gathered out of sheer ignorance. We told them how deadly the virus is and how it spreads in the community.”“The Imam also requested the villagers not to violate lockdown orders and not to come to the mosque till things are back to normal. He asked them to offer namaz at home,” said the SDPO.The police also distributed rice, dal and vegetables among 140 poor families in the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-a-hundred-defy-covid-19-lockdown-gather-for-friday-namaz-in-bengal-district/story-abzPWSAGuyDozBxhFFU5VL.html

They cannot even afford to fall sick amid the COVID- 19 lockdown.The people of Kali Krishna village of Tripura are on edge, literally, living as they are on a narrow strip of land on the Indo-Bangladesh border. The village stands hemmed in between the international border and the barbed wire fence India has erected 150 yards away from it on its side.Jahangir Hossain, a peasant, is among the 3,000 odd neither-here-nor-there people for whom the March 24 lockdown came as a bolt from the blue as the border gates closed abruptly at midnight hour, shutting them out from the rest of the country.Fear and uncertainty have gripped people in the godforsaken place.“We do not know who to approach for assistance, as the officials on the Indian side are not opening the gates. We are trapped here,” 42-year-old Hossain told a PTI by phone.India has raised barbed wire fences across its 4,096- km border with Bangladesh, 150 metres ahead of the zero line, in accordance with the 1971 Indira-Mujib pact.Another resident of the neighbouring Nabadeep Chandra Nagar village, who preferred not to be named, said some villagers, with no solution in sight, were entering Bangladesh to buy essentials, and sell poultry and agricultural produce.Subrata Majumder, the sub-divisional magistrate of Sonamura in Tripura’s Sipahijala district, insisted people living on the other side of the fence visit Bangladesh often to buy and sell items, and that there is nothing new about it.According to BSF Chief Public Relations Officer C L Belwa, certain guidelines have been issued to the paramilitary force as part of the efforts to contain the spread of COVID- 19, but claimed its local unit has been distributing food and other essential items among those stuck outside the fence.Selim Khan, a resident of Nabadeep Chandra Nagar Village, however, alleged that the rations they receive is not enough to sustain a family.“With the gates closed on the Indian side, we are facing difficult times buying essential supplies and tending to our fields, part of which fall in the mainland. Add to that, our foodstock is depleting fast, he added.Shyamal Muhuri, a member of the Kali Krishna Nagar panchayat, said the villagers had been told to come to the mainland but they refused.“We made an appeal to the villagers to shift to the Indian side, but they refused to respond to the plea, claiming that their livelihood would be at stake. They also said that there would no one to look after their houses, land, poultry and cattle, if they were to move to the mainland,” Muhuri told PTI.Echoing him, Joydeb Sarkar, a local leader of the ruling BJP, said his party had called upon the villagers to take shelter in government buildings, but they turned down the offer.“People living on the other side of fence are mostly daily wagers, having no permanent source of income. We are looking for government land for their rehabilitation and resettlement, but the process is taking longer due to unavailability of a suitable plot, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-in-tripura-struggle-for-survival-on-indo-bangla-border-amid-lockdown/story-iV82Wo9uMmp3uk9UT1qwkI.html

11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Software engineers join hands with Cyberabad Police to deliver essential services||K Amarnath hates to sit at home idle just watching movies on the television and browsing the internet during the ongoing lockdown on account of Covid-19.So, the software engineer with Cognizant Technologies in Telangana’s Cyberabad has chosen to spend his time serving food to thousands of poor who have lost their livelihood due to the 21-day lockdown.“I thought the best way to reach out to one’s heart is through the stomach. So, I have taken up preparing food at a kitchen of my friend’s restaurant at Gachibowli which has since been closed and supplying breakfast and lunch to the hungry,” the 35-year-old, who has been on a paid holiday for the last two weeks, says.Amarnath is one of the 300-odd volunteers associated with Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC), a collaborative venture of information technology and IT-enabled services companies located in and around Madhapur and Cyberabad police stations.Though the council is primarily meant for ensuring safety and security for the software hub using high-end technology, it has taken up social service during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and is involved in various activities.From serving food to the poor, distributing groceries and medicines in various localities, arranging ambulance services in emergency situations and educating people about the disease, besides helping the police in implementing the lockdown are some of the things they are doing.The council has set up a Covid-19 control room on the premises of Cyberabad Police Commissionerate at Gachibowli, where around 40-50 software employees work in three shifts round-the-clock.“On an average, we received 1000 to 1300 calls every day, from various parts of Hyderabad and Cyberabad, requesting us to supply food or groceries in a particular area for lunch or dinner, or from people who need ambulance service or even for supply of masks or medicines or water bubbles. Our volunteers quickly plunge into action and attend to the needs of the people, with the help of the police,” Chinnam Rajasekhar, an engineering graduate who had worked for a VFX firm in Madhapur till recently, says.On average, the council supplies food packets to around 25,000 people in different parts of the city.“On my part, I supply food to around 1500-2000 people. The menu comprises flavoured rice made of tomato or brinjal or potato or even pickles, besides curd rice. Every day, I also supply breakfast like Vada or Mysore Bajji, to police personnel and also SCSC volunteers at the control room,” Amarnath says.“From tomorrow, we are planning to supply 10,000 buttermilk sachets to the people every day,” he adds.Rajasekhar, whose father has a job in an ordnance factory near Sangareddy, works from 9am to 11pm at the control room and also looks after issuance of vehicle passes, preparation of schedules and route maps for the distribution of food and other material the following day. The 30-year-old also replies to emails from people who have queries.“The team of volunteers has been doing excellent service. Many software engineers are working from home for their offices during the morning hours and coming to the voluntary service in the evenings. Hats off to their dedication,” Krishna Yedula, centre head of software firm Virtusa and the secretary of SCSC, says.Apart from people like Amarnath, SCSC has also tied up with the Ramakrishna Mission and NGOs like Akshaya Patra for the preparation of food and procuring groceries.“Apart from huge contributions from our own software companies, we have been getting liberal donations from a cross-section of people and that is serving our purpose,” Yedula says.Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjannar said a large number of police personnel belonging to law and order and traffic wings were working along with SCSC volunteers in distribution of grocery bags and food packets, water bottles, buttermilk packets, vegetables and other essential items to the needy.“Our volunteers are also looking into the complaints of violation of home quarantine norms, social distancing rules and lockdown orders and are reporting to the control room. We advise people to break the chain of coronavirus by staying at home, staying safe and rule-bound during the lockdown period,” Sajjannar says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/south/coronavirus-update-software-engineers-join-hands-with-cyberabad-police-to-deliver-essential-services/story-ySyXBN6dFxfZG8iGrBRURP.html

If we start the essential activity, then the patrol constable on the road must learn to distinguish between the essential and non-essential,” said a senior official.It is understood that one of the proposals to revive economic activity with a graded lift of lockdown was to demarcate the country into red, yellow and green zones. The Red zones with major corona activity will remain sealed, the yellow with very limited number of cases will be monitored but movement will be allowed and the green zones will be allowed to come back to normal.“ There are some 400 districts in this country that are not affected by the virus. We may look at opening them to activity and take a graded call on other districts by labelling them in yellow and green zones. One must not forget that the harvesting season begins from April 14 and India is a largely agrarian economy ,” said an official.While PM Modi went into micro details including supply of PPE, HCQ and masks at these meetings, it is understood that he will study the full impact of lockdown over this weekend to decide on the final call. Given his credibility with the masses, PM Modi’s decision will be followed to the last word.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-covid-19-lockdown-pm-modi-to-strike-a-balance-between-saving-lives-and-livelihood/story-YDfgytD5CaDnjRRGaA2vtM.html

A survey will be conducted to provide compensation to the villagers and action will be taken against those responsible for the incident,” Chaudhary said.Sasan Power Limited said in a statement that the breach in the ash dump yard wall pushed the water causing a break in the boundary wall and affected some thatched houses and minor land parcel. “We are deeply anguished by the incident involving the break in the ash dump yard wall at our Sasan Power Plant… We are investigating the reasons underlying the incident. Power Plant operations will continue as the relief and restoration work is not affected by the same,” it said.“We are closely working with locals and the District Administration in relief and restoration work,” it added.Environment expert Ashwani Kumar Dubey condemned the incident.“Due to negligent act of officials of Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project, the fly ash dyke breached and toxic residue and fly ash-laden water entered the houses of villagers and damaged their crops and also entered the Rihand reservoir. There is a fear of loss of life as well,” Dubey said.Dubey pointed out that this was not the first such incident in Singrauli. “Earlier, fly ash dyke of Essar breached. Then dyke of Vindhyachal super thermal power plant breached. Now, this is the third such incident just within a year. Only a few months back the officials of the power plant told a team of National Green Tribunal (NGT) that their fly ash dyke was in a good condition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-missing-2-injured-after-reliance-power-plant-in-mp-develops-breach/story-SnhU3OabCtB4mItTRD22PJ.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Madhya Pradesh has highest death rate, poor state response||Madhya Pradesh on Friday reported the highest death rate of Covid-19 patients in India with almost the entire health department either in quarantine or in hospitals. The health experts said the high deaths and spurt in cases indicated poor state response to the deadly virus in the state.The first four cases in the state were reported from Jabalpur on March 20, the day when chief minister Kamal Nath resigned from his post two hours before he was to face a floor test in the state assembly to prove the majority of his government. Bhopal joined the list of Covid-19 affected cities in the state on March 22 with one patient.On March 23, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan took over as the new chief minister for the fourth time but without any cabinet minister. That day, the state had seven cases in total.In the next two days, the number of Covid-19 positive cases went up to 15 and the number of districts from where the cases were reported increased to six from two. Till the end of March, the number of cases increased to about 66 with five deaths. Only 1,000 samples for the Covid-19 test were collected and there were only three labs approved by ICMR , according to the health department bulletin.By then, there was a clear indication that Indore was turning out to be the Covid-19 hotspot in the state with 66% of the total cases and three of five deaths. Officials said the local administration failed to enforce the nationwide lockdown in Indore in letter and spirit after which Chouhan replaced the collector and deputy inspector general (DIG) Police in Indore.“But it was too late and too little. Damage had been done. Those who had contracted virus in Indore were spreading within their areas. The situation was about to explode and it happened. Had there been testing of samples on a large scale, Indore’s story would have been different today,” said an official from Indore who was not willing to be named.In a fortnight since then, the state on Friday had 451 cases in 20 out of the total 52 districts and 36 deaths in 6 districts. Indore accounted for 235 of these cases and 26 deaths. Madhya Pradesh has conducted only 70 Covid-19 tests, per million population, as per the analysis of data provided by the state government.Within 24 hours of his taking over, the CM replaced Chief Secretary Gopal Reddy and appointed Iqbal Singh Bains in his place. Reddy had taken over just 7 days back. Amid the spread of coronavirus cases, the CM also replaced health secretary Prateek Hajela on April 1, blaming him for poor response to the pandemic with Faiz Ahmad Kidwai. Pallavi Jain Govil, principal secretary in the health department had not reported to authorities that her son had returned from the US.On April 2, a managing director and IAS officer in National Health Mission (NHM) tested Covid-19 positive. On April 4, another IAS officer in the health department tested positive. Children of the IAS officer and another director in directorate who also tested positive for Covid-19 had returned from abroad, which was not reported to authorities. After being tested positive, both insisted to work from home saying they did not have any Covid-19 symptoms. On April 8, both of them were forcefully taken to a hospital.Till then, 18 health department officials, including the director of health services, had tested positive and 40 others were in mandatory home quarantine. “The two IAS officers heading the department showed symptoms of cold and cough almost the same time but they continued to attend the meetings in the directorate and the state secretariat,” a health department official said, requesting anonymity. He said the two were responsible for more than 50 officials including several IAS officers having to self-quarantine. Some of these IAS officers were heading important departments.  Giving an example of how lightly the officials took the Covid-19 situation, another health department officer said even social distancing norm was not practised in the Covid-19 control room at state’s health directorate. “The control room later became an epicentre of coronavirus as the two IAS officers and the director used to come there regularly,” he said. However, the state government in an official statement sought to justify the stand of the officers and said their sons had cleared the screening at the airport. They had no symptoms and they had completed the quarantine period.Amid all this, the health department employees across the state threatened to go on strike claiming that there were not enough Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits for health workers. Despite efforts, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan could not be reached for his comments. Additional chief secretary, health, Mohammed Suleman, who has now been asked to handle the Covid-19 situation as the head of health department, didn’t respond to calls and text messages.Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said the CM didn’t hold even a single video conference with the chief medical officers of all districts or public representatives. It was on April 10 that the CM sought suggestions from former chief minister Kamal Nath and leaders like Digvijaya Singh and Uma Bharti, he said.“The way the officers were shifted demoralised other officers. In fighting corona, the government’s entire focus was on social distancing, which is not bad. But there should have been an equal focus on procuring test kits, PPE and other equipment. To me, MP is the worst managed Covid state in the country,” he said.  Former minister and Congress leader, Ajay Singh said, “Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan messed up everything in trying to become a one-man army. Also, when the entire world was concerned over the corona pandemic the CM was busy in toppling the then Congress government.”However, state BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “When the BJP government came the situation was very bad. The then Congress government had not taken any measures. There was no effort to procure PPE kits, testing kits etc. The BJP government took prompt measures to control the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-madhya-pradesh-has-highest-death-rate-poor-state-response/story-qj5UbOxyGLxJMlK7BlF5BJ.html

From now, all Covid-19 suspected patients will be taken directly to government quarantine centres set up in various parts of the national capital.The paid centres were opened on the night of March 16 at five hotels of Aerocity — Red Fox, IBIS, Aloft, Holiday Inn, and Pride Plaza — and as many as 608 people were put under quarantine. Most of the them were passengers who had arrived at the Delhi airport from other countries and had to undergo the mandated quarantine. According to district magistrate (New Delhi) Tanvi Garg, of the 608 people under quarantine, five tested positive for Covid-19. Three of them had come from the USA while two were from Australia. “The Aerocity’s paid quarantine facility saw the last batch of passengers check out on Thursday. With this, the paid quarantine achieved its purpose successfully with only five positive (asymptomatic) cases. The remaining 603 persons were discharged after they tested negative for Covid-19,” Garg said. The five Covid-19 patients are being treated at Lok Nayak hospital. Piyush Rohankar, the area’s subdivisional magistrate and the nodal officer of the paid facility, said the facility has now been closed. “Now, every district has quarantine centres, so there is no need for the paid facility anymore. In case there is a spurt in cases, then the government itself will book the hotels,” he said.A few who stayed at the quarantine facility told HT over phone that some of them had to remain even after their 14-day mandatory quarantine was over as the government did not have a standard operating procedure (SoP) in place for their movement.It was only on April 4 that Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued the SoP which allowed persons who have completed their quarantine to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-shuts-paid-quarantine-at-aerocity-hotels-as-people-move-out/story-uEmiC20SlnhbfKhLNr19PK.html

The country-wide restrictions are to end on April 14.Click here for full Covid-19 coveragePunjab and Odisha have already declared they will not ease the strict restrictions and said they will continue till the end of April.Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said on Friday that community transmission has started in the state with 27 positive cases coming from secondary sources, a claim contested by the Union health ministry.Punjab, which was one of the first states to impose a statewide lockdown and stop public transport, has reported 132 Covid-19 patients till Friday.“We had around 1,40,000 NRIs and foreign returnees, including from those countries where the virus had spread. They were the primary ones. Now, with 27 positive cases of secondary transmission, we have entered the stage of community transmission. That is a serious cause of worry,” Amarinder Singh said during a press conference.However, responding to a question during the daily Covid-19 press conference in New Delhi, Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Aggarwal said there is no community transmission in the country yet and there is no need to panic.“Today, the challenge is not local or community transmission. Whenever the community transmission stage comes, we will inform you. There is no community transmission in the country yet. There is no need to panic,” Aggarwal said.The World Health Organization says community transmission is “evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases”.Community transmission is the third of the four stages of the spread of an infectious disease. The first is travel history, the second is local transmission, the third is community transmission, and the fourth is epidemic.The WHO in the latest Covid-19 situation report number 80 has termed India’s virus transmission classification as “cluster of cases” and not “community transmission” as of now.Also read: On Covid-19 lockdown, PM Modi to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoodThe Centre has already reached out to state governments asking them to assess if some categories of services and people needed to be exempted from the lockdown, which many have seen as an indication that some restrictions will continue to be in place even after April 14.In Maharashtra, the numbers of Covid-19 patients stood at 1872, according to the Union health ministry data, and there have been 110 deaths in the worst-hit state in the country.In Tamil Nadu, there were 963 cases of the coronavirus disease with eight deaths.

11-04-2020||India||PM Modi to interact with CMs today, discuss lockdown extension||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold another round of video conference with all chief ministers on Saturday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and is expected to take a call on extending the lockdown, which will end on April 14.The Centre is considering extending the three-week nationwide lockdown over the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak after some states asked its enforcement beyond April 14. It will also keep the option of lifting the restrictions in a staggered manner in mind.Punjab and after Odisha have already extended the lockdown till the end of the month. Also read: What you need to know todayUttar Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka have said that the threat of Covid-19 would be easier to handle if the lockdown, which took effect on March 25, remains in force for a longer duration.Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Puducherry are also among others who have favoured an extension of the lockdown. Prime Minister Modi on Wednesday stressed ‘lockdown is the only way to save our people’ as he ruled out lifting the nationwide restrictions in one go.He had said that life will not be the same again after the coronavirus pandemic and that there would be “pre-corona and post-corona” for times to come.“I am regularly talking to CMs, districts and experts. Nobody is telling me to lift the lockdown. We need strict rules to maintain social distancing. We have to take many unexpected steps too,” Modi said.“I will talk again to CMs. But as of now, the mood is that entire lockdown lifting is not possible. We are also talking in district levels. For us, lockdown is the only way to save our people,” Modi added.Also read: Rising infections among medical staff raise preparedness concernsThe number of Covid-19 cases in India on Friday reached 6761 and 206 have so far died of the disease. Experts have raised concern that once the lockdown is lifted and people are allowed to get out of home freely, it could lead to a spike in the number of cases, negating the gains from the lockdown. However, there are also worries that continuing with a strict lockdown could cause long-term damage to the economy.The Union government has asked for strict enforcement of the current lockdown and reached out to states to assess if some categories of services and people needed to be exempted, in a sign that a set of restrictions will continue to be in place.The Union health minister, Harsh Vardhan, on Friday met state health ministers and urged them to ensure that the lockdown was strictly followed.“I request health ministers of all states to ensure that lockdown is followed 100% in your respective states. If we lag behind in this, it will be difficult for us to win this fight against Covid-19,” he said.The Centre also constituted 10 high-level multi-disciplinary central teams to help states from where a high number of cases are being reported. These teams have been rushed to Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, to aid them in containment preparedness, hospital preparedness and ventilator management.The Union home ministry has also reached out to states and asked whether more categories of people and services need to be exempted, officials familiar with the development said on Friday. The step is also being widely seen as a sign that the lockdown will continue in some form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-interact-with-cms-today-discuss-lockdown-extension/story-0ZR30SdEoLiLBTyzvrktPL.html

It seems that the militants ran away in initial firing itself,” the spokesperson said,“One PIKA LMG (light machine gun) and material for making IED (improvised explosive device) have been found from the house of one Aslam. Now, a tracker dog is being used for tracking down the escaped militants,” the spokesperson added.The encounter in Kulgam is the fourth in Kashmir since the 21-day lockdown was clamped across the country to break the chain of Covid-19 infections.Ten terrorists and five security force personnel have been killed in different parts of the region in these encounters in the past few days. Police claimed to have killed 23-year-old Jaish-e-Mohammed commander in Sopore, who was active since 2018, two days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/encounter-erupts-in-kashmir-s-kulgam-officials/story-MJ5ayPwnuxsY9app2DJirK.html

11-04-2020||India||New environmental public hearing policy soon||The Union environment ministry is revising its public hearings policy and is likely to release it by next week keeping in mind the social distancing required in view of the Covid-19 pandemic that has prompted a 21-day lockdown in the country, a top official said. Public hearings are consultations with local people who are either displaced or affected by any infrastructure project. The local people can object to the project or voice specific concerns at these hearings. Company representatives and state pollution control board officials are present during the hearings and are supposed to record people’s comments. These comments are also considered by the ministry’s expert appraisal committee to clear or reject a project.CK Mishra, the ministry secretary, said they were working out the policy for the pending public hearings. “...during the lockdown period public hearings should be avoided unless very urgent. A case-by-case approach will be taken. The district administrations have also been informed about not holding public hearings during lockdown. For later, we are deciding on a strategy.”The Gujarat Pollution Control Board has, for instance, scheduled a public hearing for the expansion of a refinery and petrochemical complex at Vadinagar on May 1. The residents said they may be unable to participate in the hearing amid the lockdown.Virendrasinh Vadher, a local farmer leader, said he has written to the board about their concerns. “In this situation, it is not possible for most persons concerned to know that the public hearing has been announced because distribution of newspapers is affected.’’ “People concerned have no way to connect with their communities and discuss issues.”He has not received a response to his letter dated April 6.Public hearings related to infrastructural projects are pending across the country. Dubna-Sakridihi iron ore and manganese mines in Odisha had started mining without any prior environmental clearance. When the ministry’s Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) heard this violation case in January last year, it recommended a public hearing, which remains pending. Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher with the think tank, Centre for Policy Research, said public hearings ought to have been conducted for many more projects. “We do not know how many in total because respective state pollution control boards notify these public hearings.”Separately, meetings of EAC on mining were held on March 25 and 26 and that of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) on April 7 during the lockdown and decisions on significant infrastructure projects were taken. The NBWL’s meeting was chaired by Union environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, via video conferencing and wildlife clearances for projects in 11 states were approved. The EAC on March 25 recommended public hearings on several projects. Kohli said there is a the visible one-sidedness in how the environment ministry is presenting itself during lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-environmental-public-hearing-policy-soon/story-2gZMioXbH1WV9Eua43UpbO.html
11-04-2020||India||Supreme Court, high courts hear interesting cases amid curbs||Interesting cases have come up for hearing in high courts and the Supreme Court since the lockdown was imposed on March 25 to check the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Here are some of them:‘Animals have the right to life’: Kerala resident N Prakash moved the high court via video conferencing on April 4 seeking permission to travel for purchasing food for his cats. He submitted that as a vegetarian, he does not cook meat at home and his three cats were being fed special biscuits. Prakash said police rejected his request for an online pass to travel to a pet hospital to procure the biscuits.HC heard Prakash via video conferencing April 6 and allowed his plea noting that animals also have the right to life as laid down in a 2014 Supreme Court judgment. It referred to Constitution’s article 51 A (g), which says it shall be the duty of every citizen to protect forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures.‘Let the curse of corona fall upon you’: The Calcutta high court on March 23 initiated contempt proceedings against lawyer Bijoy Adhikari after he cursed Justice Dipankar Dutta that “may the coronavirus infection befall” on him after the latter’s refusal to hear his case.In his order, Dutta said Adhikary on March 23 interfered when the court was dictating a ruling and “thumped the addressing table and then banged the microphone on it.” It said Adhikary was warned to behave but instead of heeding to such warning, he was heard to say that “my future shall be doomed by him and for such purpose, he cursed I be infected by the coronavirus”.No ban on newspapers: The Madras high court on Thursday dismissed a plea seeking a ban on newspapers. The plea claimed coronavirus can spread through contact with newspaper and prayed that the exemption given to print media from lockdown restrictions be withdrawn.The court said restricting or prohibiting the publication of newspapers will be violative of the right to free speech and independence of media. “More research is needed to establish that the virus could spread easily through newspapers. When such is a position based on these preliminary researches and in the absence of sufficient data, the prayer sought for by the petitioner cannot be granted.”Centre on government-approved news on Covid-19: The Supreme Court on March 31 rejected a plea of the Centre for a direction to the print, electronic and social media against publishing anything on Covid-19 without first ascertaining facts through a mechanism of the central government. The direction was sought in response to two petitions filed in the court highlighting the plight of migrant workers, who were forced to return from big cities to their homes on foot after the lockdown was announced. “Any deliberate or unintended fake or inaccurate reporting either in electronic, print, or social media and particularly web portals has a serious and inevitable potential of causing panic amongst large sections of the society,” the Centre said it in its affidavit.‘Lockdown impossible without the declaration of emergency’: The Centre for Systemic Accountability and Change, an NGO, moved the Supreme Court on March 31 arguing the lockdown has effectively led to the suspension of fundamental rights and the same can be done only through the imposition of emergency and not under the Disaster Management Act as was done by the central government.The NGO sought imposition of financial emergency under Constitution’s article 360 arguing it was essential to tackle the threat of coronavirus and to ensure recovery of the economy after the lockdown is lifted. The court adjourned matter when it came up for hearing on April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-high-courts-hear-interesting-cases-amid-curbs/story-u6sQzgt5Zo3dcFUreHBjtI.html
11-04-2020||India||Uddhav Thackeray to be MLC for 2 months if Maharashtra governor nominates him||The Covid-19 outbreak has created troubles for the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s election to the state legislature. While the state cabinet has passed a resolution asking governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to nominate Thackeray from his quota to the Legislative Council, the CM will get only about two months’ tenure to Upper House as the term of the two vacant seats from the quota ends on June 6. Notably, elections to the Council have been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Thackeray, who took over the reins of the state on November 28, is not a member of either Legislative Council or Legislative Assembly, and has six months to get elected to either of the House. The CM’s six-month period ends on May 28, and if he is not nominated or elected during this time, not just him but the entire cabinet would have to resign.“Uddhav Thackeray will not get full term of six years. He will be able to get only remainder term as an MLC and term of that particular seat is ending on June 6. He will have to be re-nominated by the Governor to continue to work as the CM,” said a senior official from the state legislature. Given the uncertainty due to the outbreak, the question is what will happen after June 6 when Thackeray’s term as a potential MLC ends. If the governor re-nominates him to the Upper House, all may be well. But, there could be a legal tangle over whether a person can be reappointed as a minister without being elected to any House.A Supreme Court judgment issued on August 17, 2001 has termed such re-appointment of a minister in Punjab government without getting elected as “improper and undemocratic”.“Tej Prakash Singh had resigned from the position as a minister on March 8, 1996 but was reappointed without getting elected to the legislative assembly as a minister on November 23, 1996, which was challenged in the court of law,” said a law department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-to-be-mlc-for-2-months-if-maharashtra-governor-nominates-him/story-Eb1pwER78cV3zxRvDQSNRP.html

Pakistan also proposed that the contribution be used in accordance with the Saarc Charter.Responding to Pakistan’s position, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “It is for each Saarc member state to decide on the timing, manner and implementation of their Saarc Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund commitments.”He added, “Where India is concerned, the commitment made by the prime minister is today in an advanced stage of implementation. Assistance in material and services has been extended to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.”The other members of Saarc have also “made early commitments to the Fund” and the “degree of seriousness of each nation can be gauged by their behaviour”, Srivastava said.According to New Delhi, India’s engagements with Saarc members on Covid-19 related matters are stand-alone events, whereas Pakistan has sought to bring all issues under the Saarc secretariat in a bid to block Indian initiatives.On Wednesday, Pakistan skipped a video conference of senior trade officials of Saarc, saying it chose not to participate since the Saarc secretariat wasn’t involved in organising it.Saarc groups Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepall, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hits-at-pakistan-for-conditional-pledge/story-aWlx8RvXx0RqbEkgWmjHvN.html
11-04-2020||India||Indian Army targets terror launch pads across LoC||The army on Friday targeted Pakistani positions across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Keran sector with artillery guns and caused severe damage to posts, terror launch pads and an ammunition dump in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, said two officials familiar with the details of the operation.The assault was launched in response to an unprovoked ceasefire violation by the Pakistani army days after five commandos belonging to an elite army Special Forces (SF) unit were killed in action along the LoC, the de facto border, in the same sector on Sunday during an intense close-quarters battle with an equal number of terrorist infiltrators who were all eliminated.The army had received intelligence inputs on Friday about another infiltration attempt in the same sector, said one of the officials cited above. Terrorists often sneak into Jammu & Kashmir under cover fire from the Pakistani army.The Indian army released a 48-second video clip showing heavy artillery blasting some positions, including an ammunition dump that is seen exploding in a huge ball of fire.As reported by HT on April 8, there has been an unusual spike in ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army along the LoC this year to help infiltrators sneak into Jammu & Kashmir compared to border violations in the previous years. The Pakistani army has carried out more ceasefire violations during January-March this year compared to the corresponding periods of the previous two years. Pakistan violated the ceasefire 1,144 times between January and March, with the highest number of violations (411) being recorded last month when Covid-19 cases started peaking globally. It has carried out 53 ceasefire violations this month (as of April 6). Figures show that the Pakistan army violated the ceasefire 685 times in 2019 and 627 times in 2018 from January to March. The J&K police said Pakistan violated the ceasefire in Uri sector of Baramulla district as well. Last month, a house was damaged when Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged fire along the LoC in the Uri sector. The Pakistani troopers attacked Indian posts with small arms and mortar shells along the LoC in Poonch district through this week.Last week, six security personnel were injured in Sunderbani-Nowshera sector when Pakistan violated ceasefire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-targets-terror-launch-pads-across-loc/story-i0uTke0MA4YMUHoVHqCjKI.html
11-04-2020||India||‘Must prioritise labour intensive sectors’: Vikram Kirloskar, CII President||Indian industry expects a prolonged recovery period after the national lockdown is eased and is hoping for government support, especially to small and medium enterprises, to help mitigate the pain, Vikram Kirloskar, president, Confederation of Indian Industry told Goutam Das during an interview. Edited excerpts:What sort of stimulus will India need to emerge out of the Covid-19 crisis?We believe the stimulus has to be twofold. One would be to assist and support the affected population through relief and cash transfers. This can be an additional ₹2 trillion given directly to the beneficiaries. The second would be to support enterprises, especially MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), to avert mass-scale closure of businesses and loss of jobs. We have suggested that this support can be extended through banks. This could be in the form of extra credit limits for wage payments and interest obligations of stressed sectors. Also, additional loans are required to enable MSMEs and stressed sectors to overcome the loss of business. Expansion of working capital loan to all enterprises would greatly help address present challenges... the government could consider a fund of ₹30,000 crore for banks, which would enable a leverage of five-six times.We have recommended that the government limit its fiscal spending to contain the crisis at an additional 2% of the gross domestic product (GDP) over and above the allocation of ₹1.7 trillion. This is a prudent level that would prevent flight of capital and safeguard the macroeconomic fundamentals.What should be the government’s exit strategy from the lockdown?From an industry perspective, we will abide by the decisions of the government as far as exit timing and strategy is concerned. The key ask is that the strategy be communicated well in advance to industry to enable restart plans. It is perhaps important that labour intensive sectors such as manufacturing and construction be given priority...What are the supply-chain constraints the manufacturing industry will face after the lockdown?The manufacturing industry restart will depend critically on two things. The first is the return of workers to the workplace. We need to reassure workers that their safety and health will be of paramount concern through a strong messaging exercise. Next, we must ensure safe travel means. We have suggested that a QR code can be used by local authorities to permit workers to travel to their workplaces... The second is the smooth movement of goods across the supply chain. What is the industry’s ask from the government in terms of easing the pain?The government has proactively been consulting with the industry on a continuous basis on the modalities of exit, and this process will lead to an orderly exit. However, we are in a situation where we can expect a protracted recovery period. The government should consider conserving its firepower to last it over a length of time, even while providing succour to the most needy sections of society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-prioritise-labour-intensive-sectors-vikram-kirloskar-cii-president/story-CA4p4U1Z3TIQO8og4wuzcO.html
11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: The importance of testing for Covid-19||An analysis of fatality or death rates (proportion of those infected who die) and testing rates (per million of population) throws up some interesting results and serves to highlight an important aspect of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19): states that test more, will, over time (and this is a mater of a few weeks to a month) end up showing lower fatality rates than states that test very selectively. To be sure, even the best Indian states (from the perspective of testing) aren’t doing enough, but, in general, states that test more will, over time expand the denominator (people tested), which will reduce the proportion of people found to be infected. It will also serve to reduce the death rate, which is a subset of those infected. In the absence of widespread testing, a comparison of death rates is, at best, a road approximation of how the virus has affected various states; however, with 7556 people being infected with Covid-19 as of Thursday night, and the death toll crossing 200 (250), it makes sense to look at these numbers. As the numbers change appreciably, HT will revisit this analysis.On the basis of the current analysis, Madhya Pradesh has the highest fatality rate of 8% and Delhi has done the most testing per million population (594), leaving out Ladakh whose small population skews the number. Maharashtra has tested 274 per million , which puts it in fourth place.But if, as the state claims, the high number of cases in it (1574 on Thursday night) is a result of aggressive testing, then the state’s fatality rate (currently 7.1%) will reduce over time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-in-india-the-importance-of-testing/story-yQpnxiZFPChp11GXF2boIJ.html

She wanted them to reach out to as many people in distress as they can and assess the government’s work in containing the pandemic.Interacting with Congress state unit chiefs through video-conferencing for over three hours, Gandhi asked them to regularly update her on the party’s relief works.She hoped that the Centre would come out with a plan to help the poor, farmers and labourers who were suffering the most due the lockdown.She urged her party to ensure that reliable and free testing mechanisms were ramped up and also that steady and sufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) reached those at most risk of infection.For their part, some state units pointed out that certain governments were deliberately obstructing and preventing Congress workers from carrying out the necessary relief measures‘save indian jobs in US’The Congress Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to impress upon the United States to prevent job losses of Indians holding H-1B visas.“After compromising the ‘India First’ policy in the HCQ (hydroxychloroquine) drug, the government is again failing to secure the safety and livelihood of Indians in the US,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said. “Time for the PM to ensure that our soft power of ‘Namaste Trump’ converts into fair treatment of H-1B visa holders.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hailed accredited social health activists, auxiliary nurse and midwives and anganwadi workers for being at the forefront in the fight against coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-tells-congress-state-units-to-keep-eye-on-govt-relief-work-ensure-ppe-supply/story-0hJNeq0tcmK0xpQmwoL69L.html

The two, accused of financial irregularities, had been absconding since March. The two were traced to Mahabaleshwar on Wednesday after going into hiding in March and ignoring summons from investigators. They had travelled from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar on the basis of an authorisation letter from a Maharashtra police officer. The state government has ordered an inquiry and sent the officer, Amitabh Gupta, on leave. The two were quarantined for violating the national lockdown imposed to check the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. They are facing investigations for allegedly diverting money from DHFL using fake borrowers and in the matter of alleged kickbacks taken by Yes Bank promoters in exchange for a loan.“On April 9, information was received by the CBI that both the accused were located in district Satara ... Thereafter, an email has been sent to DM and SP of Satara (Maharashtra) for not releasing them without an NOC from the CBI or order of the court and taking steps to prevent them from absconding,” a CBI spokesperson said. The ED too has written a similar letter to the Satara administration. Meanwhile, a political blame game has started in the state, with the ruling and opposition parties accusing each other of aiding the family.Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis accused the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government of “facilitating the accused”. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should tell the people that under whose pressure the letter was issued,” he said.Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant hit back, saying, “We suspect that the permission given to Wadhwans was at the behest of some BJP leader as the family has been very close to the party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-ed-write-to-satara-admin-over-wadhawans/story-2AqEpgpzFbSx697jmm5QeJ.html
11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus lockdown: Punjab, Uttarakhand want national curbs extended||The Punjab and Uttarakhand governments recommended on Friday that the ongoing national lockdown be extended beyond April 14, when it was supposed to end, and restrictions not be lifted until the end of the month. The Punjab announcement came hours after chief minister Amarinder Singh insisted it was the only way to fight Covid-19 as the community transmission has started in his state with 27 cases linked to secondary sources.Later in the day, the Uttarakhand government recommended the extension of lockdown till April 30, closure of all educational institutions till May 15 and made masks mandatory for all residents.The recommendations came a day after Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik extended the lockdown in his state till April 30. There were calls from states such as Tamil Nadu for extending the curbs. The BJP-ruled states have left it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a decision on extending the lockdown. Modi on Wednesday indicated that his government is not inclined to lift the emergency protocol in its entirety on April 14. He is due to discuss extending the lockdown with chief ministers on Saturday. “The number of positive Covid-19 cases will increase as is happening across the world and even in India. How can Punjab be isolated from it? We have contained the pandemic to some level as compared to other states. But this will spread,” Singh told media via video-conferencing. He said the 27 positive cases of secondary transmission were a serious cause of worry and that is why the Centre has to consider extending the lockdown. Punjab has reported 151 cases and 11 deaths. “We had around 140,000 NRIs and foreign returnees... They were the primary ones. Now, with 27 positive cases of secondary transmission we have entered the stage of community transmission.” The Union health ministry has denied that India had reached the community transmission stage, insisting that it was still at the local transmission stage.Singh said he would convey the decision of his cabinet to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Singh said in view of the harvest season in Punjab starting from April 15, the state government will allow district-wise exemption for farmers to harvest the rabi crop with appropriate social distancing.“We are expecting another bumper crop of 185 lakh tonnes of wheat this year and for that we will have to make adequate arrangements,” he said.In Uttarakhand, the policy enumerating steps to move out of lockdown was formulated at a meeting at the residence of chief minister, Trivendra Singh Rawat, on Friday evening. Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and spokesperson, said the decision regarding extending lockdown till April 30 will be sent to the Central government for approval. “Regarding other points in the policy like making masks compulsory, the state government has taken them on its own and doesn’t need the permission of Centre,” he said. In Tamil Nadu, a panel of health care experts on Friday recommended extending the lockdown till the end of April. After meeting with them, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami said the final decision would be made on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-lockdown-punjab-uttarakhand-want-national-curbs-extended/story-GUgG6YVM2894ZcbCosN1uM.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The total number of people infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has crossed 1.6 million. Of these, at least 100,000 have died. And at last count, 177 of the 195 countries in the world had confirmed cases. In India, the number of cases on Friday night was 7,556, and there have been 250 deaths attributed to Covid-19. Like many parts of the world, India is in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. Most people who can work from home are working from home; many factories are shut; all recreational facilities are closed; and there’s no work happening in construction, and very little in agriculture, the most employment-intensive sectors of the economy. Across 32 states and Union territories affected by the disease, local administrations have declared containment zones, and almost completely sealed these off from the rest of the neighbourhood, or city, or district, or state as the case may be.Apart from affecting lives and livelihoods, Covid-19 has affected our very way of life. And it has changed the way we work. Many believe that things will never be the same again — even when we have vanquished the virus.What little we know of Sars-CoV-2 tells us that it is highly infectious. That it can live on metallic surfaces for days. That it can be transmitted through mere exhalations. And that apart from social distancing, self-isolation, simply not going out and interacting with as few people as possible is the best way to prevent infections (and also break the chain of infections). Yet, there are people who are out and about, doing what they usually do.The newspaper vendor delivering papers.The municipality worker sweeping the streets. The sanitation worker disinfecting a neighbourhood.The grocer and the pharmacist who remain open for business.The delivery people who drop off food or other purchases. The police who man pickets and maintain order.The health care workers who care for the ill. The volunteers who feed the poor (and, lest we forget, those who feed stray dogs and cows). There are more — from the researcher experimenting with cures, to the worker in a factory making protective overalls — but you get the picture. All of them go on about their work as if nothing has happened. But what may have been the ordinary in the past is now the heroic. Mundane acts of drudgery are now selfless acts of courage. These people, and what they do isn’t just our link with the past — but makes the present bearable.Most of these people go on about their work as if it is business as usual — either the significance of what they do is lost on them, or they do not want to make much of it. I’d like to think it is the latter. These are ordinary men and women doing extraordinary things without making a big deal of it.Yet, at a time when staying in is the surest way to stay safe, the mere act of venturing out to perform what the law calls an “essential service” is a display of selflessness. Of courage in the face of adversity. Of resilience. When (not if, but when) we defeat the virus, it will be because of these people.

The App also provides important and credible information on the containment of the disease.“Aarogya Setu is an important step in our fight against COVID-19. By leveraging technology, it provides important information. As more and more people use it, its effectiveness will increase. I urge you all to download it,” PM Modi tweeted on Friday night.Earlier this week, the prime minister had urged all BJP workers to spread the word about Aarogya Setu, which was launched at the beginning of the month.“At least 40 people should be told about this and how to use this,” he had said on April 6.Approximately 5 million people had downloaded the App within the first few days of its launch and the number of downloads went beyond 10 million by April 8, as per the data available on the Google playstore.Developed with the public-private partnership, the Aarogya Setu App is available for installation in both android and ios based smartphones. “The app will calculate the risk score based on their interaction with others, using cutting edge bluetooth technology, algorithms and artificial intelligence,” Neeta Verma, director general, national informatics centre, government of India had said after its launch.Once installed it asks users to switch on the Bluetooth technology on the phone and to turn location sharing feature to “always”.The App uses technology to detect other devices that have Aarogya Setu installed on them and that have come in the bluetooth/GPS proximity range of the user to assess the risk one runs of contracting the disease by applying the principle of contract-tracing.Apart from its primary function, the app also encourages people to donate to PM CARES Fund, which was set up especially after the coronavirus outbreak to invite donations to generate resources to deal with crisis of this magnitude.The Prime Minister on Friday night also lauded contributors to the fund including the railways, Ola cabs and the international consumer internet group Prosus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pm-modi-explains-why-india-needs-more-downloads-of-aarogya-setu-app/story-603Mgoh3ZC2JcbYH0S4PPO.html
11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: With 400,000 kits, Tamil Nadu to ramp up Covid-19 testing||Tamil Nadu has tested 8410 samples for Covid-19 as of Friday, of which over 10% of cases have tested positive. While nearly half or 4167 of those tested are people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat conference in New Delhi in March, which was seen as priority testing by the state, the government is now looking to expand testing across the state.The first step towards large-scale testing was to procure 400,000 rapid test kits. An official at the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) told Hindustan Times that the state has also procured 100,000 more real-time PCR kits.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here India has been using the RT-PCR, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, test on nasal or throat swab samples of suspected patients to test for Covid-19. These tests can take between 12-24 hours to show results. In comparison, the rapid antibody tests identify disease-fighting antibodies in blood samples and can deliver results in 45 minutes to two hours. According to an ICMR advisory, rapid testing kits (for antibody tests or blood tests) need to be deployed in areas where mass testing is required, such as evacuation camps, large cluster areas, and camps for migrant workers.“Our priority is to stop the spread of any new cases outside containment zones or quarantined areas. That is the main objective,” chief secretary K. Shanmugam told reporters on Friday. “TNMSC has started preparatory work from January. Whether it is PPE kits, triple masks, or ventilators, we have been procuring them directly. The order for testing kits were also made directly (with suppliers) apart from the ones we will receive from the Central government,” he said,Chief minister E. Palaniswami had said last week, “Once the test kits arrive, we will be testing the family members of those who are already tested positive for COVID-19. After that, tests will be performed on those who have come in contact with these people. Then people living in the areas around the spot will be subjected to testing. That is why we have procured 4 lakh rapid test kits.”While Palaniswami had said the pandemic is at Stage 2 or local transmission and that it has chances of moving on to the next stage, the chief secretary told reporters on Friday that not one case of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) tested over the last 24 hours showed a positive result. “There are only 23 cases overall in the state for which there is difficulty in determining with certainty how the person became infected,” he said. “At this stage we are not at Stage 3 (community transmission).”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We are going to increase testing centres to all government medical colleges. We are also encouraging private labs with accreditation to apply to be testing facilities,” director of public health K. Kolandaisamy told HT. “Now the infection is clustered in containment zones, so we are only taking samples from there and apart from testing SARI cases,” he said. Tamil Nadu has 220 containment zones. There are 19 testing facilities across the state – 12 government, 7 private -- at this stage. Dr. Ram Gopalakrishnan, an infectious disease specialist at Apollo Hospital who is a committee of healthcare and medical experts that consults with the government, told HT that there was a need to test more people with existing PCR tests and conduct serology tests on a widespread basis as soon as kits are available.“There is no question that there is community transmission within hotspots. While it is probably also true that there is little or no community transmission in areas outside these hotspots, we don’t know unless we test more on a systematic basis,” he said. “The government criteria was quite restrictive till a couple of weeks back, now they have liberalised testing. They have also introduced serological tests which will certainly help make the diagnosis much easier. The government has its own constraints, there is a shortage of kits. Their concern is if we just open up testing all kinds of wrong testing will be done, kits will get exhausted and people who truly need tests will not have them.”Also read: How false negative results are complicating Covid-19 testingThe lockdown was a game changer as it halted the spread of the coronavirus, but widespread testing, aggressive contact tracing and isolation was the only way to fight the pandemic effectively, Gopalakrishnan said. “If this gets into hospitals, we are finished, healthcare workers will be the first to be wiped out,” he said. “This will always be a low-grade chronic illness and that is the best case scenario. If you have this as a low-grade sporadic illness like H1N1 influenza has become then the hospital systems can handle it.”Neuberg Diagnostics in Royapettah in Chennai is amongst the private laboratories approved to test for Covid-19. “We were one of the first ones in Tamil Nadu to get approval. Currently we are carrying out the RT-PCR tests as antibody tests are not approved for private labs in India,” its chief operating officer Aishwarya Vasudevan said. “Over the weeks, the guidelines have been constantly changing depending on the changing nature of the virus. Currently with the support the state government, we are encouraging walk-ins as well as samples from hospitals.”Also read: Covid-19 cases near 2,000 in Maharashtra; cross 900 in Delhi, Tamil NaduNeuberg Diagnostics has done close to 1000 tests so far. Vasudevan said that there was scope for widespread testing in India. The country has one of the largest number of RT-PCR machines but only 56 private labs are approved to test, so far. “Of course there is scope for ramping up testing. The government will have to help link it to the private sector,” she said. “But the routine sample testing business (outside of Covid-19 tests) has come down by 80-90% and we still have about 60% of fixed costs to run our operations,” she said. The lab has been testing samples of patients with Below Poverty Line cards for free.The expert committee on Friday recommended extending the lockdown in the state by another fortnight to the end of April. After a meeting with the committee Palaniswami said that the final decision on whether the lockdown will be extended or not would be made after cabinet consultations on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-400-000-kits-tn-to-ramp-up-testing/story-GyQ1gZbOr9oVumdeagzK3M.html
11-04-2020||India||WCD ministry initiative: Online sessions for childcare workers||From young women in Hamirpur slum not receiving sanitary pads amid the national lockdown to runaway children in a Moga childcare institute(CCI) not wanting to go home, women and child development minister Smriti Irani had to take queries on all kinds of problems during a live orientation session for childcare workers earlier this week.Following Supreme Court orders which listed out steps that child welfare committees (CWCs), juvenile justice boards (JJBs) among others must take to ensure the safety of children in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry started these live online sessions on April 3.So far, most of the sessions have been hosted by the WCD ministry officials with the help of experts from UNICEF, NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences), ChildLine, among others where care workers are instructed on how to look after women and children during the unfolding coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to an audience of over 825 officials during one of the live sessions, Irani asked the Hamirpur NGO worker to get in touch with the district officials. Irani, who has attended two such sessions till now, also asked frontline the workers such as anganwadi workers, to download the Aarogya Setu app, and told them that protective gear will be provided to those delivering ration. The rising cases of violence against women and children were discussed in some sessions and emergency helpline ChildLine highlighted that it saw a 50% jump in distress calls, with many children asking for food. Maximum distress calls regarding Covid-19 were received from Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Punjab.On Friday, the UNICEF in a statement said as over 99% of children and young people under 18 worldwide live in one of the 186 countries which have placed some form of restrictions on movement, childcare officials must pledge to keep children healthy and safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wcd-ministry-initiative-online-sessions-for-childcare-workers/story-QfWCM2cdNrBhAqESa9hG8K.html
11-04-2020||India||Condom-maker PSU at forefront of antibody testing kits||In the 1970s, it played a key role in India’s family planning programme, manufacturing condoms branded Nirodh. Just around three years ago, dismissed as a mere condom maker (it was more), there was an attempt to privatise the company. Over the past month, it has been at the centre of controversies -- on how it delayed placing orders for protective equipment for health care workers, or the margin it was adding to such equipment it sourced. Meet the state-owned HLL Lifecare Limited (the HLL stands for Hindustan Latex Limited, its avatar in its condom making days, but no one uses that name anymore), which has emerged an important part of the government’s fight against Covid-19. The Thiruvanthapuram, Kerala-based company has developed a rapid antibody diagnostic kit to test Covid-19 patients (in a mere 15-20 minutes, the company claims). According to EA Subramanian, director of technical operations of HLL Lifecare, the company was able to develop the test kit within a month. It has had experience in developing test kits for TB, dengue and malaria.The rapid antibody diagnostic kit to test Covid-19 patients has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research, and validated by the National Virology Institute in Pune. “We have got an order of 2 lakh kits to begin with and are planning to produce 20,000 per day in our Manesar plant in Haryana. Mass production will begin on Monday and two lakh kits will be dispatched within the next 10 days,” said Subramanian. The production is scalable, he added. The Union government has already placed an order worth ~2,000 crore for the kits and other equipment. In fiscal year 2018-19, HLL Lifecare’s standalone revenues were ~1,471 crore and net profit , ~15.36 crore. Even including its five subsidiaries it had revenues of ~1,696 crore and made a small loss of ~12.96 crore. The test kits are important because governments across the world are scrambling to manufacture or buy enough test kits. India, too, ordered on April 7 half-a-million rapid antibody test kits with at least seven Chinese companies receiving import licenses from the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI ) for the same. Established in 1967, HLL Lifecare played a crucial role in the family planning campaign of the country, distributing condoms at subsidised rates. Its brand Nirodh was the mascot of the family planning campaign and almost became a generic name for condoms in the country. Later it diversified into other areas, making intrauterine devices, contraceptive pills, blood bags, surgical sutures, and Ayurvedic preparations. The company says that unlike imported Covid-19 test kits, which cost ~700-800, its own kits will be priced ~350-400 (the final prices have not been fixed). The health ministry has already authorised HLL Lifecare as the nodal procurement agency for all medical requirements to fight Covid -19. It has been entrusted with procurement of N95 surgical masks with respiratory valves, personal protective garments, nitrile gloves, goggles, hand-held infrared thermometers and hand sanitisers .Since there is mounting demand for these products across the country, HLL floated an open tender and shortlisted some of manufacturers who will now supply these, said a company official who asked not to be named. The company is also manufacturing some protective equipment in-house.  “We have also entered into an agreement with Sree Chithira Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology for developing patient examination and disinfection booths. The World Health Organization is also funding us to make and procure more ventilators,” said Subramanian. Meanwhile, employees of the public sector unit are upbeat about the role their firm is playing in the Covid fight. “Good the government did not sell it off. Now it is playing a key role in the health sector of the country. Hope this will open the eyes of the government,” said an office- bearer of the Hindustan Latex Employees Union who did not want to be identified.The union, the Kerala government and the Union ministry of health are believed to have scotched efforts to privatise the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/condom-maker-psu-at-forefront-of-antibody-testing-kits/story-6t6sh7Z96zhfYGiQ66fs9O.html
11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: Punjab extends curbs; PM Modi to meet CMs today||With Prime Minister Narendra Modi scheduled to hold his third video conference with chief ministers on Saturday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, including reviewing the lockdown, which ends on April 14, Punjab became the second state — after Odisha — to extend the lockdown till the end of the month. The Union government has also asked for strict enforcement of the current lockdown, and reached out to states to assess if some categories of services and people needed to be exempted, in a sign that a set of restrictions will continue to be in place. With the number of positive cases in India growing to 7,556 — Friday witnessed 850 new cases — a fresh debate also broke out on whether the country has entered the stage of community transmission. Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh suggested the spike of secondary infections in the state indicated it had; the Union health ministry continued to deny it; and the World Health Organization (WHO) bracketed India in the category of a “cluster of cases”, which is a stage before community transmission.In Punjab, CM Singh chaired a meeting of the council of ministers, which decided to extend the lockdown to check the community spread of the pandemic and to prevent overcrowding at the mandis in the light of the ensuing wheat harvesting and procurement season, an official statement said. Singh said in a tweet, “Given the seriousness of the situation arising out of #Covid19, Cabinet has decided to extend lockdown & curfew till May 1.” He told the media that most of the 27 positive cases reported in Punjab on Thursday (the maximum daily increase for the state) were those of secondary transmission and expressed apprehension that the state may be entering the community transmission stage of the outbreak. Odisha had, on Thursday, extended the lockdown to April 30. Back in Delhi, there was a spurt of activity within the government. The Union health minister, Harsh Vardhan, chaired a meeting of state health ministers. He urged them to ensure that the lockdown was strictly followed — failing which India would find it hard to battle the pandemic. “I request health ministers of all states to ensure that lockdown is followed 100% in your respective states. If we lag behind in this, it will be difficult for us to win this fight against Covid-19,” he said.The Centre has constituted 10 high-level multi-disciplinary central teams to help states from where high number of cases are being reported. The teams have been rushed to Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, to aid them in containment preparedness, hospital preparedness and ventilator management. “The minister assured all help, including providing adequate supply of personal protection equipment (PPE), N-95 masks and ventilators, in all states. A detailed discussion was also held among the group of ministers yesterday [Thursday] on the existing lab strategy, especially how to increase sampling in hot spots and clusters,” informed Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, during a media briefingSeparately, the Union home ministry reached out to states and asked whether more categories of people and services need to be exempted, officials familiar with the development said on Friday. This is being widely interpreted as a sign that the lockdown will continue in some form — but may see the staggered re-emergence of certain more segments of people, as indicated by PM Modi in his last video conference with the chief ministers. A review meeting was also held by the Prime Minister’s Office during the day on various efforts to check the coronavirus spread, including the production of PPEs, the absence of which has emerged as a key obstacle in securing health workers who are in direct contact with patients. Meanwhile, despite the Punjab CM’s statement on possible community transmission, and the fact that data from an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study said that samples of about 2% of the Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (Sari) cases lifted from within the community had tested positive for Covid-19, the health ministry reiterated that there was no community transmission.“If there is community transmission in the country then we will be the first ones announcing it, as we would need people to take extra precautions,” said Lav Agarwal. The WHO also put India in a category named “cluster of cases” — a notch below the community transmission stage and a classification used by the global body for cases “clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common exposures”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-extends-curbs-pm-to-meet-cms-today/story-OJ3QYStq8PXVanmW09Pr3M.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: As race for vaccine heats up, new techs come to fore||The development of a vaccine for Covid-19 is proceeding at an unprecedented pace and scale, and also using innovative technologies, according to an analysis of the global Covid-19 vaccine development database, published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery.With five coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine candidates in phase 1 clinical trials to establish safety for humans and 73 in exploratory or preclinical stages, a vaccine is likely to be ready in early 2021, the analysis says. As many as 78 projects have reached the active stage of development within three months of genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that is causing the current pandemic, being published on 11 January 2020, according to the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness (Cepi), one of the world’s biggest public funders of vaccine development.Adaptive and parallel vaccine development phases, innovative regulatory processes and advanced manufacturing capacity have helped fast-track development, which traditionally takes an average of a decade. Even accelerated efforts, such as that for the first Ebola vaccine, took five years.Of the confirmed active vaccine candidates, 56 (72%) are being developed by the private sector, with the rest being led by academic, public sector and other non-profits. There are 37 unconfirmed projects for which development status cannot be determined from publicly available or proprietary information sources, according to the analysis. Most Covid-19 vaccine development activity is in North America, with 36 (46%) developers of the confirmed active vaccine candidates, compared with 14 (18%) in China, 14 (18%) in Asia (excluding China) and Australia, and 14 (18%) in Europe. There is no public information on vaccine development in Africa or Latin America, said the report.A range of new technology platforms are being used, including nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), virus-like particle, peptide, viral vector (replicating and non-replicating), recombinant protein, live attenuated virus and inactivated virus approaches, many of which have never before been used to develop vaccines that are currently licenced for use.“Most vaccine development focuses on identifying the genetic code of the protein that a virus uses to enter human cells, which is then used in the vaccine to trigger an immune response against subsequent exposure in people who are vaccinated. The virus can also be genetically modified to be rendered harmless to make inactivated vaccines, such as polio, rabies, and hepatitis A and B, which often require multiple doses,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Scientists are leveraging existing work on vaccines against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) coronavirus and rapid response platforms with 2 Sars-CoV-2 genetic sequences inserted to speed up vaccine development against the novel virus. “The speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,” said Richard Hatchett, CEO, Cepi.Most developers for the Covid-19 vaccine are focusing on platforms based on nucleotides, which are the building blocks of genetic material, DNA and RNA, because of their potential for speed and flexibility for antigen manipulation. Sars-CoV-2 consists of a strand of RNA enclosed in shell covered with crown-like spikes (explaining its name; Corona is derived from the Latin for crown) . Producing an immune response against the viral spike (S) protein can prevent it from entering cells and multiplying to cause infection.“Vaccines based on viral vectors offer a high level of protein expression and long-term stability, and induce strong immune responses,” said Dr Ganguly.Vaccine development, on average, takes 10.71 years from the preclinical phase, and has a market entry probability of 6%, according to a study in journal PLOS One.“Any vaccine development requires a lot of testing for to establish it’s efficacious and safe, we need to make sure countries licence the vaccine through proper procedure. They then need to get a massive build up in manufacturing capacity and have a system to ensure that those who need the vaccine the most get it first,” said Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation’s special envoy on Covid-19.“Accelerating vaccine discovery process should not compromise safety and evaluation of effectiveness and safety at each step is imperative. Countries need to also build manufacturing, distribution and delivery capacity to ensure it reaches those who need it most,” said a public health specialist in India, requesting anonymity.Animal models that specifically assess vaccine efficacy have been developed, using ACE2-transgenic mice, hamsters, ferrets and rhesus macaques. A small study from China posted in the preprint database medRxiv, found rhesus macaques don’t get re-infected with Sars-Cov-2, which provides evidence that vaccines will offer protection, though for how long remains unclear.“The changes in a virus’ genetic sequence must also be tracked to establish patterns and predict its behaviour, on how it will spread and whether it is likely become more virulent. To develop an effective vaccine, we need study consistent virus change,” said Dr Ganguly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-race-for-vaccine-heats-up-new-techs-come-to-fore/story-2AxMOPhPyeCHKS1nQbUMKO.html
11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: 100,000 dead in 101 days, half of them in just a week||In the 101 days since the world first heard about the mysterious new virus behind Covid-19, a person has, on average, succumbed to the illness every 90 seconds. On Friday, the toll surpassed 100,000, a milestone that could well be dwarfed soon at the current rate of the pandemic’s growth: fatalities have doubled and the total number of infections grew by 600,000 in the last week alone, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Research Center.In India, national capital Delhi recorded 183 new cases on Friday – the largest single-day jump. Most of these (154), however, were related to the Nizamuddin cluster from where roughly 2,300 have been taken to hospitals and quarantine centres. Overall, the country recorded 855 new cases and 19 new deaths, taking total infections to 7,549 and fatalities to 250.The numbers, which came on the 39th day of the outbreak in India, represent a steady flow that, while not ballooning in the way they did in many populated countries, threaten to quickly go out of hand. In western countries, the virus tore through in approximately six weeks: the United States and Europe together account for over 77% of all infections and close to 87% of all deaths.“The attention now should be on lower and middle income countries like India and the sooner you start testing at a widespread level, the better you will know what is going on in your country,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, the head of biostatistics at University of Michigan. “The acceleration curve in India looks completely different than other countries – India is doubling infections in about six days while a country like UK takes three days,” she said, adding that it is important to determine whether this is because of lack of reporting or other factors such as temperature and genetics.India is at present in the middle of a three-week lockdown that has brought the economy to a halt and led to a massive spike in unemployment, but is also credited with averting an endemic crisis. The government is likely to retain much of the curbs, maybe even extend the lockdown which is scheduled to end on April 14. “From an epidemiological perspective, you start seeing an appreciable drop in case counts when you lock down for 42-56 days but that may not be practical. You have to come out of a lockdown soon,” added Mukherjee, who is among a dozen academicians from three American universities studying the disease’s progress in India and other nations.Since the middle of March, some of the biggest economies of the world have locked down their cities and are now struggling with the question of when to lift some of these curbs and let industries restart to fend off further economic devastation.The head of the International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday the global economy is headed for the worst recession since the Great Depression of 1930s, and the UN labour organisation said 195 million full-time jobs could be lost in the second quarter alone. The rate of unemployment in India shot up from 8.41% to 23.81% in the week when the country was forced into a near-complete shutdown, according to estimates by Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.Scientists and researchers say the way forward for the world will require new, focussed steps to enforce social distancing that are more sophisticated than population-wide lockdowns. “It is important that we start to think of exiting lockdowns as combination of policies. People will need to be allowed greater social flexibility and there will need to be innovative solutions, such as contact tracing through mobile apps,” said Steven Riley, professor of Infectious Disease Dynamics at Imperial College London, in a video published on Thursday by the varsity’s Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics.On Friday, Apple and Google -- who together control the mobile phone software market almost entirely -- said on Friday that they will work together to create contact tracing technology that aims to slow the spread of the coronavirus by allowing users to opt into a system that catalogs other phones they have been near. They will work together on technology that will allow mobile devices to trade information via Bluetooth connections to alert people when they have been in close proximity with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.In India, authorities will also need to focus on mobilisation of resources since infections are likely to peak in different regions at different times. “We have seen that hot spots go through peaks at different times. India will need to find a way to move resources rapidly so that health care systems don’t collapse,” said Mukherjee. “Our lives are going to be constrained and restricted for a while everywhere in the world. It is important to be intelligent how we emerge from this, because cases will rise when we do and instead of having pickets, we need to build check dams to handle if there is a flood of cases,” she added.The unprecedented crisis has been met with unparalleled efforts in the scientific community that has raced to develop a vaccine to protect people from Sars-Cov-2 , the pathogen that causes Covid-19. According to an analysis in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, five vaccine candidates are in phase 1 clinical trials and 73 in exploratory or preclinical stages. A vaccine, the analysis says, is likely to be ready in early 2021 – the earliest estimate available at present. At the same time, however, there are many aspects of the pathogen that are still to be known. South Korean officials said on Friday that they had launched an epidemiological investigation after 91 patients thought cleared of the new coronavirus had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), said the virus may have been “reactivated” rather than the patients being re-infected.Other Korean experts said patients had likely “relapsed” rather than been re-infected and that false test results could also be at fault, or remnants of the virus could still be in patients’ systems but not be infectious or of danger to the host or others.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-000-dead-in-101-days-half-of-them-in-just-a-week/story-2wNOEIKWM7u9FhrgeqS7oI.html
11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus crisis: Blood donors to be asked about health status for Covid-19||Blood donors are now asked for the health status, including symptoms of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), but they are not being tested for it even as the numbers of cases cross 6,500.Despite the lockdown, there is no shortage of blood and its components as requirement for trauma cases and elective surgeries have gone down substantially.“We have started thorough screening of all donors; they have to fill up a detailed form informing about their health status and also details such as their Covid-19 status, or if anyone they knew had tested positive, or someone in their neighbourhood had any Covid-19 like symptoms. We are doing our own risk profiling before allowing them to donate,” said RK Jain, secretary general, Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS).With the number of blood donation camps in summer months going from 35, on an average, to none in Delhi since lockdown was imposed to contain the pandemic, the ICRS is reaching out to individuals to motivate them to donate.The ICRS has recently tied up with residents’ welfare associations and plans to send mobile-collection vans to residential colonies from Monday. Since the government has declared blood as an essential supply on Thursday, vans for blood collection can move without restriction.“We reached out to our voluntary donors individually, arranged pick up and drop for them, and even forwarding short videos of children who need regular blood transfusions to motivate these people to come out and donate blood. I have been issuing passes to ensure their movement isn’t hampered in any way. In areas where there were multiple donors, we would even send our mobile van,” says Dr Vanshree Singh, director (blood bank), IRCS.“Since elective surgeries are not happening, and trauma cases have gone down, what we these days are getting is request for blood from people who undergo regular blood transfusions, such as people suffering from thalassemia and other blood disorders, chemotherapy patients, anaemic pregnant women etc. By and large, we managed to stay afloat due to demand from a particular set of people going down that compensated for the reduced blood donations,” says Jain.With the Centre issuing an order declaring blood services as essential services, the society will start holding blood donation camps by sending mobile blood collection units to various localities across Delhi from Monday.“…addressing concerns of those running blood centres and blood transfusion services, especially regarding concerns with managing safety and adequacy of blood during this period of restrained gatherings and social distancing… it is essential that the supplies of safe blood continue to be maintained at licensed blood centres in the country. Activities for blood collection and voluntary blood donation therefore are required to be continued judiciously during this period to meet the blood requirements,” said Union health ministry recommendations to states on April 9.Blood banks the world over are dependent on voluntary blood donations from healthy individuals to demand for blood and its components. “We are tying up with various residents’ welfare associations to park our blood collection vans near residential localities so that people don’t have to travel long distances to donate blood. And at the time we will follow all infection control and social distancing measures such as two couches instead of the earlier practice of four to draw blood. There will be at least 3 metre gap between the two couches and at one time there will be no more than three people allowed in the camp. The vans will be disinfected on a regular basis,” says Singh.Apart from the camps, the society will also run a fleet of cars to pick up donors from their homes, take them to the blood donation centre and drop them back home again.The news of donation camps being held will put a lot of harried minds at ease. “The challenge is that thalassemia patients need fresh blood, which should ideally not be more than five to seven days old. The guidelines say less than two weeks old because if the blood is older, the haemoglobin doesn’t rise enough in these patients. So holding camps will help as donors otherwise have to go to a hospital and donate. We alerted patients that they should try to arrange for donors, should such a problem arise,” says Shobha Tuli, founder, Thalassemics India.Dr RN Makroo, president, Indian Society of Transfusion Medicine, says that many of the blood banks have started pooling in resources. “We are sharing the supply because this is an extraordinary situation. We also tell regulars to try and inform the centre in advance of their arrival preference and requirement, so that the centre is prepared to make adequate arrangements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blood-donors-to-be-asked-about-health-status-for-covid-19/story-m07CIcZbZXNhSCaEtvXJIP.html
11-04-2020||India||HT Salutes: Everyday heroes of the pandemic||There is little to be cheerful about in a world battered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The global tally stands at 1,447,471 confirmed cases and 83,401 deaths even as the pandemic peaks in one country after the other. In India, the news is becoming grimmer: infections, fatalities, shortages. As the numbers go up of people infected (5,274), dead (165), hospitalised and quarantined, staying home is seen as the only way India’s citizens can save others, but not everyone is convinced this is all they can do to help.So, while they follow the official rules and restrictions, thousands of Indians are finding ways to help those who are more vulnerable. They are publishing data and insights, launching donation drives, sewing masks, video-chatting with senior citizens, mobilising support for migrant workers, countering fake news and fake science, feeding stray dogs, and making viral memes to remind people to do the simple things like washing their hands. Meet some of India’s corona volunteers.Naveen MS, Karnataka Sahaya, Challkere“Today, we don’t have solution to coronavirus, but we have a solution to the fear and rumours,” says Naveen MS, a civil service aspirant based in Challkere taluka in Chitradurga district of Karnataka. While he worries about the impending damage to the economy from the pandemic, his immediate concern is for people’s “psychology.” In his own town, he says, panic is widespread.“Minimum people are infected (Karnataka has 181 positive cases so far) but maximum people are fearing. Facts are being manipulated in private WhatsApp groups and prime-time news alike,” he said. In the cities, he points out, people have easy access to verified facts and official information, but not so in the rural areas. “In the villages, no one has a Twitter account, and no one is using Telegram (messenger), so the responsibility is on the educated people such as myself who have access to technology. Even if one person in a village is using Telegram, he can share the right information with the rest of the population.”In Mid-March, Naveen joined the Telegram group Karnataka Sahaya which was launched by the state information department to circulate official information and counter fake news. The open group has over 21,000 members of whom most are citizen volunteers. “We deal with three kinds of inquiries. There are medical enquiries where people are dropping in to ask if they should be tested in the case of a cough; then there are official enquiries where people ask about rules and restrictions in their areas; and third are basic enquiries about general facts – how many infections, what are the precautions, etc. As laypeople, us volunteers don’t know anything, so our job is to connect doctors and officials who show up in shifts on the group with those who have queries,” he said.Hundreds of questions are posed and answered on the group every day.“Do gas cylinders come under essential commodities?”“When will Covid-19 tests be available for general public in private labs?”“There are rumors going on about one confirmed case in Koppal. Can I know?”As an information warrior, one of Naveen’s major tasks is to spot and call out fake news. So far, he says, he and his fellow volunteers have busted a handful: “Jio offering lifetime free recharge for Rs 498. There is a cure for novel coronavirus in a book by Dr Ramesh Gupta. A medicine has been discovered for Covid-19. Russia has unleashed 500 lions on the roads to keep people indoors.”On Monday, Paramesha C from Kanataka’s Davanagere district posted a query on the Telegram group. He wanted to know if a message he was sent via WhatsApp contained real or fake news. The message alerted recipients that the police would act against anyone posting or forwarding any coronavirus-related update on social media as per a new government mandate. “I wanted to check if it was true before I believed it or forwarded it. I was told it was fake news.”Naveen thinks it’s equally important to find and share uplifting information about the human battle against the virus. “I collect positive news from around the world and share it with as many people as possible, like China closing down its coronavirus hospitals, doctors in India being successful in treating many cases, a network of Canadian scientists making excellent progress in Covid-19 research, number of cases declining in South Korea.” He says the work has filled him with purpose like never before. “You feel a sense of nationalism, a sense of belonging.”Anupriya Singh, Corona Warriors, BahraichOn March 24, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a national lockdown, millions of migrant wage labourers employed in urban centres rushed to their villages, but thousands have since found themselves stuck far from home without work or food, or a future plan. On March 26, Anupriya Singh, who lives in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, started a Facebook group to get them help wherever they are. “The first alert we received, just a friend and I, was about a group of migrant workers in a Noida market. They are entirely dependent for their meals on the local carts that sell lunch and dinner for Rs 10 or Rs 15, but as lockdown curfew struck, the carts vanished, and the workers were stranded without any gas cylinders or cooking supplies. A friend drove 50km with food to reach them, explaining to the police every few kilometers that this was an urgent matter.”Since then, Singh says, the group has grown to 5,000 members who respond to messages posted on the group all day from across India.“In Surat, 20 labourers are stranded and there is no ration. They are from Ara district of Bihar.”“Ten labourers stuck in Santacruz, Mumbai. They are from Giridih in Jharkhand. Food is a problem”“Thirteen people from Hardoi in UP stuck 100 km from Hyderabad in Kandukur.”Singh says most of the appeals for help are coming from Delhi and Maharashtra, but the problem is nationwide. “We recently heard from a group of migrant workers from Nagaland -- 20 of them. They said they would never have asked someone for help, but they are struggling to find any food. One of our volunteers there got in touch with the local administration which came to their rescue immediately.”Typically, she says, once they receive an alert from a place, they try to mobile local support in one way or the other. “We are fairly spread out by now, so usually one of us knows someone in local police or administration or political party or NGOs, and irrespective of jurisdiction or affiliation, most of them have been helpful. At times, we are even able to arrange food or medicines for stranded labourers through an individual or shopkeeper near them.”Stranded in Moradabad after his metal-works factory shut down and the borders closed, daily-wage worker Kamal Saxena ran out of food supplies and cooking gas. “My family is in Bareilly and I am in Moradabad, living alone and waiting to be paid by the factory contractor my pending salary. Last week, I couldn’t leave the house because of lockdown and had nothing to eat. I had no money either. My daughter found out about this Facebook group and gave me a number to call. I called it and gave my details, and some hours later, someone came by with a bag of groceries -- atta, daal, oil, chawal, salt.”The volume of posts on the Facebook group is going up steadily. “There is a lot of panic among migrant workers. Not each of them needs to rush home, but many are fleeing because they believe this is a city virus and it will consume everyone who remains in the cities,” she said. Currently, Singh says her volunteer shift begins at 8am and ends at 2am the next day. She has made her peace with it: “We live in India. In this country, people stand up for each other.”Megha Jose, The Pawsome People Project, CoimbatoreJust days into the social isolation sparked off by Covid-19, Megha Jose and her team noticed that many of Coimbatore’s estimated 30,000 street dogs were leaving the streets. “They began to migrate kilometers beyond their areas and organised into groups – possibly to hunt for food. As people stopped coming out to feed them and shops and restaurants closed, a lot of dogs were starving. Street dogs are known to hover in the vicinity of open garbage, but now they were literally in the middle of it,” said Jose, who runs a volunteer-driven initiative for the street dogs of Coimbatore called the Pawsome People Project.The team also began to hear from people anxious about their proximity with their own pets as rumours about dogs being carriers of the coronavirus went viral on social media. “A lot of people were calling to say, ‘we don’t know if we can keep the dog around while we have old people living in the same house.’ They were also concerned about their residential societies banning dogs. We saw some purebred dogs, including a Pitbull and a Doberman, left in the streets,” Jose said.Down to 40 volunteers from their usual strength of 150, the Pawsome people reacted to the emergency by doing what they do: finding street dogs and feeding them. “People were sending us messages whenever they saw a group of dogs at a location, and we would go out with food and follow their directions. The first few days, some of us were stopped several times by the police because of the curfew, but then we got 40 passes from the district magistrate who had heard about our hurdles and asked us to get in touch,” Jose said.Weeks into the routine, their popular social media pages display a wide range of photos and videos of volunteers feeding the dogs whatever was available, from idlis to packaged treats. “We have put up memes and stories saying, ‘look at us, we have been hanging out with the dogs for a month now, and nothing has happened to us’.” Seeing these visuals, Jose said, more and more people have been shrugging off the rumors and helping the “streeties.”Their work at the moment goes beyond feel-good messaging. The Pawsome volunteers also use their wide social media network, including WhatsApp groups, to make people aware of the punishments under the Indian Penal Code for killing, caging, poisoning, and maiming animals. They also regularly file police cases in partnership with the local animal shelter against individuals or housing societies breaking these laws. “The good thing is most of our volunteers are young, so they are not shy to speak their minds,” Jose said.The results are already showing. “We are hearing back from some people who are saying that they changed their minds about giving up their pets. People are also uploading photos and videos feeding street animals and tagging us in their posts.”It’s not only the dogs on the streets who are being fed but also goats, cows, and even horses who find themselves abandoned during the lockdown. “Four or five days ago, the volunteer for PN Pudur road went to feed the dogs but before they could even taste the curd-rice, a goat came and ate it all. The dogs didn’t mind; they were quietly watching!”In Coimbatore, said district collector Thiru K Rajamani, “the street animals have been taken care of by individuals from day one of the lockdown. These animal lovers -- girls and boys both – have been tracking each neighbourhood and making sure that no dog or cat on the street goes hungry.”Riddhi Mittal, CovidIndia.Org, BengaluruOn March 11, Riddhi Mittal, a startup entrepreneur based in Bengaluru, had her ‘oh no’ moment with regards to the global spread of coronavirus. She had just read the now-viral Medium article ‘Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now’ by fellow Stanford alumni Tomas Pueyo. “It was a 25-minute read, and I thought I will give it five minutes, but I ended up reading it over and over again,” she said. Mittal spent the following 48 hours researching Covid-19 “like a maniac”.When she was done, she cleared up her calendar for the next six months and made about 50 phone calls. “To people in startup ecosystem, industry bodies, government, policy community, health tech network,” she said. “I understood how dire the situation is going to become in India.” On March 13, she joined CovidIndia.org, her friend Girish Khera’s all-encompassing tech platform aimed at battling the spread of the coronavirus in India. Spread out over a website, multiple social media channels and partnerships with stakeholders, Covid India aggregates data, builds and reviews tech products, aids sourcing and supply of health equipment, and strategizes with governments and companies. It’s a “100% volunteer effort. Everyone has a day job,” Mittal points out. “Since March 14, when we had 40 volunteers, we have been growing by 200-300 every day. Today we number over 1,000. The volunteers bring such diverse experiences -- some I couldn’t have imagined in my wildest dreams, from election management to social work.”They start by asking everyone fighting Covid-19 in India the same question: what do you need to know? Bridging the “information asymmetry”, Mittal points out, is central to India’s coronavirus challenge. So their website is designed around providing constantly updated information from multiple sources -- ministry of health and family welfare, Indian Council of Medical Research, state and district governments, individuals (verified by official sources) – about multiple dimensions of the virus’s spread: number of infections and deaths, testing history, state-wise numbers, quarantine capacity, drug availability, ICU beds. Mittal says aggregating data at that scale in India isn’t easy. “We need access to data top down and bottom up. No one right now has the access to data that people need to take decisions in the correct fashion. We get a lot of requests for data: what is the production capacity of mask manufacturers in India, what is the list of pan-India hospitals treating Covid-19 cases, what is the exact need for ventilators in all Covid-19 hospitals. But this data exists in silos. And when you go bottom to top, data quality control is a challenge.”She says the CovidIndia.org team is doing its best at making the flow of information smoother among governments (central, state, and district), companies and individuals while factoring in their respective concerns and interests. Their methods are complicated, but their goal is simple: “We want to help Indian citizens and Indian government.”“Governments should work closely with citizens,” said Captain Manivannan, the IAS officer leading Karnataka government’s information department, on volunteer-driven initiatives such as CovidIndia.org. “I am delighted to see them. Those times are gone when the government used to handle everything on its own. In this era of complex issues and need for faster solutions, we need to ramp up the delivery mechanism with the best options we have, government or non government.”Shivendra Kumar, Dignity Foundation, Delhi-NCRKumar and his team of volunteers and coordinators have been spending a lot of time on video communication apps lately. “Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp,” he said. Active in six cities across India, the Dignity Foundation’s mission is to “enable senior citizens lead active lives through easy access to trusted information, opportunities for productive ageing and social support services”. Daily meetups with the members at its physical centres was one of their core activities until Covid-19 struck Indian cities. In Delhi-NCR, where the foundation has 110 senior-citizen members, Kumar says the social distancing rules have led to a “complete lockdown” for them because old age and existing illnesses make them especially vulnerable to infection. Cut off from their social and support networks, many of them face a wide range of worries, from filling up their days to finding groceries and medicines. “No gardens, no roads, no going up to the neighbour for a chat. Those who only had domestic staff find themselves alone with nobody else in the house,” Kumar said. So, while many of the foundation’s volunteers are delivering essential supplies to their houses, some are also helping them socialize over video.“On Zoom calls with our volunteers and other members, they are showcasing their talents and pastimes. Some sing, some talk about the books they are reading, mainly motivational titles at this time. Some talk about their cooking,” Kumar said. His team is using the video platforms to connect them to the resources they need to carry on with the curfews. “Depending on their need, we have them on video with dieticians, Yoga teachers, doctors. To keep physically active while indoors, we are trying new things. Like teach them yoga postures they can practice while standing or working in the kitchen. Or yoga with meditation or yoga set to songs rather than structured exercises.”For some of them, Kumar points out, this is the first exposure to live video. “Of our 110 members in Delhi-NCR, 60 have joined us on video calls so far. It hasn’t been easy for some of them. They get frustrated if the connection breaks down. Some had been using 2G handsets so far, so their families are helping them move on to advanced smartphones,” he said. Many are learning fast. “From not using smartphones, some have progressed to leaning how to cook by watching YouTube videos. They like learning things on YouTube -- someone is talking to them while teaching them something. Some are chatting with multiple people at the same time on different screens.”For 69-year-old Surinder Mohan Sharma, a resident of Safdarjang Enclave, the days are now structured around these Zoom sessions. “We have a yoga session 4-5 days a week with an instructor from Gurugram who teaches 15 of us. I also have individual video calls with the volunteers. A quiz session is coming up later this week to keep us mentally active, and we are also looking forward to our next singing get-together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/everyday-heroes-of-the-pandemic/story-CAQb1pj8Es94mIOVAFRLNL.html
11-04-2020||India||Most coronaviruses seasonal; Sars-CoV-2 presents mystery||Out of the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, four are seasonal and cause common respiratory infections that transmit similar to influenza, according to a new paper by public health researchers at the University of Michigan. The authors of the study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases on April 4, say that their findings may help investigators better prepare for the Covid-19 pandemic. But it is not possible to say that SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, will also behave as the four do, they say. The researchers used data from an ongoing 10-year household influenza vaccine evaluation study based on hundreds of individuals infected by the four mild coronaviruses: OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. The rest of the three are SARS-CoV, MERS or EMC, and SARS-CoV-2.The researchers from the epidemiology department of the University of Michigan School of Public Health found that 9% of adult cases and 20% of cases in children associated with these four coronaviruses involved doctor visits. During year-round surveillance, most coronavirus cases were detected between December and May with a peak in January-February. Only 2.5% of cases were seen between June and September.The highest infection frequency was among children under five. Of 993 infections, about 260 were acquired from an infected household member. The transmission window for the infection acquired from a household member ranged from 3.2 to 3.6 days. Cases in children under five and adults over 50 were more likely to manifest themselves as severe disease.Coronaviruses have long been recognised as human respiratory pathogens manifesting as mild respiratory illnesses. But when animal coronaviruses spill over to humans, they are known to cause severe diseases as in the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012.“Even though the seasonal coronaviruses found in Michigan are related to SARS-CoV-2, we do not know whether that virus will behave like the seasonal coronaviruses,” said Arnold Monto, a professor at the University of Michigan and co-author of the study, in a statement.Amit Singh, an associate professor at Bengaluru’s Indian Institute of Science, said based on the clues from other coronaviruses that infect humans, it is possible that Covid-19 will eventually become seasonal. “A 10-year-old study conducted in the UK on three coronaviruses isolated from humans showed marked winter seasonality. Several unpublished observations seem to suggest that higher temperatures are linked to lower incidences of Covid-19. However, without data assembled over a number of seasons, the relation between Covid-19 and seasonality is mostly a prediction.”Singh said if the incidence of Covid-19 reduces over the coming months, it could be due to a number of reasons: effective lockdown, the build-up of immunity, or high temperatures. “Since the virus is new, we do not have immunity against it. However, once infection happens and people recover, we are likely to grow immunity against the pathogen,” he said. He added most of the pathogens like to persist in the host to maintain the reservoir. “If Covid-19 mutates at a much slower rate, then the ongoing wave of Covid-19 will generate immunity in the population, which eventually reduces the transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus.”Dr T Jacob John, a former head of virology at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, said the future is very predictable. “At the end of 21 days, the government may extend the lockdown [imposed to check the spread of the disease]... lifting the lockdown would mean opening the floodgates. The initial spread of the infection will be very slow; a few cases here and there. Then cases will increase...like an avalanche. Maybe the speed of transmission will slow down in summer and then catch up again when the temperature falls. For prevention, people should continue to exercise physical distancing of about six feet but continue with social life and relationships.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-race-for-vaccine-heats-up-new-techs-come-to-fore/story-obw3C8MO20E108VnnVnVBP.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Truckers demand Rs 50 lakh insurance in meeting with govt||The Centre reached out to road transporters on Friday to resolve problems being faced by stranded truck drivers during the coronavirus lockdown so that essential supplies reach their destinations.At a meeting with the transport ministry through video conference, transporters sought safeguards including Rs 50 lakh insurance cover for those engaged in the supply chain and free medical treatment for those who test positive for the virus. “We have been in touch with various transport associations since the lockdown and have assured government support. We have remained in touch with the home ministry and are tracking issues with the movements of goods. A decision on the demand for insurance cover will be taken soon,” a senior government official said, requesting anonymity. Trucks will be sanitized and their drivers will undergo screening at the loading and unloading poingts and also every 200 kilometres along the highways, under one recommendation by the ministry. Testing stations and screening of drivers has been suggested at strategic locations. Transporters have also asked the government to allow five drivers to travel in one truck with their driving licenses deemed as valid passes to enable them to reach transportation centres. Minister of state for road transport and highways Gen VK Singh (retd), transport secretary Sanjeev Ranjan and other senior ministry officials attended the meeting via conference with the apex road transport body All India Motor Transport Congress. “The movement of essential goods to the remotest corner of the country could get jeopardised due to restricted mobility of the drivers, first, due to lack of means of transportation and secondly due to stringent lockdown measures of certain hotspot areas by local administrations, which are also hubs of the {truck} driver community, like Mewat in Haryana,” said Kultaran Singh Atwal, president, AIMTC. A location suggested for the screening of drivers includes NH 1, Palwal in Haryana, a gateway to Mewat that is home thousands of truck drivers. “We have apprised the minister of challenges like non-percolation of the directives of the home ministry to the enforcement personnel at the ground level; scarcity of drivers, our efforts in counselling and motivating them and how to motivate the drivers to come back and mitigate fear psychosis,” Atwal said. Tens of thousands of trucks have been left stranded across state borders since the lockdown took effect on March 25. The government has issued several advisories to state chief secretaries that movement of both essential and non-essential goods be allowed, seeking to avoid shortages.“ We have to work to avert another major crisis of disruption of supply chain of essential commodities across the country. Several interventions are needed to encourage the labour workforce and drivers to return,” Singh said. Hindustan Times on Friday reported that prices of key staples, barring cereals, have surged nearly three times from a month ago because of a noticeable supply shock amid the three-week nationwide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/truckers-demand-rs-50l-insurance-in-meeting-with-govt/story-YNd5lZ3TeinQ0Or44c2sWK.html
11-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Mumbai’s cases cross 1,000 after 132 more test positive||Mumbai’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases crossed 1,000 on Friday, taking just 10 days to multiply tenfold, as health workers in India’s commercial capital ramp up testing for the infection, which has so far left 64 people dead in the city. The city recorded 132 cases on Friday, including two nurses at a hospital that was ordered to stop admitting new patients and two Tablighi Jamaat followers, taking the number of people confirmed to have been infected by the virus to 1,008. Ten more deaths took the count of fatalities to 64 in the Maharashtra capital, the Indian city worst hit by the pandemic.It took Mumbai 20 days to breach the 100-case mark after the first two patients, an Andheri-based couple, were identified on March 11. On March 31, the city crossed the 100-patient mark, taking the number to 151. Since then, the number of coronavirus disease cases has been multiplying faster.The city crossed the 200-patient mark (235 cases) on April 2, the number doubling in two days. The number of Covid-19 cases tripled in the next six days. Similarly, the death count due to the virus has increased at a faster pace.By April 9, the city had registered 54 deaths, which rose to 64 on Friday.Mumbai’s first death linked to the virus was reported on March 17 when a 64-year-old man died in Kasturba Hospital. It then took 13 days to register 10 deaths. The death count tripled to 30 on April 5, and more than doubled to 64 on Friday, April 10 . Mumbai municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said the rise in the number of coronavirus cases and the death count was directly proportional to the higher level of testing for the disease in the city. “High-level testing is our weapon through which we have identified many positive cases at an early stage, thereby, reducing the chances of community transmission. We are extracting more and more cases before the 14-day cycle of the virus so that these numbers don’t burst and emerge as community spread,” Pardeshi added.Mumbai’s G south ward that spans areas like Worli and Prabhdevi has reported the maximum number of positive cases at 199. The E ward, which covers Byculla, Mazgaon and Central Mumbai, ranks second with 69 positive cases, followed by the D ward that includes areas like Malabar Hill and Grant Road with 61 positive cases. Medical experts said the government should opt for random community testing to for a true picture of the virus’s spread. “Yes it is necessary to do testing on large scale, but it is not enough. In addition to that the government should go for random testing in areas like Dharavi and Worli to get information about the community spread of the virus,” Dr Shashikant Ahankari, a community health specialist and president of the Halo Medical Foundation, said. To deal with the challenge of testing people in densely populated areas like Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to procure 50,000 rapid testing kits. This antibody test kits will be made available within next three-four days (Wednesday-Thursday ), said a senior official from the civic health department. On Friday, six more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Dharavi, taking the total in the slum to 28, a BMC official said. These included two persons who returned from the Tablighi Jamaat religious event held in mid-March in the group’s Markaz headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin basti, which has emerged as India’s biggest coronavirus hotspot.“Among those identified as Tabligi attendees in our search operation, two tested positive on Friday. One of them is from Dr Baliga Nagar and another from the PMGP Colony. We have already started tracing their high-risk contacts,” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North Ward, said. Two nurses, aged 27 years and 42 years, of Dadar’s Shushrusha Hospital also tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday following which authorities asked the hospital to stop taking in any new patients. The BMC has asked the hospital to quarantine nearly 28 nurses who are employed there.The civic body has given 48 hours to the hospital to discharge all existing patients after proper screening.(With inputs from Sagar Pillai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-s-cases-cross-1-000-after-132-more-test-positive/story-UhMjZJJNLP9r1UgHm9O2wN.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19 in India: Rising infections among medical staff raise preparedness concerns||In the past two weeks,at least 90 doctors and medical workers have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19 ) in Mumbai hospitals, raising questions about the preparedness of hospitals to tackle the pandemic. In all, eight private super speciality hospitals, having 1,500 beds, have been sealed in Mumbai. Across the country, the total number of health workers who have tested positive for Covid-19 has increased to 200 and as many as 12 private hospitals have been sealed. On Thursday, a doctor died in Indore, Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 hotspot, but he was not on Covid-19 duty, the government clarified. Still, in both Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, health workers’ associations have complained of inadequate masks, gloves and personal protection equipment (PPE). Globally, many health workers have died after getting infected.  The list of hospitals and clinics in Mumbai that have been restricted from taking new admissions include major medical centres such as Saifee, Jaslok, Breach Candy and Wockhardt. On Friday, another new hospital, Shushrusha Hospital in Dadar, was sealed after two nurses were diagnosed with Covid-19. Apart from the medical staff, which includes at least 50 doctors who are being treated for Covid-19, another 200 health workers, including doctors and nurses, have been quarantined for 14 days at these hospitals. “It is essential to keep the hospital closed for a period of 14 days for the safety of other patients. We disinfect the wards and take samples of the close contacts. This is as per the protocols set by the Union Health Ministry,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC.Sealing off hospitals for 14 days during an epidemic is not a good idea, said doctors.“A rescue plan to isolate infected workers and the sanitisation of premises should be formulated to reopen these institutions within 24-48 hours instead of a prolonged shutdown of 14 days or more,” said Dr Ramen Goel, President, Indian Association of Gastro-intestinal Endo-Surgeons (IAGES). In Rajasthan, a small private hospital in Jaipur’s Surajpole area was sealed on Thursday, after the health workers there tested positive for Covid-19, officials said, as the total number of health workers infected with the deadly virus increased to around 50 in the state. Some of them have recovered. Earlier, a private hospital in Bhilwara, where three doctors and 14 health care staff tested positive, was sealed. In Haryana, a nurse at the general hospital, Panchkula, a microbiologist at the civil hospital, Gurugram, and a malaria worker at Faridabad, tested positive , leading to the closure of some wings of these hospitals.“While the microbiologist has been completely cured, the nurse and malaria worker have also been responding well to the treatment,” said Haryana director general, health services, Dr SB Kamboj .In Uttar Pradesh, one resident doctor at King George’s Medical University in Lucknow was infected. In West Bengal, the superintendent of Howrah district hospital, where two persons who tested positive for Covid-19 died over the past 10 days, tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday night, following which he was admitted at a Covid-care hospital on Thursday morning. A health worker at the hospital has also tested positive.All health workers are now covered under the national health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat. Some state governments have also provided them additional health insurance cover. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced compensation for any health worker dying because of the coronavirus disease. Several other state governments have announced similar compensation packages.(with inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-curbs-screening-help-state-stay-clear/story-cYxZxze8rXDDLlhlQNU1RI.html
11-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Early curbs, screening help Sikkim stay clear||Siliguri: Strict screening of travellers since January and banning the entry of foreigners and residents of other states since the first week of March has helped the small Himalayan state of Sikkim, which shares its borders with China to the north, Nepal to the east, Bhutan to the west, and West Bengal to the south, remain clear of Covid-19 till date. As of Thursday, its international neighbours had 1160, 8 and 3 active cases respectively, while West Bengal has reported 107 cases till date. Sikkim banned the entry of foreigners and Indians from other states in the first week of March well before the nationwide lockdown began on March 25. Even before that, in January, Sikkim began to screen travellers at Rangpo and Melli, the two main entry points into the state — their details were jotted down, and their health status was checked. Jacob Khaling, political secretary to the chief minister, said, “The state government started taking precautionary measures much before the coronavirus was taken seriously in the country. From January 28 we started sanitization programmes at Melli and Rangpo borders and started keeping records of all travellers and screened them.”The landlocked state, Sikkim chief minister Prem Singh Tamang said, has enough rice to feed people for three months and there is no fund crunch to fight Covid-19. Tourism is Sikkim’s primary industry and the state stands to lose revenue with the lockdown. But for now, it has managed to stave off Covid-19 cases. “For the sake of the safety of the people we did not look at economic losses and took early and hard decisions, which includes sealing the borders and banning entry of international and domestic tourists,” Tamang told HT.Most of the essential commodities needed by Sikkim are sent from Siliguri in West Bengal. Vehicles carrying essential goods have been given special permission to ply between Sikkim and Siliguri, The government has also been getting its supplies of pulses and edible oil from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh.Wire fences have been put up along some parts of the border that are unmanned and wild, particularly along shallow rivers and streams from where people can cross into the state. More than 2000 policemen have been deployed to keep vigil on hill tracks, rivulets and forest paths adjoining Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills in Bengal that are used regularly by people.Sudhakar Rao, special director general of police, Sikkim, said that all loop roads in the hills are guarded round the clock and not a single person is being allowed to cross the border. M K Sharma, state health minister, said, “More than 500 people including students returned from other states and they are in quarantine at different locations in all four districts. Some have also returned home (after spending time in quarantine). The state government has made arrangements for isolation in government hospitals equipped with ventilators.” In addition to Rs 50 crore allotted as part of the State Disaster Management Fund, Rs 175 crore has been sanctioned from the North East Council to tackle Covid 19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-curbs-screening-help-state-stay-clear/story-CIoJLBQh2VnB380zK3PC8L.html

Many of them returned from big cities to their homes on foot. The Centre has directed all states and Union territories to use their State Disaster Response Fund to provide temporary accommodation, food, clothing and medical care to migrant labourers left jobless because of the lockdown.Mahesh Jena on April 7 arrived in Odisha’s Jajpur town, where he was stopped at a check post installed to stop outsiders from entering the district. “With a rucksack on his back, he was cycling. After lockdown was announced, the factory in Maharashtra where he worked as a daily labourer was closed leaving him and several others in great misery. He somehow managed to get a rickety bicycle from a local there and started cycling to his home in Odisha,” said police inspector Ashish Kumar Sahu.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicJena was first screened as per protocol at the district headquarters hospital and found without any symptoms of Covid-19. He was then sent to a government quarantine centre set up at a high school in the district, where he would be kept for 14 days. Jena said he was left with no options when the factory was closed. “When the factory was closed we were told that it would not reopen for the next five months. I figured out that if I continued to stay then I would run out of money quickly. So the only option was leaving the place at any cost,” said Jena. He bought a rickety bicycle for Rs 1,200 on March 31 and then spent another Rs 500 to replace its tyre and tube. On April 1, Jena began his journey at 4.30 am. His initial plan was to reach his village in 15 days. “When I started, I did not want to stop, I rode during the daytime and carried on till 12 in the night. I would then look for a temple or roadside dhaba to sleep,” said Jena. He ate at roadside dhabas or at places where local police and some voluntary organisations offered free food. During the journey, he had to replace his cycle tyres. His phone too conked off.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHis initial plan was to reach his village in 15 days. “When I first arrived in Sangli along with my village friend 7 months ago, I had hazy idea about the route. On April 1 when I started from Sangli, I thought I could cover about 120-130 km a day on the cycle and reach home. But when I started, I did not want to stop, I rode during the daytime and carried on till 12 in the night. I would then look for a temple or roadside dhaba to sleep off,” said Jena.After reaching Sholapur, he rode towards Hyderabad and then towards Vijayawada. From there he went to Vishakhapatnam and Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh till he entered Odisha at Ganjam. From Ganjam he cycled to Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and finally Jajpur on April 7 evening.“I was worried about being picked up by police during my journey. I was stopped twice by police on Andhra-Maharashtra border and Andhra-Odisha border, but I was allowed to go,” said Jena, who lived with his uncle and father in a dilapidiated asbestos-roofed home in Jajpur before leaving for Maharashtra. He has not seen his mother from his childhood.Jajpur block development officer Sourav Chakraborty said it was incredible the way he cycled to his home. “His journey would make a very good script for a movie,” said the BDO. Jena has not shown any symptoms of Covid -19.Avid cyclist and president of Bhubaneswar Cycling and Adventure Club, Sanjeeb Panda said the journey of the youth showed his grit and deternination. “As cyclists, we take lot of precautions during long journey and are careful about adequate consumption of electrolytes. We ride cycles that are geared for such long journeys. What the youth achieved without having access to modern bicycle is fabulous achievement,” said Panda.Having spent 5 days in the quarantine home, Jena said the meal of rice and dalma(a boiled curry of lentil and vegetables) being served twice a day was getting too boring. “How long can you eat the same food twice a day? After I am discharged from the quarantine centre, I plan to go back home and have a nice meal. Once the factories reopen I would again go back,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-year-old-cycles-1k-km-from-maha-to-reach-home-in-odisha-in-a-week/story-KhYozURsZEJpSBE7wwmnIN.html

The Centre also asked the authorities to keep tabs on social media and act against objectionable content.“Clause 9 & 10 of the Consolidated Guidelines (on the lockdown) state that no religious congregation will be permitted without any exception and all social/cultural/religious functions/gatherings shall be barred,” the order said.For the attention of the public authorities, social/religious organisations and citizens, guidelines of the lockdown should be widely circulated. People violating the guidelines will face penal action under provisions of the law, the order said.“There are several festivals in the coming week. In this regard, several community leaders have come forward and are convincing their respective communities to assist the government in strictly implementing lockdown,” a spokesperson for the home ministry tweeted. Shab-e-Barat was marked on Thursday and Good Friday was observed on April 10. Festivals such as Baisakhi, Rongali Bihu, Vishu, Poila Boishakh, Puthandu and Maha Vishuba Sankranti too fall in April.The 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to end on April 14. Although the government is yet to decide whether it should be extended. there are indications that the restrictions would be prolonged.A senior Indian Police Service officer in Uttar Pradesh, who didn’t wish to be named, said the state was deploying an adequate number of personnel at places of worship ahead of the festivals, and drones were being used to monitor the movement of people in such areas. “Anybody violating the lockdown will face strict action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-religious-meets-during-lockdown-centre-tells-states/story-slUlpM44fIKSQiFvRSMApN.html
11-04-2020||India||More hospitals being approached to join Ayushman Bharat||With many of its 20,000 empanelled hospitals being converted into dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hospitals, the implementing agency of the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme has launched an express empanelment service to rapidly get on board more hospitals so non-Covid beneficiaries don’t lose out on medical treatment. For Covid-19 treatment, separate treatment packages are being created that states government will take a final call on. Several medical colleges, civil hospitals and district hospitals, which were otherwise treating the bulk of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (AB-PMJA) patients, are being converted into dedicated Covid-19 facilities in States.The National Health Authority (NHA), which implements the state-run insurance scheme, has started a new service called Hospital Empanelment Module (HEM) Lite, for patients suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, cardiac issues and diabetes that require continuous treatment.“We are also dividing our empanelled hospitals under Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 hospitals, largely to prevent cross-infection. Since most of the hospitals are providing Covid-19 treatment, we decided to bring more hospitals on board for non-Covid patients,” said Dr Indu Bhushan, chief executive officer of AB-PMJAY.“The packages, especially for Covid-19 treatment, are being designed since it is a new disease and doesn’t fit into our regular package structure. We have given states a free hand and they will be designing as per local needs. These hospitals have the choice whether to provide regular treatment under the scheme or convert themselves into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals,” he said.The express empanelment will be open for three months, and later extended if a hospital desires but it will have to go through the usual empanelment process that may take longer. “We are merely fast-tracking the process now keeping in mind the outbreak situation,” said Dr. Bhushan.Using the HEM Lite process, it will take less than one hour for a hospital to fill the application form along with documents. The system has been built in a way to ensure that the rest of the process of approvals by concerned authorities is expeditious, say NHA officials.Last week, the government had brought testing and treatment of Covid-19 under AB-PMJAY so as to provide free testing and treatment to the beneficiaries at private labs and hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-hospitals-being-approached-to-join-ayushman-bharat/story-sXtFn1dWfP4DrHn9ZLhlnM.html
11-04-2020||India||Govt plans changes in law to allow 12-hour shifts in factories||The Union government is considering a change in a 1948 law to allow longer shifts in factories as it works out ways to help factories cope with fewer workers and high demand -- and all against a context where the ongoing nationwide lockdown is likely to continue beyond April 15. The change will allow companies to extend the daily shift, from the current accepted norm of 8 hours, six days a week (or 48 hours) to up to 12 hours, six days a week (72 hours).  According to two senior officials in the know of the matter, a proposal is under “active consideration” to amend the Factories Act of 1948. Section 51 of the Act says “No adult worker shall be required or allowed to work in a factory for more than forty-eight hours in any week.”Although there are provisions of overtime in the same act, which has been providing the key legislative framework in Indian industries for the past 72 years, the feeling in the government is that exceptional circumstances call for exceptional provisions. One of the eleven empowered groups of senior bureaucrats, the one on “facilitating supply chain and logistics management for availability of necessary items such as food and medicine” is pushing for the amendments to allow up to 12-hours of daily shifts from the 8-hour schedule in factories making essential goods.An executive at a large consumer products company that also makes essential products said on condition of anonymity that the shortage of workers is a real problem -- not because his company employs contract workers (it doesn’t) but because local administrators have to take a call on how many workers they will allow so-called curfew passes to. In some cases, this person adds, it is 50%. In some, lower. Longer shifts will help in this context -- as long as the workers are paid proportionately more, something that is part of the plan. The proposal is being backed by a bunch of senior officials including consumer affairs secretary Pawan Agarwal and Guruprasad Mohapatra, secretary of Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, according to the two officials. Both Mohapatra and Agarwal are part of the empowered group mentioned in the first instance, that is headed by drinking water and sanitation secretary Parameswaran Iyer. The first official official, who is directly involved in the discussions said: “It can ensure lesser physical movement of a large number of workers amid restrictions. But longer working hours would also mean restarting production lines to higher capacity. Since workers will get paid extra money it will also solve their liquidity issues.”While a factory worker is already entitled to overtime, the factories act restricts such overtime to a maximum 120 hours over three months.The law also stipulates that for each hour of overtime, a worker is entitled to double the normal rate of wages.“The amendments will ensure higher earnings for a worker and also reduce the requirement of workers by 33%. The entire scheme perfectly fits the current situation when a large number of workers are at home or in the shelters provided by the states,” said the second official.According to the two officials, the government is also aware that only 270 out of 700 districts in India have reported Covid-19 patients. It has already received suggestions, they added, that in the remaining districts, industries should be allowed to reopen . On Friday, union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal interacted with industry bodies over their concerns which included shortage of labour, liquidity issues, cancellation of orders and massive losses.Trade union leaders, however, remain unimpressed with the proposal of extending the shift hours. “In some enterprises, workers are already working overtime. This is the government’s long term project to extend working hours and eventually, workers will work more with less payment. Instead of these cheap tactics, the government should look into the large-scale retrenchments that is talking place in industries across India now,” said CITU general secretary Tapan Sen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-changes-in-law-to-allow-12-hr-shifts-in-factories/story-eODI0qrWT6p757VMRPSqTP.html
11-04-2020||India||To boost sales, Centre asks states to suspend farm law||The Centre has recommended that states suspend certain provisions of their respective Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts for three months to allow farmers to sell their harvest from multiple locations and to any buyer, Union farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Friday. The move is aimed at encouraging social distancing and also ending farmer distress during the ongoing lockdown to fight the coronavirus disease, with disrupted supply chains forcing many producers to destroy their harvests. The APMC Act regulates buying and selling of farm produce in about 5000 mandis or markets across the country. The Act empowers states to notify markets to cater to a specific area and farmers can sell in their designated markets only. “Farmers should be able to sell to any buyer. Otherwise, all farmers of an area will converge in a single market, which will obstruct the principle of social distancing,” Tomar said in a video press conference. “Therefore, states have been requested to sidestep this Act for three months.”Tomar said procurement of wheat should start on April 15. The Centre has also asked states to start procuring 25% of pulses and oilseeds under the Centre’s price support scheme. On April 9, the agriculture ministry issued orders, invoking the market intervention scheme, which will allow the Centre to compensate horticulture farmers for a dip in wholesale prices and damages to harvested fruits. A nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease has impacted farmers as labour shortages and lack of buyers have thrown farm operations into disarray. This has also upended the farm-to-fork supply chain, as India fights the Covid-19 pandemic. Farmers in many states have been forced to dump perishable harvest due to lack of buyers, which has also depressed farmgate prices. Most farmers in northern and central India are in the middle of harvesting the biggest winter staple, wheat. “We can’t deny that farmers would have suffered losses, especially in perishable commodities. States are on alert. They have to do the assessment of such losses. If they want Centre’s help to compensate, we have a laid-down process and we will look into it with full compassion,” Tomar said. The minister added that if states grant exemptions to certain aspects of the APMC Act, then finding buyers should not be a problem. The Centre has therefore allowed large farmer producer organisations, which are rural agricultural businesses, large buyers, cooperatives and individual traders to buy farm produce, sidestepping the APMC regulations. The government has kept over 300,000 trucks ready to ferry harvests under the aegis of the national agriculture markets, an online trading platform, that has been updated to meet the needs of farmers during the lockdown.The farm sector, which employs nearly half the population, has been roiled by the lockdown. Arrivals (of farm commodities) in APMC markets have plunged sharply, down almost 60% in some markets from a month ago. Land transportation costs have risen sharply, as truckers struggle to cross interstate boundaries, despite exemptions from the lockdown. Restrictions and quarantine measures have resulted in crippling labour shortages, affecting loading, unloading and sorting of food commodities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-boost-sales-centre-asks-states-to-suspend-farm-law/story-wDIqQt1wdLzt6mxX3zBEwN.html

It had taken the intervention of National Security Adviser Ajit Doval to get them to vacate the building.Also read: Full list of 26 Delhi coronavirus hotspots after 3 additions on FridayThere were 24 who had already tested positive and at least 200 more already showed symptoms of the disease. Those who had the symptoms were moved to hospitals; the others to state-run quarantine centres. Nationwide and in Delhi, a massive search was also launched to quarantine every person who had been to the congregation or had come in close contact with those already tested positive. Across the country, there are over 22,000 such people in quarantine centres.A similar search in Delhi also led the police to hundreds of Jamaat followers including foreigners who had been hiding in the capital’s mosques. There were scores of others from the city who had gone home.According to a home department official in the city government, Tablighi Jamaat-linked cases accounted for a total of 554 out of 903 cases. That number is expected to increase over the next few days and weeks when test results for 176 more people come in. They had been in the government’s quarantine facilities for some days and were shifted to hospitals after they developed symptoms.Also read: 3 more Delhi areas under Covid-19 hard lockdown over Tablighi Jamaat casesThe authorities concede, as they did at a meeting chaired by Lt Governor Anil Baijal yesterday, that there could be scores of others. They have no way to be certain. And there could be more Covid-19 clusters that originated at the Markaz, the Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin.Three such clusters were identified on Friday and placed under a hard lockdown that bars people from stepping out of their homes. Instead, the authorities try to make arrangements to supply groceries and other essentials where possible.Friday’s decision raises the total number of localities in containment zones to 30. There were a few other localities that were brought under containment strategy but the details had not been released to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-900-patients-30-hotspots-how-jamaat-linked-cases-push-delhi-s-covid-19-cases/story-OydcTdL2b1HRG4rwdbUemM.html

The situation may likely to go out of hand causing more deaths. We can always revive the economy at a later stage, but we cannot bring back the lives,” KCR said at a press conference on Monday.Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy also held a high-level meeting to discuss the strategy to be adopted if the lockdown is continued or lifted. It was decided to work out a comprehensive strategy in all sectors in the event of continuation of lockdown.The government will take a call after the Centre takes a decision and the state is prepared for both the situations, an official familiar with the development said.The meeting also discussed in detail the steps being taken in the Covid-19 cluster zones where there are a large number of positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-to-decide-on-lockdown-extension-on-saturday-andhra-will-wait-and-watch/story-eY3KO46zH9Dwsi1k4rgoBJ.html

The Char Imli locality, where most of these bureaucrats reside, has been gripped with fear as an IAS officer, who has tested positive, insists on being treated at home so that she can continue her work with the department. The Bhopal district administration tried to convince her into being hospitalised, but she refused. However, the administration pasted a sticker outside her bungalow on Sunday advising people not to visit her.An IAS officer said, “She should understand the gravity of the problem and cooperate with the administration. A hospital-like facility can’t be created at home, and it is beneficial for her and all other officers in the colony that she be treated at a proper health facility.”The officer did not respond to phone calls. However, the officer in a video message on Sunday evening said, “I was working with health department personnel. It is possible that I got infected from any of them. But I don’t have any symptom of Covid-19 and I am completely healthy. As per doctors’ advice, I am working from my room.
