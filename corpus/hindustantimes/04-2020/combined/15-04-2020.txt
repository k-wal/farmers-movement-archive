But of one thing there can be no doubt. Even before Covid became the central feature of our lives, the economy was already in the doldrums. With a global recession expected and predictions about our growth rate scaled down to 1.5% or even lesser, this will get worse.In the post-Covid India, we will all be scared, damaged, poorer and even less sure of what the future holds for us than we were in the already gloomy pre-Covid era.But there is one other factor that we may not be paying enough attention to. In the post-pandemic world, we will have to work hard to repair relations between Hindus and Muslims. Rarely, in recent decades, have the two communities been so distrustful of each other.It started with the anger over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. Without going into the rights and wrongs of that issue, there is no doubt that many Indian Muslims interpreted the government’s moves as a way of treating them as second class citizens.I believed, perhaps naively, when the Covid crisis started that we could sort out our differences and fight the virus unitedly.Then the Tablighis set the agenda. I have written about the criminal behaviour of the Jamaat before so I won’t belabour the point.The Tablighi Jamaat means nothing to most Indian Muslims. It is a primitive, fundamentalist movement that would take Islam to the Middle Ages. Liberal Muslims all over the world do not waste any time defending it. Just as liberal Hindus are appalled by the things that Golwalkar of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh wrote, liberal Muslims disown their community’s fundamentalists and loonies. Even the RSS itself is now deleting the most embarrassing bits from new editions of Golwalkar’s books. Hindus do not believe that they have to find excuses for Golwalkar or for the misdeeds of other Hindus. When the Babri Masjid was demolished, the strongest condemnation came from liberal Hindus. Nobody in the mainstream said, “Yeah, but what about all the temples that Muslims had also destroyed?” There was no place for whataboutery or weak excuses.Perhaps it is because majorities behave differently from minorities, but after the Tablighi incident, some liberals (Hindu and Muslim) issued only qualified criticism of the Jamaat when outright condemnation was called for. And all too often they resorted to whataboutery.Once that whataboutery started, liberals were playing the RSS game. The Jamaat should have been seen as a lunatic fringe group of Muslims who endangered India’s fight against Covid. Instead, thanks to liberal naivete and communalist poison from both sides, the incident has now become a Hindu-Muslim thing. We sometimes forget that a desire to spawn strife is not just restricted to our own communalists. Several foreign countries have an interest, if not in fomenting Hindu-Muslim conflict, then certainly in keeping India weakened and divided.Thousands of fake messages have gone out to Muslims on social media ”documenting” entirely non-existent cases of persecution and warning of dire consequences from the authorities if they dare admit to having contracted the infection. That’s one possible reason why some of those who attended the Jamaat gathering are now absconding. And that’s why we have not been able to track down everyone who was inside that petri-dish of corona infection.The trouble with communal tension is that, like the coronavirus, it grows exponentially.A primitive Muslim sect uses the name of God to keep devotees from following the rules of the lockdown. When they are caught and a backlash ensues, Muslims are told that they will be tortured by the police. They hide. They infect more people. Public opinion grows against them. Persecution does begin. And so the cycle goes.It has now got to the stage in Delhi where even secular Hindus ask whether it is safe to order biryani (“do you think the cooks may be infected?”) and check the religion of delivery boys (“only because of corona, na!”). It is heartbreaking to see the kind of abuse and discrimination that innocent Muslims are being subjected to. Videos aired on TV channels and social media show Muslim vendors being asked to leave markets, Muslims being denied entry to shops and much more. For how long will Muslims take these humiliations before beginning to wonder if their own country is rejecting them?It is very difficult — if not impossible — to break the circle of mistrust and hatred when it gets to this level.And I fear that the gulf between communities will grow. Some of it will come from extremists on both sides. Some of it is coming from digital armies across our border. And some of it, sadly, is being fanned to win votes.When the virus is brought under control and we confront the recession, we will be encouraged to forget that even before Covid arrived, our economy was already in trouble.Instead, we will be told that India was doing fine. Even the fight against Covid was going well till Muslims decided to sabotage the government’s efforts and refused to practise physical distancing or to be tested. Yes, it will be said, there is a recession but that’s only because of Covid. And we could have handled Covid if it wasn’t for the Muslims. The economy and the battle against corona were all destroyed by Muslims.Such words as ‘jihad’ will be flung around on TV channels and it will be suggested that Muslims did this deliberately because many of them are ‘anti-national.’ We must fight and defeat Covid. But once that’s done, we must work to restore communal harmony. And that will be an even more difficult struggle.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-post-covid-agenda-for-india-repairing-hindu-muslim-ties/story-o9EVEJUJ1twTcaXpGLuFOO.html
15-04-2020||News||India needs a strong fiscal stimulus||India has seen among the most stringent prevention responses to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) so far. With a complete lockdown for three weeks already, and a further 19 days added on Tuesday, it has hit the maximum in an index of stringency designed by the United Kingdom’s Overseas Development Institute. But its economic response has been among the weakest, with an outlay of less than 1% of GDP compared to 10% in the case of the United States (US), 16% in Malaysia and a staggering 20% in Japan. It is important to dismiss the argument that India is poor and hence cannot be expected to do what richer countries have done. When a response is classified as weak, the evaluation is not in terms of absolute sums of money, but of the outlay in relation to a country’s capacity measured by its GDP. As economic policy in India following the onset of Covid-19 must address both the relief made necessary by the lockdown and restoration of the level of activity after it is lifted, we may consider these two aspects together, terming the overall response needed as “stimulus”. What should the extent of this fiscal stimulus be? The level of the US stimulus may be taken as a benchmark. Concerns have already been expressed that a stimulus in India should be approached with caution as it has implications for the fiscal deficit. At 10% of GDP for 2019-20, the stimulus would amount to approximately Rs 20 lakh crore. This may come across as a huge figure.However, it is actually quite close to the direct loss of GDP due to a month’s lockdown, estimated as a 12th of annual GDP. If we are to take the multiplier to be 1.25, the final figure for loss due to the lockdown will exceed ~20 lakh crore. So, with a fiscal stimulus amounting to 10% of GDP, we would be no more than compensating for the economic shock that accompanied the lockdown.Now, what of the implications for the fiscal deficit? A stimulus of ~20 lakh crore by the Union government would lead to an estimated deficit of approximately 14% of GDP in 2020-21. The figure is arrived at assuming that nominal GDP will grow at 6% (2% real output growth plus 4% inflation), and that so would public revenues. Public expenditure has been calculated by adding the proposed stimulus to the budgetary estimate for 2020-21. These can only be ballpark figures. What are we to make of the estimated figure of 14% of GDP for the fiscal deficit implied by a stimulus package of 10% of GDP? Well, as we are working with the figure for the US stimulus as a benchmark, it may be mentioned that one published estimate of the deficit implication of the US stimulus of two trillion dollars is that it will lead to a fiscal deficit of 14%. So, what is being proposed here is not unheard of. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated “Jaan bhi aur jahan bhi”, implying that the economy cannot be ignored even as we are engaged in saving lives, the government is yet to announce a stimulus beyond a meagre relief package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore. Some economists look askance at the proposal for a fiscal stimulus on grounds of macro-economic stability. However, for now, India has substantial stocks of foodgrain and reasonably high foreign exchange reserves. In its last assessment, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) figures show reserves exceeding outstanding short-term debt and cumulative portfolio capital inflows. Finally, crowding out of private investment can be avoided by the RBI absorbing the government bonds that will have to be issued. Before viewing this mechanism with horror, it would be worth recalling that growth accelerations have taken place in India at times when the budgetary deficit was monetised through central bank accommodation.However, it is important to go beyond the numbers and imagine the role of fiscal policy in creating the economy that we value. If there is anything that this pandemic has done for us, it is to expose the parlous state of the health infrastructure in India. In any reconstruction of this infrastructure, first would be hospitals, primary health centres and laboratories, but we are also constantly reminded of the poor state of public health services, extending from sanitation to waste management. We have few public toilets, inadequate sewerage or assured water supply for the majority. The coronavirus pandemic has made us realise how important public goods are for a dignified and secure life. A focused public spending is central to the reconstruction that must now begin if we are to have a meaningful future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-needs-a-strong-fiscal-stimulus/story-QYu2VqYMMtVESfuQkQswfP.html
15-04-2020||News||Covid-19: The five lessons of the Bhilwara model||On Tuesday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi extended the lockdown by another 19 days, till May 3. But there was a nuanced policy measure that the PM introduced in his speech. He spoke about hotspots — which represent clusters where a high number of cases have been identified and which can become sites of community transmission. These hotspots, he emphasised, had to be contained; the administration had to ensure that areas which were vulnerable were strictly monitored; and the overall objective had to remain to prevent the emergence of new hotspots. States, districts and sub-regions which are able to do so will see a relaxation of restrictions after April 20. Through this approach, the PM is attempting to balance the dual, often, conflicting objectives the country has to meet. On the one hand, it must soften the blow of the pandemic in a country of 1.3 billion people whose lives and livelihoods were forced to a grinding halt. On the other, it must spend time, money and resources on the containment of the disease, and eventually, its eradication. To do the latter, the PM’s reference to hotspots is crucial. It comes in the wake of several states in the country declaring certain areas as containment zones. In these zones, the lockdown is more strictly enforced; even essential supplies are delivered to houses; there is aggressive screening; testing is ramped up; isolation is enforced; the patients are treated; and the effort is to first flatten the curve and then ensure that the zone becomes free of disease. This model assumed national prominence because of the measures adopted in the textile town of Bhilwara in Rajasthan, which came to be known as “ruthless containment”, a phrase coined by the state’s additional secretary (health), Rohit Kumar Singh. The measures merit detailed examination because the model is now serving a broader template. Once it was discovered that the disease had arrived, and spread in the town, the Rajasthan state government, led by chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Singh, along with a determined and capable local district administration, aided ably by health care professionals and police personnel, worked tirelessly on two fronts: Precaution and treatment. The Bhilwara model proved to be a difficult, but necessary, method. It was difficult because the model caused large-scale public inconvenience — it is not easy for any regime, especially democratic regimes, to disrupt the lives of citizens. But this was done. The first lesson from Bhilwara, therefore, is that state governments must remain alert, have a constant feedback mechanism from the ground, respond promptly, and be ready to take decisions, purely on grounds of the spread of the disease and expert input. When the first case was reported on March 19, the administration did not hesitate to implement an inside-out curfew. Remember this was before the national lockdown was imposed. Restrictions were put in place, albeit leniently, and essential services were allowed during this time. However, fearing a greater spread, the administration gradually extended the geographical reach of the curfew by creating buffer zones, which ultimately covered the whole district. It then began tightening essential supplies. This was a Herculean, multi-pronged approach that required agencies to go door-to-door to deliver essentials. This, then, is the second lesson — adapt according to circumstances, implement even tougher measures when necessary, but do it sensitively and with a humane face to ensure that citizen needs are met. This was then supplemented with the aggressive screening of all residents, and continuous testing of symptomatic individuals. This is particularly praiseworthy since the nearest testing centre is in Jaipur, about 250 kilometres away from Bhilwara. Over time, government agencies established dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and arranged for vehicles to ferry people from the rural areas to get tested. Thousands of hotel rooms, and beds in other institutions and hostels, were set up as quarantine centres to keep symptomatic patients in isolation. This, then, is the third lesson. Hard measures are not an end in themselves. They are the means to ensure better health outcomes. And therefore, the period of strict lockdown has to be used to ramp up health infrastructure, test, isolate and treat. To keep local officials motivated, teams of elected village representatives right up to the subdivisional magistrates, were given special and specific responsibilities. This is the fourth lesson. India has robust institutions on the ground; it has leaders with roots in the community who have legitimacy with the people; it is important to make the entire process participatory by using these institutions and leaders. That will ensure popular buy-in. There is, however, a troubling trade-off involved in the Bhilwara model, as in other containment zones. Pandemics trigger health emergencies which demand coercive measures and the curtailment of some civil liberties that often don’t feature in democracies. These include restrictions on the freedom of movement — through curfew, quarantine, sealing borders and so on — and the rationing of supplies. But perhaps, in times of unprecedented crises, this is the only way forward. And that, then, is the final lesson. There will be short-term restrictions on rights — but it is for a larger public good, and conditional on the rights being restored when public health improves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-the-five-lessons-of-the-bhilwara-model/story-ExB8hp0sf07cssUwG0IdSL.html
15-04-2020||News||What the history of pandemics tells us about coronavirus||One of the good things about studying history is that no matter how bad things get, you can almost always find something from the past that was worse. This is also true about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has now engulfed the world. Perhaps the most comparable pandemic is the Spanish Flu, which lasted from January 1918 to December 1920. It infected some 500 million people and killed 50 million. To put this into perspective, the entire population of India, as per Census 1921, was about 250 million.The Spanish Flu took place almost exactly a century ago but it had several similarities with Covid-19. But this was not the only pandemic to have similarities with Covid-19.The three cholera pandemics of 1817-1824, 1826-1837 and 1846-1860 claimed more lives than any other disease outbreak in the 19th century. Originally starting in India and Central and Southeast Asia, cholera spread to China, from where it reached Europe through trade routes and Russian soldiers. It spread to Poland through Russian troops, who were brought in from various parts of the Tsar’s empire to suppress uprisings. It then spread from Poland to East Prussia, forcing the Prussian authorities to close their borders to Russian transport. By 1831, the situation was so severe that the British government issued quarantine orders for any Russian ships sailing to British ports. But it was too late. The pandemic had already spread to Britain, France and most of Europe and Asia. Hundreds of thousands died. More than a million died in the Russian Empire during the third pandemic alone, and at least a 100,000 in most affected nations with each successive wave. Thus, we can safely say that the death toll went into millions. The cholera pandemics of the 19th century had the most similarities with the coronavirus pandemic today. They both started in Asia, and spread to other parts of the world, deeply affecting specific nations (Russia for cholera, Italy and the United States for the coronavirus so far). They both also spread to other parts of the world through these specific nations and the affected populations were, unlike the global population that got Spanish influenza, not weakened by any major war — at least not on the industrial scale of World War I. The cholera pandemics, just like Covid-19, also called for ship quarantine measures and spread primarily through the people who had gone abroad and brought it back to their nations. These pandemics required social distancing to prevent the spread of the infection. Like Covid-19, the cholera pandemics brought with them large economic losses — not only could ships not enter many ports, bringing maritime trade to a standstill, overland trade was also greatly affected. The Silk Route and other Central Asian trade routes, which counted for the majority of overland trade, could not be used due to both the threat of getting the disease and the anti-cholera steps taken by the Russian Empire, which controlled most of Central Asia at that time. Large financial losses were incurred, especially by the British and the Russians, the two most affected parties in terms of trade. Both relied on their far-flung empires for resources and wealth.India can learn from the cholera pandemic, as it started here, and within months, hundreds of thousands were either infected or dead. At least 100,000 Indians and 10,000 British troops died in the first pandemic (1817-1824). This was partly because of not practising proper social distancing, which requires active participation from the people. Both an active government push, and deep citizen engagement and support, is clearly needed for social distancing and other public health measures. In Russia, the incompetence of Tsar Nicholas I’s regime in handling the pandemic across the massive rural expanses and the population of his vast empire led to more than a million deaths. While he ordered anti-cholera measures eventually, the damage had already been done. The delay in responding, and the vulnerability of large countries, with a substantial rural and floating population, must be factored into any response.To end on a positive note, no matter how bad they were, how many millions they killed, or how much they disrupted the economy, all of these pandemics were beaten, with the human race coming out stronger than ever. There was once a time when smallpox terrorised the world, but now it is all but eradicated. The Black Death was beaten. The Spanish Flu was beaten. The cholera epidemic was beaten. We have recovered and come out stronger than ever from all these diseases. I am sure that we will be able to defeat the coronavirus too.Shiv Malik is a student of Class 9, Vasant Valley School, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-the-history-of-pandemics-tells-us-about-coronavirus/story-Fb3XDfXe0lyk0JukqtdG1L.html
15-04-2020||Chandigarh||PGI serves show-cause notice to doc who gave projection on Covid cases to Punjab government||The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research has served a show-cause notice to a faculty member who reportedly provided assistance to the Punjab government regarding the projection of Covid-19 cases in the state.PGI officials said that an explanation has been sought from Dr Shankar Prinja, who serves as an additional professor at the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health.A senior PGI official not wishing to be named said, “There is a set protocol regarding carrying out research and providing assistance to external agencies, which has not been followed (in this case).”Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, said authorities were unaware that an expert or faculty member from the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health has carried out any study or given an estimate that the Covid-19 may peak by mid-September and can infect 58% of the country’s population. He, however, confirmed that a show-cause notice has been served.On April 10, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh claimed that 58% of the country’s population is likely to get infected with coronavirus while quoting a PGIMER study. He said that the infections were likely to peak by mid-September.Later, the institute issued a press note and clarified that no such study had been carried out to which the CM’s media advisor Raveen Thukral said the report cited by Captain was an assessment by Dr Prinja.Dr Prinja could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgi-serves-show-cause-notice-to-doc-who-gave-projection-on-covid-cases-to-punjab-government/story-XWMzGPDLzMtTZAFTpdmocP.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Police helpline got 300 calls from migrants since lockdown began||Around 300 calls, averaging to about 10 to 20 per day, have been received on number 100 from migrant labourers in need of food and shelter since the lockdown came into effect, said Mumbai Police on Wednesday. When asked what measures police is taking to ensure there is no repeat of the recent Bandra like situation, where nearly 2,000 migrant labourers gathered on Tuesday demanding to be sent back home, Pranaya Ashok, DCP (operations) and spokesperson for Mumbai Police said, “All police stations and traffic police have been asked to strengthen the nakabandi points to ensure labourers are not put in vehicles and taken out of the city. Essential service vehicles are especially being checked.”“We have increased our foot patrolling in areas where migrant labourers are staying to find and solve their issues. We along with BMC are ensuring they get basic facilities like food, ration and if they have an accommodation issue, then we with the help of NGOs are also providing them place at shelter homes,” added Ashok. The DCP added that they have received over 300 phone calls on 100 number since lockdown and 10 to 20 calls daily from migrant labourers. “We take their address and send a police team to the spot after getting the call and identify their problems like food or shelter. We then provide it with the help of BMC or NGOs,” added Ashok. The police said somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 migrant workers are staying in Mumbai city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/police-helpline-got-300-calls-from-migrants-since-lockdown-began/story-ScFHMKpr522xBCpB52epyO.html
15-04-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow: 2745 contacts of Covid-19 patients under the scanner||Through a three-layer surveillance mechanism, the Lucknow police intensified verification of the contacts of Covid-19 positive patients, police officials said.Joint commissioner of police (JCP), Law and Order, Naveen Arora said 2745 people had come in contact with 56 coronavirus positive patients, excluding 31 who tested positive on Wednesday.The JCP said one of the 28 people who tested positive in Sadar area had participated in a community kitchen organised in the area. Another such Covid-19 positive patient was a tailor who came in contact with multiple people. Besides, one Covid-19 positive person had a travel history to Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Naidu and Maharashtra, he added.He said the growing contact list of new positive patients would increase the work of the surveillance team.The JCP said the special cell constituted for surveillance of contacts of coronavirus positive patients was doing three-layer verification —digital verification by scanning mobile call details of Covid-19 positive patients, physical surveillance by collecting intelligence from the locality and field intelligence collected by special branch of the state intelligence as well as central intelligence agencies.He said 255 cell phones, including 32 cell phones of Covid-19 patients, were put under digital surveillance. The figure would rise now as 31 more people tested positive on Wednesday itself, he said.“We are collecting mobile phone details of these patients. Further screening will be done by approaching their mobile contacts with whom they have interacted or met during this period,” he said.POLICE DEPLOYMENT INCREASEDPolice deployment at all 13 hotspots was increased to ensure proper compliance with the lockdown, he said.“Other than three deputy commissioners of police (DCP) and three additional DCPs of three zones, eight assistant CPs, 11 police station in-charges, 88 sub-inspectors and 506 head constables and constables have been deployed at these 13 hotspots. In addition, over two companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary have been deployed in these areas,” he explained. CITY DIVIDED IN FIVE POLICE ZONESThe JCP said the entire Lucknow city is divided in five zones—east, west, north, south and central—which will be supervised by five deputy commissioners of police. He said these five zones are further divided in 14 sectors and 32 sub-sectors. Police deployment was done in two shifts of 12 hours each and, as many as 225 barriers, have been installed to restrict vehicular movement.“As many as 307 sub-inspectors, 292 women constables, 219 head constables and 718 constables are deployed at these barriers,” he said and added, “Moreover, 163 police response vehicles, including 86 four-wheelers and 77 two-wheelers, will keep patrolling the city.”11 TRAFFIC ZONESBesides, the city was divided in 11 traffic zones to restrict vehicular movement. He said at least 10 traffic inspectors, 58 traffic sub-inspectors, 42 head constable promotes, 179 head constables 646 constables and 305 home guards were deployed in these traffic zones. Eleven flying squads were constituted to check duty points, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-2745-contacts-of-covid-19-patients-under-the-scanner/story-UjSQU35YvZ7dxvrDv5YbIN.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Siddhivinayak padyatra cancelled, Mumbai devotees walk 25km at home||A Kandivli resident, Rakesh Bhandari, and his group of 25 pilgrims, who recently completed their 175th padayatra (walk) from their homes to the Siddhivinayak temple, on Tuesday continued their monthly tradition by enacting the pilgrimage by walking at their respective homes.Around 21 people including Bhandari walked for around 20 to 25 km at their respective homes, the same distance that they covered during their monthly group walks to Prabhadevi’s Siddhivinayak temple.“I had hoped that the lockdown will end on April 14, post which we would have walked to Siddhivinayak temple. However, as the lockdown was extended, we didn’t have an option but to walk at our homes to continue our tradition of padayatra,” said Bhandari. Bhandari along with a group of seven friends started the tradition of carrying out padayatras in 2005. The group now has about 200 members with a core team of around 25 people. On a monthly basis, at least 10 to 15 members walk to the shrine with their family and friends.“It was tough initially. But over the years, it became a fun exercise for all us. Considering we are all runners, when we reach near Mahim signal, we run the remaining stretch for 4.5 km,” said Rajesh Sharma, who stays at Ghatkopar.On Tuesday morning, they had decided a designated time when everyone would run at their homes and click a selfie at the end to get a feeling that they were all together. The run timing for each of them differed from three to five hours. A friend of theirs, who had participated in more than 100 padayatras with them before moving to Australia, also joined the group along with his wife on Tuesday. After the run, each of them prayed to the deity from their place and watched the prayers taking place live on Siddhivinayak temple’s website.Sanjay Karve, a chartered accountant who is a member of the group, spoke of a time when the group had managed to wade through waterlogging to reach the temple during monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/siddhivinayak-padyatra-cancelled-mumbai-devotees-walk-25km-at-home/story-1dYBJF16RNwBF7wahaZp6K.html
15-04-2020||City||P’kula count reaches seven as Sector 15 woman’s husband also tests positive||A day after a 44-year-old Panchkula woman, a resident of Sector 15, reportedly not having any travel history, tested positive for Covid-19; her husband also tested positive, taking the district’s count to seven. Confirming the same, Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said that the report of the 48-year-old man was confirmed positive on Wednesday evening. While the woman is a post office employee, her husband is an architect.The man was admitted in civil hospital’s isolation ward on Tuesday night after his wife had tested positive. 26 CONTACTS TRACED Panchkula deputy commissioner (DC) Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said that till now 26 people, who had recently come in contact with the woman, have been traced by the health department. They have been shifted to the civil hospital and tested for COVID-19. These include family members, relatives, a private doctor who attended to her and the doctor’s family. Ahuja said the woman had got her health checkup done at a private clinic in Sector 11 on April 6.“As per details, her condition deteriorated on April 2 and she consulted a private doctor afterwards. She came to the civil hospital at a later stage when she required a CT scan. Earlier, the spot was detected in an X-ray,” said the DC. He further said that it was a ‘serious’ case and the health department was trying to trace more people who had come in contact with her as the source of her infection was yet to be ascertained.“As a precautionary measure, I appeal to anyone, who had come in direct contact with her or her family in April, to visit the civil hospital for medical screening,” the DC said.The woman and her husband had claimed that they had stayed put at their residence and only went to the market to buy essential goods.It was also learnt that some relatives of the woman from Delhi had visited her in the last week of March.There are currently five active cases in Panchkula as the first two patients, both women, had recovered and were discharged from the hospital on April 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/p-kula-count-reaches-seven-as-sector-15-woman-s-husband-also-tests-positive/story-n4NjnE8qFQPMIL1M4NIP8I.html
15-04-2020||Lucknow||KGMU e-cards come in handy for blood donors||A young couple from Aishbagh in Lucknow entered the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) blood bank to voluntarily donate blood, an activity which has almost come to a standstill since imposition of the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown.A blood donor e-pass issued by the KGMU made the donation possible.“The passes are now being issued to interested donors as voluntary donation has become negligible though the need remains the same — around 190 units per day,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, head of the department of transfusion medicine at KGMU and head of the state blood bank on the campus.The step was taken as, otherwise, donors could not reach hospital. So, they asked Prof Chandra to find a solution.“They were unable to reach (hospital) as they did not have any document, such as a requisition form from a doctor,” said Prof Chandra, the brain behind the ‘Covid-19 voluntary blood donor’ cards.These duly filled and signed e-cards are issued by the blood bank and transferred via WhatsApp to the donor. “The police too know about these cards now,” she said.The donors can carry these cards on their cell phones and show them to the police on the way. The cards also mention the route to be taken and the date on which the pass has to be used, so that there is no scope for misuse.The Aishbagh couple, Brijesh Singh and Buddhamitra, went to KGMU with these cards. “The husband donated blood while the wife could not do so due to a fitness issue. But she can come again after a few days. We respect the gesture that voluntary blood donors are showing to maintain adequate stock in the blood and save lives,” said Prof Chandra.Voluntary donors can contact the blood bank and mention their details.

15-04-2020||City||Chandigarh classified Covid-19 hotspot, relaxations ruled out||With the Union health ministry on Wednesday identifying Chandigarh as one of the 170 Covid-19 hotspot districts, classifying it under red zone, strict restrictions will continue amid the nationwide lockdown till May 3.Now, the UT administration will not be able to introduce any new relaxation till the city remains in the red zone — a district with a high number or growth rate of cases.The other two zones are orange (potential hotspot) and green (free of pandemic).The development comes on the day when no fresh case was reported in the city for the third consecutive day, keeping the tally at 21, of which only 12 cases are active.Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, health, said: “In case, there is no positive case in the city for the next 14 days, it will move to orange zone, and if there is no positive case in the next 14 days, it will be identified as a green zone.”Earlier the administration was planning some relaxations after April 20, according to the April 15 guidelines of the ministry of home affairs. These cannot be introduced till the city moves to orange or green zone, said Gupta.“Hotspots are declared after 15 or more cases are reported from one particular geographical area. In a hotspot zone, comparatively stringent measures are taken to contain the spread of disease. It calls for more testing, restricted moment and aggressive contact tracing of the people who have been tested positive. Extra efforts are required to contain the situation,” said JS Thakur, chairman of the PGI Committee on Covid-19 Prevention and Information.According to the Centre’s guidelines, in hotspots, containment zones will be demarcated by the government as per guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare. In these containment zones, activities allowed for non-hotspot areas will not be permitted. There shall be a strict perimeter control in the area of the containment zones to ensure that there is no unchecked inward or outward movement of population except for maintaining essential services (including medical emergencies and law and order related duties) and government business continuity.A senior UT official, requesting anonymity, said: “Chandigarh has been declared a hotspot for being among ‘highest case load districts contributing to more than 80% of cases for each state in lndia’. It is unfortunate Chandigarh has been considered both a district and state, and we hope the central government reconsiders this particular criterion in the city’s case.”Meanwhile, In the interest of public health and safety, the Chandigarh administration, on Wednesday, banned with immediate effect, the spitting of paan or any chewable tobacco product, sputum, etc in public places, offices, workplaces, factories or establishments. UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “The administrator bans spitting in public places and violators will be criminally prosecuted.”WHAT ARE THE THREE ZONESRed Zone: No activity allowed except for essential and emergency servicesOrange Zone: Minimum activities like opening of limited public transport, harvesting of farm productsGreen Zone: Further relaxation, including opening of MSMEs with in-house lodging facilities for employees HOW CAN CHANDIGARH MOVE TO GREEN ZONEContainment operation will be deemed over when there is no case reported in 28 days after last case tests negative. Hotspots (red zones) will be assumed to be undertaking effective containment activities if no case is reported in 14 days (to be designated orange zones), and will be deemed successful in containment, if no case is reported for 28 days (to be designated green zones).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-classified-covid-19-hotspot-relaxations-ruled-out/story-DCPdZBkvBdAsEjyGhzEkIN.html

They just need a little creativity,” said Dr Gunjan Gupta, a pathologist and the brain behind the video.Dr Gupta got this video made in four days and it was ready on her birthday April 14. “How I made this video with clips of 20 women doctors is interesting,” she said.Dr Gupta asked the other doctors to record their dance on a particular portion of the lyrics of a song and send the clips via WhatsApp. This was the birthday gift she demanded from her friends.“The idea came during the lock-down as we could not meet nor do anything together. But we could chat on social media and send video clips to each other. And I insisted that all send a few seconds’ video,” she said.The song ‘Panchchi Banu Udti Phiru Mast Gagan Mein’ from the movie Chori Chori was selected as it is vibrant and positive.

15-04-2020||Mumbai||Need to counsel Covid-19 patients: Docs||On Wednesday, a 29-year-old patient of Covid-19 died by suicide in BYL Nair Hospital where she was undergoing treatment for the infection. This is the first case of a Covid-positive patient killing themselves. The incident highlights the urgent need to counsel patients, said doctors. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has since decided to form a special team that will provide counselling to those being treated for Covid-19.The Covid-19 patient was a resident of Worli and had been admitted to Nair Hospital on Monday. Yesterday, she tested positive for Covid-19. According to the hospital, she killed herself between 3.30am and 4am on Wednesday, in a bathroom in the isolation ward. Agripada police station has registered a case of accidental death.“There is growing fear among people about the virus. Fake messages on social media aggravate the situation along with social stigma. Counselling should be made mandatory for all quarantined people, especially Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, general secretary, Indian Psychiatric Society. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends counselling for both patients and caregivers.Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, health department, BMC, said, “We have decided to take the help of experts from our psychiatry department to counsel patients in order to strengthen the mental health of Covid-19 patients admitted to all hospitals in Mumbai.” The BMC will also deploy extra security staff in hospitals treating Covid-19 patients to increase surveillance of patients and security for doctors.Recovered patients have complained about the unavailability of counsellors in government and private hospitals. A 56-year-old Mira Road resident, who was admitted to Kasturba Hospital in March and was alone in the isolation ward, said, “Sometimes, I would cry. Then the nurses and midwives would come and cheer me up. I wish there had been a counsellor to talk to.”However, doctors working in isolation wards have questioned the feasibility of counselling in these areas since this would require a doctor to spend approximately 30 minutes with each patient. “Sitting in an isolation ward for so long can make the medico vulnerable to infection. Even for us, we try to attend patients as quickly as possible to avoid long stays,” said a doctor at Kasturba Hospital.Psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada said counselling sessions may be conducted using video calls. “Patients can be treated through video calls. But even for that, the hospital needs to connect the patients to us, which is not happening,” he said. After the state government announced its medical task force for patient management on Monday, psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty had alleged the team did not include any psychiatrists and written to the Prime Minister’s office, seeking a review. “This is the mental epidemic in the making. Patients with a history of mental illness require counselling. Otherwise, even though they recover from the virus, their mental health will be compromised,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-to-counsel-covid-19-patients-docs/story-4sQX37QPX8M2XC4q0l7oRJ.html

The police had called Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) teams, but so far no report of the fire has been shared with the police department. Police have not rounded up or arrested any person in the case.‘Administration overlooking demand for relocation’The shopkeepers allege that the UT administration has been overlooking their demand for relocation to a safer place.It is learnt the traders are running their business illegally as they do not have a licence. The UT administration had tried to evict them, but they got a stay order from the Punjab and Haryana high court in 1993. Thereafter, there has been no move to shift the market.Past incidentsThe previous major fire was reported in September 2016, when nine shops were gutted in fire started by wielding work in one of the shops.In 2015, eight shops were reduced to ashes while five were gutted in 2014.In 2012, as many as 22 shops were destroyed.

Following the decision, the Maharashtra State Board formed a committee to come up with a revised marking scheme. “It is becoming impossible to transport answer sheets of Class 10 and 12 exams to the homes of teachers due to the lockdown.

15-04-2020||Lucknow||Lock-down impact: Ashes await immersion, funerary rituals shelved||Inability to perform after-death rituals for departed loved ones due to curbs has compounded the pain of many families during the lock-down to check spread of corona virus. Urns containing ashes are piling up in crematoriums and Shantipath and 13th day rituals pending too.More than 300 urns containing ashes are waiting for immersion in the lockers of Bhaisakund cremation ground and 50 urns at Alambagh and Gulalaghat crematorium are also waiting to be collected due to the ongoing lockdown.Shantipath and terahnvis (13th day ritual) of more than 400 people are also pending.In Hindu religion, the mortal remains of the dead are cremated and then the ashes are immersed into rivers, most preferably the Ganga. Pandit Ram Keval Tewari said,“ In Hinduism it is said a soul gets salvation only after immersion of ashes. But for the past 21 days, due to the lock-down the relatives of the dead are unable to move out with ashes to immerse them.” Due to travel restrictions they are not able to reach places like Haridwar, Varanasi and Kanpur etc for immersion.”Pandit Kaushalendra Pandey of Bhaisakund Ghat said, “Usually shantipath and terahnvi are announced on the ghat but more than 400 people have postponed both the rituals and have planned them after lock-down opens.”There have been more than 500 deaths after March 24 when lock-down started. “That’s why most of the people chose to keep the ashes in lockers instead of immersing them immediately,” said in charge of the Bhaisakund cremation ground Surya Vikram Singh.He said, “Lockers are limited. We have around 84 lockers at Bhaisakund and 40 odd at Gulalaghat and Alambagh where the ashes are kept. But due to unprecedented circumstances people are not able to immerse them. As a result, now more than one urn is kept in a single locker. In some lockers, there are more than 5 urns. However, the ashes carry names of the dead with serial number so that they are not mixed up.”Presently we have kept 12 lockers empty for VVIPs and VIPs said another official of LMC . While rest of them are occupied.Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said, “ These are difficult times , are we are fighting corona so we need cooperation from everyone.The LMC is trying to get more lockers and planning to double the number of lockers after lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lock-down-impact-ashes-await-immersion-funerary-rituals-shelved/story-FBAm5J3BnzS10C8KOErtAN.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||‘Tweak Maha universities laws to help 2020-21 batch finish academic year’||Several heads of higher education institutes got together (WHEN) to share a contingency plan with the government regarding the status of examinations.This comes barely a week after the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant formed a special committee of experts to come up with a variety of ideas to adjust the examinations and results of the current semester and plan the 2020-21 academic year.“Before any plans are drawn or executed, the state government first needs to temporarily tweak statutes of the Maharashtra State Public Universities Act, 2015, so that the changes are applicable to the entire 2020-21 batch and are discontinued thereafter. State government needs to pass a temporary ordinance in this matter,” said TA Shiware, chairman of the Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges.In a letter sent to the education minister, principal secretary of state education, directorate of technical education (DTE) as well as all heads of state universities, the association has charted out two plans keeping in mind the possibility of another extension of the lockdown.According to the association, state higher education institutes cannot start their next academic year before September-October 2020. “If the lockdown is lifted by May-end, colleges still have the month of June to conduct exams and announce results in the same month, while the university can conduct final year exams in July and ensure results are out by August. Online exams will not be feasible for several students studying in rural parts of the state,” the letter by the association states.In case the current lockdown situation is extended till June 30, the association suggests that all students be promoted based on their performance in the previous semester. “Several state governments are preparing plans but we suggest that Maharashtra take into consideration the decision of the University Grants Commission (UGC) before taking a final call,” said Shiware.College exams aside, admissions process for most professional courses too are stuck at present. The state common entrance test (CET) cell in March decided to postpone the MH-CET for engineering and pharma courses indefinitely. The entrance test was originally scheduled to take place between April 13 and 23 this year.Two weeks ago, the National Testing Agency (NTA) announced that the second phase of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains will now be held in the last week of May. The exam was originally scheduled to take place between April 5 and 11, and as per a statement released by NTA, the next possible dates will be announced only post April 15. About 9 lakh students have registered for this exam.IIT-Delhi announced that the JEE Advanced exam will now be postponed to the last week of May instead of the first week of May, hinting at a delay in admissions to engineering institutes across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tweak-maha-universities-laws-to-help-2020-21-batch-finish-academic-year/story-Gx5SgGELR2Yr9Svc7fgzhO.html

15-04-2020||Mumbai||Ahead of delivery, pregnant woman tests positive, made to wait for 30 hours for treatment||Seven hospitals in the city refused to admit a Covid-19 positive pregnant woman, 27, from Grant Road, who is expected to deliver in three days, owing to lack of Covid-19 obstetrician-gynecologist ward, her husband alleged, adding she was kept at home without medication, even 30 hours after the diagnosis. Finally, BYL Nair hospital agreed to admit the woman on Wednesday evening. According to the protocol of the union health ministry, when a patient is found positive of Covid-19, he/she needs to be immediately shifted to an isolation ward. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) recently issued an advisory – Management of Pregnant Women in Covid-19 Pandemic – seeking special care for pregnant women.The woman didn’t have symptoms. Around four months ago, the couple had reserved a bed for her delivery at Masina Hospital. According to the instructions from the hospital, they did the Covid-19 test on Saturday. On Tuesday, when her reports came positive, the hospital refused to admit her, alleged the husband. Dr Vispi Jokhi, MS CEO, Masina Hospital, said, “Nothing like that has happened and I won’t be able to comment on it.”The husband said he then contacted King Edward Memorial (KEM), Bhabha (Kurla), St George, Kasturba, Seven Hills hospitals, along with two private hospitals, but was turned down by all. “BMC officials didn’t admit my wife to an isolation ward and she was at home without treatment even 30 hours after the diagnosis. On Wednesday, some health officers came for inspection and fumigated the building, but refused to admit my wife,” said the husband. When HT inquired with Seven Hills, the biggest isolation facility in the city, Dr Mohan Joshi said, “We don’t have the facility and within a day, we can’t set it up for the delivery.”This comes days after a 30-year-old Covid-19 positive pregnant woman from Nallasopara succumbed to the infection at BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central on April 4. According to a gynaecologist associated with Kasturba Hospital, hospitals refuse to admit such patients owing to the post-delivery complication, along with possible vertical transmission during delivery. “Firstly, the pregnant woman will have complications due to the infection. Secondly, even after delivery, the condition of the mother can deteriorate further, with breathing complications. Lastly, the hospital needs to take proper care to stop any possible transmission of the virus from the mother to the child during delivery,” she said. “This is why, hospitals with Covid-19 isolation facilities, too, are refusing to admit the woman.”“We are looking into it. Our doctors are in touch with them,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer BMC, said earlier in the day. “The hospital is sending an ambulance to ferry my wife to the isolation ward. At least, my wife will start getting treatment and we hope to have a healthy child,” said the husband. “If anything happens to my wife, I will drag them to court.”Talking to HT, politician Rais Sheikh, who intervened in the matter, said, “Now, it has been made compulsory to undergo test for Covid-19 before delivery. But in Mumbai, there is no facility for Covid-19 positive pregnant women. This is complete mismanagement.”Health activists said the BMC should convert one of their 28 maternity hospitals into a Covid-19 centre for deliveries and treatment of infected pregnant women to avoid such negligence in the future. “The BMC needs to take precautionary measures to provide better healthcare to pregnant women, who are already vulnerable to the infection. If community transmission starts, more pregnant women can get infected,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ahead-of-delivery-pregnant-woman-tests-positive-made-to-wait-for-30-hours-for-treatment/story-yCQZdWLu4FfK3MzYbwmNpO.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Railway e-ticket booking suspended||After a large group of migrant workers gathered outside Bandra railway station on Tuesday afternoon, the Indian Railways has decided to suspend online bookings for its outstation trains.Though the railways had shut the booking counters outside railway stations ahead of the nationwide lockdown, people could make online booking during the lockdown period for train journeys after April 14.The Railways, through Indian Rail Catering Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), issued a circular on the cancellation of bookings and the refund on e-tickets. “There will be no advance reservation of train tickets, including e-tickets, till further advice. However, facility of online cancellation will remain functional.” said the statement.Passenger associations have blamed the Railways’ online booking service for the gathering of migrant workers in Bandra. “The online booking section should have been shut during the first 21-day lockdown period. This is the fault of the railway ministry. They created hope among people that they would be able to go back to their hometowns and this led to the gathering,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.An internal letter by South Central Railway regarding a proposal to operate Jansadharan special trains for stranded migrant workers was also widely shared on social media. “The decision on train operations can be taken only by the railway ministry. The letter was an internal one on planning operation of trains only if the lockdown was lifted. No such decision was taken,” said an official from the Railway Board, the apex body of all zonal railways.South Central Railway issued a statement claiming the letter had been misinterpreted and was based on internal planning. “A communication related to internal planning of South Central Railway to assess demand for train services is being misinterpreted in some sections as a decision to run special trains for migrant labourers. There is no such proposal and all passenger trains stand cancelled till May 3, 2020,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/railway-e-ticket-booking-suspended/story-KvzqpcWFPsvnqKyp6AWplJ.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Form panel to oversee migrant aid: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state to constitute taluka-level committees to oversee the work of distributing essentials like food, water, sanitation and medicines to migrants and daily wage workers who have been rendered jobless and homeless due to the Covid-19 lockdown. In an earlier hearing, the court had directed the state to form district-level committees to oversee the work, however, on Thursday the petitioners informed the court that the directions were not being implemented efficiently and thousands of migrants were in dire straits.A bench of justice RK Deshpande, while hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) and a writ petition all dealing with the plight of migrant workers, the homeless and slum dwellers, was informed that the condition of these persons was pitiable as they were stranded in the city and had no means to sustain themselves. The petitioners prayed for directions to the state to ease the suffering of the workers. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the court that as the Supreme Court was hearing a similar petition, no orders could be passed by this HC.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, however, assured the bench that the government was cognizant of the conditions and was taking adequate measures to alleviate the sufferings of the affected persons. He submitted that migrant workers could not go back to their hometowns as there were travel restrictions.After hearing the submissions the bench said that while district-level committees were addressing the problems of the needy and marginalised sections of the society, taluka-level committees would improve coordination better and the state should consider it. The court further directed the government to conduct surveys and medical tests of those wanting to undertake inter-state travel.The court then posted the matter for the first week of May and asked the state to present the survey report as well as act as per the SC orders that are expected to be passed on April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/form-panel-to-oversee-migrant-aid-hc/story-sSsWvAkDeQQIYX4ilBpjkM.html

15-04-2020||Lucknow||Mohanlalganj village in grief as migrant’s body arrives||A pall of gloom descended on Dakhina village in Mohanlalganj on Wednesday, as the body of 19-year-old Divakar arrived from Jalandhar late evening. Officials said Divakar, who was a Covid 19 suspect, died two days back in Jalandhar.“However, after confirmation that he didn’t died of coronavirus infection, the Punjab government released the body and sent it to his home village,” an official said.Pallavi Mishra, sub divisional magaistrate (SDM) Mohanlalganj, said Divakar had ben ailing for a few days and succumbed to his illness.Divakar’s distraught father Nankau Kumar, who is a farmer and has a family of 10 (including 8 children), thanked the district administration for facilitating the transportation of the body amid lock-down. “I had lost all hope. I never thought that I would be able to perform the last rites of my son. But the district administration came to my help,” said Kumar.Kumar said Divakar was the second eldest among the siblings and worked with a private firm in Jalandhar. He was caught in the lock-down and couldn’t return home. “I don’t know what happened to my young son. It’s is still hard to believe that is he no more,” he added. He said the family was informed about his demise a couple of days back and asked to collect the body. But following the lock-down, the family approached the district administration for help.“We extended complete support to Nankau, who initially wanted to go to Jalandhar to collect the body. We even processed the travelling passes for him and his family,” said Pallavi Mishra, sub divisional magaistrate (SDM) Mohanlalganj.“But before the family could leave for Jalandhar we got the information that since Divakar did not test Covid 19 positive, the Punjab administration had dispatched the body,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mohanlalganj-village-in-grief-as-migrant-s-body-arrives/story-IZ2Pa9gjAD5IkzDLB85AcO.html
15-04-2020||Chandigarh||Procurement gets off to a slow start in Punjab||Wheat arrival in the grain markets and purchase centres in Punjab was below par on the first day of procurement on Wednesday, with many citing uncertainty and fear among farmers in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic as the reasons behind the poor turnout of farmers. Of the 8,213.5 tonnes of produce that arrived in 252 mandis, most in south-west Punjab, 3,645.5 tonnes was procured by agencies, officials said.To limit crowding and ensure social distancing, the government is inviting a limited number of farmers through coupons, with permission to sell up to 50 quintals of wheat at their closest grain market.The coupons will act as a curfew pass for unhindered movement of the farmers’ tractor-trailers. On the first day, only 6,290 coupons were issued in the state. With the process of issuing coupons still picking up pace, several sellers across the state complained that they could not reach the grain markets.Gurjeet Singh, a farmer from Badesha village near Samrala town of Ludhiana district, went to the Khamano mandi in the morning to meet his arhtiyas (commission agents) to enquire as when he should bring his produce for sale.“The crop I have sown on 12 acres of land is ready for harvesting. But the government wants us to keep it as long as we can even as we want to dispose it at the earliest. This is the dilemma every farmer is facing,” he said.“We don’t have adequate storage space at home. Also, who would unload, load and then unload it again? It will be a cumbersome task. besides, the incentive the government has offered to farmers for holding back teir produce is only a promise,” added Gurjeet.FARMERS FORCED TO TAKE BACK PRODUCERaghbir Singh of the nearby Ramgarh village was asked to take back his 70 quintals of produce he unloaded outside the office of an arhtiya. “I got a pass three days ago and was told to come today. Now, the market committee is forcing me to take back my produce as the moisture content in it is 12.4%, barely 0.4% more than the limit,” he said.“The government has directed us to ensure social distancing is maintained in mandis. Since there is no facility of drying grain in the mandis, the farmers have to keep the produce at home as long as the permissible moisture limit is achieved,” Khamano market committee chairman Surinder Singh said.“Those arhtiyas found defying government directions on maintain social distancing or helping farmers make out-of-turn sale would invite cancellation of their licences for the entire season,” said Surinder.Around 5 kilometres from Khamano, the Sanghol mandi was yet to receive produce.“It is not that we are not helping the farmers in drying wheat in the mandi yards, but we are short of labour. The wheat arrival is likely to pick up in a few days,” said additional chief secretary Viswajeet Khanna, who heads the state-level committee on harvest and procurement.NO FARMER TURNS UP AT MAJHA MANDISNot even a single farmer brought produce to the grain markets in Majha region on Wednesday. The farmers and officials of the agriculture department and Punjab mandi board said the delay in the arrival of the crop was due to moisture in the grains due to the recent rain.Officials of the four border districts of Majha region - Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Pathankot – said the produce is likely to start arriving in the mandis from April 20 onwards.“Most of the farmers have not started harvesting due to moisture in the crop. The pace of arrival of wheat will pick up after April 20,” said Sarwan Singh Pandher, secretary, Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Punjab.JALANDHAR, HOSHIARPUR MARKETS GET NO PRODUCE Also, not many farmers turned up at the grain markets in the Doaba region comprising Jalandhar, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar and Hoshiarpur districts.In SBS Nagar district, wheat arrived in only two grain markets of Balachaur sub-division. Produce of 12 farmers was purchased.In Kapurthala district, 105 tonne wheat arrived in two grain markets of Sultanpur Lodhi and Bholath, of which 30 tonne was purchased, said an official. No produce had arrived in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur districts.NEGLIGIBLE ARRIVAL IN SOUTH MALWAWheat procurement at various centres in south Malwa districts remained symbolic on Wednesday. In Bathinda, only one farmer arrived with his crop whereas nearly 3,000 coupons were issued to farmers in the district.Only two farmers arrived with their produce in Mansa.Moga did not witness any wheat arrival while the Fazilka administration did not issue any token to farmers. Faridkot witnessed wheat sale by 75 farmers.“For Thursday and Friday, we have issued 20,000 and 41,000 passes. Things will be streamlined in a few days,” additional secretary (mandi board) said HS Brar.(Inputs by Vishal Joshi and Gagandeep Singh in Bathinda and Jalandhar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/procurement-gets-off-to-a-slow-start-in-punjab/story-plbbHnYt6xARKE0QuitNZO.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||After Bandra chaos, the Maha political blame game begins||Left red-faced by the gathering of migrant labourers outside Bandra railway station on Tuesday, Maharashtra ministers blamed the railway ministry, terming the incident a “conspiracy” against the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, called the incident an “intelligence failure” and alleged the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) planned the crowding to give the issue a communal colour.A parallel battle also ensued on social media with hashtags “UddhavResign” and “Maharashtra with CM”. Since the incident at Bandra station, hashtag “UddhavResign” was trending on Twitter. Subsequently, on Wednesday, the Shiv Sena circulated the hashtag “MaharashtrawithCM’ to push it on Twitter. Several members of the party tweeted with the hashtag, backing chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday evening to win the perception battle.Amid the political slugfest, the Mumbai Police have arrested Vinay Dubey for allegedly uploading a video on social media asking migrant workers from north India to gather at Kurla Terminus on April 18 to demand that they should be sent back to their native town. Home minister Anil Deshmukh said, “Misinformation regarding the commencement of trains from April 14, 2020, was spread using 11 different methods. The accounts have been tracked, FIRs are being filed & due legal consequences will follow.” The Maharashtra cybercrime team has identified more than 30 accounts spreading rumour about train services, Deshmukh said.A section of media reported on Wednesday evening that Deshmukh knew Dubey. “An autodriver who donated ₹25,000 to the chief minister’s relief fund eight days ago met me in Mantralaya. I think Dubey was with him. I don’t know him directly,” Deshmukh tweeted on Wednesday. A day after Thackeray urged against politicisation of migrants’ issues, NCP chief Sharad Pawar asked people to refrain from putting misleading messages on social media. He also appealed the political leaders to rise above politics. Terming the Bandra incident as “unfortunate”, Pawar in an address via Facebook Live, said, “Thousands of people gathered near Bandra station and social distancing rules were violated. Do not put any message that will mislead people…I want to appeal to all leaders across the political spectrum that there is nothing wrong in doing politics, but this is not the right time as the country is going through a serious crisis. Hence, there is a need to work in tandem irrespective of which party government is in the state. I’m hoping that due care will be taken to ensure such incidents will not be repeated.”Former Maharashtra chief minister and state public works department minister Ashok Chavan on Wednesday alleged a political conspiracy behind Tuesday’s gathering of migrants at the railway station and a social media campaign which followed demanding ‘President’s rule’ in Maharashtra. “We are investigating the entire episode of crowding by migrant workers at the Bandra station on Tuesday evening. We are investigating who was patronising the social media campaign holding the state government responsible for it,” said Chavan at a video press conference. Chavan and state revenue minister and Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said that the railways were accepting train bookings till April 14 which added to the confusion. Chavan alleged that the officials of the railway ministry have faulted and minister Piyush Goyal should look into it.Thorat, who was also a part of the video press conference, said the Railways had taken online booking till Tuesday afternoon before announcing the cancellation of all trains. “The confusion among the migrants led to the incident. It did not pertain to any specific community or religion. The crowd included migrants from all communities,” he said.BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari alleged Dubey was a member of the NCP. Ashish Shelar, BJP legislator from Bandra West, where the incident occurred, in a letter to Shiv Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray and BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, said the congregation was an “intelligence failure”. In his letter, he demanded that immediate provision be made of ration and financial aid for these labourers. “The plot was orchestrated by Dubey, who is a member of the NCP. He has contested an election on their ticket. If there was any confusion about the trains and if migrants had come to board a train, why would they not carry any luggage, why were there no women and children, why would they come to Bandra local station,” Bhandari asked.NCP spokesperson and state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said Dubey is not a member of the NCP. On Tuesday, Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray blamed the Centre for not arranging trains for migrants before lockdown was announced on March 24. Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday sought police action against BJP’s Kapil Mishra who through a tweet posed similar questions like the one Bhandari asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-bandra-chaos-the-maha-political-blame-game-begins/story-YnrYmdFpc1usfb9fqW5qpJ.html
15-04-2020||Lucknow||Villagers’ hospitality wows French family caught in lock-down||When a swanky imported car carrying five French nationals stopped in Laxmipur village of Maharajganj on March 25, transcending language barriers the curious villagers understood at once that a foreigner family on India tour was caught in the corona lock- down and needed help. Since then the Pollarez family from Toulouse city of France, on a world tour in their car since 2019, has been camping at the temple of this village, mixing up with the once strange villagers who are showing the spirit of ‘Athithi Devo Bhav’ by showering them with affection and offering them tea, snacks and other essentials while strictly practicing social distancing. While locals in general try to communicate through gestures, some literate ones use broken languages. “When I came here, we and the villagers were strangers to each other but they soon became friendly and helped us a lot. India is great and so are its people,” said an elated Pollarez Patrice Joseph, 40, the family head who drove to India through Pakistan’s Wagha border in February on a tourist visa , visited Indian cities and was on his way to cross the Nepal border through Maharajganj when suddenly everything came to a halt due to the lock -down. He said once the lock-down was lifted, he wished to return to his country in his car, equipped with machines and tools used in repair work.Pollarez Patrice , a motor mechenic by profession, is accompanied by wife Virginie Pollarez, daughters Ophelie Pallarez , Lola Janniefer Pollarez and son Tom Pollarez.Rahul, a local said, “ The entire village is treating them as guests. In Just a few days, the family has learnt to commonly use Hindi words like namaste, dhanyawad (thank you), aap kaisey hai (How do you do?) etc. The family gets up early in the morning and locals offer them tea and snacks which they eat happily .There are moments when they enjoy by dancing on tunes played on mobile phone and share lighter moments with villagers, They also click selfies with locals.” DM Ujjawal Kumar said, “The administration is ensuring that the French nationals do not face any problems. A medical team was sent to check them and all were found well. Police teams have also been instructed to ensure their security.”SDM Nautanwa Jasveer Singh confirmed that the family was on Indian tour since February and was stranded due to lock-down. “All necessary items, including groceries, are being provided to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/villagers-hospitality-wows-french-family-caught-in-lock-down/story-0eQa7JqC2sIYxXg3tjDarM.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Migrants ‘boycott’ food; authorities counsel them||Migrant workers’ hopes of returning to their hometowns after the 21-day lockdown ended on April 14 were dashed when the state government, and later the Centre, announced an extension. This has led to unrest among the migrant workers staying in shelters in various parts of the state. In some shelters, the ‘homesick’ migrants boycotted lunch on Tuesday after the announcement of the extension of the lockdown till May 3. Authorities at these shelters have now begun counselling the workers.A majority of the migrant workers stranded in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region are from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and other states in north India. Around 75,000 migrants and homeless are living in Mumbai at various shelters arranged at schools, colleges and community halls. “There is unrest among them, especially after the announcement of the extension of the lockdown and the incident in Bandra. More than food and shelter, they want to go back to home amid the uncertainty owing to the pandemic,” said an official from the Mumbai suburban collectorate, requesting anonymity. Ninety such migrants, mostly from UP, are living at Uttar Pradesh Bhavan in Bandra (East). An official said that they are eagerly waiting for the lockdown to end so that they can return home.On April 14, after hearing the announcement of the extension of the lockdown till May 3, many workers became restless. At a shelter in Nashik, the migrants announced a boycott of lunch. “We had to convince them with the help of a psychiatrist only then food was served at 3pm. They have not complained about the arrangements but they have become homesick. We tried to tap the possibility of finding them work but questions arise about the possibility of spread of the virus,” said a senior officer looking after the arrangements at the shelter.At shelters in Palghar and Talasari too, labourers refused to dine. It was only after being counselled by the district collector and other officers, the workers agreed to have dinner. “We have been regularly arranging counselling and meditation sessions for them. We have more than 5,000 labourers from 19 states put up in government and private shelters,” said an official from Palghar district collectorate.Maharashtra has 4,618 shelters in various districts with arrangements for 5.72 lakh migrants. The state government shoulders responsibility for their meals, while NGOs donate toiletries, clothes and other essentials. The state government has allocated ₹90 crore for the arrangements.In Beed, there are around 1,266 migrants stranded from various states. The officer-in-charge at one of the shelters said they organise devotional activities like bhajans and kirtans to keep the labourers engaged.Deepak Nagargoje of Shantivan, an organisation working for cane-cutters, said that more than 9,000 workers are waiting to return home. “More than 2.70 lakh returned home before the lockdown. The rest are facing problems and want to go back at the earliest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/migrants-boycott-food-authorities-counsel-them/story-mxpuA0LbsC4nvxbZ6YqtlI.html
15-04-2020||Chandigarh||Many mouths, little food: Poor pay price for UT’s miscalculation||It is 1 pm and the Sun is its scorching best. Waiting for food amongst a horde of 500 people at colony number 4, a slum in Industrial Area, Umesh Yadav said it was unbearable to stand in the heat and wait for food. “Today evening we got no food. I dont want to live on the mercy of the government if I can earn two meals a day for my family, but I am helpless,” said Yadav, a printing press worker. Janaki Devi, a middle aged woman, said that few days ago she had requested officials and the area councillor to increase the number of distribution points and deliver food earlier due to rising temperature, but no one has paid heed. “Those sitting in office should try standing in the heat for hours for just two chapattis and dal,” she said. FEW DISTRIBUTION POINTS SEE MAD RUSHNihal Ansari, an unemployed daily wager, said about 2,500 people lived in the colony, but with only two distribution points for lunch and its worse in the evening with one distribution point. “In the mad rush, no one follows social distancing. Many don’t even get food,” he said. Papu Shukla, husband of ward number 13 councillor, said Kajheri village in their ward with 5,000 households has only one distribution point. “When they ask for more, they face humiliation. If it can’t ensure dignity of the poor, it is better the administration stops giving us food,” he said. Bapudham, a Sector 26 slum, is at the mercy of NGOs, with no government involvement or supply. Area councillor Dalip Sharma said there were 1,500 labourers who have been reduced to beggars after the lockdown. “While we manage dinner with help of the area’s transport association and Sector 28 gurdwara, we have no resources to feed them lunch,” he said. UT MAKING CHANGES: DC Deputy commissioner Mandip Brar said changes in the distribution system are underway so needy will be fed well till the curfew is in place. He said distribution of wheat and dal to beneficiaries of Centre’s schemes has been speeded up.With the curfew extended till May 3, many NGOs have backed out from supplying cooked food to UT administration. The pleaded helplessness saying they have run out of dry ration.NGOs and the Red Cross are supplying most of the cooked food distributed by UT administration which claims it supplies about 50,000 food packets to the needy everyday. Organisations which have discontinued the service say they had made arrangements and had mandatory permissions till April 14 only.One such organisation, Shri Chaitanya Gaudiya Math Temple, Sector 20-B, Chandigarh, was supplying 10,000 meals a day. Jai Prakash Gupta of the mutth said, “Resource constraint is an issue but we are trying to find a way to restart.” Non-availability of ration is the biggest hindrance for organisations providing cooked food. Bhupinder Verma, general secretary, Prachin Shiv Mandir Management committee, Ram Darbar, said that in March, the administration assured them of dry ration and temple committee would supply cooked meals. “Even though they didn’t do as promised, we supplied cooked food for 500 people everyday. Now, if we are given ration, our volunteers will contribute,” Verma said. Harishankar Mishra, chairman of Hallo Majra’s Jai Gurudev Sansathan, which supplied 1,000 meals said ration was not available due to curfew. “We are figuring out how to restart but in the current scenario, it it will be hard to do,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/many-mouths-little-food-poor-pay-price-for-ut-s-miscalculation/story-3OMNuSN1EPMdcxfsP6EEYP.html

When they entered the area near Hazi Nebwali mosque, a group of local residents attacked the team. The mob damaged two vehicles and two people, including a doctor, sustained injuries. The DM said that at least 10 people had been taken into custody while others involved in the incident were being identified and stern action would be taken against them. Heavy force has been deployed in the area and people have been asked to remain indoors.Meanwhile, the chief minister’s office said in posts on twitter, “The attack on health and sanitation staff and policemen is unpardonable and is condemned. Action under provisions of Disaster Control Act will be taken and National Security Act will be invoked against them.”It said recovery of damages caused to public property would be made strictly. The CM’s office said the district administration should identify such people immediately and besides providing security to the common man, strict act should be taken against anti-social elements. It said the CM had taken a serious note of the incident, adding that doctors, health department staff, sanitation workers and policemen deployed for security had been working round the clock during the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mob-attacks-health-team-in-moradabad-cm-orders-nsa-against-culprits/story-a6kW7uO5LAb1ObQJ2pVv5N.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Zoos up efforts to prevent Covid-19 among animals||The state zoo authority has lauded zoos for their efforts to prevent coronavirus among animals, including comprehensive health screening of workers.After a tiger in an American zoo tested positive for coronavirus, there are concerns that animals could contract Sars-CoV-2, and nine zoological parks and four wildlife rescue centres across the state were asked to submit a compliance report by the Maharashtra Zoo Authority (MZA) last week. The zoos submitted their responses by Tuesday.“Almost 80% of all centres are complying with instructions issued by the Centre and the state government. There are no symptoms or abnormal behaviour displayed by any animals so far,” said Ravikiran Govekar, member secretary, MZA.With 318 captive animals and birds, Veer Mata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan or Byculla zoo has screened all 30 zoo keepers for symptoms of Covid-19 at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) Maratha Compound in Byculla (East) over the past week. A health screening report with details of travel history, family health history, recent illnesses, and Covid-19 related symptoms. “None of the staff or animals has showed any symptom. The idea was to cut off the first point from where any infection can be transmitted to any of the animals,” said Sanjay Tripathi, director of Byculla zoo. “A protocol has been put in place where staff members are not allowed to move outside zoo premises under any circumstances.”Santisers are being kept outside every enclosure, all vehicles entering the premises are mandatorily sanitised and only one gate has been kept open during the day. “While there is no change in animal diet, all food items are boiled, sanitised using potassium permanganate (KMnO4) disinfectant solution and then offered to the animals,” said Tripathi. “Managing in-house facilities is the most important factor during these trying times.”Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park in Katraj developed a special Covid-19 dress, including masks and caps, for all zoo keepers to curtail any transmission of infection to animals. Nisargakavi Bahinabai Chaudhary Zoo in Pimpri-Chinchwad has been practicing social distancing, isolation, and sanitisation of the premises thrice a day. Maharaj Bagh Zoo in Nagpur provided a list of dos and don’ts to all staff members. Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Borivli, had also screened all its staff, especially those handling tiger, lion and leopard enclosures. Any persons detected with any illnesses at SGNP have been directed not to report on duty.“Of the 13 centres, these are some that stood out in developing an appropriate protocol of getting health check-up for staff, safety of food provided to animals, among other efforts. We have issued an internal advisory to other zoos to replicate such efforts,” said Govekar. “Three important points directed are screening of staff handling animal, orientation on sanitisation and social distancing, and looking out for any symptomatic changes in captive animals,” said Govekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/zoos-up-efforts-to-prevent-covid-19-among-animals/story-avrgt0I3AqvZnwXgJ5hJzM.html

The PGI Employees’ Union has written to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Union health ministry stating that it is unreasonable on the part of the hospital administration to restrict health workers from arranging their own personal protective equipment (PPE) as it shows the insensitiveness and lack of compassion at a time of a pandemic.Another organisation, Medicos Legal Action Group, has also demanded revocation of the orders.“On the one hand, the PGIMER is not able to provide the equipment in the areas where there is considerable risk and, on the other, the administration is stopping employees to buy their own equipment. What kind of diktat is this?,” said Dr Neeraj Nagpal, convener of the group.He added, “It is unethical on the part of the authorities to pass such orders at a time of scarcity of products.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-decision-to-stop-staff-from-pooling-money-for-safety-gears-draws-flak/story-dR4lNWR5l6BDMcDLY6l9wK.html

15-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad villages regulate entry/exit to fight Covid-19||Khirajpur village — which is about 10km inside from the main Delhi-Meerut Road in Ghaziabad district — has gone into a voluntary lockdown and put in place stringent rules for its residents, similar to those being observed in containment areas, to contain the spread of Covid-19. Khirajpur is not the only village to have put in place stringent measures.“Ever since the first positive Covid-19 case was reported from Ghaziabad city in March, we disallowed entry of outsiders to our village. We have erected barriers and no outsider is allowed. In case the relative of any resident arrives,they are put up at the primary school on the outskirts of our village and the family or the village committee takes care of their food and other requirements.They are not allowed to enter the village,” said Sartaj Amhad, the pradhan of Khirajpur , which has a population of about 2,400 people.“Initially 2-3 people had come, but when we told that they will have to stay at the school, they left. It is a norm here that visitors stay at the school instead of the home of their relatives in the village. At the main entrances, we have put up hand wash and sanitizers. locals of the village, mostly farmers, have to manatorily use the handwash/sanitiser after returning from their fields,” he added.He said that during 2018-19 Swacchta campaign, the villagers had removed large garbage dumps from the open areas and even those spreading over the private land. This has helped them maintain a clean surrounding and reduced seasonal diseases.At a little distance away lies Sarna village in Muradnagar, which houses a population of about 500 families. The village is located at a distance of 3km from the Delhi-Meerut Road.“We have also barricaded the main entrance to our village. As a precautionary measure we have also disallowed entry of vendors. Only a handful of vendors who live in villages are tasked to supply fruits and vegetables from the markets. We have also disallowed entry of outsiders or relatives of local people. Announcements regarding the same were made through 65 loud speakers,” said Neeraj Tyagi, the village pradhan.The chain of loudspeakers has also helped villagers connect to events like Prime Minister’s address on various occasions and his speech is aired live.“Through the loudspeakers, we make announcements to our residents and have informed them that they should not be asking heir relatives to visit till the lockdown is in place,” he added.Similar barricading has also been undertaken at Dasna Dehat area, ever since a countrywide lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month to fight the spread of covid-19.The Dasna Dehat area comprises about 8-10 localities like Bhoorgarhi, Kudiagarhi, Gurjargarhi, Indergarhi, Akash Nagar etc and houses a population of about 70,000.“Dasna Dehat areas are close to Masuri, which is a hotspot and under intensive lockdown. All the main entrances of the localities have been barricaded with the help of bamboo poles. Banners/posters have also been placed with messages that state that entry of outsiders is prohibited,” said Satish Kumar, who represents his wife Reena Devi, who is the pradhan of Dasna Dehat.Satish said that any outsiders who arrive to these areas will have to stay at the nearby private college which has a number of rooms.“We have no other option but to request them to stay at the college. So far people have not come. In case they come we will take care of their food and daily necessities. For observing lockdown, we have also formed a committee of 4-5 members who are tasked to obtain information about any outsiders trying to enter our areas. Vendors from outside are also not allowed in and only identified local ones are selling fruits, vegetables . It is only in emergency cases that people are allowed to move out,” he added.At present Ghaziabad city has 14 hotspots. A majority of these are in city areas with only a few l— ike Naipura in Loni, Khatu Shyam Colony in Duhai and Masuri — coming under the rural areas.“We have heard that many villages have restricted entry of outsiders and have been observing a complete lockdown. It is good that the villagers are taking precaution against the virus. This is in turn a major help for us as we can concentrate more on containment zones and hotspot areas where positive Covid-19 case have been found,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-villages-regulate-entry-exit-to-fight-covid-19/story-1ftTNJFEldh69nttvQSpSK.html
15-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Random sampling started in Covid-19 hot spots, delayed test reports a major issue||Teams from the Ghaziabad health department have started random sampling of people living in Covid-19 hot spot areas and containment zones. The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday has also directed the districts to ramp up collection of samples so that more people can be traced and shifted to quarantine centres.In Ghaziabad, chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said the health department has started collecting about 20 samples a day from 14 hot spot areas.“But delay in getting test reports is a major issue. Till Wednesday, we have 547 samples which are pending as we have not received any report for the past three days. Earlier, we sent samples to Delhi but now we send them to a lab in Noida. However, we have started random sampling from containment zones and hot spot areas in order to ascertain if there any positive cases in these localities,” Gupta said.On Wednesday night, a doctor from Indirapuram was found positive for coronavirus, officials said.With the new positive case, the total number of hot spot areas may increase to 16 in the district, the officials said. The officials said a containment area of 1km radius is identified in case a person tests positive for Covid-19 in a particular area. In case of more than one positive case, the radius is increased to three kilometers.In both instances, a two-kilometre buffer zone is also created, where door-to-door surveillance activities are taken up by health teams.“To take up random sampling, our surveillance team will visit households in these areas at random and collect samples which will be sent for testing. So far, we had been collecting samples only of those with foreign travel history or those who complained of symptoms and those who attended religious congregations,” the CMO said.Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health), Wednesday said from the initial sample collection of about 150-200 daily, the state is now collecting more than 2,000 samples daily for the past two days.“On Tuesday, we collected 2433 samples. We have also given instructions to districts having no Covid-19 positive cases to send a minimum of 20 samples a day while districts having hot spots or having more than 50 cases should send at least 150-200 samples a day. The sampling and testing have been ramped up so that we discover the spread at the earliest and those found positive can be treated,” Gupta said.He said as per the latest age profile, the state had 17% cases in the age group 0-20 years; 46.5% in the age group of 21-40 years; 26% in the age group of 41-60 years; and 10.5% cases in the age group of above 60 years.Across the state, the total count of Covid-19 cases has risen to 727 (till Wednesday evening) with 55 patients discharged from hospitals and 11 dead. In Ghaziabad, the total number of Covid-19 cases is 28 while seven were discharged from hospitals.The CMO said that a 37-year-old doctor, an oncologist with a private hospital in Vaishali, from a pocket in Indirapuram was found positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday and he got himself admitted to a hospital in Delhi.“Seven of his family members have been quarantined. We are trying to trace his other contacts and these may also include patients who visited him. The pocket in Indirapuram where he resides will be turned into a hotspot. The location of Vaishali hospital may also be turned into hot spot. If the two new hotspots are created, Ghaziabad will have a tally of 16 hot spots,” CMO Dr Gupta added.Prasad said the first set of ‘pool sampling’ was initiated in Agra district Wednesday. Under the pool sampling, individual samples are mixed and tested as one. In case the test is negative, all individual are termed negative. In case the pool tests positive, all individuals will be tested again. Doctors said pool sampling will save on resources and time.“Five samples were pooled and sent for testing in Agra. This concept will be used across the state as well. We have also decided that the audit of all Covid-19 deaths will be taken up and detailed reports of all deceased will be studied by a panel of doctors. This will help us gather insight on each case and the analysis will be helpful in treating Covid-19 patients,” Prasad said.The officials also said students in their final year of MBBS and nursing courses will also be given an opportunity to join the health department’s efforts to fight the coronavirus spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-random-sampling-started-in-covid-19-hot-spots-delayed-test-reports-a-major-issue/story-dNsAJcngH0CcKHb2l4dGrN.html
15-04-2020||Noida||Silicon city RWA extorting vendors, allege residents||Despite directives from the Uttar Pradesh government and the district administration, Amrapali Silicon City Residents Welfare Association are reportedly charging money from vendors to allow them to set up kiosks inside their residential premises.The vendors in turn have been jacking up prices of essential items — like vegetables and fruits — in order to recover their costs.The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration, after witnessing a surge of Covid-19 cases, had earlier fixed the rate list of essential items to check black-marketing during the ongoing lockdown.Residents of Amrapali Silicon City in sector-76 of Noida, claimed its residents’ association – Silicon City Social Welfare Association (SCSWA) — has been collecting ₹12,000 per month from each vegetable vendor and Rs 8,000-10,000 from each milk vendor.A resident of Amrapali SIlicon City who did not want to be named said that vendors not willing to pay are not allowed to set up kiosks inside the premises. “The SCSWA is not allowing residents to step out to buy essentials and instead forcing us to purchase essentials at a higher prices,” he said. Rajesh Kumar, another resident, said that in total disregard to rules set by the district administration, the SCSWA was imposing its own set of norms. “They didn’t even allow my milk vendor for doorstep delivery after he refused to pay money. Every item is being sold at a higher price here,” he said.When contacted, Deepak Pandey, the secretary of SCSWA, accepted that the association was collecting a fixed amount from the vendors, before allowing them in the society. “Though I had objected to this proposal personally in the general body meeting, but it was finally approved with a majority,” he said.GB Nagar commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said that such extortion by residents’ association was ‘illegal’ and will not be tolerated. “I have ordered the SHO concerned to enquire about this matter. If the residents’ complaints will be found true, stern action against the SCSWA officials will be taken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/silicon-city-rwa-extorting-vendors-allege-residents/story-xH6hWVBcY1g0SJdbi26qSN.html
15-04-2020||Noida||Poverty hits kids as schools take learning online||Technological poverty, driven by low incomes in a time of crisis, is pinching the under-privileged now more than ever, especially as private schools have taken their classes online. Parents of children, who got admission to private schools under the RTE Act, said they were unable to get assignments or help their children attend classes due to the lack of necessary infrastructure. They fear their children may lose an entire year.“In our family of four we have one phone that has WhatsApp. My two children, are in different grades and have to somehow share the phone. They attend classes on alternate days. We get the assignments and tests, but it’s cumbersome. They try to keep up with the load but they’re beginning to lag behind their classmates simply because we don’t have computers or tablets or even another smart phone,” said Rukmani, a domestic help who works in 7X. Her children, one in class 3rd and another in 5th, attend two different private schools.In view of the lockdown, the government had declared that students from classes 1 to 8 should be promoted to the next grade without being made to write their final term examination. After this, most schools opted to start online classes and share assignments electronically.A private school teacher, who did not wish to be named, said they are using multi-media platforms to include the entire class in a video conference and that the interaction has been as good as that of a real classroom.However, some students don’t have this option altogether as many schools have simply shut operations for now.“I had heard that many schools were operating online. I asked my kids’ school but they said they are closed for now. The kids are studying at home by themselves but we are worried all this may cost them an entire year,” said Sarita, another cook working in Sector 75.Government schools are also trying to follow the online model but they are not having as much success.“We are sharing PDFs and assignments with as many parents as possible through WhatsApp. But not all students have access to a smartphone. We are working to come up with ways to reach out to as many of them as possible,” said Suryaprakash Rai, district coordinator, primary education department.There is no notification yet about when classes may resume, and how would social distancing be ensured, after the lockdown is lifted.But some private schools said that once normal school operation resumes kids who are lagging behind will be helped through extra classes.“We will organise extra classes for students from economically weaker sections. We have a buddy system in place to help these students. We will make it more efficient once the classes start. Every section has a WhatsApp group and all our class teachers have been trying to reach out to as many students as possible, but the efficiency is not 100% and we will work to fill up the gaps for sure,” said Kamini Bhasin, principal, DPS-Sector 30.The online system wasn’t easy for even middle class families with enough infrastructure.“We had one spare laptop in the house. But I have two kids in different grades whose timing for online classes coincides. During the lockdown with electronics not being an essential service, procuring the necessary gadgets was not easy and it was only through a friend who owns a showroom in Nehru Place that I was able to somehow get my hands on another laptop,” said Deepak Jha, a resident of Sector 77.Online classes have led to an increase in the demand for electronics services, repairs and maintenance but with the lockdown in places, people don’t have access to these facilities either.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/poverty-hits-kids-as-schools-take-learning-online/story-SqkZP4eXN4T3eY2ar38lRK.html

Now, the districts that are coronavirus free will also have to send minimum 20 samples to the laboratories daily. The districts in which more than 50 positive cases have been reported will have to send 200 samples for laboratory test.The sample test will assist the health department in tracking the positive cases fast and admit them in hospitals for treatment.It will also assist the department in checking the spread of the disease, he said.The health department has already prepared a plan to test minimum 2,000 samples daily.On Tuesday, 2,433 samples were tested in the laboratories across the state and another 2,400 samples were sent to the laboratories as well, he said.The health department has also started pool testing of samples.On Tuesday, samples from Agra were sent for pool testing to the laboratory located in KGMU, he said.In a study conducted by the health department it was found that 17% of corona patients were in the age group of 0-20 years, 46.5% of the patients were in age group of 20-40 years, 26% of the patients were in age group of 41-60 years and 10.5% patients were above 60 years. Though the number of the cases was high among the young people, the casualty rate was high among the old people, Prasad said.People should take special precautionary measures to protect the senior citizens and vulnerable people from coronavirus.Along with following Covid-19 protocol such as social distancing, frequent hand wash and covering of the face, the people should also boost their immunity. The smokers should avoid cigarette as they touch their lips during smoking, he said.FINAL YEAR MBBS STUDENT TO JOIN FIGHTLucknow: To intensify the fight against the coronavirus, the state government on Wednesday decided to utilize the services of final year MBBS and nursing students.Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed the medical education department and the health department to post final year MBBS and Nursing students who have completed their course in the hospitals to examine patients and assist senior doctors in the treatment of coronavirus positive patients as well.Their joining will add to the human resource and also provide young manpower to the hospitals.

15-04-2020||Gurugram||Haryana struggles to increase Covid testing as it fails to find partner labs||The six private laboratories authorised to do Covid-19 tests in the city have conducted more than 800 tests in the last 15 days, an average of about 53 tests per day. While the private labs said they were working 24X7 to test as many samples as possible, the collective clearing capacity of these labs is far below the number of samples the district is required to test every day given that Gurugram is Haryana’s largest Covid-19 hot spot. The state has directed the district machinery to take at least 450 samples per day to check clustering of Covid-19 cases. As on Wednesday, the total cases of Coronavirus disease in Haryana were 190. Of these 32 were in Gurugram with 1 death. The district had six active containment zones as on Wednesday. Gurugram chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said they collect about 300 samples every day from public and private hospitals. “On some days, we collect about 400 samples. When the sample number is high (more than 300), we approach private labs (Core Diagnostics and SRL Labs) for testing as directed by the state health department. Other labs are doing tests as per their capacity,” Dr Punia said. As per the data shared by the district health department, private labs have tested an overall 2,173 samples in Gurugram till now. Largely, samples are sent to PGIMS Rohtak for testing, which individually tests at least 150 samples per day. It must be noted that right now the state is only testing a limited number of samples provided by private hospitals where suspected patients are taken.“We are consistently doing tests in our labs, working in three shifts for 24 hours. We did not anticipate the volume of samples would be skyrocketing. We are receiving samples from the health department along with private hospitals and collection from home,” Zoya Brar of the Core Diagnostic said. According to Brar, the lab is not in short supply of RT-PCR kits as they are in contact with five different vendors. “We cannot stock kits but we do have a sufficient number that can last for a few days. We are ensuring a constant supply of kits,” she said, adding that testing should be further ramped up. Dr Risabh Singh Rajput of Modern Diagnostic, one of the ICMR approved labs, said, “We are following the ICMR protocol, taking samples from the private hospital. We are testing 15-20 samples every day.” When HT tried contacting SRL and other labs they refused to comment. HURDLESOfficials said the state government wants the labs to play a larger role and the labs can sign voluntary memorandum of understanding (MoU) to take on additional samples when they increase testing, but only three of the six labs have done that. “As a part of the MoU, the private labs will have to collect samples and test it within a defined time period. As per the norm, they have to ensure the samples are collected from a spot within two hours and test results have to be delivered within 36 hours. Most of the labs are not comfortable with the turnaround time. One of the conditions is that if they are not able to deliver the results in the stipulated time, we would deduct 20% of the overall testing cost per sample,” an officer with the Haryana Medical Services Corporation Ltd, which coordinates supply of all medical infrastructure across the state, said asking not to be named. He also said that the state is trying to reach out to labs who are ready to provide services for the entire state instead of focusing on two to four districts only. “A few of these labs want to restrict to Gurugram alone. It is for this reason we are not able to utilize the potential of private labs,” he said. “Only three labs have agreed to this proposal while the remaining three have expressed their reluctance. We are still talking to them as it would aid in increasing the overall testing capacity, though we are simultaneously increasing the capacity in government set up too,” another HMSCL officer said.Officials said the samples exceeding the government lab capacity are sent to private labs for testing and the payment (₹4,500 per test) is being done by the state government. In Haryana, more than 6,000 samples have been tested until now. Out of which 4,591 tested negative and results are awaited for 1617 samples. There are two government labs — PGIMS, Rohtak, and a BPS Khanpur Kalan, Sonepat — are testing. The capacity of two government labs is at least 200 samples a day. They are trying to increase the capacity to 500 tests per day. LABS HESITANTOfficials and lab experts said the hesitation in the current scenario could be traced to lack of sufficient field force to collect samples from different districts. Brar, who has been working with the Haryana government on various health projects said, “Government has been considering labs that are ready to deploy their field force in collecting samples from different districts and give timely results. It is difficult also as visiting different districts, collecting samples and bringing it to the testing lab is not an easy process. It requires manpower.” Meanwhile, to speed up testing, a government lab has been set up in Faridabad’s ESIC Hospital stating Monday. A CSIR lab in Chandigarh is also functional and they are in the process of establishing five more labs in Nuh, Hisar, Karnal, Rohtak, and Panchkula. Health officials said they are authorised to send samples to Dr Lal Path labs and Dr Dangs lab in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-struggles-to-increase-covid-testing-as-it-fails-to-find-partner-labs/story-L23TqO0DOU3ZxF9V8A4vBO.html
15-04-2020||Gurugram||Talk shows, musical evenings, online yoga: The World Spa residents keep their spirits high||Staying at home all day long during the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can be a tedious task. But not for the residents of The World Spa in Sector 30, thanks to the society’s own discussion platform World Spa Ki Baat. The talk show is held daily for an hour at 5pm via video conference. Residents who are experts in their respective fields speak on topics such as the modernisation of the Air Force, international affairs, energy security, college admissions, spirituality, and others. “Around 70-80 residents log in to watch the sessions. The speakers are planned and residents are told in advance,” Ashwani Singla, president of The World Spa Apartment Owners’ Association, said. The residents have planned daily engagement sessions to keep indoors. In the morning, the residents can join a virtual yoga session at 7.30am conducted by one of them on alternate days. The session lasts an hour. “Admiral Suren Rao has been conducting yoga sessions in the society for a long time. As the Covid-19 scare broke, his family wanted him to stop the sessions with the residents as he was 73 years old. We then asked him to conduct the sessions online. This is the first time he is using technology for the class,” Rakesh Vij, a resident who spearheaded the lockdown engagement activities of the society, said. In the evening, during sundown, the society has a music hour at 6pm. Two residents in possession of large speakers play songs from the two wings of the condominium. Residents can even place their requests in advance and coordinate a playlist. The society is currently working on a plan to host a Zoom dance party.However, residents of the society have not forgotten about their staff and others less fortunate. The society is located next to Silokhera village. To help the daily wagers in the village, residents raised a fund and adopted 350 families to help during the lockdown. They partnered with the district administration to help distribute the ration the society bought with the fund.“The residents raised around ₹7-8 lakh to help the daily wagers who had been affected by the lockdown. We bought ration for them and provided it to the district administration who helped distribute it in the village,” James Abraham, a resident who has been living in the society for the past 11 years, said. The condominium has over 1,300 residents. The society started preparing for the lockdown by formulating a special task force to take care of its residents. It collected recent travel histories of residents, advised them on safety and other precautions. Singla said that at one point, the society had 92 residents under quarantine. “The task force, which included public health experts, trained our staff on sanitation protocol and rehearsed steps like serving those in quarantine, disposing of the waste and how to extend support to residents in isolation. They were also provided PPE kits,” Singla said. The society also turned to its 17-year-old resident, Mihir Vardhan, a robotics enthusiast, to help with face masks. Vardhan created prototypes of face shields using open-source designs on the Internet at home. These were provided to the staff to protect them against the virus while on duty. “I have three 3D printers at home that I used to print the face shields. They are made from polylactic acid, a polymer. The society had asked for four for the staff, I provided them six,” Vardhan said.The society has one grocery store and a chemist inside its complex. Residents can place their order via WhatsApp beforehand. They are informed when the order is complete. They can then pay and pick up the order. The society is allowing doorstep deliveries of only perishable items; for the rest, deliveries are restricted to tower lobbies. While most condominiums in the city have opted for a no-walk policy, The World Spa focused on providing small windows for residents to go on walks. “There are two slots of three hours each for taking walks in the morning and evening. Towers are alternately assigned the slots. A street inside the complex is provided for this. Residents have to maintain 6ft distance. Older residents and children are advised against stepping out,” Singla said. He added that this decision was taken keeping in mind the physical and mental well being of residents. The society has accommodated around 40 members of staff inside its complex in a vacant building. The staff are offered meals through a community kitchen and they work on a rotational basis. Routine medical check-ups of the staff are conducted daily. Those staying inside the society are being provided 1.5 times their salary for the duration of their stay. “We recently held a high tea and special dinner for them to show our appreciation for their efforts during this difficult time,” Singla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/talk-shows-musical-evenings-online-yoga-the-world-spa-residents-keep-their-spirits-high/story-lHbU0zVygHvHhqvHt8tX2N.html
15-04-2020||Delhi||Educational institutes scramble to take learning online||The Union home ministry on Wednesday released guidelines stating educational institutes — schools, colleges, and coaching institutes — will continue to remain shut till the end of lockdown May 3, putting universities and educational boards in a spot.A countrywide lockdown till April 14 was put in place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month to contain the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown was on Tuesday extended till May 3.Amid the closure of schools and colleges, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), which is yet to complete conducting Class 12 board exams, will also not be able to restart its evaluation process that has been on hold since March 19.The CBSE is also yet to conduct re-examination for Class 10 and 12 students of northeast Delhi districts, where board exams had to be postponed after the February communal riots.“Since the lockdown has been extended and the exams, as well as evaluation, are still pending, the board will hold deliberations on how to proceed further,” a CBSE official said .While announcing the closure of educational institutes till May 3, the MHA on Wednesday added that these institutions are “expected to maintain academic schedule through online teachings.” The institutes have been asked to use Doordarshan and other educational channels for teaching purposes. The Delhi government had earlier told HT that they were exploring options of using television channels to reach out to students.In order to conduct exams, however, universities are waiting for recommendations from the University Grants Commission, which has set up a panel of vice-chancellors to find out ways to mitigate academic loss and chart a course of action. The committee is expected to submit its report by Thursday. The varsities have, however, prepared a set of options which can be used for its students.“Online is one of the options being explored. The final decision will only be taken after the UGC panel gives its recommendations. DU has a large number of students and we have to take that into account before making any decision,” said Vinay Gupta, Dean (Examinations), DU.A senior DU official, requesting anonymity, said the university has prepared different modalities including multiple-choice question-based assessment or assignment-based assessment. “We are waiting for the government’s recommendations on how exams should be conducted since there should be a uniform process across the country,” the official said. The varsity is also training its teachers through workshops and webinars on online teaching-learning processes. Students and teachers having queries can reach out to the Delhi University Computer Centre with their doubts.Jawaharlal Nehru University too recommended online examinations on Tuesday and is waiting for feedback from its Deans, before formulating the final policy. “Students who will be unable to give examinations for lack of internet connectivity should be allowed to submit their assignments with a grace period. However, students, who do not have internet connectivity due to the lockdown, will be permitted to write the online examinations after they return to the campus post lockdown,” said a report prepared by the varsity’s committee constituted to look into the matter.On Tuesday, HT had also reported how Jamia Millia Islamia was planning to carry out five 20-marks online assessments and use best of three as the final score. The varsity is also compiling a list of students who do not have access to the Internet to formulate an alternative.In a country with a sharp digital divide, the suggestion to switch to the online mode of education has left many thinking about students who do have access to the internet or devices like smartphones and computers.Poonam Batra, who teaches at the department of education, DU, said, “Due to this lockdown and subsequent online classes, the digital divide is clearly visible. It is worse at school level, where there are major issues, including poor access to computers. While authorities are seeking to digitise education, our ground reality tells a different story. Many students will be left out, resulting in deeper educational inequalities.”Professor Shyam Menon, former vice-chancellor of Ambedkar University, however, said, “Online learning isn’t the ideal scenario but this is an exigency and we are trying to do the best we can. Teachers are using both synchronous (video calls) and asynchronous (email readings) means of online communication to reach out to students since there is an unevenness in access to the internet.”Menon, who also teaches at the department of education, DU, added, “An alternative could be printing out study materials and sending them to students by postal services. That could work once there is some relaxation in the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/educational-institutes-scramble-to-take-learning-online/story-HCwg2bumFktXYvmNJn6BYN.html
15-04-2020||City||How Delhi cops plan to enforce extended lockdown||New DelhiThe Delhi police, administration and civic authorities are working out ways to enforce the extended coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown -- from a moratorium on the sale of liquor and tobacco to a ban on spitting -- when some restrictions will be lifted after April 20 to allow select handyman services in the city The police are yet to issue an order on the execution of exemptions for all those who can open for business after that date, but many officers who spoke to Hindustan Times said the department will work closely with the Delhi government, market welfare associations and resident welfare associations to implement them.According to the guidelines issued by the federal ministry of home affairs on Wednesday, many self-employed people like plumbers, carpenters, electricians and automobile mechanics, who are not registered, will be allowed to return to work when the exemptions take force.. “We could issue curfew passes for such persons. If there are no curfew passes, then police will speak to the resident welfare associations or the market welfare associations to give the names of all such persons in their area,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity. They could then be allowed after matching their names and details with their identify proof document such as a voter’s identity card or an Aadhaar unique ID. This practice is already being followed in places like Chandni Mahal and Nizamuddin, which are containment areas.“These are only the list of suggestions we have made in a meeting with our senior officers. The order is yet to be issued,” said the police officer cited above.Beat constables will coordinate with workers like roadside mechanics, who have no links with market associations or residential colonies, another police officer said.“Every police station area is divided into beats. A constable or a head constable is in charge of the beat. The beat could comprise of a lane or many lanes. Each constable is expected to know every person from his/her beat. It will be the beat in-charge’s job to ensure that only the concerned person is out on the road,” the second officer said.The guidelines also state that the sale of liquor, tobacco or any such items will be “strictly prohibited” until May 3, the last day of the extended lockdown. The district administrations said on Wednesday that it has formed teams to ensure compliance with the rule. “The teams comprise of licensing inspectors from the municipal corporations, legal metrology officers (LMOs) from the weights and measurements department, excise inspectors, drug inspectors, and food and civil supplies inspectors. They submit daily reports to us on their actions taken in various districts against activities such as illegal sale, hoarding and blackmarketing,” said Sonalika Jiwani, sub-divisional magistrate,Mehrauli. The rules also talk of allowing some construction activities in the city form April 20. For this, the onus will lie of the municipal corporations. “I will hold a meeting with my officers tomorrow to chalk out a plan for enforcing this. Our inspectors will have to visit every lane and thoroughly check that only those projects are opened where labourers are staying on-site,” said Varsha Joshi, commissioner of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation. “Also, the larger point of inspecting construction activities is to ensure strict compliance with social distancing. Whether workers are being given adequate protection to prevent the spread of the virus will also be checked,” Joshi said. The latest guidelines also said spitting in public should attract penalties. The directive was first issued by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal last month when officials in the quarantine facility in Tughlakabad registered a first information report for misbehaviour by those evacuated from the Nizamuddin Markaz and put under quarantine in mid-March. The complaint said the inmates were spitting even after being warned against it. Compliance with the prohibition of spitting will have to be ensured by the district magistrates, said a senior government official. “This drive is already going on across all districts. We will escalate the crackdown now,” said a district magistrate on condition of anonymity.

15-04-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow: CMO orders closure of private hospital where corona patient was admitted||The health department on Wednesday ordered closure of a hospital in Daliganj area after it was found that a person who tested positive for coronavirus was admitted there a few days back.“Notice was issued for closure of hospital and all clinical and para-medical staff will remain under home quarantine and a list of the same has been demanded from the owners of the Daliganj Hospital,” said Lucknow’s chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Narendra Agrawal, in a press statement.Different medical associations have, however, opposed the decision. Dr Anoop Agrawal, secretary of the UP Orthopaedic Association, who owns a hospital in Faijullaganj said, “This is discrimination between the government and private hospitals. When a corona positive patient had visited the KGMU, its sanitization was done and functioning of the casualty ward was resumed within 36 hours but the same is not being done in a private hospital.”Dr Rama Srivastava, president IMA, Lucknow said, “Even if a positive patient visited a private hospital sanitization can be done and the staff in direct contact should be put under quarantine but the hospitals should not be sealed.”“The decision to run or keep the hospital closed should be with the owner,” he said. Dr PK Gupta, former IMA president, Lucknow, on Wednesday announced to close his pathology for a few days. “I was running services for four hours a day but if the health department will take such actions it is better to keep establishment closed till the situation is better and health department turns supportive instead of discriminatory.”Doctors said that if such types of actions are taken services such as ultrasound, x-ray and pathology may get affected. “Private sector is supporting the government that has asked us to run emergency services. But if we have to face action for supporting the administration what choice do we have but to shut shops till better times,” said Dr Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-cmo-orders-closure-of-private-hospital-where-corona-patient-was-admitted/story-0ArjXm2o3o6d18P1Mh3zhL.html

On Monday, the Chandigarh Police had arrested 182 people who stepped out of their homes for morning and evening walks. Police have been regularly issuing warnings to people against going to city parks for a walk.

15-04-2020||City||Observe social distancing guidelines while harvesting: Mohali DC||The district administration in coordination with the agriculture and farmers’ welfare department is undertaking all the necessary measures to ensure that social distancing guidelines are observed by the farmers and farm labourers while harvesting wheat.On Wednesday, deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan said, “The combine owners have been sensitised about measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They have been told to sanitise their machines with sodium hypochlorite or sanitisers.”“The combines that would be coming from Handesra and Lalru would also be thoroughly sanitised,” he said.“Farmers and farm labourers engaged in the harvesting process should strictly observe social distancing guidelines and everyone must cover their faces with masks. At the harvesting site, proper arrangements should be made for ensuring hygiene. In case anyone connected with the harvesting process suffers from an ailment such as coughing, fever or respiratory problems, then disengage that person from work and immediately inform the health department authorities.Curfew passes extendedDayalan also said that the restricted movement and curfew passes issued to ensure essential supplies and legitimate travel of people during the curfew/lockdown would be considered valid till the extended period of curfew/lockdown.The district magistrate (DM) had imposed a curfew under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) till further orders in the district to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.Hassle free wheat procurement would be ensured, says Balbir Singh Sidhu Meanwhile, state health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “The farmers of Punjab have been the backbone of the economic structure of the state.”“The government would ensure that the farming community faces no problems in selling their crops.

15-04-2020||Delhi||Lockdown relaxations offer hope to migrants who work as plumbers, carpenters||When Ram Vir, a 28-year-old plumber, set out to the Capital from his village in Bihar last year, he had dreams of a better life for his family.He had to repay a loan his father had taken from a local money lender for his train ticket and stay in Delhi. His wife and children were also planning to join him in another year.“Everything was going as planned until March 25, when the government announced the lockdown. I lived in a one-room set in Palam, but I gave that up to go back to my village,” Vir said. Vir said that after the lockdown was announced, his panic grew after watching the news of thousands workers like him heading towards their respective villages. On March 27, he decided to follow suit.On his walk to the Anand Vihar Inter State Bus Terminal, as there was no public transport, Vir was stopped along with many others who had thought it better to head home than stay in the Capital without work. They were sent to a shelter home near New Delhi railway station. There, he met quite a few more self-employed people like him -- carpenters, electricians, roadside car mechanics, all with no way to go home.With cash running out, Vir was waiting anxiously for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address on Tuesday to get clarity on how the days ahead would be. The extension of the lockdown till May 3 initially came as a huge blow to him, but it was only on Wednesday that he realised that there was an exemption for workers like him. An order issued by the ministry of home affairs on Wednesday, has come to the rescue of many self-employed service providers like Vir, allowing them to resume their jobs after April 20 except in areas marked containment zones.Such self-employed service providers are not registered with the government or any home service companies. They are daily wagers found in almost every colony and lives on a call-by-call basis. There are no official numbers as they are part of the large unorganised workforce in the Capital, but a senior Delhi government official said that it could be around 30,000 to 40,000.Unlike registered autorickshaw drivers or those who driver Grahmin Sewa vehicles, they are also not eligible for financial support of the ₹5000 provided by the Delhi government because of the lockdown.“You have no idea how much relief this news has brought me. I will first get out of here and get a new room on rent and then start work,” Vir said.“The centre’s order will be followed. However, the mechanism on how this will be implemented is yet to be devised,” said the official quoted above.By mechanism, he was referring to whether they will be issued passes or the time of day that they are allowed to work, among others.Mukesh Kumar, 27, an electrician, in north-west Delhi’s Rohini said with the days getting warmer, the demand to service and repair air-conditioners and other electronics is likely to pick up.“I have already got a number of calls from my previous clients. I don’t know how much work we will get. There are some tools and spare parts that we have to purchase from different dealers. I hope the government will do something about it,” said Kumar, who runs a small electrical store in Rohini, and has a family of seven to feed.Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city, however, have not yet decided on whether they will allow these service providers entry. Many have barred the entry of any outsider into their premises as the Covid-19 infection spread.“It may end up defeating the purpose of the lockdown. The workers will go house-to-house carrying same set of tools and baggage, which can lead to spreading of infection. How will one ensure sanitising the entire house?” said HC Gupta, president, Federation of Ashok Vihar RWAs, who is also a doctor. “I will urge people in the area to take the services only when there is an emergency and wait for the regular repairs and other things till the lockdown is lifted.”The state government has said that it will issue a detailed order soon on how the MHA’s order will be operationalised. Suresh Singh, a mechanic, who works at an automobile repair shop in South Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar said that while the move to allow self-employed workers was welcome the government should also announce financial assistance for those whose livelihoods have been affected. “It has been nearly a month since we have earned anything and even now the exemption is for a select few. There should be some financial help for us, so that we can survive this lockdown,” Singh said.Tarun Pradhan, a senior researcher of labour laws and social structures at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that the relief to migrant workers will also control the possibility of another mass exodus from the city.“When a person is not able to survive in a city, unable to afford basics like food, especially under such a scenario when the health and well-being of his family is also at stake, his natural tendency will be to run back to his home. The government needs to assure that these migrant labourers are safe and allowed to earn for their families,” Pradhan.Meanwhile, labour unions feel that the relaxation should not just be limited to a small section of migrant workers.Thaneshwar Adigaur, member of the Delhi Construction Workers Advisory Committee and secretary of Delhi Asangathit Nirman Majdoor Union, said, “The construction workers in the unorganised sector should have also been included when carpenters, plumbers and electricians are allowed. It is a matter of livelihood, as a majority of Delhi’s lower rung workforce has not been able to get the benefit of the Delhi government’s financial assistance scheme. They should be allowed to work so that they can earn their livelihood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lockdown-relaxations-offer-hope-to-migrants-who-work-as-plumbers-carpenters/story-RfuPXsQg7iknVHHhoGB8CK.html

15-04-2020||Delhi||Cops to wear body cameras in containment zones||The Delhi Police is equipping personnel deployed in containment zones with body cameras to record violations and misbehaviour with police and healthcare workers.As the new guidelines, issued by the Central government on Wednesday on the extended lockdown, has specified “spitting in public” a punishable offence, the use of body-worn cameras will also help the police identify and prosecute offenders, deputy commissioner of police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said.“Body cameras will have a dual benefit. Firstly, it would dissuade people from unnecessarily arguing with police or staffers of agencies deployed in containment zones for enforcement and screening. Secondly, it will help in maintaining surveillance on people in home-quarantine and residents who defy lockdown rules by not wearing masks or stepping out of homes without any purpose,” Thakur said.Delhi’s South and South East districts are among the first to have started equipping their police personnel with body-worn cameras in 16 neighbourhoods, including Nizamuddin, Zakir Nagar, Deoli and Sangam Vihar, where containment zones have been identified.In South district, 15 cameras have been made available while in South East, which has 13 such red zones, 20 body-worn cameras are being used. The other districts have also been asked to provide such cameras to personnel.Personnel in containment zones will wear the camera on their chest, on top of the protective equipment (PPE) kit, to record all the activities happening in front of them, deputy commissioner of police (South East) RP Meena said.“Each camera has the capacity to record audio and video for 10-12 hours. As the government has decided to punish those found spitting in public, the cameras would help us identify people involved in the unhygienic act,” a senior police officer, who is not authorised to speak with the media, said.The city police personnel wear body cameras while regulating vehicular movement, and while manning protests or mass gatherings.According to the officer, most incidents of misbehaviour and altercation with police, health and sanitation staff occur over the use of masks, social distancing, screening of residents or sanitisation of their houses and neighbourhoods.Thakur said that on Wednesday, a Kotla Mubarakpur resident had a scuffle with the police, when he was confronted for not wearing a mask. Apart from the sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the man was also booked for obstruction and use of criminal force.“Body-worn cameras may help curb such violent behaviour as the footage can be used as evidence to prove their offences in the court of law,” said Thakur.According to the police data, 180-200 cases pertaining to lockdown violations are registered every day in Delhi. The violators are arrested and bailed, as per provisions under the Epidemic Diseases Act and sections 188 269, 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), and 271 (disobedience of quarantine rule) of the IPC. If convicted, an offender can be sentenced to a maximum imprisonment of two years, or be fined, or face both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cops-to-wear-body-cameras-in-containment-zones/story-ZxvSiI8FJOIcJBG9ECnPuN.html

In its order, the court said that since the accused was “an educated man” he should have been respectful of the doctors and not threatened them, but stated that no useful purpose would be served by keeping him in judicial custody and crowding Tihar Jail.Police had arrested him on a complaint filed by a 29-year-old junior resident doctor at Safdarjung Hospital who had alleged that the man started speaking about social distancing and remarked that “doctors like them were spreading infection in residential areas”. The incident had taken place on April 8.The man was granted bail by the Metropolitan Magistrate on April 9, but, it was cancelled on the same day by the Additional Sessions Judge looking into the seriousness of the allegations. The aggrieved then moved the Delhi High Court seeking release from jail.Appearing for him, his counsel contended that his client has been falsely implicated and he had only protested against the complainant and her sister for not adhering to social distancing norms. He said that both the women became aggressive and told that they were doctors and knew the meaning of social distancing. However, the court said that the accused, being an educated person, should have been respectful to the doctors rather than abusing and threatening them.“The country is passing through a very difficult phase and the doctors are rendering yeomen service to the nation. The petitioner being an educated man, as stated by the counsel for the petitioner that he is an interior designer by profession, should have been respectful to the doctors rather than abusing and threatening them,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-accused-of-assaulting-two-delhi-doctors-gets-bail/story-jq9qF8woe6I4jxUd30KQdM.html

Rumours that the money will be taken back by the government if not withdrawn immediately is making these beneficiaries wait for hours under the sun. Even as the State Bank of India, which has the highest number of PMGKY accounts, has dispelled such rumours, there has been no change on the ground.“Paisa aa gaya hai par nikale kaise. ATM hai par PIN generate nahi hua and bank wale baat hi nahi sun rahe (The money had been credited, but I don’t know how to withdraw it. I have a debit card but its PIN has not been generated. No one is listening to me in the bank,” says Shakuntla Devi, a resident of Pabhat village in Zirakpur, who was standing in one such queue.A visit to various bank branches in Zirakpur and Dera Bassi revealed that officials have failed to deploy staff to ensure that those queuing up follow social-distancing norm. The banks were asked to send text messages to customers to ensure they come on different days, depending on their account numbers. As a precaution, main entrances remain closed and customers are let in one by one after checking their documents.“After standing in the line for about two hours, I have been told that I cannot withdraw the money as days have been fixed according to the last digit of the account number,” said Rachna Devi of Dayalpura village in Dera Bassi, while denying that she got a message about staggered withdrawals from her bank branch. While none of the bank officials contacted for comment for this story were willing to come on record, Dera Bassi subdivisional magistrate Kuldeep Bawa said: “I have asked police stations concerned to patrol the markets and ensure there is no rush outside banks. We are also creating awareness among beneficiaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jan-dhan-beneficiaries-give-social-distancing-the-go-by-outside-banks-in-mohali/story-riFd5RR9zJQOMOo3I1mxoM.html

Some residents allege that they have not received any ration for the last few days and are managing by borrowing from each other.The village, with a population of 3,000, is the largest Covid-19 cluster in Punjab. It has 38 positive patients out of the total 56 cases of Mohali district and was sealed by the district administration around a week back. On April 9, the district administration had strictly banned the movement of people in the area, which was declared a containment zone by the health authorities and nakas were set up all around the village.The administration had claimed that they would be providing food and ration at the door steps of the residents.Jaswinder Singh, a resident of the village, said, “Since the last three days, we don’t have ‘Atta’ (flour) at our house and are borrowing it from our neighbours. Even the vegetable vendors are not allowed in our village.”Another resident, Talwinder Singh, said, “The flour mill in our village is closed and we don’t have any other option. We are thankful to our neighbours who are helping us. Some of the villagers are also struggling to get medicines.”Meanwhile, Dera Bassi sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Kuldeep Bawa said, “These are all false allegations as we have a list of the entire village and have provided them everything. They have milch animals but are asking for Verka milk, which is not a genuine demand.”The villagers have also alleged that the district administration is not allowing them to harvest wheat and fear that the standing crop would be exposed to rain and hailstorms. Gurpreet Singh, a villager, said, “The administration has not allowed us to use our combine harvesters. They have told us that they would provide us with combines but we don’t know when the machines will come. Our crops are ready and we fear that they would be exposed to the rain.”Control rooms set up The district administration has set up control rooms to ensure that food-related issues are redressed at the respective sub-division level itself.The district-level control room number of the nodal officer is 9888201787 and the district food control room number for essential commodities is 0172-2219541 or 7888556264.

DGP Dinkar Gupta selected the names for the award, instituted at the initiative of Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. The awardees continue to work at the frontline of the covid-19 operations and response activities in the state.The awardees include four superintendent of police (SPs), one ASP, one DSP, six inspectors, four sub-inspectors, three ASIs, two head constables and four constables. Gupta said they were selected from nominations that police commissioners and SSPs had sent. He added that the CM wanted the award to be instituted in light of the scale of sacrifice of over 45,000 policemen, working relentlessly across the state, along with social and religious organisations, to realise his resolve that ‘no man will sleep hungry in Punjab’.Vatsala Gupta, ASP Nakodar, did pioneering work in reaching out to the poor and underprivileged slum dwellers of Nakodar town, while DSP Varinder Jit Singh of Rupnagar ensured the supply of essential goods to the poor and needy by mobilising volunteers. SI Jatin Kapoor of Rupnagar motivated panchayats to impose a voluntary lockdown of their villages.SHO Bhagwant Singh of Kharar (Mohali) proactively carried out the tracking and tracing of suspect coronavirus cases. Similarly, SI Neeraj Chaudhary of SBS Nagar took the risk of visiting isolated corona patients to trace their contacts, after some of them refused to cooperate with the epidemiologist and other doctors. SI Shohrat Mann of Pathankot is doing commendable work providing food to the poor and the downtrodden. SI Shakunt Chaudhary of Fatehgarh Sahib has done commendable work as the in-charge of a critical naka point the DGP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-names-25-cops-for-new-sewa-to-society-award/story-pnyutm1rhLnoKOfCerFiaK.html
15-04-2020||Chandigarh||Global pandemic puts study abroad dreams on halt for students of Punjab region||Rohan Verma, 21, was looking forward to pursuing a course in 3D animation from Canada. Verma is now in a dilemma as the lockdown has halted his visa processing.With high commissions dysfunctional and countries imposing restrictions in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, the study abroad dreams of thousands of students in the region are gripped by uncertainty as the world grapples with the Covid-19 lockdown.Verma said, “I had applied in a Canadian college, but my visa processing was stopped. I am not able to decide what to do next. If I apply here again, I will have to pay the fee again.”Immigration experts say over 1 lakh students from Punjab and Chandigarh land in foreign countries like Australia, Canada, UK and others for pursuing education every year.Navneet Singh, an immigration consultant, said, “Last year we had sent around 1,200 students abroad for studies, but we have experienced a dip this year. Worst affected are those who have already paid their fee and their files are with the high commission offices. Every May and September countries like Canada and Australia take students, but we aren’t sure whether students will be able to go in the fall either.”“Around 50,000 students go abroad from here between July and September, but this year the number will go down,” said Jatin Wadhwa, director of a Candigarh-based education abroad consultancy.Equally hard pressed are those students who are already enrolled in courses abroad, but couldn’t fly due to the lockdown.For 18-year-old Simranjeet Kaur, lockdown has deferred her semester to January 2021. “My classes were scheduled to start in May but now they will start in January next year. I do not have any option but to wait.”Managing director of an overseas solution provider said, “We receive applications mostly from the students of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The intake that was about to happen in May in Canada and few Universities of Australia has been deferred. Students as well as parents are in panic.”“For September intake last year we had received over 100 applications, but this year we have not received any. There is much uncertainty because we do not know when board examinations will be conducted. I think we will see a dip of 60% in applications this year,” said Rakeshwar Walia of an immigration and education consultancy based in Khanna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/global-pandemic-puts-study-abroad-dreams-on-halt-for-students-of-chandigarh/story-XIdlVXEoLWpb5pxfv7ym6O.html

According to the ED, the cancellation application had been filed in March but due to the lockdown, they had not pursued it. However, as the brothers failed to appear before the ED and have left the city there is an apprehension that they may abscond and hence the sought an urgent hearing of the application.A division bench of justice P D Naik while hearing the application on Thursday was informed by government pleader Poornima Kantharia that ED had filed the application soon after the brothers were granted bail as the grounds were erroneous. She said that ED was to move the application before the HC in March but due to the lockdown and restrictions on the movement they did not pursue it.She further submitted that the brothers were not attending the ED office as per the bail conditions and it later came to light that the brothers had left the city and were first living in Khandala and thereafter at their farmhouse in Mahabaleshwar. “They refused to attend the ED office citing a threat to their life due to the coronavirus, but they felt no fear while travelling out of the city,” said Kantharia.She further added that there was an apprehension that the brothers may abscond and hence their bail should be cancelled and they should be put back behind bars.Despite the nationwide lockdown, the Wadhwan brothers and their family of 23 had left Mumbai and were living in a rented house at Khandala. However, after they were asked to vacate the house they managed to travel to Mahabaleshwar based on a letter from Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary (special), home department. The investigating agencies were unaware of the Wadhwans leaving the city and it was only when a neighbour of the farmhouse alerted the Satara police, the whereabouts of the Wadhwan’s came to light. All 23 members of the Wadhwan family have since been kept under institutional quarantine in Satara.After hearing the submissions the bench issued notice to the Wadhwans and directed the Satara police to serve the same on them and posted the matter for hearing on April 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-seeks-cancellation-of-wadhwan-brothers-bail/story-RdPOcfyBSgVozzD8SApQPN.html
15-04-2020||City||Thane traders face problems as TMC shifts market||The wholesalers at Jambli Naka in Thane are unhappy after the market was shifted to 17 spots in the city.The traders said most areas are far off and they do not have transport to travel long distances.They claimed that none of them were taken into confidence while implementing the new system. Thane Municipal Corporation had to shut the wholesale vegetable and grocery market at Jambli Naka as social distancing norms were violated in the market. The markets opened to huge crowds in the past few weeks despite repeated warnings by the authorities. On Tuesday, TMC divided the wholesalers into 17 different spots across the city to ensure there is no crowding in one place. Santosh Mali, a wholesaler, said, “Earlier, they had moved the market to Central Maidan to ensure social distancing, but still there was crowding. Now, they have shifted traders to 17 different spots. Some wholesalers have to go as far as Mumbra, Diva or Ghodbunder, which is difficult. The new spots lack basic facilities such as water, electricity and washrooms.”Another trader, Ankush Thonge, said most of the areas such as Mumbra or Vrundavan society are containment zones so they are scared to do business there. “None of our issues have been addressed. They have to distribute the commodities from 4am to 7am only. It is difficult to cater to all traders in this limited time. There is one transport van which provides produce to all wholesalers. The transport vehicle will not go from market to Mumbra or Ghodbunder. So, those who are allotted spaces in far-off wards will suffer,” said Thonge.The wholesalers have also drafted a letter to the authorities to resolve some of their issues. TMC has asked the wholesalers to sell commodities to only small-time traders and not to residents. A civic official said, “The work of providing them facilities is in progress. But, markets have to be shifted to ensure there is no crowding at one place. The wholesalers will have to abide by the norms or else they will not be allowed to do business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-traders-face-problems-as-tmc-shifts-market/story-KgrsOk6q4vY0dP3wu3nj7O.html

As Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) confirmed three more cases on Monday evening, police and health workers teams reached Hindpiri to pick the patients around 10.30 pm, according to locals.The locals were protesting in the team presence, arguing why was the team taking the patients during the night. The team could finally take the three infected people to hospital around 4.30 am on Tuesday. Stone was pelted on the ambulance that was there to pick the patients and police barricades were also vandalised.  With addition of three new cases, Hindpiri has alone recorded state’s maximum of 11 confirmed Covid-19, followed by nine cases in Bokaro, two in Hazaribag and one each in Koderma and Giridih. Till now, two, including one from Hindpiri, have died due to the pandemic.Subdivisional officer (SDO), Ranchi, Lokesh Mishra said four ambulances had been sent to the area. Stones were pelted on one ambulance and vandalised a part of it, he said. “After discussions, we later picked the patients around 4.30 on Tuesday from the locality and admitted them to the hospital,” said Mishra, adding, contact tracing is being done to find out people who might have come in contact with these patients. The SDO said they were also identifying the people who resorted to violence and action would be taken against them.“A section of the residents turned aggressive when administration’s team suddenly came at night around 11 to pick the patients without informing anyone. Some residents were not in favour of it. They wanted the patients to be taken in the morning. The administration should inform at least some community leaders who could help them in the task,” said Ibrar Ahmad, president Anjuman Islamia, Hindpiri.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the Hemant Soren government was adopting discriminatory approach even in lockdown violation. State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said the teams of Ranchi police and health workers, who are putting their lives at risk at midnight, went to Hindpiri to pick corona patients. “But police, as well as the health workers, were misbehaved and people demonstrated violating the curfew,” said Shahdeo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/ranchi-administration-picks-corona-patients-amid-violent-resistance-from-section-of-hindpiri-residents/story-ZlVQcV5l13B6i1eZhEJkIO.html

15-04-2020||Ranchi||Late surge of positive covid cases mark first leg of lockdown in Jharkhand||The first positive case in Jharkhand was recorded on March 31, a week after the national lockdown was announced. It was of a Malaysian woman in her early twenties, a member of Tablighi Jamaat group that was picked from different mosques in the state capital. She is still under treatment at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). As per the latest official data, the number of positive cases stand at 24, of which two persons have died — one each in Ranchi and Bokaro. Both were senior citizens. These cases have been reported from across five districts including Ranchi, Bokaro, Hazaribag, Koderma and Giridih. Eleven of the 24 positive cases have been reported from one area, Hindpiri, in Ranchi. The entire area, the biggest hotspot in the state with a dense population of around 60,000, has been under curfew for about a week. Six of the 11 cases in Hindpiri are from one single family, including a 60-year-old man who died on Sunday morning. The other two hotspots are in Bokaro. The district’s first case was reported from Tello village under Chandrapura block. A woman of this village, who had been to Bangladesh and then to New Delhi to attend religious congregation Tablighi Jamaat, was detected positive for Covid-19 on April 5. Later, four members of her family were also found infected with novel coronavirus infection.The district’s second hotspot is Saram village under Gomia block from where three confirmed cases have so far been reported. The village came in light after the death of the 75-year-old man who was tested positive few hours before he breathed his last. The deceased, reportedly, had no travel history or contact history with any positive case. The district administration is still tracing the links as to how the man got infected with coronavirus infection.Of the 24 positive cases in the state, the authorities have been able to trace connection of five to Tablighi Jamaat. While Jharkhand figures lower in terms of number of positive cases as compared to other states, it is also due to slow pace of testing. As on Monday, 2,523 tests were conducted from across the state. “First, this is one state which would not have many people who might have come from abroad. As far as migrant workers are concerned, most could not return. One advantage of the state has also been that the population is sparsely habited across the state. Even the urban centres are not very densely populated,” said a health department official. The officials, however, rue the fact that the tests are not adequate for a state with a population estimated to be over three crore. “Obviously, it is due to the lack of number of testing kits, besides the lack of testing centres. We have two centres which are fully operational. The third started on Monday, but it is still to get into the groove. Testing has gathered pace only since April 10 when over 200 samples were picked. Monday saw the highest to date with 406 sample collection. The chief minister and the health minister have been highlighting it during all of their interactions with the Centre,” said an official. One of other aspects of the lockdown has been providing ration and food to the needy. The state government has started over a 1,000 ‘daal-bhaat’ centre across the state besides the Didi kitchens in all panchayats in the state, providing free meal to the needy. The state government is now also planning to transfer ₹2,000 to a migrant worker from one family, stuck outside the state, on recommendation of the local MLA. As per estimates, over seven lakh migrant workers from Jharkhand are expected to be stuck in different states. Taking lessons, the state government has also constituted a subcommittee of three ministers for overseeing the related issues during the lockdown. “We focused on providing food to the needy, besides seeing that agriculture produce and other things like milk production is not affected during the first leg of lockdown. We are going to implement all such measures even more effectively now,” said Rameshwar Oraon, state’s finance and civil supplies minister. Oraon is also a member of the ministers’ subcommittee constituted on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/late-surge-of-positive-covid-cases-mark-first-leg-of-lockdown-in-jharkhand/story-910Wztoa2LDkizo8SWtjuL.html

15-04-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon to have an extended stay of 8 days over the city||The southwest monsoon will have an extended stay of eight days over Mumbai, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) stated on Wednesday.The normal onset date has been delayed by a day and withdrawal date by nine days, stated IMD in its monsoon forecast. The new onset date for Mumbai is June 11 (against June 10 originally) and the new withdrawal date has been declared as October 8 (against the existing September 29). This means that the normal duration of the entire monsoon over Mumbai will span from June 11 to October 8 across 120 days as opposed to 112 days from June 10 to September 29.“Existing dates were so far based on old data from 1901-1940. We have revised this based on data from 1961-2019 for onset dates and 1971-2019 for withdrawal dates. Earlier, the data was collated from 149 stations. The new dates are based on data from 3,500 stations across India,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD’s director-general. “Based on this, Mumbai’s normal monsoon duration has increased by over a week (eight days),” he added.Across the state, new monsoon advance dates have been delayed by three to seven days while major changes have been identified for withdrawal dates. For example, the onset date for Jalgaon has changed from June 13 to June 18 while the withdrawal is October 6 from September 27. Changes for seven Maharashtra cities were published by IMD on Wednesday. “We cannot go by weather information that was relevant almost 80 years back and that change is visible in monsoon behaviour over the past decade. Climate change has a major role but its exact impact on monsoon is yet to be studied,” said Mohapatra.Delay in monsoon withdrawal by around 10 days is likely to impact the agriculture sector, especially across central Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada, said Akshay Deoras, Independent meteorologist and Ph.D. researcher at the University of Reading, UK. “Significant rainfall activities beyond mid-September can have a negative impact for crop harvesting. Maharashtra has already seen significant damages to ready to harvest or harvested crops in October in the last few years. The state government needs to come up with an action plan for this,” he said.On Wednesday, IMD released its first stage country-wide long-range forecast for the southwest monsoon (June to September) 2020, which is expected to be ‘normal’ or 100% of the long period average (LPA), with a model error of ± 5%. India defines ‘normal’ rainfall as between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 88 cm for four-months.“This is good news as it benefits the agricultural sector, food and water security during this difficult period of the Covid-19 outbreak,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) adding that the forecast was based on models predicting favourable ocean-atmospheric global weather factors.There is a 41% probability that the monsoon will be 96-104% (normal) and a 21% probability that it may be 104-110% (above normal). Last year too, the forecast was 96%, but actual rainfall was 110% of the LPA, the highest since 1994. IMD will be releasing its second stage forecast during the last week of May or June first week.HT had reported on April 13 that Mumbai city and suburbs could witness above average rainfall (2,500 mm) this monsoon, more than the seasonal average, as per forecasts issued by independent meteorologists.Meanwhile, private weather forecasting agency Skymet will not be issuing its forecast this year. The agency was widely criticised for their inaccurate forecast last year. “This was a decision taken by our management. The weather patterns and dynamics are changing and we want to invest in our technology so that we come on top and give an accurate forecast. We will be back next year with better technology backed updates,” the agency said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-to-have-an-extended-stay-of-8-days-over-the-city/story-0ZDfWEzo5NUbyYSl8qZruI.html

Online training about the manner of use of said software be given to all the Judicial officers and court staff through a Centralized Computer Committee. “Such Centralized Computer Committee would, from time to time, seek necessary instructions from IT Committee of this Court on the aspect of VC hearing and would also ensure that there is complete uniformity amongst all districts in this regard,” it added. The High Court also said that each district and sessions judge (DJ) would be at liberty to take appropriate steps to personally ensure that the mechanism of mentioning of urgent matters in each of the district courts is quick and efficient. It also said that the DJ could depute judicial officers for hearing the matters related to bail and urgent civil/injunction cases, corresponding to the need and requirement of the district court concerned. Reacting to this, KC Mittal, chairman, Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), said that more benches would bring improvement in the functioning and more cases will be heard.“In terms of the district courts, we will observe the situation for a couple of days and if there is any problem, then we can again make some changes,” Mittal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/functioning-of-delhi-high-court-and-district-courts-to-remain-suspended-till-may-3/story-nyWLWLeK0E1JfIOFtzza2J.html

The government should immediately announce an MSP for cherrym which should be at least ₹50/Kg,” said Singha.“The representatives of cooperative societies said the Delhi markets under ordinary circumstances order 40,000 boxes per day but this year commission agent will not purchase more that 10,000 boxes per day,” Singha said.

This service is free for Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) workers and policemen but fares are been charged from private emergency service people like security guards or citizens.The average daily revenue is Rs 1.25 lakh as against the average daily revenue of Rs 1.5 crore on a normal day when the fleet runs in full strength.Some PMPML workers’ unions such as the PMPML Rashtrawadi Workers Union has demanded that this service be made completely free for everyone in the emergency period as the revenue is negligible. Sunil Nalawade, vice-president of the union also demanded that once the service is made free, bus conductors could be exempted from duty on these 120 buses and thus protected from the risk of infectionPMPML chairperson and managing director Nayana Gunde said the emergency PMPML service is primarily meant for doctors, medical staff, PMC cleanliness workers and police personnel. The departments concerned are reimbursing the cost of ticket to PMPML and regular tickets are charged from others.About the demand to make the service free, she said, the matter would be given due consideration and “if feasible we will take the call”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/120-pmpml-buses-on-emergency-duty-during-lockdown/story-xNhhnKLM3cX6hNniMAMXEK.html

15-04-2020||Delhi||Flyers hoping to get back home after first lockdown, continue to remain stranded||Aarti Sabharwal, who works at a multinational company in Gurugram, had to catch a flight to Jabalpur from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Wednesday morning to go see her family. As the first phase of lockdown was ending on April 14, she had booked her flight a day later, unaware that the suspension of flights would also be extended up to May 3. Her wait to meet her family seems to be longer than she expected. Sabharwal is stranded in Gurugram, away from her family in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, since March 25, the day 21-day-long lockdown began. “After waiting for 21 days, we booked our tickets with SpiceJet. If there was no clarity on the extension of the lockdown or on whether the flights would be allowed to operate even after April 14, the airlines shouldn’t have accepted bookings at all. Not just this, but even after the lockdown extension was announced, until late Tuesday night, we could see the flight status scheduled, not cancelled. We tried calling the airline repeatedly, but there was no response,” she said.Sabharwal said there was no clarity over the refund of money. “The tickets were more expensive than usual and we have got no response from the airline on the refund. The portal through which we had booked the tickets is still awaiting a response from the airline,” she said.SpiceJet said in a statement in Tuesday that given the extended lockdown “we are cancelling the reservations of those who booked themselves for travel till May 3. Upon cancellation, your entire amount will be maintained in a credit shell and the same may be used to make fresh bookings till February 28, 2021, for the same passenger.”However, Sabharwal isn’t alone. Neha Mahto, who lives in Noida, and had gone to Kolkata to attend a family function, has been stranded there since March 23. “My return tickets with Air India are scheduled for April 19. I didn’t cancel them because there was no clarity whether flights will operate or not, after April,” Mahto, who works as a process coordinator at a private firm in Noida, said.She further said that she had contacted the Air India customer helpline which informed her that the booking amount would be reserved against her ticket and could be adjusted against her future bookings after May 3, valid till September. “However, what bothers me is the fact that now we would have to pay the balance amount against the new bookings; there is no waiver for cancellation and all charges would be levied. In the current circumstances, our money is being toyed with. We cannot ask for cancellation, as there is no waiver as well as balance charges are to be paid for new bookings,” she said.The airlines also took to Twitter to update their flyers about the current situation. In one such tweet, Air India said currently all flight operations are suspended. “We will definitely provide help as and when flight operations resume. Will keep posted with latest updates,” the airline tweeted.Like Sabharwal and Mahto, Abhay Mishra, 30, who had come to Delhi from Ranchi, on March 24, said he had first booked a return ticket on April 2, which he changed to April 17 after the lockdown was announced. But Mishra is now struggling to get his refund. “Now that all flights have been cancelled, airlines must return money to their customers. What most airlines are doing is they are keeping our money reserved in e-wallets and will allow us to later book tickets using the same money. But it is expected that once the lockdown is lifted, air tickets will get expensive. The money we used today might not suffice for ticket prices after 15 days. The airlines must return the money now,” Mishra, who works at a PSU in Ranchi, said.While GoAir also said that it is extending the ‘Protect Your PNR’ scheme till May 3, wherein customers are eligible to reschedule their flight for the next year, i.e., until May 3, 2021, none of the four major airlines—SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir or Air India—could give the number of bookings they had to cancel between April 15 and May 3, because of the lockdown extension.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of the lockdown on Tuesday, the ministry of civil aviation also tweeted, “All domestic and international scheduled Airlines operations shall remain suspended till 11.59 pm of 3rd May 2020 [sic].”To inform their travellers, the Delhi airport also took to social media and requested passengers to get in touch with their respective airlines for further information on flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/flyers-hoping-to-get-back-home-after-first-lockdown-continue-to-remain-stranded/story-lhgCb4YJh152qw0xbiEI5M.html

Mumbai has so far reported 1822 of the 2801 cases. Thane had three, Mira Bhayandar two and Vasai Virar and Pimpri Chinchwad one each, officials said.The death toll remained at 178.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMore than 600 cases of the coronavirus disease have been reported from Mumbai in the last four days between April 11 and April 14. This means around 34% were reported only between Saturday and Tuesday. At least 150 cases are being reported daily in Mumbai on average.Maharashtra’s Medical Education and Drugs department has said 79% of the people who died of Covid-19 had co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, or blood pressure. The report was based on Tuesday morning’s data from the health department.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakAccording to the data, 120 of the 152 who died had co-morbidities, while 32 didn’t have such existing conditions. However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had reported on Monday that 87% of Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai were due to co-morbidity and 7-8% had age-related risk factors.According to data for Mumbai as on April 9, the maximum deaths were recorded in the 61-70 age group (22), followed by 51-60 age group (11), 71-80 age group (8), then 41-50 years (6).According to experts, the main reasons for deaths in Covid-19 patients who don’t have co-morbidities are late diagnosis, low immunity and age-related issues linked to immunity. It also depends on the health of a person’s lungs, they added.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing at an alarming rise but there is no need to panic.“Maharashtra rate is high in the country, but it is also because of the highest number of tests we have been performing,” he said.“I have spoken to the mother of a six-month-old kid who has recovered from the infection and an 83-year old woman who recovered from it. This means with courage and patience the war against the coronavirus could be conquered,” the Shiv Sena chief added.The state government has sought permission from the Centre to start clinical trials of plasma therapy and BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine, given to newborns and children to prevent childhood tuberculosis, for treatment of Covid-19 patients.“I am sure the state will get breakthrough after getting permission for conducting the studies,” Thackeray had said in his address to the state on Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/117-new-covid-19-cases-take-maharashtra-tally-to-2801/story-mr2YjZ5ea5TAYX3IX302DP.html

15-04-2020||City||Precautions in place, Punjab begins exercise to procure 130 lakh tonnes wheat||Punjab on Wednesday started the massive two-month exercise to procure 130 lakh tonnes of wheat, in what can be termed as Asia’s biggest-ever commodity purchase.In view of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Punjab Mandi Board is ensuring disinfection of grain markets and yards, while labourers, farmers and staff of procurement agencies have been asked to wear masks and wash their hands frequently. Commission agents are using sanitisers and have made arrangements for drinking water and rest rooms for labourers. To limit crowding and ensure social distancing, the government is inviting a limited number of farmers through coupons, with permission to sell up to 50 quintals of wheat at their closest grain market.The coupons will act as a curfew pass for unhindered movement of the farmers’ loaded tractor-trolleys. In the wake of curfew restrictions, the state government has also increased the grain markets from 1,800 to nearly 4,000.On the first day, only 6,290 coupons were issued in the entire state. With the process of issuing coupons still picking up pace, several sellers across the state complained that they could not reach the grain markets. The government plans to issue 27 lakh coupons in a staggered manner till May 31, following which it will begin the process of shifting the procured crop to warehouses.₹19.25 FOR A KG OF WHEATPunjab, which contributes nearly 35% wheat to the national kitty, is buying the wheat for the central food agency — Food Corporation of India, which will further distribute it among different states for subsidised food under the public distribution system.The Government of India has fixed ₹1925 per quintal as minimum support price of wheat.The state government has asked the procurement agencies to ensure payment to farmers within 48 hours of procurement of their crop.“I harvested my crop last week and stocked it in my house. Now, I am here to sell the wheat using the coupon issued by my commission agent. Like other citizens, farmers are also cautious and are ensuring social distancing in the market,” said Gurmukh Singh, a farmer at a market in Rajpura.Another farmer Angrej Singh said as there were limited farmers present, he will be free by the evening. “After selling wheat, I will use my tractor to make straw husk, a dry fodder for animals, to make more money,” he added.The sold crop will be managed by the commission agents, who will handle the unloading, cleaning, packaging in sacks of 50kg and 30kg and then issuing the J-Form (crop sale form) to the farmers.“One Day 1, we have issued 6,290 coupons, followed by 17,995 coupons for Thursday and 41,337 coupons for Friday. The number of coupons will go up to 70,000 per day, depending on space in the markets and pace of harvest arrival. Punjab is committed to purchasing every single grain of harvest. We will complete it by May 31,” said KS Pannu, secretary, agriculture. While usually the process of procurement begins on April 1 and ends by first week of May, this time around, it was not only delayed by a fortnight, but will be staggered and conclude by the end of May. COUPON LIMIT HAS FARMERS WORRIED As the crop has ripened due to delayed procurement, farmers with big landholdings are a worried lot. “Each coupon allows sale of 50 quintals, which is yield of 2.5 acres. How will a farmer with bigger landholdings sell his produce? Worse, the commission agent are issuing only one coupon per farmer,” said Jagmohan Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union. SCREENING FOR MOISTURE To ensure that only crop, which meets FCI specification, reaches the grain markets, the procurement agency staff are measuring the moisture content and returning consignments with higher moisture. “We have limited space.

15-04-2020||Patna||A group that arranges for last rites amid lockdown||Arranging a funeral has become difficult for many families losing their loved ones amid the lockdown since lockdown rules specify that attendence at funerals be low, which is also convincing people to get help from a group of activists that help the bereaved families conduct the rituals. They have to hire people to help them in preparing for the last rites and for other arrangements at the cremation site, Gulabi Ghaat in Ranchi, said Jaiprakash, one of the group members. "Even close relatives fail to turn up, partly due to the lockdown restrictions, and partly because of the fear of infection. Some families even prefer to register their presence in the rituals online,” he said.A person hired for the job is paid roughly Rs 300 for a duration of three to four hours. Those who are out of work due to the lockdown readily agree to do the job to earn some money, he said. “Since the lockdown came into effect, we have handled 16 such cases. It’s a home-to-Ghaat service. We not only provide the manual labour but also a vehicle to carry the body in to the cremation site. We have a fixed rate of materials required for the rituals, and have directed the sellers to charge Rs 6,000 for the entire package from middle-income family groups. Poor families can get the same service for Rs 2,000. However, if a family cannot afford that, we bear the entire cost,” Jaiprakash said.Manish Kumar, another social worker in the group, said that even close relatives do not turn up at funerals, fearing risk of infection. “We were shocked when someone contacted us for the first time for this service, on March 25. We received a call from Govind Mitra Road in the city. It was more surprising since the family was quite affluent and had sufficient resources. We arranged ambulance service and collected things from the Ghaat for them,” said Sushil, another member of the group.“That day we decided to help all such families for cremation during the lockdown,” he added.In many cases, families prefer electric cremation because of the crisis. The facility is available at Baans Ghaat in the city, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/a-group-that-arranges-for-last-rites-amid-lockdown/story-GvuJIqiZ1LtmaqCP3VSqpO.html

15-04-2020||Patna||Bihar plans mega screening for Covid-19||In a first, Bihar will launch from Thursday a mammoth eight-day active screening, covering all households in the four endemic districts of Siwan, Begusarai, Nawada and Nalanda, in its efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) to newer areas.These districts account for over 65% of the 66 cases of the virus in the state till Tuesday, after two cases were reported in the past 24 hours. It will also launch door-to-door screening in nearly 8,000 villages, having any person with international travel history last month. The robust screening in villages would cover nearly 17% of the total households in the state, said officials.During the exercise, people found with Covid-19 symptoms would be identified and their samples would be taken for further confirmatory tests.“We believe that those who returned from foreign countries are a potential source of spreading the virus. As such, we have decided to screen every house in the village, having an international traveller who returned in March, to check any missing case in the community that may have escaped detection,” said Deepak Kumar, Bihar’s chief secretary.“We believe Bihar is the first state to launch an intensive active screening programme on this scale,” he said.The state government would also launch an intensive door-to-door screening within three kilometre radius of the dwelling having an infected person, said health officials. “The state government also decided to tap retail drug stores, formal and informal service providers, including MBBS doctors, Ayurveda, Unani and homeopathy practitioners and quacks to collate data on people with influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) who had consulted them,” said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health.Baring the state government’s plans to check the spread of the virus, Kumar said the door-to-door screening in the affected districts and villages would be akin to the pulse polio drive.“We will deploy 50,000 teams, each comprising two members, to visit every household in the affected districts and villages. The survey team will carry a questionnaire and ask people about their travel history and screen people for symptoms of the virus like dry cough, fever or breathlessness, with special emphasis on households having senior citizens above 60 years of age,” said Kumar.The team would re-visit every household after five days to check for Covid-19 symptoms, he said.While screening households in the four districts, the government had also decided to screen dwelling in blocks, which were in adjacent districts. Say for example, while undertaking the exercise in Siwan, the authorities would also screen households in blocks of adjoining districts like Gopalganj and Saran. Similarly, while undertaking the screening drive in Begusarai, the authorities would also screen households in adjoining blocks under Samastipur and Khagaria districts, he added.“We hope to establish infection trail in every case during the entire exercise, which will be completed by April 24,” signed off Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-plans-mega-screening-for-covid-19/story-LuDvw8KSVI8kfvH27gh7eL.html
15-04-2020||Bhopal||All 5 who died of Covid-19 in Bhopal were gas tragedy victims||All five persons who died due to coronavirus in Bhopal were victims of the 1984 gas tragedy in the Madhya Pradesh capital, an official said on Wednesday. On March 21, some organisations working for the survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy wrote to the authorities concerned, saying such people were more vulnerable to the coronavirus infection than normal individuals.“All the five persons who died after contracting Covid-19 here were victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy,” the official said.The Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Center (BMHRC), a dedicated facility for the treatment of gas mishap survivors, was recently turned into a medical facility for coronavirus patients, causing hardship to these people, Rachna Dhingra, member of the NGO Bhopal Group for Information and Action, told PTI.The first coronavirus victim from Bhopal, a 55-year- old man, died at a city hospital on April 5 due to negligence of authorities, she alleged.Another 80-year-old gas tragedy victim, who was a retired employee of the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), was also not given due medical care. He died on April 8 and his sample came out positive for coronavirus on April 11, Dhingra said. Besides, a 40-year-old gas tragedy victim, who was suffering from oral cancer for more than a year, died on April 12 and his sample test report later came out positive for coronavirus, she said.Another 52-year-old gas mishap survivor, who suffered from a permanent injury, had history of tuberculosis and could not get prompt care for his respiratory problems.He recently tested positive for coronavirus and died on his way to the Covid-19 ward at Hamidia hospital, she said.Also, a 75-year-old senior journalist, who survived the gas tragedy, died on April 11 and his sample test report came out positive for coronairus on Tuesday, she said.On March 21, some organisations working for the welfare of gas tragedy survivors wrote to the state and central authorities concerned, saying an overwhelming number of gas victims suffer from respiratory, cardiovascular, kidney problems and cancer as a result of exposure to the toxic gas that leaked at the Union Carbide factory here in 1984.They claimed that these survivors were at least five times more vulnerable to Covid-19 than other people.Instead of paying special attention to the needs of Bhopal gas victims, the state government took over BMHRCand turned it into a medical facility for Covid-19 patients, Dhingra said.For last 22 days, no gas victim was even allowed to avail emergency services there, she said.Dhingra said before BMHRC was converted into a dedicated facility for coronavirus patients, 86 gas tragedy survivors were admitted there.After it was made a hospital for Covid-19 patients, all except five were discharged. Out of these five, a 68- year-old woman died at the hospital due to ailments related to the gas mishap, she said.Besides, out of the gas tragedy survivors discharged from BMHRC, two persons, both aged around 70, died at their homes while another one died at a city hospital due to the gas leak mishap related illnesses, she said.In a letter to gas relief hospital’s monitoring committee chairman, retd Justice V K Agrawal, the NGOs pointed out all these aspects and urged him to re-start the medical facility for gas victims considering their vulnerability.The NGOs have also filed a writ petition in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, demanding that gas victims be provided a dedicated medical facility for their treatment, as was the practice earlier.Meanwhile, taking note of the death of five gas tragedy victims due to coronavirus, the state government has decided to categorise BMHRC as a ‘COVID Health Centre’ where gas mishap survivors can continue to avail treatment for their ailments.An order to this effect was issued late Tuesday evening, a health department official said.“Now, gas victims can continue to get treatment as usual in BMHRC, he said.Bhopal Divisional Commissioner Kalpana Shrivastava said the earlier decision to make BMHRC a dedicated facility for Covid-19 patients was taken at the “government level”.Dhingra said the Out Patient Departments (OPDs) in other government hospitals of Bhopal continue to remain open for gas incident survivors.Arif Aqueel, the former state minister of Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department, said the earlier decision to close BMHRC for gas victims was not in the interest of these people, and they should be given treatment at this facility on priority, especially in the OPD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/all-5-who-died-of-covid-19-in-bhopal-were-gas-tragedy-victims/story-hLqYJse99gLnkxwxe8QwWO.html

Farmers’ union leader Balbir Singh Takhan, who visited Bhiwani’s Behal Mandi, said, “Many farmers failed to turn up as they did not receive the government’s message asking them to bring their produce to the mandis.”A farmer, Ram Chander of Dadri’s Ranila village, said he had brought 40 quintals of mustard to the grain market but was still waiting to sell it. He, however, appreciated the government and arhtiyas’ efforts to procure grain amid the Covid-19 outbreak. “Hafed and marketing officials have assured us that they will start procurement process by tomorrow,” Takhan said.Sushil Kumar, a commission agent from Bhiwani’s Behal, said, “We refused to buy mustard as the government is not making us handling agent on paper.” Village heads purchase mustard at rural centresAfter arthtiyas refused to purchase mustard at few rural purchase centres, Bhiwani administration authorised four village heads to buy the farmers’ produce. When this HT correspondent visited Mitthi, Sidhanwa, Paju and Kurl villages, he found that the centres there lacked basic amenities. However, farmers and village heads had put their best efforts and initiated procurement process. The sarpanches claimed that they were facing issue of weak internet connection, but farmers were cooperating with them. Amit Sangwan, a farmer from Bhiwani’s Mitthi village, said he had brought 40 quintals of mustard to the mandi and local sarpanch procured his produce at ₹4,425.Hariyawas sarpanch and Sidhanwa procurement centre in-charge Sunil Sheoran said, “We bought mustard from 10 farmers in two shifts. We will put all our efforts to purchase farmers’ produce even with limited resources. The farmers covered their faces and maintained social distancing at mandi,” he added.Bhiwani DC Ajay Kumar said they had started the procurement process at 24 out of 32 centres.“50 farmers will be allowed to sell their crop at the bigger grain markets and 10 at the rural centres. There were few concerns of commission agents in Behal, Digawa and Loharu grain markets, which were later resolved. Four village panchayats initiated procurement process in the district today for the first time in the history of Haryana after arhitiyas refused to purchase from these centres. We will start procurement at the remaining eight centres in a couple of days,” he added. Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry said farmers at few centres in her constituency were not issued gate passes.“If there weren’t any arrangements at purchasing centres, why were the farmers even called there? I want to ask agriculture minister why did he reduce the number of mandis in the district during the last stage?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/poor-turnout-on-first-day-of-mustard-procurement-in-haryana/story-whgNrMiGQPU0WpPLdBxzJN.html

They will carry out further investigation; we can’t reveal anything,” said Yogesh Gawde, senior inspector at Rabale police station.Also read: Social distancing goes for toss in Bandra, ‘homesick’ migrants protestWho said what?Labourers“I am from Malda in West Bengal. We heard the government was running a special train from Mumbai. So we packed our luggage to leave the city as we have lost our jobs,” Farooq Shaikh, a daily-wage worker who stays at Behrampada in Bandra (East), said.“We are out of food and now the lockdown has been extended. How will we survive here in Mumbai? We came to know about a special train running for migrants, so we gathered,” Zahid Mistri, also from Malda and who lives in Bandra, said.Also read: What you need to know today“We have spent our savings during the first phase of the lockdown.

The government should start trains to shift us from here to our native place,” Abdul Kayyun, another labourer, said. Police and railways officialsVijayalaxmi Hiremath, the senior police inspector at Bandra police station, said they received information about people gathered outside Bandra railway station around 3.30pm. A team of police officers rushed to the spot and found close to a 1000 people there.Additional reinforcement was called from the reserved police force zonal office and from the neighbouring police stations of Khar and Santacruz.

They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home.” Aaditya Thackeray tweeted.He also reiterated the state government’s demand to operate trains for 24 hours for migrant labourers.“Right from the day the trains have been shut down, the State had requested trains to run for 24 hours more so that migrant labour could go back home. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray raised this issue in the PM- CM video conference as well requesting a roadmap for migrant labour to reach home,” he said.After Aaditya Thackeray’s outburst, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) state unit called the incident a failure of the state.Ex-MP Kirit Somaiya asked the Uddhav Thackeray government to explain how a thousand people gathered at Bandra(West) near the station despite prohibitory orders. Somaiya asked the chief minister to explain what the intelligence agencies were doing and how a large number of people could gather when the police did not allow more than four people in one place.“How and why today?” he asked.Devendra Fadnavis, the former chief minister and leader of Opposition in Maharashtra, said the incident that happened in Bandra was serious and that the state government failed to adequate arrangements for the labourers.“Migrants coming out and demanding food or allowing them to leave for their home state is a failure of the government. It is surprising, that instead of helping the people, ministers are blaming the Central government in an attempt to hide their failure. It is shameful that the government is playing politics at such a time. I urge the state government to hear the people on how they want the ration and food,” he said.Aaditya Thackeray later tweeted saying the Centre and states are facing a Catch-22 situation.“The centre has taken immediate cognizance of the issue and is assisting the State actively. We understand the catch 22 situation centre and states face. I’m thankful to PM & HM for understanding the situation, while trying to ensure the safety of home states of migrants,” he tweeted.“The migrant labour issue persists everywhere. Even as we house more than 6 lakh migrant labour, with breakfast lunch and dinner, the Union and State Govts are coordinating on further relief for the same. We will continue to ensure the comfort of all migrant labour in our camps,” he said in another tweet.Phone call and Uddhav Thackeray’s Facebook addressUnion home minister Amit Shah spoke to Uddhav Thackeray soon after the incident. Shah said that events such as the protest weaken India’s fight against coronavirus disease and the administration needs to stay vigilant to avoid such incidents, according to ANI.He also offered his full support to the Maharashtra government, according to news agency ANI.In a live webcast later in the night, Uddhav Thackeray assured migrant workers that they were not in a lockup and were safe. They should, therefore, maintain discipline for the next two weeks after which arrangements will be made to have them sent home.The chief minister said someone must have “misled” them that trains are starting from today, as a result, they have gathered there. “We have many people who could do this. Do not try to play with their emotions and create a law-and-order situation in the state. I will take strict action against such people. I also ask people not to politicise the issue. This is the time to remain united and fight the pandemic,” the chief minister said.Thackeray also spoke in Hindi during his address.“Why are you worried? You are with us, staying in my state. You will be safe here. There is nothing to worry about. We are not feeling happy to lock you like this. We have to face the challenge unitedly. The day lockdown will be relaxed, you will be allowed to go to your homes. I’m in contact with the central government regularly,” he said.He also said that the state has made arrangements of food and stay of around six lakh migrant workers, along with medical facilities. The state also increased the scope of Shiv Bhojan thali, subsidised meal scheme, to 80,000 per day.What now?Maharashtra’s home minister Anil Deshmukh has directed the police to investigate who spread the rumours about the train and take stern action against those found guilty.Railway authorities also stated that there were rumours on the commencement of train services, however, a notification was issued on the extension of the cancellation of train services.“It is clarified that all passenger train services on Indian Railways, including premium trains, mail/express trains, passenger trains, suburban (local) trains, shall continue to remain cancelled till 12am, May 3, as per guidelines of the Government of India,” the Western Railway said in a statement.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-update-from-lathicharge-to-probe-what-happened-in-mumbai-s-bandra/story-23e56DeUTVBFBbKUdOUbwN.html
15-04-2020||Kolkata||‘My nephew and I never had any symptoms’: Bengal Covid-19 patient in hospital since April 1||A 49-year-old Covid-19 patient, who is in hospital since testing positive on April 1, said he and his nephew never had any symptoms of getting infected by coronavirus.His elder brother, a 59-year-old who too was tested positive, died in a private hospital on April 5. His 21-year-old nephew was released a couple of days ago.Sudip Chatterjee, a resident of Sheorafully in Hooghly district, is under treatment at the Infectious Diseases Hospital at Beleghata area in north Kolkata, the state’s nodal hospital for Covid-19.“My brother had preexisting ailments. He suffered from bronchial problem and hypertension. But I and my nephew never showed any symptom, even though we two tested positive along with my brother,” said Chatterjee.Chatterjee, who is a marketing executive, said he was under nominal medication at the hospital.“I have no symptoms of illness – neither fever nor sneezing and cough. I am on nominal medication. I wonder why my swab samples tested positive yet again,” he said.Overall, 17 people, including the family of their car’s driver and domestic help, have been quarantined for coming in contact with Chatterjee, his brother and nephew. According to him, the source of his brother’s infection remained untraced.“My brother went to Durgapur in train. He might have contracted it during the train journey,” he said.Chatterjee said that a good number of the patients at the infectious diseases hospital have shown mild symptoms and are at no risk. Spending time in ‘virtual confinement’ was the only problem he suffered from. He spent his time using his phone, talking to friends and family members and browsing the internet.He is also thankful to the doctors and nursing staff who, he said, “gave excellent support to sail through the difficult times.”“My realisation is that only those with a weak immune system, especially the elderly ones and those with pre-existing diseases, are getting affected by this virus. There is no need to panic but we must maintain social distancing to prevent crowding in the hospitals,” Chatterjee said.Sixteen patients from this hospital have been released so far after testing negative twice.“There are several patients with nominal symptoms but there is no question of taking any case lightly, as their condition may suddenly deteriorate,” a senior doctor at the hospital said.“Even on Monday night, one patient died at our hospital after his condition deteriorated. Moreover, anyone testing positive, irrespective of showing symptoms or not, is a carrier,” the doctor added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/my-nephew-and-i-never-had-any-symptoms-bengal-covid-19-patient-in-hospital-since-april-1/story-Ui2q438jPFAKwLvyrB0tII.html

The migrant labourers alleged that the food provided to them is so bad that even the animals will not eat it. Rajni, a native of Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi said that they were receiving substandard quality food and milk. “The meals are never served on time. The quality of the food is substandard. Many pregnant women are also staying with us. If the administration cannot provide adequate facilities to us, they should make arrangements to send us back home,” she said. A group of women, who were accompanying Rajni complained that they were getting semi-cooked rotis, rice and vegetables.“The administration should allow us to leave this shelter home so that we can go back to our village,” the women added.The women further claimed that they do not have money left.“If not coronavirus, hunger will kill our families. The government is least concerned about us,” the labourers added.Jhajjar DSP Shamsher Singh reached the shelter home and assured the labourers of good quality food.“We have asked the authorities to provide good quality food and milk to labourers, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-workers-complain-about-bad-quality-food-served-at-jhajjar-shelter-home/story-AYMVMjtyurgiEGK8klwToO.html

15-04-2020||Mumbai||Man donates blood for plasma therapy study on Covid-19||A man in his 20s, who recovered from Covid-19 more than three weeks ago, on Monday became the first from Maharashtra to donate blood for a study on the use of convalescent plasma therapy to treat the disease. Wit-hin three weeks of recovery, a patient develops antibodies that can neutralise the virus. The therapy involves transfusing plasma — a component of the blood — from a recovered patient into a patient fighting the infection, to act as reinforcement for the latter’s immune system. Kerala was the first state to start the convalescent plasma therapy with approval from the ICMR. Following in their footsteps, the blood samples were taken at BYL Nair Hospital and the therapy will be carried out at Kasturba Hospital. “On Monday, we took the sample of the first donor who has fully recovered from the infection. Now, it will be sent to Kasturba Hospital, which will decide on the transfusion,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair hospital. Five other recovered patients, too, have agreed to donate blood for the study. “It is an experiment. Other important factors are the amount of antibodies produced in the body of a cured patient and the extent of extraction possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-donates-blood-for-plasma-therapy-study-on-covid-19/story-4rtc6nZpgXK7EAPNRX2BtN.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Kandivli, Sewri housing societies form ‘anti-corona teams’||Two housing complexes, in Kandivli and Sewri, have setup anti-corona teams comprising residents, to help citizens in combating daily issues during the Covid-19 lockdown.The 15-storeyed Kamla Ashish housing complex in Kandivli with 250 residents has a core team of five members that have prepared a checklist of daily activities, a register noting in and out time for citizens, and issue passes for one person per family to go out for essentials. Without the pass, residents cannot exit the society premises. The team uses closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras round the clock to monitor those entering and exiting in shifts.“We must follow rules of quarantine strictly. For this, we have constituted the task force to help others as well as ensure all our guidelines are followed,” said Amit Kotak, treasurer. “These five residents also cater to all requirements for senior citizens to ensure they do not step out.”Other responsibilities include monitoring daily cleaning activities, refilling sanitisers at common areas, and replacing toothpicks being used to operate lift buttons. “A grill outside the lift is locked everyday post 8pm and opened only in case of medical emergencies. This team further makes daily announcements about safety guidelines,” said Kunal Ajmera, committee member.Meanwhile, more than 200 residents at Sewri’s Ashok Gardens have taken up different daily activities to ensure the society, comprising 522 flats and 2,000 residents, functions smoothly during the lockdown. While 55 people are holding guard as security, 30 residents are in-charge of housekeeping, 40 fulfil requirements for home-alone senior citizens, 10 cater to gardening and waste management, seven in-charge of electricity, 10 resident doctors look into queries and medical concerns, 25 residents supply essentials to quarantined families, 10 citizens communicate with the civic body for daily updates and important information, five are in-charge of the sewage treatment plant and 30 help the in-house grocery and vegetable store.“We had 185 staff members, who live close to the complex, sub-contracted for us for most of these activities (that the anti-corona team has taken up) before the lockdown,” said Capt Prakash Correa, secretary of the society. “A few days into the lockdown, we minimised the number of workers to 25, who were provided temporary residential and food facilities within the complex. The idea was to not have any interface with the outside world. To compensate for lesser staff, over 200 residents volunteered and were given the option of which verticals they would like to choose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kandivli-sewri-societies-form-anti-corona-teams/story-yApyTUYM9qXzxqogr9C6EN.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Special train rumours bring migrants on street in Bandra||Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the coronavirus-enforced nationwide lockdown to May 3, close to a 1,000 migrant workers gathered outside Bandra railway station, after they heard rumours that the government was running a special train for migrants to return home. The situation eventually forced the Mumbai Police to resort to lathi-charge to disperse the migrants — most of them from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal — who were demanding the state help them return home. A police officer said the migrants, who assembled around 3pm, were dispersed two hours later.The incident snowballed into a political blame game between the ruling and opposition parties in Maharashtra as tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray took aim at the Union government for “failing to take a call on arranging a way back for these migrant workers”, while the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit called the incident a failure of the state. Home minister Anil Deshmukh, meanwhile, directed the police to investigate who spread the rumours about the train and take stern action against those found guilty. While the Bandra police filed an FIR against 700 unidentified persons, the Navi Mumbai police detained an Airoli resident for allegedly uploading a video on social media which officers said may have helped spread the rumours. “The man has been handed over to Bandra police. They will carry out further investigation; we can’t reveal anything,” said Yogesh Gawde, senior inspector at Rabale police station. Tuesday’s scenes were a replay of the events in Delhi last month. Daily wage workers have been rendered jobless ever since the lockdown was announced late last month to stem the spread of coronavirus, making their life a struggle. Despite authorities and NGOs making arrangements for their food, most of them want to go back to their home to escape the hardships brought by the curbs.Vijayalaxmi Hiremath, senior police inspector at Bandra police station, said, “We received information about people having gathered outside Bandra railway station around 3.30pm. A team of police officers rushed to the spot and found close to a 1,000 people gathered there.” Additional reinforcement was called from the reserved police force zonal office and from the neighbouring police stations of Khar and Santacruz. “We tried to make them understand, and asked them to return to their houses, but the crowd was not in a mood to listen,” said Hiremath.“The workers were protesting against extension of the lockdown, saying they do not have access to food and other essentials,” said a western railway (WR) official, who did not want to be named.The Bandra police, in co-ordination with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), also arranged for a truckload of essential commodities for the people who had gathered there. But they refused to accept it, and started heckling the police personnel on duty.“There are around 10 CCTV cameras in the area and we have footage from a drone, which will help us identify the people who were part of the crowd,” said Hiremath.Farooq Shaikh, a daily-wage worker who stays at Behrampada in Bandra (East), said, “I am from Malda in West Bengal. We heard the government was running a special train from Mumbai. So we packed our luggage to leave the city as we have lost our jobs.”Zahid Mistri, also from Malda and who lives in Bandra, said, “We are out of food and now the lockdown has been extended. How will we survive here in Mumbai? We came to know about a special train running for migrants, so we gathered.” Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone 9, said, “We have registered an offence.”Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who addressed the state via Facebook Live, said no one should politicise the issue of migrants and asked labourers’ cooperation to fight the current situation. Thackeray also warned people against misleading them and disturbing the law-and-order situation.He urged the migrant workers not to worry and stay in the state until lockdown continues. He said that they are safe in Maharashtra and will be allowed to go to their native places the day the lockdown is over.The chief minister said someone must have “misled” them that trains are starting from today, as a result, they have gathered there. “We have many people who could do this. Do not try to play with their emotions and create law-and-order situation in the state. I will take strict action against such people. I also ask people not to politicise the issue. This is the time to remain united and fight the pandemic,” the chief minister said.Thackeray switched to Hindi during his address and told the migrants, “Why are you worried? You are with us, staying in my state. You will be safe here. There is nothing to worry about. We are not feeling happy to lock you like this. We have to face the challenge unitedly. The day lockdown will be relaxed, you will be allowed to go to your homes. I’m in contact with the Central government regularly.” He also said that the state has made arrangements of food and stay of around six lakh migrant workers, along with medical facilities. The state also increased the scope of Shiv Bhojan thali, subsidised meal scheme, to 80,000 per day.Devendra Fadnavis, former chief minister and leader of Opposition in Maharashtra, said the incident highlighted the failure of the state government. “The incident that happened in Bandra is serious. We have been telling the state government from day one to arrange for essential rations for migrants, who do not have ration cards. But the state government has failed to do so. Migrants coming out and demanding food or allowing them to leave for their home state is a failure of the government. It is surprising, that instead of helping the people, ministers are blaming the Central government in an attempt to hide their failure. It is shameful that the government is playing politics at such a time. I urge the state government to hear the people on how they want the ration and food,” he said.Railway authorities also stated that there were rumours on the commencement of train services, however, a notification was issued on the extension of the cancellation of train services. “It is clarified that all passenger train services on Indian Railways, including premium trains, mail/express trains, passenger trains, suburban (local) trains, shall continue to remain cancelled till 12am, May 3, as per guidelines of the Government of India,” said a statement from the Western railway.Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray took to social media to announce that the crowd had been dispersed but also took a swipe at the Central government.Thackeray said the migrant workers wanted to go back to their hometowns and many were refusing to eat and stay in labour camps.“The current situation at Bandra Station, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the Union Government not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home for migrant labour. They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home.” tweeted Aaditya Thackeray.Thackeray also reiterated the state government’s demand to operate trains for 24 hours for migrant labourers.“Right from the day the trains have been shut down, the State had requested trains to run for 24 hours more so that migrant labour could go back home. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray raised this issue in the PM- CM video conference as well requesting a roadmap for migrant labour to reach home,” he said.The FIR against around 700 people has been registered at Bandra police station, under sections 143 (punishment— whoever is a member of an unlawful assembly), 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly, guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) , 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the India Penal Code (IPC) and section 3 of the epidemic diseases act 1897.Meanwhile, more than 100 migrant labourers came out on the streets in Mumbra on Tuesday, demanding they be sent to their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. After the lockdown was extended, they panicked. They came out in droves from their homes and blocked the roads near Rashid Compound at Mumbra around 1.30pm.Mumbra police and State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) personnel reached the spot and stopped them from agitating. They started announcing over megaphones to disperse, saying the government will continue to give them food and shelter. It took around 20 minutes for the police to remove them from the streets.Deputy commissioner of police, S Burse, said, “Around 120 people came to the streets and started demanding transport to return to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Most of them stay in Mumbra on rent. We assured them that all their basic needs would be met.” In Kalyan, police saw a crowd of people near Kalyan station area. They were waiting for an ST bus. The cops told them to go home and they immediately dispersed.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/special-train-rumours-bring-migrants-on-street-in-bandra/story-xhbHoTx0rXqLnDuDu7M3GL.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s case count rises to 2,684; toll 178||Three hundred and fifty more people across Maharashtra tested positive for the coronavirus and 18 died of it on Tuesday, taking the state’s case count and toll to 2,684 and 178. For a second consecutive day, the state reported 350 or more cases, including 216 in Mumbai alone. The financial capital also reported 11 deaths.With the number of coronavirus cases rising rapidly, the Maharashtra government has sought permission from the Central government for starting clinical trials of plasma therapy and BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine — given to newborns and children to prevent childhood tuberculosis —for treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday. Thackeray, who had reviewed the situation in the districts with no or comparatively fewer coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients on Monday, so as to decide on beginning industrial operations in these areas, said the decision about relaxing curbs will be taken on April 20. He, however, announced a committee of scientists and financial experts, including Raghunath Mashelar, Deepak Parikh and Ajit Ranade, to suggest steps to be taken for the revival of the state economy. The state government has already appointed two separate committees of ministers and bureaucrats for deliberation on revival of the state economy. The government has reportedly deferred its plan to allow industrial operations in some of the districts after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday morning that the decision about relaxation will be taken after reviewing the situation for the next week, until April 20.Of the 18 people who died on Tuesday, 11 are from Mumbai, four from Pune and one each from Aurangabad and Ahmednagar. One victim was from outside the state.Eleven of the victims were in the age group of 40 to 60 years, while five were above 60 years of age and two were less than 40 years. Thirteen of the 18 had underlying ailments like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma and heart ailments. One of them was suffering from cancer, while one was suffering from tuberculosis, the statement issued by the health department has stated.The state government has performed 46,588 tests till Tuesday. A total of 5,059 teams formed to monitor people suspected of contact history with infected patients and in the containment zones, have so far screened 18.37 lakh people for symptoms of the virus. At present, 67,701 citizens are under home quarantine, while 5,647 are in institutional quarantine. 259 positive patients have so far been discharged after they recovered from the infection.The authorities have traced most of the 1,400 attendees of the Tablighi Markaz event at Nizamuddin in Delhi last month. 755 of them have undergone tests and 50 have tested positive. Seven of them are from Latur, seven in Yavatmal, six in Buldhana, 14 in Mumbai, and two each in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nagpur and Ahmednagar. One each from Ratnagiri, Nagpur, Hingoli, Jalgaon, Osmanabad, Kolhapur and Washim have tested positive. Seven people, who had come in close contacts with these attendees, have tested positive.The state has witnessed a rise of 1,666 patients and 114 deaths in eight days (April 8 to 14). “Last two days have seen more than 350 patients testing positive, from the average of little more than 200 patients for four days before it. We expect the trend to continue for a few more days before the downward trend begins,” said a senior official from the health department.Thackeray said that it is an alarming rise, but there is no need to panic. “Maharashtra rate is high in the country, but it is also because of the highest number of tests we have been performing. I have spoken to the mother of a six-month-old kid who has recovered from the infection and an 83-year old woman who recovered from it. This means with courage and patience the war against the coronavirus could be conquered,” he said.“We have sought permission from the Centre for starting clinical trial of plasma therapy and BCG vaccine for treatment of Covid-19 in the state. I am sure the state will get breakthrough after getting permission for conducting the studies,” Thackeray said, in his address to the state through Facebook Live.Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, state medical education department, said they required permission for starting clinical trials from various agencies of the Centre, which includes Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Central Drugs Safety Organisation (CDSO), Drug Controller General of India, among other. For both studies, BCG vaccine and plasma treatment, permission has been sought.“Haffkine Institute has conducted a study on BCG vaccine as treatment of coronavirus and has got encouraging results. But we have to follow a protocol. We have given all the required permissions from the state and sent it to the Centre. While, Central Drugs Safety Organisation has given the permission, we still need the same from ICMR and Drug Controller General of India. Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, too, has written to the Centre, for clearing the pending permission,” Mukherjee said. It is said that mild and moderate cases of coronavirus got cured and severe cases gets mild with BCG therapy, he said. After receiving permission, clinical trial can be started, which will be based on randomised-control trials with double-blind technique. The same process is applicable for plasma therapy, said the medical education secretary.India is in the final stages of framing a protocol for conducting a clinical trial for convalescent plasma therapy, which uses antibodies from the blood of cured patients, to treat severely ill Covid-19 patients.Kerala has got permission for conducting clinical trials of plasma therapy in the state.“Once clinical trials are successful, the state can start them — BCG vaccine and plasma therapy as a treatment for Covid-19 patients,” said the medical education secretary.Meanwhile, the state government is tapping the possibility of relaxing restrictions in the districts, where there are no Covid-19 patients and allowing industrial operations there. The cabinet sub-committee of seven senior cabinet ministers deliberated on Tuesday on many such factors to minimise financial losses and bring public life to normal to some extent.“The revival of the state economy is a task before us as the state is going through a challenging economic situation owing to the lockdown. There was a pressing demand for lifting of restrictions on industries in the green-zone districts, which have no Covid-19 patients. We are considering to allow industries to operate with 30% of their manpower to maintain social distancing and at the same time, bring industrial activities back to normal,” said public works department minister Ashok Chavan, who is member of the sub-committee.State government has appointed two committees for the revival of the state economy, which has been wading through challenging times owing to the Covid-19 lockdown. One committee comprises incumbent and former bureaucrats who are serving or have served in the finance department and state-owned financial institutions. The another cabinet sub-committee is headed by deputy chief and finance minister Ajit Pawar and comprises six other senior ministers. In its first meeting on Tuesday, the committee discussed various issues state economy and industry is currently facing and the ways out to face it. The committee was unanimous on the urgent need of relaxing the restrictions on the industries in the districts that fall under the green and orange zones.The issue of allowing migrant workers to go back to their respective states was also discussed in the sub-committee meeting. There are 5.62 lakh migrants put up in 4,618 shelters across the state. They also include the cane cutters who are stuck in other districts and neighbouring states after the harvesting for the season got over. “There could be an arrangement of allowing people to travel to their home district or the state after thorough check-up and valid passes. There are limitations of the authorities to make arrangements for these migrant workers,” Chavan said.Officials, however, said that the decision about the relaxation in the green zone districts is expected only after the due deliberations with the central government. “We expect the guidelines to be issued by the central government over the relaxations in some of the districts. The Centre has already issued a circular to exempt some of the auxiliary segments from the lockdown for the smooth operations of the essential services. But now prime minister, in his address on Tuesday said that they will review the situation over next week before any decision on relaxation. The district collectors have been asked to ready their plan for the industrial operations in the green zone districts, but the decision is yet to be taken,” said an official from the state government. The official said that operation of the industrial units not related to the essential commodities may begin after a week.State government said on Tuesday that it has completed the planning for the seeds and fertilizers required for the sowing on 140 lakh hectares of cultivable land in Kharip season beginning next month. State agriculture minster Dadaji Bhuse said that stock of 16.57 lakh quintal seeds and 40 lakh metric ton fertilizer has been readied for the season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-case-count-rises-to-2-684-toll-178/story-RLch8XHWjnZvV6MdLji4NO.html

15-04-2020||City||In next 5 days, Delhi govt to test 20,000 in containment zones||New Delhi: The Delhi government has decided to undertake a massive testing exercise by conducting 20,000 RT-PCR tests for Sars-CoV-2, the virus causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), over the next five days on people living in containment zones and quarantine centres, according to an official order. It has also designated private labs in each of the city’s 11 revenue districts to help with sample collecting and testing because the six state-run centres that conduct these tests are already overburdened.To put the number in perspective, a total of 16,282 tests have been conducted in Delhi since mid-January, when screening for Covid-19 began. A total of about 10,000 tests are carried out across the country in a day. Though the government wanted to scale up testing by using rapid antibody tests -- simple blood tests that give results in 25 minutes and show the presence of antibodies that suggest a person has recovered from a mild strain of Covid-19 and is thus immune to the virus that causes it -- but the kits that were to first come from China on April 5, and then April 10, are yet to be arrive.The Delhi government, which ordered 100,000 rapid testing kits, also planned to use them to speed up testing by pooling samples and testing in batches.“It has now been decided by the competent authority that 20,000 RT-PCR tests are to be performed on a war footing in Delhi in the coming five days for … timely containment of the disease,” said the order, a copy of which is with the HT.The exercise has already started with 692 samples collected from containment zones on Tuesday. Until last week, the Union government was testing symptomatic people who were taken to hospitals on suspicion of having the infection; people who might have come in direct contact with those who test positive; symptomatic health care workers; and people admitted to hospitals with severe acute respiratory infections (Sari) were also being tested. The Indian Council of Medical Research (IMRC) on April 9 changed the guidelines to also allow testing in those with flu-like symptoms from the identified hot spots, gatherings and evacuation centres.The RT-PCR test -- for which a swab is taken from the throat and nose -- is the most accurate Covid-19 test because it detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) to diagnose current infection. The report, however, comes typically in two to three days.The increased testing would have added to the load at six government centres testing the samples – reports for at least 714 samples were still pending on Tuesday, according to a government report. The Delhi government therefore designated private labs in of the city’s revenue districts to conduct the tests for a fixed price.Dr Lal Path Labs is the designated private lab for tests in the north, north-west, and north-east districts, according to the order. Sir Ganga Ram hospital will conduct tests for the central district, Onquest Labs for the New Delhi district, Dr Dangs Lab for the south district, Apollo laboratory for the South-east district, Max hospital in for tests in the east and Shahadara districts, Prognosis laboratories for the south-west district, and City X -Ray and Scan Clinic for the west district. In case the designated private labs also reach capacity, the samples will have to be referred to Dr Lal Path Labs, the order adds“We are happy to share our infrastructure and expertise for the welfare of the people. This is a very fair way of involving the private labs for scaling up the tests, and Delhi government has been very proactive. They have also promised that the money will be reimbursed within the week,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dangs Labs.The government has also decided to seek the private sector’s help in sample collection.Private laboratories will be paid Rs 4,500 if they collect a sample and use their own testing kit; R 3,500 if the sample is collected by the government and the kit is of the lab; and R 2,200 if the sample is collected by the government and the kit is also provided by it. The Supreme Court last week ruled that all private labs should test for free but later modified the order to say that the tests should be offered for free only to poor patients. According to the new order by the government, the money will be released directly by the state from the Union government’s National Health Mission Covid-19 fund.“The antibody tests are currently not available, and we are not sure when they will be here. Plus, they are not foolproof. Add to that the increasing number of patients in our hospitals who would need at least two tests to be discharged, there was a need to scale up our RT-PCR testing capability. As for testing in the hot spots, what we are seeing is that 30-50% of the cases are asymptomatic. In nearly 10% or 15% of the cases from Delhi we have been unable to clearly establish the source, pointing out the need for increased random testing,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and the head of a team of five doctors assisting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in Covid-19 preparedness.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-next-5-days-delhi-govt-to-test-20-000-in-containment-zones/story-0v25nrN4infL2g35UmlgFP.html
15-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s air quality info inaccurate since Saturday||Recent air quality information regarding particulate matter (PM) for Mumbai has been inaccurate as most pollution monitoring stations of the state pollution control board are not operational. The Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin on Monday and Tuesday is collating AQI data from only five stations since April 11.There are 12 air quality monitoring across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region that record PM2.5, PM10 among other pollutants on a real time basis. All except one in Kalyan, which has been inoperative throughout the lockdown, were functioning normally till April 11. Since then, data from only three PM 2.5 monitors and five PM 10 is being published on the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) website. The reason for the failures at the other stations is not known.“Even though these are continuous monitoring stations, in the event of a power trip or technical glitches, our officers go to these stations for a simple reboot. However, this is not happening due to current restrictions. We will be requesting the government to allow these activities to resume for the benefit of citizens,” said SC Kollur, chief scientist, MPCB. Monitoring stations are not listed under essential services in Maharashtra.Consequently, the air quality index (AQI) being generated for the region does not have data from stations in Worli, Colaba, Vile Parle, Borivli, Sion, Nerul, Kalyan and Vasai. “Having temporal gaps makes it difficult to correctly evaluate the effect of the lockdown on the city’s air quality,” said independent researcher Ronak Sutaria.Based on data collected from all stations other than Kalyan, between March 23 and April 8, Mumbai witnessed a 65-70% decline in air pollution during lockdown, said Kollur.The overall air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday in Mumbai was 70 (satisfactory), according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), which has 10 monitoring stations across MMR. Navi Mumbai recorded high PM 2.5 levels with AQI at 120. Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR, said PM 10 levels were marginally higher and explained this as “seasonal phenomenon”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-air-quality-info-inaccurate-since-saturday/story-DKdqprgoG2ngEQkdqO6itK.html

His head had been severed from his body, said officers of the government railway police.The police suspect it to be a case of suicide and have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the code of criminal procedure. The police said the man was identified on Tuesday afternoon after his parents heard from a neighbour about an accident and went to the mortuary.According to the police, he had appeared for Haryana board exams, barring one subject, which could not be conducted due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and was awaiting results. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that a motorcycle, belonging to the victim’s father, was found parked near the railway tracks.“A preliminary probe has revealed that on Monday afternoon, the man’s father had scolded him and asked him to concentrate on his studies. After some time, his father went to the grocery shop. Around 4pm, he went to his father and asked for keys to his motorcycle, ostensibly to practise riding,” the police officer said.The police said the man rode to the tracks and allegedly killed himself by lying in front of a freight train, which was going towards Rewari. One freight train is operational for transporting railway staff and some essential items amid the lockdown, the police said. His body was handed over to the family after the post-mortem examination on Tuesday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/18-year-old-kills-himself-after-father-scolds-him/story-mHEAZeReYxBsNecclUEeBM.html
15-04-2020||Delhi||CBSE awaits guidelines for clarity on exams||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is hoping guidelines the union government will release on Wednesday will provide some clarity on conducting the remaining Class 12 board examinations and on evaluating Class 12 and Class 10 papers, even as it prepares for the worst case scenario of not being able to hold the exams at all. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISC) is also waiting for the guidelines and preparing to hold exams as soon as possible while the International Baccalaureate (IB) has decided that there will be no tests this year and that all students will be marked on the basis of their predictive grades. “Holding examinations are our top priority and the board is ready to conduct them as soon as the lockdown ends. Meanwhile, the board is also looking to kickstart the process of evaluation which has been stalled (by the lockdown), All exams for class 10 have been conducted and only a few are left for class 12. We are keenly awaiting the guidelines that will be issued by the Centre on Wednesday,” said a CBSE official who asked not to be named. The official added that in case it is not possible to conduct the exams, options such as marking students based on internal assessment would be considered.Significantly, CBSE-affiliated schools abroad have already decided that exams will not be held; these schools are figuring out a way to mark students. “This however will not be a preferred option. Our attempt is to conduct the exams,” said the official, adding that a decision would be taken soon in consultation with human resource development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and HRD secretary Amit Khare. CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi said: “We are awaiting the detailed guidelines. At this time we cannot say more, but whatever decision we take will be in the interest of students”.The CBSE had on April 1 decided that it will hold nationwide class 12 board exams in 12 main subjects. There are 12 subjects for which exams are pending in the case of CBSE ( business studies, geography, Hindi (elective), Hindi (core), home science, sociology, computer science (old), computer science (new), information practice (old), information practice (new), information technology and biotechnology) and eight in the case of CISCE.There are also six exams left for ICSE (Class 10). “We are ready with our plans. But we can put them into practice only after the lockdown is lifted or if we get a go ahead from the government,” said Gerry Arathoo, CISCE’s chief executive officer. There are around 2,500 CISCE-affiliated schools in India and abroad. Arathoon said that the board will give at least a week to students for preparations. “We can’t even think about any other mode to hold the exam such as online. We are not well equipped for that.” The International Baccalaureate (IB) has cancelled exams this year in view of the prevailing situation. In an official statement released on March 23, IB said that it consulted stakeholders across the globe and decided that the May 2020 exams should not be held. According to the IB’s official website, it will award the diploma/course certificate to the students after evaluating their overall performance in the last exams. “We will be using vast historical assessment data to ensure that we follow a rigorous process of due diligence in what is a truly unprecedented situation. We will be undertaking significant data analysis from previous exam sessions, individual school data, subject data as well as comparative data of schools who have already completed uploading requirements and those who have not.”The board had asked schools to submit the coursework for all candidates.The extension of the lockdown has not gone down well with some students waiting to appear for exams. Shreya Sinha, a class 12 student in a private school in south Delhi, said that it’s become a “never ending wait” for her. “It’s so unprecedented. I’ve only one exam left and it’s looking like an unnecessary burden. Don’t know what will happen for our undergraduate admission. I want to get over with the exams as soon as possible.” Another class 12 student at Ahlcon Public School said he hasn’t been able to focus on an entrance exam due to the stress of not giving his school exams -- although even the former has been postponed. “I am preparing for the NEET and it’s also been postponed now. It’s so difficult to concentrate on studies these days. I wish my CBSE board exams were over.” NEET is short for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-class-x-and-most-class-xii-exams-over-cbse-hopes-guidelines-will-allow-it-to-evaluate/story-ySE3fxt8ptQvgMZVgEHQLO.html

Of these, six – including the greater flamingos - were migratory while seven were residents. The total number of water birds were 1,241 of which 343 were migratory and 898 were resident.“The census was held last week at Okhla Bird Sanctuary alone and only the water birds were included. Every year some of the migratory birds do stay back,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar.The migratory birds that were spotted included Greylag goose (18), Bar Headed Goose (25), Ruddy shelduck (12), Northern Shoveler (110), Common coot (98), Greater flamingo (80).

The sanctuary is home to about 350 species of birds of which nearly over 60 are local and long-distant migratory.“Most of the birds migrate back but a few are left mostly because of some injuries or illness. Apart from the water birds, certain juvenile raptors also stay back. Their departure is also a sight with a V formation or line formation and the flocks keep on changing the leader as other birds fly in a jet stream,” says eminent birder Bikram Grewal.The migratory birds start arriving here by October, while their strength reaches the peak in December.“Their departure begins by the March and April mid they are all gone to their breeding grounds in central and north Asia,” said birder Jaswinder Singh Waraich.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/amid-lockdown-forest-dept-holds-census-at-okhla-bird-sanctuary-as-migratory-birds-fly-back/story-cQrI7PpvzvtNBf2E4vMcYK.html

I thank the medical staff and everyone else involved in my treatment. The atmosphere in the isolation ward was friendly and positive.”Chief medical officer Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “Every patient who is cured is like a feat for us. On Monday, a 65-year-old Jamaat worker was discharged and today it was Gurpreet. With the recovery of these two, now five Covid-19 patients remain under treatment in hospitals in Ambala.”Gurpreet has been advised to remain at home and maintain social distancing with the family members.Talking about his experience at the hospital, he said, “I had my smartphone, so there was no chance to feel bored. I always kept in touch with my family and they kept boosting my morale. However, I noticed a lot of false information being spread on social media. There was a post with my photos claiming that I’m extremely ill. This had worried my relatives. Someone had shared my test reports on the web with my phone number, so I even got random calls.” He added that action should be taken against those spreading false information.Principal medical officer Dr Poonam Jain said, “The hospital staff was always there for Gurpreet. He was anxious at first, but eventually calmed down as he received proper care and treatment. After his samples tested negative twice, he was discharged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ambala-s-1st-patient-discharged-seeks-action-on-rumour-mongers/story-Q0OPLTf16z3q2I6RxThE4L.html
15-04-2020||Delhi||Death and dearth, the reality of patients outside AIIMS||All that Rizwan Hasan wants is help to board a bus towards his hometown in Muzaffarpur of Bihar. Being visually challenged, Hasan was accompanied by his wife to Delhi for a second eye surgery at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on March 21, but has been left without shelter and certainty of two meals a day, since a lockdown was imposed on March 25 to control the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) .“The day we arrived, my wife had to return home to attend to the last rites of her uncle. Now, I am alone, at the mercy of anyone who is kind enough to bring an extra plate of food for me,” says Hasan, 30, before the police chases him away from outside the AIIMS Metro station, his latest residence.A 100 metres away, under the AIIMS flyover, 29-year-old Madhuri, weeping, sings a sad folk song while her two children sleep on a plastic sheet next to her. Her eight-year-old son has a heart illness (a hole), but his treatment is not on the immediate priority list.“The police offers us lunch, but does not allow others to us food. They let us sleep outside an AIIMS gate at night, but keep chasing us away in the daytime,” said Madhuri, of Ballia in Uttar Pradesh, adding they sometimes make do without dinner. Her son’s surgery, scheduled for March 25, has been postponed and she hasn’t been given a revised date.In the initial days of the lockdown, there was no one to offer them meals, forcing them to spend all their money on food. “If you lift the lockdown today, we’ll have to either travel without a train ticket or walk all the way home,” says Madhuri, who goes only by her first name.Hasan and Madhuri are not alone in this situation. Scores of patients and their relatives, who had arrived at AIIMS for treatment before the lockdown, are spending their days under the flyover, in subways, on footpaths and outside the AIIMS Metro station, as the hospital has shifted its focus to treating Covid-19 patients.While the Delhi government has made shelter arrangements for the homeless and stranded migrants, many AIIMS’ patients and their kin have been left in the lurch.The rain baseras, dharamshalas and tents near AIIMS are operating at full capacity and government officials say that finding space for shelters in this area has been a problem.“We have 25 tents around AIIMS, which can accommodate up to 1,000 occupants at one point. Currently, all shelters are saturated in terms of occupancy because of the lockdown. Space has been a big issue in the area,” said Bipin Rai, member and spokesperson of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board.He said that authorities concerned have been requested to allocate space for more shelters in the vicinity of the hospital.Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police (south), said that food is being provided to stranded patients and their relatives. “Our officers go out to serve them meals and also respond with food when we get specific calls about anyone not receiving meals,” said Thakur.TREATMENTS UNCERTAINWhile many of these patients are stranded due to the lockdown, there are some who continue to stay on in the hope of getting surgeries and treatments done.Urmila Devi of Dumka in Jharkhand is one such person who had a chance to leave the city before the lockdown, but stayed back on in the hope that her nine-month-old granddaughter could undergo heart surgery on March 25. “When the hospital does reopen for the regular patients, I don’t know when we’ll get the next date,” said Devi.AIIMS authorities said that no new dates are being given. “We are only doing emergency surgeries at the moment. All those who got the dates before the lockdown or before the out-patient departments (OPDs) closed were sent a message informing about the cancellations. We have the mobile phone numbers of all our registered patients,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS.When are these postponed surgeries likely to resume? “We do not know. It depends on the situation. We will likely extend our working hours to accommodate more patients when the routine services resume,” said Sharma.DEATHAmid those undergoing hardships here was a 35-year-old cancer patient, Sanjeev, who died last Friday in a subway right outside the hospital, where he was staying. “He had been admitted to AIIMS for the last eight months, but had to leave the hospital due to the coronavirus. Now, my husband and I bide our time sitting on the same blanket on which our son died,” said Meena Devi, Sanjeev’s mother, of Banka in Bihar.Devi and her husband share the subway with 30-40 other patients and their relatives, all sleeping on blankets or plastic sheets. They say this is the only spot outside AIIMS where the police don’t chase them.HEALTH GOES FOR A TOSSAmong the patients is Pankaj Kumar, a 26-year-old resident of Samastipur in Bihar. A liver problem has left him with an abnormally bulge in the stomach and doctors had prescribed him a diet of eggs, milk, pulses and green vegetables, which are currently out of the question. “The people offering us food mostly bring pooris. I shouldn’t eat that, but I would starve to death if I don’t eat what is served,” said Kumar.Even those who have found a place at shelter homes before the lockdown say they are left without the basic nutritious foods prescribed by doctors. Sunil Sharma, a cancer patient, of Begusarai in Bihar, was prescribed coconut water, fruit juice and milk, but neither are they available nearby nor does he have the money to purchase them. “We had come prepared to bear expenses for a month. This has gone much beyond that,” he said.NO MONEYOutside the AIIMS Metro station, Karan Das, who is his late 30s, is left without any money to buy medicines for his 12-year-old son, who was slated to undergo heart surgery. “He has difficulty waking up and remaining active without medicines. But medicines cost us ₹6,000 a month and we have exhausted all our money,” said Das.While some of these patients continued staying in Delhi in the hope of receiving treatment once the lockdown ended, others said they have been stranded.One such patient is Hari Lal, who came to AIIMS on March 23 with breathing problems, but couldn’t leave due to the lockdown. He has no mobile phone, doesn’t remember the phone number of his family members and hasn’t spoken to them since coming to Delhi. “I just want to go home. I’ll walk when the lockdown ends on April 15,” said Lal, unaware that the lockdown has been extended.LACK OF SHELTERMany of the patients said they tried to gain entry into the rain baseras, but weren’t let in.Sudeep Kumar, who manages a group of tents, run by an NGO, near AIIMS, said that the need for social distancing has forced them to accommodate just half their usual capacity. “We also can’t allow in new people for the fear of infection,” said Kumar, adding that about 300 people are being accommodated in 13 tents set up here.At a rain basera run by the same NGO, social distancing seems impossible, despite closing their doors to new entrants. “You give me space and I’ll ensure social distancing,” says Uttam Thakur, the in-charge of the shelter.At the same shelter, cancer patient Mohd Salam, of Bhagalpur in Bihar, said his chemotherapy session has been postponed by two months. “I don’t want to die here. I’ll try to walk back home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/death-and-dearth-the-reality-of-patients-outside-aiims/story-QLT2ySVr9Jp3FfEPjOEz8J.html
15-04-2020||Delhi||With lockdown extended, varsities brainstorm on ways to conduct exams||With the central government extending the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 till May 3, higher educational institutes across Delhi are now deliberating on how to conduct the annual examination for lakhs of students. While most institutes are waiting for the recommendations of the committee formed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to look into the matter, universities have also conducted internal meetings to brainstorm possible solutions. Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Tuesday said it was trying to finalise the process for conducting exams on digital platforms. Keeping JNU’s diverse student population in mind, registrar Pramod Kumar said a “flexible yet efficient” mechanism will be devised based on the recommendations of the deans and chairpersons, which are to be submitted by Thursday, and after wider consultations. The academic committee has recommended cancelling the summer vacation this year. In its report, it also said students, who will not be able to appear for online examinations due to lack of access to internet connectivity, should be allowed to appear for their exams after the lockdown restrictions are lifted.Najma Akhtar, vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia, said the university had submitted its recommendations to the UGC panel. “Following consultations with our teachers and deans, we have planned to hold five 20-mark online assessments based on each unit of a paper. The best of three will be taken into account as each student’s final score. This will give students an option to better their scores even if they get low marks in one unit assessment,” she said.With classes being held through video conferencing, several higher educational institutes, including Jamia, had signalled a shift towards the online teaching-learning process in the wake of the lockdown which began on March 24.“I have asked for departments to share data on how many students were unable to attend classes and for what reason, so that we can find an alternative solution for these students,” Akhtar said, while highlighting the digital divide in a country where high bandwidth internet remains inaccessible to many.As per the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, total internet subscribers per 100 population stands at 52.08 as of September 2019. Of the 1,195 million wireline and wireless subscribers, at least 688 million (58%) were internet users. Not just the internet, devices like smartphones and computers are also not available to all. According to the fourth National Family Health Survey, conducted in 2015-16 across more than 6,00,000 households, only 9% of households has a computer.Keeping this in mind, Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) made a list of recommendations to DU vice-chancellor and the UGC. This comes a day after the varsity held a meeting with its deans to discuss modalities of online examination which could be conducted for its nine lakh students. One of the options discussed included submission of answers via audio clips.“For a large university such as DU, an online examination system is not viable. The university neither has the infrastructure nor the capability of providing/ensuring a level playing field in terms of accessibility and ease to the diverse student population it caters to,” DUTA president Rajib Ray said in its letter to the V-C on Tuesday.The recommendations listed by DUTA include conducting examinations as soon as universities reopen with priority given to final year students. The teachers’ body also said that shifting to an annual mode of teaching, especially at the undergraduate level, should be seriously considered.ADMISSIONSGenerally, the May-June period is the time when universities and colleges across the capital conduct admissions for their academic session that begins in July-August. The rescheduling of board examination due to Covid-19 lockdown and delay in academic learning is bound to have a ripple effect, which will affect the admission process as well.“We will make all efforts to start the new academic session in July. However, it might be difficult to conduct entrance tests at multiple centres outside Delhi as it was done in previous years,” Akhtar said. “Teachers and administrative officials will wrap up their work for the current academic session by April 30. The work on admission and tests will begin during the summer vacation which is likely to begin in the first week of May.” Delhi University is also mulling over taking the admission process completely online, including the verification of documents and certifications, to minimise the need for students to visit campuses. JNU has suggested conducting interviews of those who clear the entrance examinations via video conferencing. The Ambedkar University of Delhi said it was consulting faculty members and would not be able to comment on the matter yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-lockdown-extended-varsities-brainstorm-on-ways-to-conduct-exams/story-WwGplfE8prmCzM2vNCuIXN.html
15-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt unlikely to cancel summer break in schools||Even though the nationwide lockdown has been extended by 19 days, the Delhi government is unlikely to cancel summer vacations in schools this year. Although some private schools are of the view that the summer break can be advanced this year to avoid academic loss, government officials said Delhi’s ‘harsh weather conditions’ won’t allow them to continue regular classes in May and June.All private and public schools in the city have been closed since March 13 given the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. In Delhi schools, the summer break starts in the second week of May and continues until June. Schools reopen in the first week of July. A senior Delhi government official said that the education department is taking suggestions from schools, parents and other stakeholders on what can be done about the summer vacations. “It’s impossible for us to cancel the summer break considering the harsh weather conditions of Delhi in May and June. We can’t risk the lives of students. We are considering conducting classes for senior students from 9am to 12pm for some days in June. We are yet to decide on this. It’s highly unlikely that schools will reopen before July for all students in Delhi,” the official said.Many private schools across the city said that it would be better if the government advances the summer break this year. “The government can declare this lockdown period as a summer break and restart the school session by the last week of June. However, the government’s concern over the weather conditions in Delhi during that time is also genuine. They can also come up with a class-wise summer break plan to avoid academic loss,” Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu School in Rohini, said.Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said that if the summer break is advanced the school will be able to make up for the loss. “There are many students who are not being to attend online classes. We need to think about these students as well. We can cover their loss if we start early. We will be able to make up for the losses if schools reopen by mid-June. We can hold classes for a shorter duration,” she said.Amita Wattal, principal of Springdales School in Pusa Road, said, “We need to take a lot of things into consideration before deciding anything about the academic calendar. All the schools can’t hold classes in June. Not all schools are air-conditioned.”Meanwhile, both private and public schools in the city have already started conducting online classes for their students to continue learning amid the lockdown. The schools are also sending students worksheets and activities via emails, WhatsApp and SMS daily.The Delhi government is also considering a tie-up with a television channel soon to cover all students. “We are in talks with some channels. We are planning to get four hours’ airtime every day for classes 9 to 12,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-unlikely-to-cancel-summer-break-in-schools/story-26FKD8nVPFf9lNVIApvALK.html
15-04-2020||Delhi||Supply chain stretched, retail stock starts thinning out||Ensuring that the supply chain is not disrupted is a major challenge, especially with an extension of the lockdown for 19 more days, according to various stakeholders.The stock of many essential items, including perishables, foodgrains, packaged items, pharmaceutical products, consumer durables and dairy products, is already thinning out across the city. Traders are apprehensive that continued strict curbs on movement may spark shortages in the short term.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the lockdown will be extended till May 3, with enhanced restrictions for hot spots to contain the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19). The Centre will issue a set of guidelines for states to implement the extended lockdown on Wednesday.Fresh curbs, put in place by the Delhi government to ensure social distancing at wholesale vegetable and fruit markets, are likely to hit the supply of green vegetables, especially those arriving in small and medium-sized vehicles, such as pickup trucks and tempos. The government imposed staggered timings for purchase of vegetables and fruits, token-based entry of only 2,000 vehicles and allowing only one supply vehicle per trader, be it a small or big truck.Traders at Azadpur Mandi, which is Delhi’s biggest wholesale fruit and vegetable market, said that the situation, except for staples, such as potatoes, tomatoes and onions, is likely to worsen at retail markets in a couple of days.“Nearly 60% of major green vegetables are not reaching the wholesale market. The shortage of bottle gourd, ridged gourd, brinjal, bitter gourd and okra at the mandi will start reflecting in retail markets soon. The revised rules are not allowing the adequate supply of these vegetables by farmers. It’s a failed system,” Anil Malhotra, a member of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Azadpur, said.He said that these vegetables and fruits, such as muskmelon and watermelon, are supplied in smaller vehicles from neighbouring states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.Usually, a wholesale trader receives vegetables from three to five vehicles per day. “Nearly 64 traders were challaned for violating the norm of one vehicle per trader. This is creating a gap in supply. For instance, if a trader normally used to get 15 tonnes of these vegetables per day, he will now get only three to four tons. It will eventually result in price rise at retail markets,” Malhotra said.Rajendra Sharma, a wholesaler at Azadpur market, said, “Supply of vegetables coming in big vehicles such as trucks with 25-tonne capacity will not be impacted much but the supply of green vegetables will become a problem if the one-vehicle-per-trader rule is not changed. Nearly 50% of the green vegetables might become expensive in the days to come if the situation prevails,” he said.Sharma said that farmers are not able to supply their produce to wholesalers due to the token system.Haji Yamin, a trader at Okhla Mandi, has similar concerns. He said that instead of limiting the supply and the number of vehicles in the mandi, the government should ensure that people follow social distancing, use sanitisers and wear masks. “Normally, over 100 trucks and small vehicles of fruits and vegetables used to supply to the market, but this number has gone down by 30-40%,” Yasmin said.However, Adil Ahmad Khan, chairman, APMC Azadpur, a Delhi government-appointed official, said that there were some hiccups, initially, in the implementation of the new system and that it would be streamlined soon.“There are some concerns of the traders regarding the supply of green vegetables and entry passes. We have held a meeting with the traders and assured that arrangements will soon be made so that the supply of green and perishable vegetables is not affected. The validity of passes, which were issued to the wholesale traders of the mandi, has now been extended till May 3,” Khan said.Transporters too said that they are working at just 15%-20% of their capacity. Pradeep Singhal, chairman, All India Transporters Welfare Association, said that many trucks are stranded at borders, while there are not enough loaders or drivers. “Most of the workforce has left the city. There are not enough people to drive vehicles. We are in talks with the government and have also requested them to provide social security for drivers so that they are encouraged to resume work,” said Singhal.Besides, retailers and small-time grocery store owners said that they are running out of essential items due to delays and a lack of movement at the wholesalers and distributors’ end.Sumit Dawar, a grocery store owner at Lajpat Nagar market, has been using making trips in his vehicle to procure stock from wholesalers. “Initially, the supply would reach every three days, which gradually started extending to almost a week. People would stock up the moment fresh supply arrived. Besides, many distributors of flour brands, packaged items and toiletries have not been supplying stock. To deal with this, I decided to get permission from the local authorities to use my car for getting some stock, but even then, only a limited stock can be ferried in a car,” said Dawar.In nearby Defence Colony market too, the scenario is similar. “We are running short of a number of packaged items that customers ask for, including milk powder, curd, dry snacks, beverages and toiletries. Most of the distributors have stopped sending supplies for the last 15-20 days. The old stock is fast running out,” said Rajinder Malik, who owns a general store and is also the president of the local market association.At central Delhi’s Gole Market, some stores have run out of cooking oil, ghee, rice flour and condiments. In southwest Delhi’s Dwarka, retailers said that they do have enough pulses and legumes in stock, and are running out of spices, frozen foods and sanitary items. “Many customers ask for items of specific brands of cumin, methi seeds and other items, such as hand wash, toothpaste and soap, fresh stock of which is yet to come,” said Ajay Bansal, who owns a departmental store.The list of essential items drawn up by the government includes milk, fruit, vegetables, medicines, food grains, spices, cooking oils and sanitary items, among others.Wholesale dealers and distributors supply stock from their godowns to retailers across the city. The supply chain relies on several interconnected elements — workforce, transport and availability of containers for packaging, among others. If a single element is disrupted, the entire chain is thrown into disarray.Besides, with only a limited number of people being issued curfew passes, only one or two persons from each shop or warehouse have the permission to commute.Naresh Gupta, the president of Delhi Grain Merchants Association said, “We are able to send out stock only once or twice a week. With limited resources at hand, it is becoming difficult for dealers to transport goods on time.”Vijay Jain, president, All India Traders Association, is hopeful that the new set of guidelines will ease restrictions on interstate transportation. “Though there are some hiccups in the movement of goods, we will ensure that goods reach retailers. We are also hoping that the fresh guidelines make it easier for supplying stock across borders,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/supply-chain-stretched-retail-stock-starts-thinning-out/story-uO7H59NjQsWzESRBZUHm6J.html

15-04-2020||Delhi||Doctor cycling back home from work mowed down by car in Malviya Nagar, dies||A 52-year-old doctor, who served as a Covid-19 nodal officer and was cycling back home from work, was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Monday afternoon.The doctor, Jai Prakash Yadav, was posted at an MCD polyclinic in South Delhi’s Mehrauli and served as the South zone’s nodal officer for Covid-19, said Alka Gupta, additional director (health and administration department). Yadav’s car had developed a problem a few days ago and as he could not find a mechanic to fix it, he had been using his son’s bicycle to commute to and from work.According to Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (South), the accident took place around 3.30pm Monday while Yadav was cycling back home to Greater Kailash-1 from the polyclinic. He lived with his wife, who works at a private hospital, and two children in the MCD Officer’s Flat in GK-1. The family belonged to Supaul in Bihar. “The doctor was turning right at a traffic junction near the Police Training School in Malviya Nagar, when his bicycle was rammed by a four-wheeler which sped away immediately after the accident,” the DCP said. Another police officer said it was a white car that hit the doctor. The driver quickly reversed his vehicle to get away from the mangled remains of the bicycle and the injured doctor and sped away. Yadav’s colleague, Ankit, who was right behind him in his car,saw Yadav lying injured and rushed him to Max Hospital in Saket where he succumbed to injuries during treatment. “They were only able to note the colour of the car,” the officer said.Yadav’s colleague, Dr RN Prasad, said the impact of the hit was such that Yadav was thrown into the air before landing on the road. “Ankit Bhai, please save me”, Yadav is said to have told his colleague who rushed him to hospital, Prasad said. “But the impact of the hit was such that his veins had ruptured and he died of excessive bleeding,” he said. The police were alerted by 6.30pm and have registered a case of causing death by negligence and rash driving against the unknown driver. “We are checking the CCTV footage along that route to identify the offending vehicle,” the DCP said. Prasad said Yadav’s car had developed a snag a few days ago and he was unable to find a mechanic due to the lockdown. So he was using his son’s sports bicycle to reach the polyclinic and back. “He had urged a security guard to arrange a mechanic. For the last few days, he was commuting by bicycle,” Prasad said. On Monday, Yadav was returning home after distributing personal protective kits to health workers, Prasad said. Yadav’s brother-in-law, Sudhir Kumar, urged police to spare no effort in arresting the errant driver. “We have heard that the driver was a young man and that he was speeding. When the entire city is in lockdown and there are so few vehicles out on the road, someone was speeding and ended up killing a doctor who was risking his life for the country. Now, we’ll focus on getting justice for him,” Kumar said.Dr Gupta, meanwhile, remembered Yadav as a “good doctor and a very nice human being”. He was handling the Covid screening data for the South zone as its the zonal director. Yadav knew the system well and it will be difficult to replace him,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/doctor-cycling-back-home-from-work-mowed-down-by-car-in-malviya-nagar-dies/story-gbp51Nt3hDEUIo8B0pj4EM.html
15-04-2020||Education||Panjab University students seek waiver of hostel fees||Students of Panjab University have requested the administration to waiver of hostel fees for those who left the campus in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. PU suspended classes on March 15 and directed its employees to work from home. Most hostel residents left the campus and there are only few students in staying there now.Many student parties requested authorities to waive of the fees as students have left the hostels, and there is uncertainty surrounding when classes will resume. Indian National Students’ Organisation (INSO) has submitted a memorandum to dean students’ welfare (DSW) Emanual Nahar regarding the same.INSO’s PU chairman, Rajan Nain said, “After the advisory from university authorities to vacate hostels due to the Covid-19 outbreak, most students vacated their rooms. So, their hostel fees must be waived off from the March 22 till the University reopens. Fees of those who have paid in advance should be adjusted in future.”Panjab University Campus Students Council (PUCSC) president Chetan Chaudhary said, “I had a discussion with DSW regarding waiver of hostel fees and he assured students won’t be burdened financially.”PU DSW Emanual Nahar said, “We have received requests from different student organisations seeking waiver of hostel fee.

15-04-2020||City||LIP MLA Bains loses security detail over his statement on Patiala attack||A day after Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains said that the attack on Patiala cops by Nihang Sikhs was a result of simmering anger against the men in khaki, police withdrew his security detail on Tuesday. They, however, did not curtail the security cover of his older brother, MLA Balwinder Singh Bains.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said he had received an application from sub-inspector Jagjit Singh, head constables Satnam Singh and Jagdish Chander and constable Mangal Singh, asking to be relieved from the security detail of MLA Bains, who represents the Atam Nagar constituency. The four cops were asked to report to the police lines with immediate effect on Tuesday.Bains, meanwhile, accused Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh of forcing his gunmen to write to the department against him. “I have audio recordings to prove that the four were under pressure. They were threatened that they would be dismissed if they don’t sign on the applications,” he said. Sub-inspector (SI) Jagjit Singh, one of the gunmen, said they are not under any pressure. “The whole department is serving the people of the state by putting their lives at risk. And instead of standing by ASI Harjit Singh, whose hand was chopped off, the MLA spoke against the whole force,” the SI said.Bains further said that he had not justified the ASI’s hand being chopped off. “I used the words ‘adle da badla (tit for tat)’ which means that due to simmering anger against the policemen who inflict atrocities on people, a sincere cop’s hand was chopped off. I never lauded this act. Instead, I spoke against those cops who are harassing people,” said Bains.“Police have been thrashing innocent people during curfew and making their videos. They did not even spare pregnant women or senior citizens. People are angry at this behaviour,” he said, adding that he stands by his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lip-mla-bains-loses-security-detail-after-his-statement-on-patiala-attack/story-LUIEKOYQerGudnucY9A6eL.html

They are surviving on the two meals provided by the UT administration in a day as their parents remain stranded in Uttar Pradesh. Sometimes, however, the food finishes quickly before their turn comes.Food not sufficientHindustan Times on Tuesday found the queue for free meals stretching almost up to one km.Almost 3,000 families of labourers here are struggling to make ends meet as jobs have dried up following the curfew because of the Covid-19 outbreak.Watch | Long queues for a meal in Chandigarh’s Khajeri village, yet hundreds go hungry In fact, some people, in their desperation to be ahead of others, have left their plates to reserve places in the queue by as early as 7 am.One hour after lunch distribution begins at 1 pm, the food, comprising cooked rice and pulses (dal) and rice, is over, while over a 100 people wait to be fed.Others say whatever food they have collected is not enough to feed their families.“There are eight members in my family, but I’ve got food for just three.

Twelve other localities of Lucknow were already sealed last week.“We have listed out the details of the houses and close contacts of people who came in contact with the two brothers. The marking of the entire area has been done and the sanitisation process of lanes and houses started on Tuesday evening,” said a senior police official.He said the entire locality, which had been sealed, included two lanes that cross each other within a periphery of around 125 metres.Joint commissioner of police (law and order) Naveen Arora, along with his team, visited the locality to chalk out a plan to enforce complete lockdown. He asked officials to seal all entry and exit points so that no people could come out or go into the locality.Police barriers had been set up at all entry and exit points of the locality while only sanitation staff, health workers and police personnel on duty were allowed there. An extensive sanitisation drive would be carried out over the next 2-3 days to completely disinfect the locality, he said, adding that the adjoining localities would also be sanitised.Arora said the police and district administration were trying to ensure that families living in the sealed locality continue to get essentials.

However, those residing in slums claim that there are still problems in getting commodities from fair price shops and shop owners claim that due to the disruption in the supply chain with the wholesale grocery market closed for two days, their stocks are limited. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) sealed all peth areas, including Swargate, Ghorpade peth, Somwar peth, Mangalwar peth, Budhwar peth, Guruwar peth, Shukrawar peth, Shaniwar peth, Raviwar peth, Bhavani peth, Nana peth and areas around the RTO office after maximum number of Covid-19 positive cases were reported from there. Once an area is defined as a containment zone, private vehicle movement will be banned and individuals who step outside their homes must wear masks. The containment, however, excludes vegetable vendors/agriculture-related transport, essentials including grocery and medical, institutional and government vehicles for scheduled period. On Monday, the Pune civic body proposed to district collector Naval Kishore Ram to declare 22 more areas as containment zones. The collector has not taken a call on the proposal yet. Anand Saraf, a resident of the peth area, said, “Although the vegetable market is closed, many vendors are still selling their stock in the internal lanes, which is helpful for residents.The milk supply is regular, too. There is no need to visit to grocery shops regularly during the lockdown, but if needed, all the necessary items are easily available in our areas.” Sandip Bhosale, a grocery shop owner from Swargate area, said, his stocks are running low. “The main market is closed and supply has been hampered. I have to send customers empty-handed even for items which could have been easily available.” Another resident, Vishal Dhanwade, who lives in Guruwar peth, said, “There have been no complaints from residents about availability of essential commodities. Though there are barricades on the roads, it is only to restrict vehicular movement. People can walk to their nearby stores and purchase essential commodities, if needed. The area is sealed, so residents prefer to get items from shops adjacent to their homes and do not step out. Also, the public appreciates the government’s move to seal the area to contain the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19.” However, Avinash Bagwe, who is a corporator and represents people who live in the slum areas, mainly near Bhavani peth, highlights the plight of the urban poor. He said, “Our area mainly consists of slums. People do not have enough money to procure grocery for a month. They depend on the fair price shops, but since many people do not fall in the below poverty line category, they have not been able to purchase items from the fair price shops. They are daily wage earners and need a source of sustenance during the lockdown. “Along with the problem of daily meals, residents of slums are also dealing with the woes arising due to increasing daily temperature. Most of the houses are 10x10 rooms made of steel. With the temperature rising, residents cannot stay inside their homes during the daytime and hence, come out to roam on the streets. This causes problems for the police officials who ask them to go back. These residents work as domestic helps and are currently not getting any financial help,” he added.Navnath Kamble, a slum dweller from Bhavani peth, said, “I am an autorickshaw driver. However, since March my income has been zero and it has become tough to manage my domestic expenses. We do not get grocery from the fair price shops as we do not fall in the below poverty line category and I do not have enough money to buy grocery for at least 15 days. The lockdown is increasing my burden and I am finding it difficult to manage my home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/supply-of-essential-commodities-in-containment-zones-enough-say-residents-slum-dwellers-struggle-to-survive/story-bMChej1s4Z3Hj7coYAXdUP.html

After showcasing his skills in the cadet category, in 2019, Mulye moved to the sub-junior category. For Mulye, the lockdown is comfortable as he trains at home every day with his coach, who is also his father, Upendra Mulye, at home. Although he misses playing with his friends, video calling has made his life easy. Mulye is also enjoying the re-run of Ramayan and Mahabharat on the television screen.Mulye who stays at Bavdhan, is maintains his fitness with circuit training drills and also practices tables tennis with his father on a mini table tennis table at home or on the dining table.

Circuit training includes – press-ups, pull-ups, inclined press-ups, sit-ups (lower abdominals), skipping, among other things. I also do suryanamaskar every day.Once I am done with my routine, I again sleep till 9:30am. After that, I have a training session with Mihir Teranikar via video conferencing. Then, later in the morning, I help my mother clean the house and water the plants. I love watering plants and it is my daily job during the lockdown. Then, I listen to music or watch TV. Afternoon sessionAfter lunch, I don’t sleep and it is time to play with my younger brother- cards or ludo. We also play cricket on the house porch. My afternoons are filled with fun activities with my brother and with my Class 7 exam over, there is no burden of studies. Sometimes, I do study Class 8 books.Evening sessionIn the evening, I exercise again at 5pm. My father also joins me and we play table tennis before concluding our session.

15-04-2020||City||Ludhiana: Spectre of Covid-19 dampens Baisakhi||The novel coronavirus outbreak and acute shortage of migrant labourers during harvest season has put a damper on Baisakhi festivities for farmers in the region. The lockdown, which was imposed to curtail the spread of the deadly coronavirus, has debilitated the farming sector. With numerous migrant workers having left the state, farmers in Ludhiana, Khanna and Jagraon say they are facing in crises. They say the few labourers that stayed behind are unskilled.Pamal village sarpanch Jagdish Singh Grewal says, “Though farmers can harvest crop using a combine, many other tasks remain labour intensive. There are no trained labourers in the area and due to the lockdown, labour cannot travel to Punjab.”“Sadly, the village youth, who come from poor families, are unwilling to help with farm work despite being offered handsome daily wages,” he added. Anoop Singh Grewal, a farmer, who owns land in Hambra area says the lockdown has raised a plethora of concerns: “The government has allowed us to use combine harvesters but it must also allow allied industries to operate. What if the combine develops a snag? Such practical problems need to be addressed before harvesting starts,” he said.Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal) president BS Rajewal says the government will understand the practical problems only when its officials began visiting the grain markets.“The government has mandated that a farmer can only bring 50 quintals of grain in one go. If a farmer has 200 quintals of grain stocked with him, will he make four trips to the mandi and who will bear the cost of it. How will the grain be moved from one place to the other, especially when there is an acute staff shortage of labour? asked Rajewal.PAU EXPERTS SAY FUTURE OF FARMING IS GRIMPunjab Agricultural University (PAU) experts have predicted that the labour crises will hit paddy transplantation as well.PAU department of economics and sociology professor and head Dr Kamal Vatta says a lot of labour will be required for transplantation of paddy. “With increased demand for labour amid the lockdown, there may be an increase in workers’ wages. This may cause delay in paddy transplantation and decline the area under cultivation,” says Vatta.“The area over which summer vegetables are cultivated may also decline because of shortage of labour. The state government should promote the use of mechanical paddy transplanters and ensure their timely repair and availability to help farmers cope with labour shortages,” Vatta said.The pandemic will adversely impact income and employment in the farming sector. A drop in prices of produce and hike in cost of production will result in lower income for farmers. Non-farm income will also decline, said Vatta, adding that though the wages of agricultural workers will increase it will be accompanied by a drop in other sectors, resulting in an overall decline in wages and employment. Vatta also predicted that unemployment among rural youth will rise as employment opportunities in urban areas decline. The incidence of rural poverty in rural Punjab may increase, Vatta said. “To alleviate the situation, the poor should be provided time-bound food coupons, unemployment allowances and employment should be generated through MGNREGA.The allocations for social welfare schemes should be enhanced,” the professor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-spectre-of-covid-19-dampens-baisakhi/story-gwWo2Cc69isuHBMDegsS9L.html
15-04-2020||Delhi||Riot victims stitch back their lives by sewing safety gear||Eighteen-year-old Saina, a resident of Shiv Vihar in northeast Delhi, has had little to do since her house and family’s shop were damaged during a communal riot in February. These days, however, she has an important job to do — stitch personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers to aid their fight against coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. “I had planned to resume my studies this year as I had to take a break due to my family’s financial situation last year. I couldn’t because of the riots,” said Saina, who goes only by her first name, adding she finished matriculation last year. “When we got the opportunity to stitch PPE kits and do something about the situation in our country, we knew we had to do it.”The eldest of six siblings, Saina was worried after her father’s e-rickshaw was burnt, home and grocery shop damaged in the riots. While the family was struggling to restart their lives, the Covid-19 disease struck. “We are relying on the ration given to us by the government and various organisations. There isn’t anything else to do. When we got the sewing machines as a part of the rehabilitation drive, we decided to stitch masks and PPE suits during this lockdown.”Saina and three other women, who lost their houses and livelihood due to the communal riots in February, take turns to use the two sewing machines given to them by a civil society collective, which was working on rehabilitation of riot victims in the area.Aasif Mujtaba, a PhD scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, who founded the Miles2Smile collective, said, “A local residing in the area, who earlier gave stitching work to these women, got a suggestion from someone that since there is no work and a dearth of PPE kits across the country, these women could be approached for the work.”A sample kit was provided to these women over a week ago along with raw material. Mujtaba says that so far, they have made over 35,000 masks and over 200 full-body PPE kits. “We have now provided them with better quality material (70 gsm) and work on it will begin from Tuesday. Some of the kits have been distributed to volunteers working in the area. We have also approached local police personnel in various areas and will distribute kits to them as well. If there is a demand, we can also sell these it to those in need,” Mujtaba said, adding that the kits would be sterilised before distribution. The remuneration for the labour remains in question. “Right now, we just wanted to help. If there is a demand for more suits and we are paid for the work, it will help us as well,” said Saina, before heading off to finish her day’s work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/riot-victims-stitch-back-their-lives-by-sewing-safety-gear/story-FJSNn6Ks7WMQWlYlHii9dN.html
15-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s decision to halt WHO funding amid Covid-19 pandemic criticized by world leaders||US President Donald Trump has announced he will halt funding for the WHO for “severely mismanaging” the Covid-19 crisis, prompting the Indian government to say on Wednesday the world community’s focus should remain on the pandemic.Trump’s move was widely seen as an effort to deflect mounting criticism of his administration’s handling of the outbreak as coronavirus deaths rose by 2,228 in a single-day record on Tuesday. Nearly 26,000 people have died and 608,377 have been infected in the US.At his daily briefing, Trump announced the suspension of US funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), ranging between $400 million and $500 million a year, for a period of 60 to 90 days.“Today I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organisation while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organisation’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the Coronavirus,” he said.Trump, who has repeatedly accused the WHO of toeing China’s line, noted Beijing “contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less”. He added: “As the organisation’s leading sponsor, the US has a duty to insist on full accountability.”He further said: “One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations…Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives.”It was not clear when the halt in US payments will take effect or whether Trump can unilaterally suspend payments, which are authorised by the Congress. The US contributed $893 million to the WHO for its two-year budget of $5.8 billion for 2020-21.The WHO’s two-year budget includes member dues and voluntary contributions from countries and non-profit organisations. Member dues are based on a country’s wealth and population. For 2020-21, the US accounted for almost 25% of member dues, followed by China, Japan and Germany.The Indian government reacted cautiously to Trump’s decision, with people familiar with developments saying the focus of global efforts should remain on overcoming the pandemic.“At present, our efforts and attention are fully focused on dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Once the world has addressed this crisis, we can revisit this question [of funding for the WHO],” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while participating in a virtual summit of G20 leaders last month, had called for reform of the WHO, which was based on the “last century’s models” and hadn’t adapted to deal with new challenges.The move was criticised by world leaders, and UN chief Antonio Guterres said this was “not the time to reduce the resources for the operations” of the WHO.Guterres said in a statement the need of the hour is unity in the global battle against Covid-19. “It is my belief that the WHO must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against Covid-19,” he said.Acknowledging the need to review actions of different entities in responding to the Coronavirus, Guterres said this can be done after overcoming the epidemic “to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis”.He added, “The lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future. But now is not that time.”German foreign minister Heiko Maas tweeted: “Blaming does not help. The virus knows no borders…One of the best investments is the @UN, especially the underfunded @WHO, to strengthen…the development and distribution of tests and vaccines.”Trump’s criticism of the WHO runs counter to his own praise for the world body and China. “CDC (Centers of Disease Control and Prevention) & World Health have been working hard and very smart,” he tweeted in February.The US president has severed or scaled down ties with several world bodies – the Paris Accord on climate change (2017), Unesco (2017) and UNHCR (2018). He has also complained about US contributions to bodies such as the UN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-decision-to-halt-who-funding-amid-covid-19-pandemic-criticized-by-world-leaders/story-FhytwJSgpjFM30zZcR31uK.html
15-04-2020||World||Spain’s daily coronavirus deaths decline as testing increases||Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday promised more coronavirus testing to try to build on a decline in daily COVID-19 deaths that has allowed Spain to start tentatively reopening its locked-down economy.Officials hope more testing will give a better indication of the areas where lockdowns can be eased further.“Spain is already one of the countries making the most daily tests. More than 20,000, and we are increasing the number,” Sanchez told a near-empty parliament.Spain’s daily number of deaths from the coronavirus fell to 523 on Wednesday from 567 the day before, the health ministry said - well below a peak of 950 reached on April 2.The International Monetary Fund has said Spain’s economy is likely to suffer heavily from the pandemic, and the government is keen to reactivate whatever businesses it can as soon as possible, especially ahead of the tourist summer months. The IMF expected an 8% economic slump this year, because of the collapse in tourism and Spain’s high proportion of small and medium-sized businesses, with the debt-to-GDP ratio projected to hit 113% - its highest level in over a century. It put the 2020 budget deficit at 9.5% of GDP, the widest in the euro zone.On Monday and Tuesday, sectors including construction and manufacturing were allowed to reopen but, with most people still confined to their homes, shops, bars and public spaces will stay closed until at least April 26.For the lockdown to be eased more broadly, officials say testing for the virus has to be expanded to include people who have mild or no symptoms, to track the spread in more detail.The government also said last week it would carry out mass antibody tests on the blood of 60,000 randomly chosen people over three weeks, to begin identifying those who might in theory now be immune after exposure to the virus.However, health and virology experts are not yet certain about the quality of such tests, or how much immunity such antibodies might provide.Spain remains one of the world’s worst-affected countries, with only the United States and Italy recording higher cumulative death tolls than the 18,579 reported on Wednesday.The official tally of cases rose by just over 5,000 to 177,633, although Fernando Simon, the national emergency coordinator, said the expansion of testing had meant more mild or asymptomatic cases were being recorded.Despite signs that public health authorities are slowly getting on top of the pandemic, healthcare workers have had no respite. In Barcelona, a doctor filed a complaint with police after her vehicle was scrawled with grafitti reading “contagious rat”, El Periodico newspaper reported.The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that countries should wait at least two weeks before evaluating the impact of loosening their lockdowns and deciding whether to go further.But Spain, having suffered a heavy blow to growth and employment during the euro zone debt crisis, is under acute pressure to restart its economy.The IMF said unemployment, already the highest in the European Union, would jump to nearly 21% from 14% last year.“Those levels of unemployment are not sustainable,” European Central Bank Vice-President Luis de Guindos told Onda Cero radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-s-daily-coronavirus-deaths-decline-as-testing-increases/story-5DE6NqEyPZ33YzgYlrp6iP.html

15-04-2020||World||In another signal to progressives, Warren backs Biden||Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday endorsed former vice-president Joe Biden for the 2020 race for the White House, paving the way for further coalescing of Democratic party’s progressives ty around his candidacy. Notably, also, she has been on his shortlist for running mate.“In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government—and I’ve seen Joe Biden help our nation rebuild,” Warren said in a video message. “That’s why I’m proud to endorse Joe Biden as president of the United States.”Warren’s endorsement was the third in a quick succession of high-profile announcements coming Biden’s way this week. Senator Bernie Sanders, another icon of the party’s progressives, announced his endorsement Monday, weeks after he became the last of the contenders to drop out of the race.Former president Barack Obama announced his support for his former deputy on Tuesday, with a message that Biden was what Americans needed “one of our darkest time”. Obama added an appeal to the country to unite in a “great awakening” and defeat current day politics characterized by “plain meanness”.Now Warren, the firebrand senator from Massachusetts, who excited legions of young supporters in the party, tapping into about the same constituency that also rooted for Sanders, with her meticulous plans on almost every issue facing the country. She had even led the crowded field of contenders briefly.Biden needs this constituency of progressive Democrats, who support state-led medicare for all, aggressive and comprehensive measures to combat climate change, lower college tuitions higher taxes on the super-rich. Leading members of this wing include New York lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Indian American lawmaker Pramila Jayapal. The former vice-president has already begun reaching out to them, and will expect Warren and Sanders to weigh in.“I’ve been proud to work with her over the past few weeks to identify and adopt important policy proposals that will strengthen us as a people,” Biden said in a statement. He has adopted Warren’s bankruptcy plan last month.Warren is also on the former vice-president’s shortlist for a running mate, as he said December. He has publicly committed himself to picking a woman for the ticket, and others on his list, according to speculation, are Indian American senator Kamala Harris, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and former candidate for Georgia governor Stacey Abrams.Biden has not given any further indications about his thinking. On her endorsement, he he said Tuesday, he is “proud” to have her in his corner. “Not just as we work to defeat Donald Trump in November, but in the years to come, as we push through a bold and progressive policy agenda for the American for the fight ahead.”Warren’s failed bid may be remembered for ever for, among other things, her epic take down of the New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg who had invested an millions from his private wealth into ads to blow out the competition and propel him to the top of the race.The strategy worked for him, but only till he got into the debate stage, where he became fair game for everyone. Warren’s attacks on him were most devastating, and he quietly ended his race after only his second debate, and poor showing in the primaries and caucuses. Warren, however, failed to turn these debate performances into wins in primaries and ended her race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-another-signal-to-progressives-warren-backs-biden/story-bkO54CXBvrIAqf3mgLq7WL.html

She was diagnosed with Covid-19 soon afterwards.“She has always cooked for herself too, although she likes a cheeky McDonalds every now and then. I haven’t told her they are closed,” said her granddaughter Alex Jones, 40.“I think the secret of her old age is that she is physically active and very independent. She had a hip operation back in December and within 30 days she was walking again. She really is amazing and I know all the family can’t wait to see her. She has quite a few fans!”Nurse Kelly Smith who looked after Titchen said:“It’s been fantastic to see Connie recover.

The CBI case relates to the fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding; the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.On the two new charges, CPS said: “The Government of India has issued this further extradition request…Put shortly, those offences relate to allegations that Nirav Deepak Modi has interfered with the CBI investigation by ‘causing disappearance of evidence’ and intimidating witnesses (‘criminal intimidation to cause death’)”.It added that the five-day extradition hearing scheduled from May 11 will go ahead, but the two additional offences part of the CBI case will be dealt with at a separate later hearing, probably in July. If the May hearing does not proceed due to the coronavirus pandemic situation, the two requests will be joined and heard in September. The next case management hearing will take place on April 28, the CPS said.

15-04-2020||World||China hid truth about Covid-19 pandemic from its people for almost a week||In the six days after top Chinese officials secretly determined they likely were facing a pandemic from a new coronavirus, the city of Wuhan at the epicenter of the disease hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people; millions began traveling through for Lunar New Year celebrations.President Xi Jinping warned the public on the seventh day, Jan. 20. But by that time, more than 3,000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence, according to internal documents obtained by The Associated Press and expert estimates based on retrospective infection data.Six days.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThat delay from Jan. 14 to Jan. 20 was neither the first mistake made by Chinese officials at all levels in confronting the outbreak, nor the longest lag, as governments around the world have dragged their feet for weeks and even months in addressing the virus.But the delay by the first country to face the new coronavirus came at a critical time — the beginning of the outbreak. China’s attempt to walk a line between alerting the public and avoiding panic set the stage for a pandemic that has infected almost 2 million people and taken more than 126,000 lives.“This is tremendous,” said Zuo-Feng Zhang, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “If they took action six days earlier, there would have been much fewer patients and medical facilities would have been sufficient. We might have avoided the collapse of Wuhan’s medical system.”Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakOther experts noted that the Chinese government may have waited on warning the public to stave off hysteria, and that it did act quickly in private during that time.But the six-day delay by China’s leaders in Beijing came on top of almost two weeks during which the national Center for Disease Control did not register any cases from local officials, internal bulletins obtained by the AP confirm. Yet during that time, from Jan. 5 to Jan. 17, hundreds of patients were appearing in hospitals not just in Wuhan but across the country.It’s uncertain whether it was local officials who failed to report cases or national officials who failed to record them. It’s also not clear exactly what officials knew at the time in Wuhan, which only opened back up last week with restrictions after its quarantine.But what is clear, experts say, is that China’s rigid controls on information, bureaucratic hurdles and a reluctance to send bad news up the chain of command muffled early warnings. The punishment of eight doctors for “rumor-mongering,” broadcast on national television on Jan. 2, sent a chill through the city’s hospitals.“Doctors in Wuhan were afraid,” said Dali Yang, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. “It was truly intimidation of an entire profession.”Without these internal reports, it took the first case outside China, in Thailand on Jan. 13, to galvanize leaders in Beijing into recognizing the possible pandemic before them. It was only then that they launched a nationwide plan to find cases — distributing CDC-sanctioned test kits, easing the criteria for confirming cases and ordering health officials to screen patients, all without telling the public.The Chinese government has repeatedly denied suppressing information in the early days, saying it immediately reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization.“Allegations of a cover-up or lack of transparency in China are groundless,” said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a Thursday press conference.The documents show that the head of China’s National Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, laid out a grim assessment of the situation on Jan. 14 in a confidential teleconference with provincial health officials. A memo states that the teleconference was held to convey instructions on the coronavirus from President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, but does not specify what those instructions were.“The epidemic situation is still severe and complex, the most severe challenge since SARS in 2003, and is likely to develop into a major public health event,” the memo cites Ma as saying.The National Health Commission is the top medical agency in the country. In a faxed statement, the Commission said it had organized the teleconference because of the case reported in Thailand and the possibility of the virus spreading during New Year travel. It added that China had published information on the outbreak in an “open, transparent, responsible and timely manner,” in accordance with “important instructions” repeatedly issued by President Xi.The documents come from an anonymous source in the medical field who did not want to be named for fear of retribution. The AP confirmed the contents with two other sources in public health familiar with the teleconference. Some of the memo’s contents also appeared in a public notice about the teleconference, stripped of key details and published in February.Under a section titled “sober understanding of the situation,” the memo said that “clustered cases suggest that human-to-human transmission is possible.” It singled out the case in Thailand, saying that the situation had “changed significantly” because of the possible spread of the virus abroad.“With the coming of the Spring Festival, many people will be traveling, and the risk of transmission and spread is high,” the memo continued. “All localities must prepare for and respond to a pandemic.”In the memo, Ma demanded officials unite around Xi and made clear that political considerations and social stability were key priorities during the long lead-up to China’s two biggest political meetings of the year in March. While the documents do not spell out why Chinese leaders waited six days to make their concerns public, the meetings may be one reason.“The imperatives for social stability, for not rocking the boat before these important Party congresses is pretty strong,” says Daniel Mattingly, a scholar of Chinese politics at Yale. “My guess is, they wanted to let it play out a little more and see what happened.”In response to the teleconference, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing initiated the highest-level emergency response internally, level one, on Jan. 15. It assigned top CDC leaders to 14 working groups tasked with getting funds, training health workers, collecting data, doing field investigations and supervising laboratories, an internal CDC notice shows. The memo directed Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, to begin temperature checks at airports, bus and train stations, and cut down on large public gatherings.The National Health Commission also distributed a 63-page set of instructions to provincial health officials, obtained by the AP. The instructions ordered health officials nationwide to identify suspected cases, hospitals to open fever clinics, and doctors and nurses to don protective gear. They were marked “internal” — “not to be spread on the internet,” “not to be publicly disclosed.”In public, however, officials continued to downplay the threat, pointing to the 41 cases public at the time.“We have reached the latest understanding that the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low,” Li Qun, the head of the China CDC’s emergency center, told Chinese state television on Jan. 15. That was the same day Li was appointed leader of a group preparing emergency plans for the level one response, a CDC notice shows.On Jan. 20, President Xi issued his first public comments on the virus, saying the outbreak “must be taken seriously” and every possible measure pursued. A leading Chinese epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, announced for the first time that the virus was transmissible from person to person on national television.If the public had been warned a week earlier to take actions such as social distancing, mask wearing and travel restrictions, cases could have been cut by up to two-thirds, one paper later found. An earlier warning could have saved lives, said Zhang, the doctor in Los Angeles.However, other health experts said the government took decisive action in private given the information available to them.“They may not have said the right thing, but they were doing the right thing,” said Ray Yip, the retired founding head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s office in China. “On the 20th, they sounded the alarm for the whole country, which is not an unreasonable delay.”If health officials raise the alarm prematurely, it can damage their credibility — “like crying wolf” —and cripple their ability to mobilize the public, said Benjamin Cowley, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.The delay may support accusations by President Donald Trump that the Chinese government’s secrecy held back the world’s response to the virus. However, even the public announcement on Jan. 20 left the U.S. nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic.During those months, Trump ignored the warnings of his own staff and dismissed the disease as nothing to worry about, while the government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits. Leaders across the world turned a blind eye to the outbreak, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for a strategy of “herd immunity” — before falling ill himself. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sneered at what he called “a little cold.”The early story of the pandemic in China shows missed opportunities at every step, the documents and AP interviews reveal. Under Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, increasing political repression has made officials more hesitant to report cases without a clear green light from the top.“It really increased the stakes for officials, which made them reluctant to step out of line,” said Mattingly, the Yale professor. “It made it harder for people at the local level to report bad information.”Doctors and nurses in Wuhan told Chinese media there were plenty of signs that the coronavirus could be transmitted between people as early as late December. Patients who had never been to the suspected source of the virus, the Huanan Seafood Market, were infected. Medical workers started falling ill.But officials obstructed medical staff who tried to report such cases. They set tight criteria for confirming cases, where patients not only had to test positive, but samples had to be sent to Beijing and sequenced. They required staff to report to supervisors before sending information higher, Chinese media reports show. And they punished doctors for warning about the disease.As a result, no new cases were reported for almost two weeks from Jan. 5, even as officials gathered in Wuhan for Hubei province’s two biggest political meetings of the year, internal China CDC bulletins confirm.During this period, teams of experts dispatched to Wuhan by Beijing said they failed to find clear signs of danger and human-to-human transmission.“China has many years of disease control, there’s absolutely no chance that this will spread widely because of Spring Festival travel,” the head of the first expert team, Xu Jianguo, told Takungpao, a Hong Kong paper, on Jan. 6. He added there was “no evidence of human-to-human transmission” and that the threat from the virus was low.The second expert team, dispatched on Jan. 8, similarly failed to unearth any clear signs of human-to-human transmission. Yet during their stay, more than half a dozen doctors and nurses had already fallen ill with the virus, a retrospective China CDC study published in the New England Journal of Medicine would later show.The teams looked for patients with severe pneumonia, missing those with milder symptoms. They also narrowed the search to those who had visited the seafood market — which was in retrospect a mistake, said Cowling, the Hong Kong epidemiologist, who flew to Beijing to review the cases in late January.In the weeks after the severity of the epidemic became clear, some experts accused Wuhan officials of intentionally hiding cases.“I always suspected it was human-to-human transmissible,” said Wang Guangfa, the leader of the second expert team, in a Mar. 15 post on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform. He fell ill with the virus soon after returning to Beijing on Jan. 16.Wuhan’s then-mayor, Zhou Xianwang, blamed national regulations for the secrecy.“As a local government official, I could disclose information only after being authorized,” Zhou told state media in late January. “A lot of people didn’t understand this.”As a result, top Chinese officials appear to have been left in the dark.“The CDC acted sluggishly, assuming all was fine,” said a state health expert, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution. “If we started to do something a week or two earlier, things could have been so much different.”It wasn’t just Wuhan. In Shenzhen in southern China, hundreds of miles away, a team led by microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung used their own test kits to confirm that six members of a family of seven had the virus on Jan. 12. In an interview with Caixin, a respected Chinese finance magazine, Yuen said he informed CDC branches “of all levels,” including Beijing. But internal CDC numbers did not reflect Yuen’s report, the bulletins show.When the Thai case was reported, health authorities finally drew up an internal plan to systematically identify, isolate, test, and treat all cases of the new coronavirus nationwide.Wuhan’s case count began to climb immediately — four on Jan. 17, then 17 the next day and 136 the day after. Across the country, dozens of cases began to surface, in some cases among patients who were infected earlier but had not yet been tested. In Zhejiang, for example, a man hospitalized on Jan. 4 was only isolated on Jan. 17 and confirmed positive on Jan. 21. In Shenzhen, the patients Yuen discovered on Jan. 12 were finally recorded as confirmed cases on Jan. 19.The elite Peking Union Medical College Hospital held an emergency meeting on Jan. 18, instructing staff to adopt stringent isolation — still before Xi’s public warning. A health expert told AP that on Jan. 19, she toured a hospital built after the SARS outbreak, where medical workers had furiously prepared an entire building with hundreds of beds for pneumonia patients.“Everybody in the country in the infectious disease field knew something was going on,” she said, declining to be named to avoid disrupting sensitive government consultations. “They were anticipating it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hid-truth-about-covid-19-pandemic-from-its-people-for-almost-a-week/story-8CiFkBxJh37CEl67eK5paN.html
15-04-2020||World||UK not to stop WHO funding, but cool on Trump rebuff||The Boris Johnson government on Wednesday refused to comment or criticise US President Donald Trump’s decision to stop funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO), insisting that London would continue to support the UN body.The UK and US have what is called a ‘special relationship’, at times prompting criticism that London closely follows Washington’s foreign policy moves uncritically. Alleging failures in handling the coronavirus pandemic, Trump on Tuesday announced withdrawing funding to WHO.A Downing Street spokesman said: “Our position is that the UK has no plans to stop funding the WHO which has an important role to play in leading the global health response. Coronavirus is a global challenge and it’s essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat”.Asked if the Johnson government is disappointed by Trump’s decision, he added: “I can only set out the UK’s position, and that is that we have no plans to stop funding the World Health Organisation”. The UK contributes over USD 10 million annually to WHO.However, Labour leader Keir Starmer criticised Trump’s decision in a radio interview.“That is completely the wrong thing to do. There needs to be a global response to this, we should be supporting our global institutions”, he told LBC.“We’re about to go on and try and get a vaccine, there should be a global effort to get that vaccine and a global plan as to how we roll that out across the world. This is not the time to be retreating and pulling away from global organisations that help roll that out”.The UK is one of the worst affected countries in Europe, with over 12,000 deaths and over 93,000 cases in hospitals. The figures do not include those passing away or infected in private homes, retirement villages and care homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-not-to-stop-who-funding-but-cool-on-trump-rebuff/story-Kb7ZwaALSyVYS6UhsX6KuO.html

The initial target was soon reached, with £70,000 raised within 24 hours.The figure reached £7 million live on BBC television on Wednesday morning as Moore watched in grateful bewilderment.Moore said: “I think that’s absolutely enormous. At no time when we started off with this exercise did we anticipate we’d get anything near that sort of money…Our brave nurses and doctors are frontline in this case … this time our army are in doctors and nurses uniforms and they’re doing a marvellous job.”“It just shows that people have such high regard for matters of our NHS and it’s really amazing that people have paid so much money. It’s almost unbelievable isn’t it,” he said from his home in Keighley.There is an outpouring of gratitude and concern for NHS staff dealing with tens of thousands of people stricken with coronavirus in the UK. Many have recovered, but over 12,000 people have passed away, as temporary mega hospitals came up in London, Cardiff and elsewhere.Moore’s daughter, Hannah, said her father was overwhelmed when the figure reached the first £1 million, but he responded with a determination to walk more: “He’s a typical Yorkshireman, so he’s very stoic, very controlled and takes everything in his stride.”“We always knew that he was this incredible gem of a man, but we never had any idea that his story would capture the hearts of the nation. We thought we could give people a little bit of happy and we wanted to share a little bit about him, and it has just gone beyond even our wildest, wildest dreams.”The money raised will be donated to NHS Charities Together, a group representing various charity organisations linked to the NHS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-99-veteran-of-world-war-ii-in-india-raises-6-million/story-uvoJrXpI8H7znCIBASn7VI.html

15-04-2020||World||South Korea holds parliamentary election under strict safety measures amid pandemic||South Koreans began going to the polls on Wednesday to elect members of parliament, wearing masks and plastic gloves as part of strict safety measures in one of the first national elections held amid the coronavirus pandemic. About 14,000 polling stations were open at 6 a.m. (2100 GMT Tuesday) around the country after disinfection, and voters were required to wear a mask and have a temperature check upon arrival. Anyone whose temperature was higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) was led to a special booth. All voters must use hand sanitizer and plastic gloves when casting ballots and maintain 1 metre (40 inches) distance between each other. The election is set to decide control of parliament and shape President Moon Jae-in’s ability to push through his agenda in the final two years of his administration, including looser fiscal policy aimed at creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, and continued re-engagement with North Korea.Globally, South Korea was one of the first countries to hold a national election since the coronavirus epidemic began, while many others postponed votes. “I had worries as the election was not delayed, but having come here and seen for myself, I felt it’s good we did vote as planned, and people are taking greater caution about distancing and restraining themselves even more,” Choi Sun-hwa, 56, told Reuters outside a polling station in Hongje-dong, central Seoul. Once grappling with the first large outbreak outside China, South Korea has largely managed to bring its cases under control without major disruptions thanks to a massive testing campaign and intensive contact tracing.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing the total infections to 10,564. The daily tally has hovered around 30 over the past week, most of them from overseas travellers. But authorities have warned that infections could resurge at any times, calling for special caution on Election Day. As of 9 a.m. (0000 GMT), voter turnout was 8%, about 0.9% points higher than in the last parliamentary election in 2016, according to the National Election Commission. That excludes nearly 27% of the 44 million registered voters who took part in early voting last weekend. Among them were about 2,800 coronavirus patients, for whom the NEC allowed voting by mail and set up special polling stations for early voting.More than 13,000 in self-quarantine have signed up to vote and will be allowed to do so after other voters leave at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT)The election campaign has taken on a different look, with candidates wearing masks and bumping fists instead of pressing the flesh and mass rallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-holds-parliamentary-election-under-strict-safety-measures-amid-pandemic/story-z6LlIAEwNtEkGmZKWIQ0iI.html

With more than half of the globe under lockdown, one of the sectors to take a massive hit is the tourism industry. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), the tourism sector accounts for one in ten jobs across the globe but due to the coronavirus crisis, as much as 75% of it under threat. “Research conducted by WTTC shows that 75 million Travel & Tourism jobs are at risk globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least 6.4 million losses across the EU, and one million in the UK,” mentions WTTC on its webpage.The coronavirus pandemic has shut the tourism sector and countries like Spain and Italy, that depend massively on their tourism industry, have taken a huge hit.According to WTTC data, Spain and Italy, two of the European nations to have borne a severe brunt of the coronavirus outbreak, reap close to 15% of their total GDP from the tourism sector. As per the 2019 figures, Spain accrued nearly 14% to its GDP through its tourism and travel sector. For Italy, the figure stood at around 13%.Other nations with a significant hit to their travel and tourism sector include China, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. All these nations have around 8-10%, more for some countries, of their GDPs benefit from the tourism sector. Coronavirus cases have crossed over 2 million worldwide. Over one lakh people have lost their lives to the deadly contagion that originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan last year in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-lockdown-paralyses-tourism-worldwide-spain-and-italy-worst-hit/story-ylIqoyjM8zela8BCBX0uXJ.html

While the documents do not spell out why Chinese leaders waited six days to make their concerns public, the meetings may be one reason.“The imperatives for social stability, for not rocking the boat before these important Party congresses is pretty strong,” says Daniel Mattingly, a scholar of Chinese politics at Yale. “My guess is, they wanted to let it play out a little more and see what happened.”In response to the teleconference, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing initiated the highest-level emergency response internally, level one, on Jan. 15. It assigned top CDC leaders to 14 working groups tasked with getting funds, training health workers, collecting data, doing field investigations and supervising laboratories, an internal CDC notice shows. The memo directed Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, to begin temperature checks at airports, bus and train stations, and cut down on large public gatherings.The National Health Commission also distributed a 63-page set of instructions to provincial health officials, obtained by the AP. The instructions ordered health officials nationwide to identify suspected cases, hospitals to open fever clinics, and doctors and nurses to don protective gear. They were marked “internal” — “not to be spread on the internet,” “not to be publicly disclosed.”In public, however, officials continued to downplay the threat, pointing to the 41 cases public at the time.“We have reached the latest understanding that the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is low,” Li Qun, the head of the China CDC’s emergency center, told Chinese state television on Jan. 15. That was the same day Li was appointed leader of a group preparing emergency plans for the level one response, a CDC notice shows.On Jan. 20, President Xi issued his first public comments on the virus, saying the outbreak “must be taken seriously” and every possible measure pursued. A leading Chinese epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, announced for the first time that the virus was transmissible from person to person on national television.If the public had been warned a week earlier to take actions such as social distancing, mask wearing and travel restrictions, cases could have been cut by up to two-thirds, one paper later found. An earlier warning could have saved lives, said Zhang, the doctor in Los Angeles.However, other health experts said the government took decisive action in private given the information available to them.“They may not have said the right thing, but they were doing the right thing,” said Ray Yip, the retired founding head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s office in China. “On the 20th, they sounded the alarm for the whole country, which is not an unreasonable delay.”If health officials raise the alarm prematurely, it can damage their credibility — “like crying wolf” — and cripple their ability to mobilize the public, said Benjamin Cowley, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.The delay may support accusations by President Donald Trump that the Chinese government’s secrecy held back the world’s response to the virus. However, even the public announcement on Jan. 20 left the U.S. nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic.During those months, Trump ignored the warnings of his own staff and dismissed the disease as nothing to worry about, while the government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits. Leaders across the world turned a blind eye to the outbreak, with British prime minister Boris Johnson calling for a strategy of “herd immunity” — before falling ill himself. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro sneered at what he called “a little cold.”The early story of the pandemic in China shows missed opportunities at every step, the documents and AP interviews reveal. Under Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, increasing political repression has made officials more hesitant to report cases without a clear green light from the top.“It really increased the stakes for officials, which made them reluctant to step out of line,” said Mattingly, the Yale professor. “It made it harder for people at the local level to report bad information.”Doctors and nurses in Wuhan told Chinese media there were plenty of signs that the coronavirus could be transmitted between people as early as late December. Patients who had never been to the suspected source of the virus, the Huanan Seafood Market, were infected. Medical workers started falling ill.But officials obstructed medical staff who tried to report such cases. They set tight criteria for confirming cases, where patients not only had to test positive, but samples had to be sent to Beijing and sequenced. They required staff to report to supervisors before sending information higher, Chinese media reports show. And they punished doctors for warning about the disease.As a result, no new cases were reported for almost two weeks from Jan. 5, even as officials gathered in Wuhan for Hubei province’s two biggest political meetings of the year, internal China CDC bulletins confirm.During this period, teams of experts dispatched to Wuhan by Beijing said they failed to find clear signs of danger and human-to-human transmission.“China has many years of disease control, there’s absolutely no chance that this will spread widely because of Spring Festival travel,” the head of the first expert team, Xu Jianguo, told Takungpao, a Hong Kong paper, on Jan. 6. He added there was “no evidence of human-to-human transmission” and that the threat from the virus was low.The second expert team, dispatched on Jan. 8, similarly failed to unearth any clear signs of human-to-human transmission. Yet during their stay, more than half a dozen doctors and nurses had already fallen ill with the virus, a retrospective China CDC study published in the New England Journal of Medicine would later show.The teams looked for patients with severe pneumonia, missing those with milder symptoms. They also narrowed the search to those who had visited the seafood market — which was in retrospect a mistake, said Cowling, the Hong Kong epidemiologist, who flew to Beijing to review the cases in late January.In the weeks after the severity of the epidemic became clear, some experts accused Wuhan officials of intentionally hiding cases.“I always suspected it was human-to-human transmissible,” said Wang Guangfa, the leader of the second expert team, in a Mar. 15 post on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform. He fell ill with the virus soon after returning to Beijing on Jan. 16.Wuhan’s then-mayor, Zhou Xianwang, blamed national regulations for the secrecy.“As a local government official, I could disclose information only after being authorized,” Zhou told state media in late January. “A lot of people didn’t understand this.”As a result, top Chinese officials appear to have been left in the dark.“The CDC acted sluggishly, assuming all was fine,” said a state health expert, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution. “If we started to do something a week or two earlier, things could have been so much different.”It wasn’t just Wuhan. In Shenzhen in southern China, hundreds of miles away, a team led by microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung used their own test kits to confirm that six members of a family of seven had the virus on Jan. 12. In an interview with Caixin, a respected Chinese finance magazine, Yuen said he informed CDC branches “of all levels,” including Beijing. But internal CDC numbers did not reflect Yuen’s report, the bulletins show.When the Thai case was reported, health authorities finally drew up an internal plan to systematically identify, isolate, test, and treat all cases of the new coronavirus nationwide.Wuhan’s case count began to climb immediately — four on Jan. 17, then 17 the next day and 136 the day after. Across the country, dozens of cases began to surface, in some cases among patients who were infected earlier but had not yet been tested. In Zhejiang, for example, a man hospitalized on Jan. 4 was only isolated on Jan. 17 and confirmed positive on Jan. 21. In Shenzhen, the patients Yuen discovered on Jan. 12 were finally recorded as confirmed cases on Jan. 19.The elite Peking Union Medical College Hospital held an emergency meeting on Jan. 18, instructing staff to adopt stringent isolation — still before Xi’s public warning. A health expert told AP that on Jan. 19, she toured a hospital built after the SARS outbreak, where medical workers had furiously prepared an entire building with hundreds of beds for pneumonia patients.“Everybody in the country in the infectious disease field knew something was going on,” she said, declining to be named to avoid disrupting sensitive government consultations. “They were anticipating it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-china-didn-t-warn-public-of-likely-pandemic-for-6-key-days/story-S5iwNcFHTbSzFcTs7nhGhL.html
15-04-2020||World||China’s recent Covid-19 cases jump to 1,500 amid exodus of Chinese from Russia||China’s has reported 46 new coronavirus cases, including 10 domestic infections, with health experts saying that the increasing number of local transmissions in the country’s northeast bordering Russia remained a concern following the return of Chinese nationals from abroad.China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday that 46 new confirmed cases mostly from Chinese coming from abroad were reported on Tuesday taking the total number of recent cases to 1,500. This included 10 new local infections.Health experts said that the Suifenhe city at the China-Russia border might become another Wuhan amid sharp increase of Covid-19 cases following an exodus of Chinese nationals from Russia. Also on Tuesday, 57 new asymptomatic cases were reported taking their total to 1,023, the NHC said.Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.The total death toll in China went up on Tuesday to 3,342 with one death reported from the epicentre Hubei Province.The overall confirmed cases in China reached 82,295 by Tuesday. This included 3,342 people who died of Covid-19,1,137 patients still being treated and 77,816 people discharged after the treatment.Also, as of Tuesday 1,012 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, 45 in Macao and 393 in Taiwan including six deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Meanwhile, frontline Chinese health experts coping with soaring cases of Covid-19 at the China-Russia border in China’s Heilongjiang province and Suifenhe city which are facing increasing pressure of imported and local cases ruled out becoming China’s next Wuhan where virus was reported in December last year.Concerns were heightened as Heilongjiang province reported 79 new imported infections of Chinese coming from Russia on Monday through border city Suifenhe.It was the highest one-day rise in imported cases for the city with only 70,000 people, the Daily report said.Neither Suifenhe nor Harbin, cities near the Russian border, which are in midst of an escalating epidemic, will become the next Wuhan as there are no large-scale domestic cases in the two places and their impact on other regions is limited and under control, Yang Yanjie, deputy head of the expert group for epidemiological investigation of Covid-19 in Heilongjiang told state-run Global Times daily.Yu Kaijiang, head of the expert group for medical treatment in Suifenhe, said that the situation is stable and controllable, as the Suifenhe port remains closed. Heilongjiang province announced on Sunday the passenger channel of Suifenhe border port with Russia would remain closed.“It is normal to have resurgence after a great epidemic as a virus cannot be eliminated completely within a short time,” Yu noted. The current medical care situation is adequate to cover the current increase in imported cases, Yu said.“We are also preparing back-up designated hospitals, ensuring that more beds will be made available,” Yu said, noting that the testing capability is meeting the demand and reaching 1,000 people per day.Hao Jun, a researcher from the Heilongjiang authority, said on Tuesday that according to their epidemiological investigation, most of the 366 imported cases from Suifenhe port were infected at the Lyublino Market and Sadavod Market in Moscow, where they worked. Hao said as returnees from Russia share an enclosed space for a long time during their journeys and have close contact, the risk of infection increased.He suggested that overseas Chinese in Russia enhance self-protection and not enter China through Suifenhe to avoid the risk of being infected during the journey.Suifenhe city has 1,479 people under collective quarantine. Local officials said Monday that 15-20 percent of the people may test positive, the Global Times report said. China has rushed specialised medical teams to border city to deal with an increasing number of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-recent-covid-19-cases-jump-to-1-500-amid-exodus-of-chinese-from-russia/story-vwJEl11SP6Q5VICu3pNHIP.html

Those present at a press conference after the meeting included representatives from the Jamiat-e-ulema Islam, Jamiat-e-ulema Pakistan, Jamaat-i-Islami and Tanzeem-e-Islami among other religious parties. The decision came despite announcement by Prime Minister Imran Khan to meet the clerics in order to discuss the issue of gathering in mosques in the holy month of Ramazan which will start from April 25.On Monday, over 53 senior clerics of Rawalpindi and Islamabad belonging to the Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia held a meeting in Jamia Darul Uloom Zakria here to discuss the ban on prayer congregations, the Dawn News reported.The Monday meeting -- attended by clerics representing various seminaries, banned groups, proscribed persons and political and non-political parties -- warned the authorities against the ban and said government leaders should abide by religious norms and seek forgiveness.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The warning came before the government could come up with a plan to curb the spread of COVID-19 during the holy month of Ramazan.Pir Azizur Rehman Hazarvi, president of the Jamia Darul Uloom Zakaria in Islamabad, said, “The closure of mosques, shutting down Friday prayers and Taraweeh is unacceptable to the countrymen.” Hazarvi, who is also the patron of Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), insisted that in order to get rid of the virus, it was imperative to seek forgiveness from Allah and increase the populace in mosques. A video clip released by the clerics on Tuesday showed leaders of various political and non-political organisations -- including JUI-F, Aalmi Tanzeem Khatam-i-Nabuwat, seminaries such as Taleem ul Quran Raja Bazar and a representative of banned group Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat -- sitting in close proximity of each other. The meeting did not acknowledge the official directives of a maximum of five persons inside mosques for the collective prayers as the clerics said that the testing times demanded more time for prayers and announced that apart from the five times prayers, Friday and Taraweeh congregations will continue. The clerics, however, agreed to take precautionary measures like use of hand sanitisers, removal of rugs and carpets, washing of floors, cleaning of hands with soaps and social distancing. Hazarvi said, “The senior clerics have noted that all efforts will be made to avoid clash and confrontations with the government and the state institutions.” Lal Masjid’s cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz also continued to challenge the authority of Islamabad Capital Territoty (ICT) administration by openly flouting the stipulated precautionary measures, the report said Every week, Aziz releases footages of huge congregations gathered for Friday prayers, denouncing the restrictions imposed by the government. As a result, the number of mosques organising large Friday congregations is increasing in Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pak-clerics-to-resume-congregational-prayers-in-mosques-despite-ban/story-wyHUbKXeRbq6qf7XZBHNLM.html

Reuters news agency reported the real toll was far in excess as it did not include the 3,700 deaths in New York City that had been presumed to be coronavirus-related but had not been tested.The surge in cases and deaths came amidst growing optimism that the country may be nearing the peak after which these numbers will begin to go down. Officials have cited the flattening of the curve in some hotspots such as New York and New Jersey, among signs that give them hope.The Trump administration has been pushing for reopening the country, the society and the economy. The president announced Tuesday bipartisan groups of advisers he will be consulting to shortly determine the way forward. The decision to end or continue social-distancing and other mitigation efforts would rest ultimately with state governors.The president acknowledged as much at the daily briefing Tuesday, dialling down an escalating feud with governors, some of whom have publicly pushed back against his claims of “total” authority in deciding when to end the mitigation measures and threatened to defy him if he persisted.But the president predictably dialled up his spat with the World Health Organization, which is in the middle of leading a global response to the epidemic that had hit nearly 160 countries, killed more than quarter of a million people and infected close to two million people.“We have not been treated properly,” Trump said, as he announced the suspension of the US funding, which is around $450 million, for a period of 60 to 90 days.During the duration of the hold, the president said, the United States will conduct a review to “assess the World Health Organization’s role and severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus”.The president accused the WHO of not alerting the world about the critical significance of the outbreak, opposing his administration’s ban on foreigners travelling from China and then for siding with China and helping it conceal the true extent of its outbreak; a list of complaints he has aired before.The president has come under mounting criticism for his administration’s delayed and botched response to the outbreak, stemming in part from his own reluctance to acknowledge the seriousness of the impending crisis and delaying mitigation efforts till much after the first cases and fatalities.Trump’s criticism of the WHO of its response to the outbreak and then papering over China’s suppression of numbers run counter to his own praise for both the world body and China. “CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) & World Health have been working hard and very smart,” he tweeted in February. And he has praised China often in tweets and remarks.President Trump has severe US ties with a number of world bodies or scaled them down now: the Paris Accord on climate change (2017), UNESCO (2017), Iran deal (2018) and UNHCR (2018). The president has complained about US contributions to world bodies such as the United Nations.In another development, the Washington Post reported that President Trump’s name will be printed on cheques the US treasury will be sending to American families as part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package. This has been called an unprecedented move intended to derive political capital from what was actually a bipartisan effort, supported by both parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-single-day-covid-19-death-toll-in-us-trump-puts-who-funding-on-hold/story-ylCHmVVaDAuTUO1BuVVRqM.html

As of Tuesday, more than 6,05,000 Americans had tested positive for the novel coronavirus -- more than the other top three countries taken together -- according to Johns Hopkins University. A record number of 2,129 of Americans died in one single day, the previous highest being 2,074 on April 10. New York has become the epicentre of the country’s outbreak with 2,03,020 confirmed cases and 10,842 deaths so far. In total, 25,981 Americans have died due to the deadly virus, Johns Hopkins University said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus. We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness, we can see the rays of light,” US President Donald Trump told reporters during his daily White House news conference on the pandemic. “We see that tunnel, and at the end of that tunnel, we see light. We are starting to see it more than ever before. We have held our numbers, everything we have done we have been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it,” he said. Trump said the United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation. “We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain,” he said.There are more than 16,000 ventilators at hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not in use at this moment, he said referring to the steps he has taken to fight coronavirus in the country. The US Food and Drug Administration, he said, has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  “It is the first one.

The DHS also continues to take action to protect the American people and our communities and is considering a number of policies and procedures to improve the employment opportunities of US workers during this pandemic,” it said.“Generally, non-immigrants must depart the United States before their authorised period of admission expires. However, we recognise that non-immigrants may unexpectedly remain in the United States beyond their authorised period of stay due to Covid-19,” the notification said, adding that people could apply for a visa extension.If applicants put in their forms within the specified time frame, their presence will not be taken as “unlawful” and where applicable, “employment authorisation with the same employer, subject to the same terms and conditions of the prior approval, is automatically extended for up to 240 days when an extension of stay request is filed on time,” the notification said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The US Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) added it “reminds petitioners and applicants that it can consider delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic when deciding whether to excuse delays in filing documents based on extraordinary circumstances.” According to rules, if an employer terminates the contract of an H-1B holder, the employee needs to find new employment within 60 days, in order to retain the visa status. Indian IT workers have been seeking an extension of this 60 day grace period to 180 days.According to the USCIS, Indians are the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extension-of-non-immigrant-visa-holders-in-us-on-case-by-case-basis-uscis/story-sG0jCWrfwIP9rs1hFU75oK.html
15-04-2020||World||Stranded Canadians returning home to face strict action on not following self-isolation||Even as the seventh special flight bringing Canadians stranded in India back to the country departed on Tuesday, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a stern warning for those returning from abroad – if they don’t have a viable self-isolation plan in place, the Government may place them in a facility other than their residences for the mandatory 14-day period in the view of coronavirus crisis.The Canadian Government had put in place those mandatory self-isolation rules on March 25 but they have now been strengthened under the Quarantine Act. On their arrival in Canada, the returning travellers will have to convince authorities they have a suitable place to self-isolate for two weeks. “We now have the authority to require them to self-isolate for two weeks in a quarantine location, like a hotel,” Trudeau said during his daily media briefing related to the Covid-19 crisis.A residence may also be found unsuitable if it also houses those who may be vulnerable to the coronavirus like “elderly family members” or if the returnees do have a “set destination,” Trudeau said.Law enforcement has been tasked with conducting periodic checks like verifying that such returnees are following the self-isolation rules. Canada has barred foreign nationals from the country, except for Americans, and is only allowing in citizens, permanent residents or their immediate relatives.More stringent measures may have been necessitated by the attitude of some of those returning to Canada. As the country’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam said, “We do every day find people who haven’t answered our phone calls and have to be chased down.”So far, seven flights have left from India after the lockdown was announced. The latest departed from Amritsar. Other flights, chartered to repatriate Canadians, took off from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.Trudeau had even earlier flagged concerns over those returning to the country. As he said earlier this month, “They pose a real risk, not just to their neighbours and their loved ones, but to our entire country. We need to ensure and we will ensure that those people are properly isolated.”Violating the Quarantine Act in Canada could attract penalties ranging from CA $750,000 to CA $1 million and between six months to three years in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-stranded-canadians-returning-home-to-face-strict-action-on-not-following-self-isolation/story-mppUgPXq98xv9BlzlWid4K.html

The academic session only begins in late August.There are an estimated 250,000 Indian students in the US.Many of them were able to get back home before India shut down its airspace on March 22. However, hundreds of Indian students, many with meager resources, have been left stranded.Indian-American hotel owners have come to their rescue by offering them free accommodation and free meals in many cases.The USCIS said that their off-campus work authorisation application, which would allow them to work anywhere in the US, must be signed by their educational institution.Under normal circumstances, international students are allowed to work within the university campus and that too for a limited number of hours per month.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Your Form I-20 (application) must include the employment page completed by your Designated School Official, certifying your eligibility for off-campus employment due to severe economic hardships caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond your control.“If your request is approved, you may be able to work off-campus in one-year intervals up to the expected date of completion of your current course of study,” the USCIS said.It said that Special Student Relief is the suspension of certain regulatory requirements by the secretary of Homeland Security for F 1 students from parts of the world that are experiencing emergent circumstances.Examples of emergent circumstances include natural catastrophe, war and military conflicts, and national or international financial crises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-stranded-foreign-students-can-apply-for-off-campus-work-authorisation-us/story-U4Pd2JBfPyRsPxRG4TAd3J.html
15-04-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Health care workers are 10%-20% of US coronavirus cases, says officials||Between 10% and 20% of US coronavirus cases are health care workers, though they tended to be hospitalized at lower rates than other patients, officials reported Tuesday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first national data on how the pandemic is hitting doctors, nurses and other health care professionals.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The data is important new information but not necessarily surprising, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, who is running the federal agency’s response to the outbreak. Medical staff have also been hit hard in other countries, including Italy and Spain.As of the middle of last week, the CDC had reports of more than 315,000 cases in the US The new report focused on about 49,000 for which researchers had data on whether or not they worked in health care. About 9,300, or 19%, of them were medical professionals. That included 27 who died.But the data varied in how complete it was, researchers said. In 12 states that did a better job reporting on whether patients worked in medicine, around 11% of cases were health care workers.Compared with US cases overall, larger proportions of diagnosed health care workers were women, were white, and were young or middle-aged adults. That’s consistent with the demographics of who works in health care, researchers said.About 10% of the health care workers were hospitalized with symptoms, compared with 21% to 31% of overall cases. That may reflect the younger age of the workers, as well as prioritization of testing for health care employees, the report said.Slightly more than half of a group of infected health care workers studied said their only known exposure to the virus was at work, but researchers say it’s hard to know for sure how different people caught the bug.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage A second report released Tuesday looked at three health care workers who became infected after treating a patient in Solano County, California, in what was one of the first instances of disease spread to medical personnel in the US Workers didn’t initially know the patient was infected with the coronavirus.

Ontario premier Doug Ford said Ontario’s schools will not reopen on May 4 as it is too soon to relax measures as the province continues to fight the new coronavirus.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “Everyone is very interested to know when things are going to get back to normal, when they’ll be able to go back to work,” Trudeau said. “The reality is, it is going to be weeks still. We recognize that it is going to be important to get our economy going and we will have to do it in phases.” Canada has more than 26,880 confirmed cases including 898 deaths. More than half the deaths in the country have occurred in long-term care homes.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. Trudeau also said that anyone returning from overseas without a credible isolation plan will be required to quarantine in a hotel.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  The new rule begins at midnight. Trudeau said an inadequate plan includes those who plan stay with many elderly family members. The federal government will pay the costs. The US-Canada border remains closed to all nonessential travel. Canada is still receiving repatriation flights for Canadians who have been stranded abroad. Trudeau said travel restrictions will remain for many weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-candian-pm-justin-trudeau-says-weeks-before-economy-can-restart/story-Y2fyWy32ctiZbymYYbZThJ.html
15-04-2020||World||New figures suggest UK death toll higher than 12,000||New figures released on Tuesday based on death certificates suggest the death toll from coronavirus in the UK is nearly 15 per cent higher than that announced daily on the basis of deaths in hospitals alone, as officials saw a 35% drop in GDP in Q2.The higher figures relate to those passing away in private homes, care homes and hospices – a sector that campaigners allege has been ‘air-brushed’ in the daily discourse. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says the virus was mentioned on 3,475 death certificates in the week ending April 3.ONS statistician Nick Strike said: “When looking at data for England, this is 15% higher than the NHS numbers as they include all mentions of Covid-19 on the death certificate, including suspected Covid-19, as well as deaths in the community.”The cumulative figures from hospitals on Tuesday were 12,107 dead and 93,873 cases. Campaigners called for similar daily release of figures from care homes and retirement villages.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab chaired another core meeting in Downing Street on Tuesday; he is likely to announce a date on Thursday until when the current restrictions would continue. The Office of Budget responsibility put the impact of current lockdown at a 35% GDP drop in the second quarter.Groups such as Age UK, Marie Curie, Care England, Independent Age and the Alzheimer’s Society have written to health secretary Matt Hancock, demanding a care package to support social care through the pandemic, besides a daily update on deaths in the care system.According to Age UK, coronavirus is “running wild” in care homes for the elderly, while Care England estimates nearly 1,000 deaths from the virus in care homes. Nearly 4.1 lakh people live in 11,300 care homes in the UK.Meanwhile. Heathrow airport announced that in March passenger numbers shrunk by 52% compared to the same time last year. The situation is expected to continue as initial forecasts show passenger demand in April is set to decrease by over 90%, with lasting and significant industry-wide effects predicted. It is operating on a single runway.Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “Heathrow continues to serve the nation by keeping vital supply lines open, and helping people get home. Now is the time to agree a common international standard for healthcare screening in airports so that when this crisis recedes, people can travel with confidence and we can get the British economy moving again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-figures-suggest-uk-death-toll-higher-than-12-000/story-cgv4AjEjOvhs8HzcDaOlyI.html

These aren’t any particularly big, big missiles,” Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley said. While the Pentagon was still analysing its data, “I don’t think it’s particularly provocative or threatening to us,” Milley said. “It may be tied to some celebrations that are happening inside North Korea, as opposed to any deliberate provocation against us.” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs said the North earlier Tuesday fired what were believed to be short-range cruise missiles from Munchon into the sea, one day before Seoul holds parliamentary elections. The firing also came a day before the nuclear-armed North marks the 108th anniversary of the birth of founder Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong Un.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aren-t-any-particularly-big-us-downplays-north-korea-s-suspected-missile-launches/story-YQejWGKXXd0am9KtE7DSBI.html

Second Lieutenant Ermando Piveta, who served in the Brazilian artillery in Africa during World War II, was brought out of the Armed Forces Hospital in Brasilia to a burst of trumpet music and applause. Wearing an army-green side cap, he raised his arms in the air as he left the hospital after eight days as a patient. “He won another battle, this time against the new coronavirus. He was released from hospital the same day Brazil is commemorating the 75th anniversary of its troops’ successful campaign in the Battle of Montese in Italy during World War II,” the army said in a statement. Piveta served in the army’s fourth artillery regiment, which trained in Dakar in 1942, soon after Brazil entered the war on the side of the Allies, the army said.He then returned to Brazil with his regiment to defend the country from an Axis invasion that never came to be. Brazil is the hardest-hit country in Latin America in the coronavirus pandemic, with 1,532 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/99-year-old-wwii-vet-beats-coronavirus-in-brazil/story-SjNdmkdCv5uWWTstXxG4cM.html
15-04-2020||World||World grapples with Covid-19 as number of cases nears 2 million||The coronavirus has infected nearly 2 million people around the world, nearing a grim milestone that exposes the difficulty of trying to contain the pathogen. Covid-19 has already claimed more than 123,000 lives worldwide.What began as a mysterious pneumonia-like illness in Wuhan, China, late last year has morphed into a global health crisis that has threatened health systems and economies alike.It took about four months for the virus to infect 1 million people, on April 3, and just over a week for that number to almost double. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday the coronavirus is 10 times more deadly than swine flu. “We know that it spreads fast, and we know that it is deadly, 10 times deadlier than the 2009 pandemic,” he said.In Canada, where the outbreak made a slow start, the death toll has now surpassed the worst-case scenario presented by the government last week.China has reportedly approved two new potential vaccines for human trials, adding that one more vaccine developed by military scientists was allowed on Tuesday to proceed to the second stage of clinical trials. The two new vaccines are being developed by a Beijing-based unit of Nasdaq-listed Sinovac Biotech, and by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-grapples-with-covid-19-as-death-toll-nears-2-million/story-IsWEzdopxyJZUCP0j3xC5H.html
15-04-2020||World||On-off social distancing may be needed until 2022: Harvard study||A one-time lockdown won’t halt the novel coronavirus and repeated periods of social distancing may be required into 2022 to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, Harvard scientists who modeled the pandemic’s trajectory said Tuesday.Their study comes as the US enters the peak of its Covid-19 caseload and states eye an eventual easing of tough lockdown measures.The Harvard team’s computer simulation, which was published in a paper in the journal Science, assumed that Covid-19 will become seasonal, like closely related coronaviruses that cause the common cold, with higher transmission rates in colder months.But much remains unknown, including the level of immunity acquired by previous infection and how long it lasts, the authors said.“We found that one-time social distancing measures are likely to be insufficient to maintain the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 within the limits of critical care capacity in the United States,” lead author Stephen Kissler said in a call with reporters. “What seems to be necessary in the absence of other sorts of treatments are intermittent social distancing periods,” he added.Widespread viral testing would be required in order to determine when the thresholds to re-trigger distancing are crossed, said the authors.The duration and intensity of lockdowns can be relaxed as treatments and vaccines become available. But in their absence, on and then off distancing would give hospitals time to increase critical care capacity to cater for the surge in cases that would occur when the measures are eased.“By permitting periods of transmission that reach higher prevalence than otherwise would be possible, they allow an accelerated acquisition of herd immunity,” said co-author Marc Lipsitch.Conversely, too much social distancing without respite can be a bad thing. Under one modeled scenario “the social distancing was so effective that virtually no population immunity is built,” the paper said, hence the need for an intermittent approach.The authors acknowledged a major drawback in their model is how little we currently know about how strong a previously infected person’s immunity is and how long it lasts.- Virus likely here to stay -At present the best guesses based on closely-related coronaviruses are that it will confer some immunity, for up to about a year. There might also be some cross-protective immunity against Covid-19 if a person is infected by a common cold-causing betacoronavirus.One thing however is almost certain: the virus is here to stay. The team said it was highly unlikely that immunity will be strong enough and last long enough that Covid-19 will die out after an initial wave, as was the case with the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003.Antibody tests that have just entered the market and look for whether a person has been previously infected will be crucial in answering these vital questions about immunity, they argued, and a vaccine remains the ultimate weapon.Outside experts praised the paper even as they emphasized how much remained unknown.“This is an excellent study that uses mathematical models to explore the dynamics of Covid-19 over a period of several years, in contrast to previously published studies that have focused on the coming weeks or months,” Mark Woolhouse, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh said.“It is important to recognize that it is a model; it is consistent with current data but is nonetheless based on a series of assumptions -- for example about acquired immunity -- that are yet to be confirmed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-off-social-distancing-may-be-needed-until-2022-harvard-study/story-yZmQYN9dshD24fnelIgZhO.html

We have to remember today that the balance between the state and the federal articulated in the constitution is the essence of our democracy.“We don’t a have a king in this country, we didn’t want a king so we have a constitution and we elect the president,” Cuomo said in his daily coronavirus briefing.Trump had said that when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total and that is the way it has got to be.Also read| ‘Need to review WHO’s role in mismanaging Covid-19 spread’: Trump halts funding“The authority of the President of the United States having to do with the subject we’re talking about is total,” he had said, adding that “They can’t do anything without the approval of the President of the United States”.Cuomo said the President’s comment that he has total authority for determining how and when states reopen “is not an accurate statement in my opinion.” He said Trump’s remarks that he has total authority over the states and the nation “cannot go uncorrected. It’s just a factual statement that is factually wrong.” “That statement cannot stand. It is not only violative of the constitution, it is violative of the very concept of democracy,” he said.Cuomo said the total number of hospitalisations continues to go down and remains flat, a good sign “we think we are at the apex on the plateau.” New York state recorded 778 more deaths on April 13, taking the death toll to 10,834.“You look at the past few days and the number of lives lost, it’s basically flat at a devastating level of pain and grief,” he said, adding that other evidence suggests that the state is seeing a flattening of the curve.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageCuomo said in his briefing on Monday that the “President was clearly unhappy.” The Governor also referred to a number of tweets by Trump attacking him and state governors.“Cuomo’s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc. I got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!” a tweet by Trump read.Another tweet said: “Tell the Democrat Governors that ‘Mutiny On The Bounty’ was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!” Cuomo said he did not follow the exact meaning of the tweet but added that he understood that Trump was not happy with Governors.“The President is clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue. The worst thing we can do in all of this is start with political division and start with partisanship.Also read: US nears Covid-19 peak, Trump feuds with governors on reopening“The best thing we have done throughout this past 44 days is we work together and we haven’t raised political flags,” Cuomo said, adding that even though this is an election year, “we said not here, not in this. This is too important for anyone to play politics.” Cuomo recalled that he had seen a poster in his grade school which had the message “suppose they gave a war and nobody came”, meaning that “what would happen if people just refused to engage, refused to fight.” He said sometimes it is better to walk away from a fight than engage in it.“Sometimes it takes more strength frankly to walk away from a fight than engage in it. The President will have no fight with me. I will not engage in it,” Cuomo said, adding that he has been clear “this is not about me, it’s about we.” The Governor said this is no time for politics and no time to fight.“I put my hand out in total partnership and cooperation with the President. If he wants a fight, he is not going to get it from me. Period,” he said.Cuomo warned that there is a real challenge ahead and just because the curve appears to be flattening, it does not mean one can relax.“We are not out of the woods. In this reopening, we could lose all the progress we made in one week if we do it wrong,” he said.The Governors of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Delaware have joined forces to coordinate a regional plan for restoring the economy ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and getting people back to work, Cuomo said, adding that the “worst is over” for the state.Cuomo along with New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, Delaware Governor John Carney and Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo on Monday announced the creation of a multi-state council.The coordinating group will comprise one health expert, an economic development expert and the respective Chief of Staff from each state and will work together to develop a fully integrated regional framework to gradually lift the states’ stay at home orders while minimising the risk of increased spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-us-doesn-t-have-a-king-ny-guv-s-comeback-to-trump-s-total-authority-remark/story-YuRT1IrO0dMcEFAKuKvbFI.html

15-04-2020||India||11 held for instigating migrant workers to gather at Bandra||Mumbai: Eleven people, including a journalist with a Marathi news channel, were on Wednesday arrested for allegedly spreading rumours that the state was running a special train for migrant workers, which led to around 1,000 of them gathering at the Bandra railway station on Tuesday, defying the nationwide lockdown.The large gathering eventually forced the Mumbai Police to resort to lathi-charge to disperse the migrants — most of them from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal — who were demanding the state help them return home. This was hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the coronavirus-enforced nationwide lockdown to May 3. An FIR was registered on Tuesday against 700 people at Bandra police station, under which nine people were arrested, and another two FIRs were filed on Wenesday . Vijayalaxmi Hiremath, senior police inspector at Bandra police station, confirmed the arrests.On Wednesday, an FIR was filed against Vinay Dubey, a resident of Navi Mumbai, who uploaded a video on social media, telling migrant workers from north India to gather at Kurla Terminus on April 18 to demand that they be sent back to their homes. Dubey, booked under sections 117, 153(a), 188, 269, 270, 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, was detained from Navi Mumbai late on Tuesday. Another FIR was against Rahul Kulkarni, a journalist with a Marathi news channel, for running a report, stating that a special train will run for migrant workers, said Bandra police officers. Kulkarni was arrested in the afternoon. “He will be produced in court tomorrow,” said Hiremath.Later in the day, nine people —Mohammad Amruddin, 35; Saif Hussein Shaikh, 36; Alam Mohammad Salim Shaikh, 28; Shamsher Ali Amir Ali Malik, 36; Helal Hakimuddin Ali, 32; Mohammad Shahid Ibrahim Shaikh, 29; Mohammad Arshad Mohammad Anvar Shaikh, 26; Altabash Chhotu Shaikh,28 and Firoz Sailchul Shaikh, 20 — were arrested from Shastri Nagar in Bandra (West). All the accused were arrested as per the FIR lodged on Tuesday.Kulkarni has been booked under sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) 505 (b) (with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against the public tranquillity), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) 117 (abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons) of the IPC, along with section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act.Bandra police officers also revealed that they have narrowed down a list of other suspects responsible for the gathering.

15-04-2020||India||From red zone to green: Why PM Modi waited for April 20 to ease Covid-19 lockdown 2.0||The first hint that Prime Minister Narendra Modi favoured early resumption of economic activity in the country had come a few days before his address to the nation. He had, while speaking with chief ministers over the weekend, told them that it is imperative to focus on lives and livelihoods for India’s bright future, a clear shift from his assertion three weeks earlier that health is wealth.In line with this sentiment, he extended the national lockdown till 3 May but provisioned for easing restrictions in areas that do not have Covid-19 cases from 20 April. These areas are being classified as green zones and would be the first to see resumption of economic activity.The 6-day gap, a top government official said, was designed to ensure that everyone is able to understand how to take the first steps out of the lockdown and prepare well for it. “Right from businesses and state governments to the district administration,” the official told Hindustan Times.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIt gives everyone time to smooth off the rough edges in the plan, a second senior official, who heads one of the empowered committees on Covid-19 at the Centre, explained.The government, he said, didn’t have this luxury when PM Modi announced the lockdown on March 24 evening. Giving people advance notice when imposing the lockdown could have defeated its purpose. Movement of people, including those who could be symptomatic or asymptomatic, could have defeated the objective of a lockdown right at the beginning.Besides, it is easier to get people to stay indoors than to ensure that only some of them step out.Still there had been communication gaps, evidenced by the repeated instructions sent out by the Centre that asked police not to stop truckers from ferrying essential and non-essential goods.A plan where some people and industrial units outside containment zones could operate requires a more nuanced approach by the district administration, the second official said.It also gives private companies permitted to operate in the green zones to make logistical arrangements for resuming operations; workforce, raw materials etc. Or to seek clarifications from the government. Like the transporters who have asked the government to explain if their vehicles could pass through districts which have Covid-19 clusters or large outbreaks.“We also hope that the district administrations would also use this time to reinforce the message that communities in neighbourhoods that have had Covid-19 cases should play a greater role to enforce the lockdown in those areas,” a third official said.Because the only way the lockdown is going to be lifted is if there are no cases. This is the incentive for community participation that PM Modi had also alluded to in his address to the nation.That the lockdown could be back if there is a Covid-19 outbreak in a Covid-free zone. “We must make sure we don’t become careless, nor allow anyone else to be careless,” PM Modi had said.That it was in their interest to stay on the right side of the zoning plan, in which every area would be marked green, orange or red.“Hotspots (designated red zones) will be assumed to be undertaking effective containment activities, if no case is reported in the next 14 days (designated orange zones) and will be deemed successful in containment, if no case is reported for 28 days (designated green zones),” Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan explained in her communication to the states on Wednesday.The top health ministry official identified 170 districts as Covid-19 hotspots and explained that such areas would be treated as green zones only if they do not report a single coronavirus case in 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-red-zone-to-green-why-pm-modi-waited-for-april-20-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown-2-0/story-sq6nJJWqANLzWDPSrF6jUO.html

Bars were ordered to remain closed.The order stated that liquor shops will remain open from 10 am to 5 pm on permitted days provided the licensees ensure maintenance of one metre distance between customers, cough etiquette and other guidelines issued by health department.The shops had been asked to operate with “bare minimum staff” and provide hand sanitizers to customers and staff while handling bottles and cash.Wholesale warehouses, bottling plants, breweries and distillers were allowed to operate with not more than 50% of their regular staff and workers. They were asked to arrange for staff to stay within the premises or a nearby place.“Since the lockdown started, manufacture and sale of illicit country liquor has increased manifold. There was possibility of people dying from drinking illicit liquor if authorized shops were not allowed to open,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.On an average Assam earns nearly Rs 250 crore as revenue per month from sale of liquor in the state and in the past two weeks the state had lost over Rs 100 crore in earnings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-2-0-assam-shuts-wine-shops-following-centre-s-revised-rules/story-xFbm6i1rbMfrpSY6lDqm6K.html
15-04-2020||India||Covid-19: When does a hotspot turn into green zone? Govt explains||India on Wednesday identified 170 Covid-19 hotspot districts and 207 districts that are potential hotspots and need severe containment measures by the government to flatten the coronavirus curve and stop the deadly infection from spreading further.Scaling up its efforts to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has advised all states to classify the country’s 718 districts into hotspots, non-hotspot districts and green zones. But the ministry has also warned that the 207 districts that are non-hotspots now have the potential to turn into hotspots so authorities should not allow any relaxation in lockdown norms in these districts.States have been asked to categorise districts reporting the highest number of cases as red zones, districts where some cases have been found as non-hotspots and those which have reported no new confirmed cases in the last 28 days as green zones.ALSO READ | Govt lockdown guidelines: What do they mean for Covid-19 hotspots, containment zonesHotspots or Red Zones are those districts which have been reporting the maximum number of cases or where the growth rate of Covid-19 cases is very high. Detailed directives have been issued to states indicating that consolidated efforts are required to use this extended lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.The criteria to include a particular district into a list of hotspots will be to check if the case load of the district contributes to more than 80% of cases in lndia or the case load contributes to more than 80% of cases for each state in lndia. Districts which display a doubling rate less than 4 days (calculated every Monday for last 7 days, to be determined by the state government) will also be called a Covid-19 hotspot or Red Zone. Any district where no new confirmed cases have emerged for the last 28 days will be dubbed a Green Zone. A district currently identified as a Covid-19 hotspot can eventually move into the ‘green’ category, if no fresh cases emerge in 28 days.ALSO READ | Covid-19: Why cramped Dharavi is a concern for expertsCurrently, hotspot districts with large outbreaks of coronavirus cases in the country are 123 and hotspots with a cluster of cases are 47. Non hotspot districts with a cluster of cases are 207. According to the ministry, the containment operation would be deemed over when no new case is reported in 28 days from an area and also after the last case tests negative. Designated Red Zones or Hotspots will need to carry out effective containment activities and, if no case is reported in the next 14 days they will turn into designated Orange Zones.If after that no case is reported for 28 days the erstwhile hotspot will turn into a green zone.States have also been briefed by the Centre about large outbreak containment strategies, cluster containment strategies, delineation of buffer and containment zones, parameter mapping, and definitions of entry and exit points to curb the spread of the virus.As part of the lockdown, movement of people will not be allowed in containment zones, except for those related to essential services, and special teams will continue to look for new cases in untapped areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-170-covid-19-red-zones-207-potential-ones-india-s-coronavirus-crisis-is-far-from-over/story-V9UvHzoGqypn3EfMQ8IwKO.html

Some of the recent instances show the state was right - at least seven cases have come to light that show patients had contracted the virus 18 to 26 days after exposure.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.A person who had returned to Kannur from Dubai had tested positive after 26 days of his arrival. In Pathanamthitta, a student who travelled in a compartment in which some Tabligi Jammat members were also present, tested positive after 22 days of her trip. Under observation she remained asymptomatic throughout but turned positive when her observation period was about to end.The unusual behaviour of the virus has left the overworked health workers worried as they are running against time to flatten the curve. On Tuesday, eight people tested positive but the number of discharged was 13. One more person tested positive on Wednesday to take the total number of patients to 387 in the state out of which 211 have been discharged, 173 are undergoing treatment and three have died.“When first few cases were reported in the state we sought the advice of the experts and they said it was always safe to keep an extended incubation period. So we took a decision on 28 days. Even those discharged were also told to comply with 14-day quarantine in their homes. We don’t want to take any chance,” said State health minister K K Shailaja.Experts say in 90 per cent cases incubation period may be right but in 10 per cent there are chances of aberrations. Since most of them are under observation they also rule out chances of local transmission.“It is a new virus and its behaviour is yet to be ascertained fully. So we need more tests. People who are under observation will have to be checked. Since there is no vaccine, isolation and testing are the best ways to check its spread,” said Dr B Ramankutty, a public health expert.People who came from abroad and other states were advised to go on home quarantine and were told that if they show symptoms during this period they would be tested and transferred to hospital in case the test turned positive. In Pathanamitta girl’s case she turned asymptomatic even after she tested positive on April 6, said district medical officer Dr N Sheeja.“We can’t give a definite incubation period to a new virus like this. In Wuhan also some cases cropped up after 32 days of isolation. So we have to be careful. We are really lagging in tests. Our current testing rate is 19 per million population. Norway tops the list with a rate of 14,537 tests per million followed by South Korea at 7,353 and the US 1,647,” said another medical||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-shows-extended-incubation-period-in-kerala/story-HOYjBOhHvc8oigqvvbdABI.html
15-04-2020||India||India uses Saarc Covid Fund for HCQ tablets to neighbours. Afghanistan next||India has decided to send 5 lakh tablets of hydroxychloroquine to Afghanistan from the Saarc Covid-19 Emergency Fund set up at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion last month. The fund was created with an initial corpus of $10 million from India; other Saarc members had also pitched in.A top government official told Hindustan Times that the decision to send the tablets had been taken but New Delhi is yet to work out the logistics in view of relations with neighbouring Pakistan. “We are looking at various possibilities to reach the medicine to the people of Afghanistan at the earliest,” the official said.One of the options being explored is use of third-party planes, may be international cargo planes.A second official said India had already made deliveries of hydroxychloroquine to other Saarc countries such as Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan. There has been no proposal to send the medicine to Pakistan in the absence of a request from Islamabad.“I think there have been public statements by leaders in Pakistan that they have sufficient supply of the medicine,” the official said.Global demand for the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine had boosted over the last few weeks after some studies showed that it helped to reduce the viral load in Covid-19 patients.India initially had banned exports of the drug to ensure that there were sufficient supplies to cater to domestic requirements. These restrictions were later eased, mostly to enable pharmaceutical companies to honour their contractual obligations on a case-to-case basis.Otherwise too, pharma companies have been permitted exports to friendly countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.The decision taken to supply the medicine and other medical assistance under the Saarc Covid-19 Emergency Fund demonstrates the utility of the fund that was created last month.PM Modi, speaking at the virtual conference of Saarc leaders, had underscored that the fund would be financed by voluntary contributions from all members. Pakistan was the last member state to pledge its share of the contribution, $ 3 million, but had demanded that the fund should be placed at the disposal of the secretary general of the South Asian grouping.The current secretary general of Saarc is veteran Sri Lankan diplomat Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, who recently succeeded Pakistan’s Amjad Hussain Sial.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was the only Saarc head of government who opted out of the conference and instead, sent Pakistan’s de facto health minister for the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-send-5-lakh-hcq-tablets-to-afghanistan-from-saarc-covid-19-fund/story-4SLfVrVI0QEsbWavZM6tqN.html

All hearings should be done preferably through videoconferencing which would automatically result in decongestion in court complexes,” the communication said.After several complaints of unavailability of the infrastructure for the video conferencing of hearing, the court also resolved that all the judges should be given online training to hear the matters through VC.“All the district and sessions judges shall ensure that video conferencing is done through ‘Cisco WebEx’. Online training about the manner of use of said software be given to all the Judicial officers and court-staff through Centralized Computer Committee.“Such Centralized Computer Committee would, from time to time, seek necessary instructions from IT Committee of this Court on the aspect of VC hearing and would also ensure that there is complete uniformity amongst all districts in this regard,” it added.The high court also said that each district and sessions judge (DJ) would be at liberty to take appropriate steps to personally ensure that the mechanism of mentioning of urgent matters in each of the district court is quick and efficient. It also said that the district judge can also depute judicial officers for hearing the matters, related to bail and urgent civil/injunction cases, corresponding to the need and requirement of the concerned district court.Reacting to this, KC Mittal, chairman, Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), said that increasing the number of benches would bring improvement in the functioning and more cases will be heard.“In terms of the district courts, we would observe the situation for a couple of days and if there is any problem, then we can again approach for some changes,” Mittal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-delhi-hc-district-courts-to-function-with-restrictions-till-may-3/story-XKOz8rVA62DzD13s0J4vnM.html
15-04-2020||India||Highway dhabas, truck repair shops to be allowed from April 20: MHA||The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday issued fresh guidelines easing the ongoing nationwide lockdown restrictions from April 20 by allowing some sectors such as the opening of shops for truck repairs and eateries along national highways to cater to stranded truckers across states.Many of these truckers have been stuck across state borders since March 24 – a day before the nationwide lockdown restrictions were enforced and has since been extended to May 3 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The MHA guidelines have specified that the movement of all trucks and other goods vehicles with two drivers and one helper will be allowed on condition that the driver is carrying a valid driving licence and empty truck/vehicle will be allowed to ply after the delivery or pick-up of goods.The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), an apex body of transporters, have reached out to the government, seeking an economic package for the sector in a bid to bring back migrant labourers, as most of them have gone back to their native places because of the lockdown woes, and resolve supply chain hurdles.They have also sought clarity from the government on the opening of booking offices and warehouses for loading and unloading of goods. “We welcome the fresh guidelines, as allowing the movement of all goods carriers will ease some pressure on the sector, especially for those whose vehicles loaded with non-essential goods are stranded. But there’re still many challenges. For example, there’s no clarity about the opening of booking offices, factories and warehouses and unless they are resolved, it’d be difficult to unload and book goods,” Kultaran Singh Atwal, president, AIMTC, said.“The non-availability of finance is another big challenge for the road transport sector, where more than 20 crore people are directly or indirectly involved. This sector is one of the worst affected because of the lockdown restrictions, as over 90% of the vehicles have been lying idle. The government needs to give immediate stimulus to this sector to drive up the economy,” he added.The transporters have urged the Centre to provide a security coverage of Rs 15,000 per month for workers engaged in the supply chain. They have also sought soft loans at a lower rate of interest, at par with the international level, in a bid to avoid scarcity of working capital finance.“The next two quarters will be critical amid the prevailing uncertainty, as poor consumption will lead to weak demand and leading to less transportation activity. It’ll take at least six months to revive production and consumption and get transportation activity to pick up. Social security for the people engaged in the supply chain has been a long-pending demand. The government must provide for drivers, helpers, loaders, unloaders, and others involved in the supply chain,” Singh said.The Centre is also considering providing a Rs 50 lakh insurance coverage for each of the people engaged in the supply chain. “A decision on the demand for insurance coverage will be taken soon,” a senior government official said, requesting anonymity.The fresh government order mentions strong containment measures in districts that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots, which has caused fresh concern for the transporters. “For example, a Red Zone, which has reported over 15 Covid-19 positive cases, may lie between two Green Zones, where no cases have been reported so far. This will affect the mobility of goods and staff between the zones,” Singh said. Thousands of trucks are stranded across several states, since the nationwide lockdown announcement was made on March 24.The government has issued several advisories to state chief secretaries that movement of both essential and non-essential goods be allowed in a bid to avoid shortage of essential commodities.Data showed that weak economic activity has reduced the demand in the road transport sector, which has led to an inactive fleet of vehicles adding collateral pressure on the operatorsThe daily average movement of trucks and distance covered dropped to 20% amid the lockdown, according to LocoNav, a fleet management firm. “We’re hopeful of a marginal recovery, thanks to the MHA’s fresh guidelines on Wednesday. The supply movement is likely to pick up to 40% from April 20, depending on the availability of staff, drivers and labourers, as many have left for their native places,” said Shridhar Gupta , co-founder, LocoNav. “The MHA guidelines have given us the clarity that a regulatory framework is in place. But, getting the labourers back to work is the biggest worry for now. Production won’t start before May and we need to assess the risk factor in labourers’ minds. They thought that it was safer to go back home when the lockdown was announced. One doesn’t know for sure whether their risk perception has changed, as the government looks to partially ease lockdown restriction curbs,” said Anjani Mandal, chief executive officer, Fortigo Network Logistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highway-dhabas-truck-repair-shops-to-be-allowed-from-april-20-mha/story-ngHiBErD5VKWeTIbFEyBIM.html

It reported 25 people had died till April 13, and five more on Tuesday.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday issued a strong warning to those ‘spreading misinformation’ about the number of deaths. Without referring to Ganashakti, she said, “People are quoting numbers to make headlines. I warn everybody against doing so, as there is a Supreme Court order for preventing misinformation and we can take legal action. The number of deaths is being determined by an expert committee and not me.” TMC spokesperson Snehashis Chakraborty, too, accused the CPM and BJP of spreading misinformation to create panic among the public. “The role of CPM and BJP is uncalled for,” Chakraborty said. On Tuesday evening, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya targeted the state government and alleged four bodies were lying at a state-run hospital but the administration was not saying whether the deaths were due to Covid-19.He tweeted that “4 dead bodies are kept in the isolation Ward of MR Bangur (covid) Hospital”, and gave details of the four people. In another tweet, he wrote: “Are these four bodies kept in MR Bangur hospital? Were they tested for corona? Had they got treatment properly?

Given the acute kit shortage, samples of suspected Covid-19 patients will be ‘pooled’ to reduce the number of kits tested,” said a note released by the health minister’s office.Pooling of samples involves testing them in batches and when pooled sample tests positive, then individual samples are assessed. This method reduces the number of test kits used, compared to testing individual samples.On Tuesday, two more people, including a woman, tested positive for coronavirus in Korba district of Chhattisgarh, taking the number of such cases in the state to 33.Both cases were reported from Katghora town, which has emerged as the top Covid-19 hotspot in the state. The town, located around 200 km from the state capital Raipur, accounts for 24 of the 33 infections detected so far in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-adopt-pool-sample-testing-health-minister-ts-singh-deo-on-covid-19/story-qUnbTE2WgfhAv72aqclkXN.html

While she’s making the most of this time with her two-year-old son Shivaay, she has been spending some time at her in-house recording studio. She shares, “I’m trying my hands at various recording equipment. I’ve a little studio in the house where I’ve been making music on my own since the past few days. I would rely on my sound engineer earlier but now I feel more independent than ever, technologically.”She’s happy to have not stopped working as she adds, “Work from home is going on in full swing. I just released a reprised version of one of my songs, Phir Na Milen Kabhi. Planning its released and getting the master sorted through the phone have happened from my home. I’m working more than ever.”The singer, however, says that she misses the high of being on a stage and being behind a microphone. “I’m missing my in-studio recordings and live gigs. A couple of my concerts got cancelled. I miss my audience and the vibe I get when they sing along with me. But my live sessions on my social media page and other portals are helping me stay connected with my fans. I’m happy to have figured out an alternative,” she says.Talking about her connecting with her audiences through the digital space, she says that she’s happy to be reaching out to them in several parts of the world. “Music has a very calming and soothing effect not just on the artistes but also on the people listening to it. Music creates positivity and good vibrations. It has a healing power and what better than to listen to some great music while you’re sitting at home. As artistes, it’s our responsibility to provide entertainment and calm people through our music,” she signs off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-an-artiste-s-responsibility-to-calm-people-through-music-says-tulsi-kumar/story-GYbl8unpBCXv99aZ1HfOBL.html
15-04-2020||India||Election on his mind, Donald Trump goes after WHO chief and China||US President Donald Trump has halted funding to the World Health Organisation for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, a decision attributed to his assessment that the Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus-led global health body had been biased towards China and given the world, and him, what he has described as “faulty recommendations”.Trump’s decision to hold back funding for the WHO at a time the world is still struggling to stop the virus that has infected close to 2 million and killed over 1.2 lakh has been criticised by several countries. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he sympathised with Trump’s criticisms of the WHO and it wasn’t immune from criticism. But, he underlined, they weren’t going to throw the baby out of the bathwater here.People familiar with the developments in Washington and New Delhi suggest that Trump’s targeted attacks on the WHO chief could be also linked to the Ethopian microbiologist’s May 2017 election with China’s backing. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had defeated the US-backed Dr David Nabarro, who was the candidate of the UK.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’s term as WHO director general is due to end in 2022. “If the support that Dr Tedros has received after the attacks on him are anything to go by, it is clear that the WHO director general may be on his way to get a second term if he so chooses,” a person familiar with the development said.The 55-member African Union and 120 member Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) have already come out in support of Dr Tedros’ handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. He would just need a simple majority in the world health body that has 194 countries as members.This means that the United States - President Trump if he returns to power in the US presidential elections just months away - will have to do some serious heavy lifting to ensure the China-backed microbiologist is not re-elected.As the Trump administration did last month to ensure that the US-backed Singaporean candidate Daren Tang is elected as Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) defeating heavily-favoured Wang Binying, the candidate from China, which has been accused of having a shaky record on intellectual property protection and enforcement.President Trump’s suspension of funding to the WHO is a huge setback. The United States is the biggest overall donor to the Geneva-based WHO, contributing more than $400 million in 2019, roughly 15% of its budget.American taxpayers provide between $ 400 million and $ 500 million per year to the WHO, in contrast, China contributes roughly USD 40 million a year and even less, Trump said.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian rushed to the WHO director general’s defence, and its own, according to news agency Press Trust of India.Both China and WHO faced serious criticism over lack of transparency especially about the discovery of the coronavirus in December last year and its silent spread in Wuhan until Beijing imposed lockdown in the city on January 23.India has steered clear of the debate over the WHO’ role, determined that it first wanted to fight off the virus outbreak before getting into any discussion over reforming the WHO.Rather than wait for WHO to declare Covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic as it did in March, India, followed by the US and later Europe, banned flights from China. This helped mostly block infected people coming to India from China. But the infection still came through Europe and the Gulf, hitting US hard and landing Europe in a health disaster.But PM Modi, however, made it clear in his G-20 address last month that the time had come to assess whether organizations of the past century were capable of handling the new age diseases.For the record, WHO sent 100,000 testing kits to India late February and another 100,000 kits at the end of March.International groups such as the African Union Commission have been more vocal. On April 8, Moussa Faki Mahamat of the AUC tweeted his ‘surprise’ to learn of the campaign against WHO’s global leadership. “The African Union fully supports WHO and DG Tedros. The focus should remain on collectively fighting Covid-19 as a united global community. The time for accountability will come,” he said.The New York-based NAM coordinating bureau, on the other hand, issued a statement the next day in support of the WHO and its DG. It said: “ The Coordinating bureau of the NAM extends its full support to the WHO and to the leadership of its DG, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, while recognising the critical role and guidance it is currently playing on the frontlines.” The NAM also expressed confidence in the leadership of Dr Tedros and asked the global community to stop politicising the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-on-his-mind-donald-trump-goes-after-who-and-china/story-GJHlLBlWfSDENiKRoys6XP.html
15-04-2020||India||EU blasts Trump’s WHO funding cut, fears it worsens pandemic||Nations around the world reacted with alarm Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a halt to the sizable funding the United States sends to the World Health Organization. Health experts warned the move could jeopardize global efforts to stop the coronavirus pandemic.At a briefing in Washington, Trump said he was instructing his administration to halt funding for WHO pending a review of its role “in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.” The United States is WHO’s largest single donor, contributing between $400 million and $500 million annually to the Geneva-based agency in recent years.Trump has repeatedly labelled COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and criticized the U.N. health agency for being too lenient on China, where the novel virus first emerged late last year.Outside experts have questioned China’s reported infections and deaths from the virus, calling them way too low and unreliable. And an investigation by The Associated Press has found that s ix days of delays between when Chinese officials k new about the virus and when they warned the public allowed the pandemic to bloom into an enormous public health disaster.The European Union on Wednesday said Trump has “no reason” to freeze WHO funding at this critical stage and called for measures to promote unity instead of division. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the 27-nation bloc “deeply” regrets the suspension of funds and added that the U.N. health agency is now “needed more than ever” to combat the pandemic.Borrell said “only by joining forces can we overcome this crisis that knows no borders.”Even though they have been traditional allies for decades, the EU has increasingly been critical of the Trump administration over the past years.Worldwide, the pandemic has infected nearly 2 million people and killed over 127,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The virus is spread by microscopic droplets expelled into the air or left on surfaces when people sneeze or cough.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he sympathized with some of Trump’s criticisms of WHO and China but that Australia would continue to fund the U.N. health agency.“We work closely with them so that we’re not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here,” Morrison told Perth Radio 6PR. “But they’re also not immune from criticism.”Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, pushed back at Trump’s announcement.“Placing blame doesn’t help,” he wrote on Twitter. “The virus knows no borders. We must work closely against COVID-19. Strengthening the U.N., in particular the underfunded WHO, is a better investment, for example, to develop and distribute tests and vaccines.”Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, called Trump’s decision “extremely problematic,” noting that the chronically-underfunded WHO is leading efforts to help developing countries fight the spread of COVID-19.“This is the agency that’s looking out for other countries and leading efforts to stop the pandemic,” Sridhar said. “This is exactly the time when they need more funding, not less.”Sridhar said Trump’s move was a short-sighted political decision that would likely have lasting consequences.“Trump is angry, but his anger is being directed in a way that is going to ultimately hurt U.S. interests,” she said.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian says the country is “seriously concerned” about the U.S. government’s decision to suspend funding.“As the most authoritative and professional international institution in the field of global public health security, the WHO plays an irreplaceable role in responding to the global public health crisis,” he told reporters Wednesday.The WHO did not respond to repeated requests from The Associated Press for comment, but its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and other top WHO officials were expected to attend a news conference on the pandemic later Wednesday.Many analysts have praised the initial response to the pandemic by WHO, which is being challenged as national interests collide with the international cooperation that U.N. agencies must rely on.But recently, many governments have split with its advice on issues of public health policy, notably on travel restrictions and whether the public should wear masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-on-his-mind-donald-trump-goes-after-who-chief-and-china/story-GRl4SBWXag1V37msiPJwYO.html

15-04-2020||India||It’s time to make a move||The onset of Covid-19 has challenged our everyday convenience in more ways than one. While social distancing and isolation are currently the most effective ways of keeping the contagion at bay, they do not shield us from feeling hesitant and constantly in doubt. With our health, finances and futures at stake, we grapple for safe passages to the next day. Can movement be a portal to this “one day at a time” approach? As Frank Zappa had once said for music, can body action differently sculpt the air in performance? Cusp, a Kolkata-based commune for mindfulness and fitness enthusiasts, held a free movement session on Instagram to encourage holistic well-being in these trying times.“All of us are homebound now. The Internet enables us to reach out and devise methods that consider both body and mind positivity. We plan to organise bi-weekly workshops on Zoom,” says Agniva Ray, co-founder and executive head, CUSP.The Sunday session was addressed by Satakshi Nandy, a movement artiste, contemporary dancer and actor from Kolkata. With a Diploma from Attakkalari Center for Movement Arts and being trained in Kalaripayattu, Bharatnatyam, Mayurbhanj Chhau and Ballet she sheds light on how her craft shapes her life. “When young, I remember carrying a red tape recorder to school. I grew up on movies where kids would be hooked to the jukebox. So, the idea of creating performance-oriented content has always been part of my DNA,” she shares. She further admits this lockdown has not been an easy phase for many – “At times, it feels like my mind is on a loop even though I know how to use dance against it!”Body movement, undoubtedly, puts one in a constructive state of mind, says Satakshi. She, however, confesses if she were to claim a couple of movement workshops can fight off General Anxiety Disorder or Depression, it would be a stretch, as she has no specialisation in mental health and psychology. “It can motivate you to pull yourself out of bed and pull through the day.” On being asked about the necessity to shift performance arts to virtual media, especially when it is a field that requires one-on-one exchange, she adds, “I see this as a temporary settlement. I am not denying the significance and influence of digital platforms, but as and when normalcy prevails, I would like to take my craft back to its original surroundings. That is something I enjoy – the audience, the spontaneity, and the fact that people can come together over music or dance.” She further goes on to add how it takes years of practice to perfect a skill and only a few days of break can drain you of the same. Being online is also a potent mode of practice while guiding other co-participants. “Attendees often sign up for a class with low self-confidence and a compromised morale. In many instances, channelling their energy into performance makes then rediscover their worth. That’s what I wish to lend through web classes too,” Satakshi signs off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-time-to-make-a-move/story-SkUSBwJ1lKOrhABIfnpkaM.html

15-04-2020||India||Covid-19 Lockdown 2.0: Congress smells political conspiracy behind migrants’ rush at Bandra||Maharashtra’s public works department minister Ashok Chavan on Wednesday alleged a political conspiracy behind the Tuesday’s gathering of migrants at Mumbai’s Bandra railway station and a social media campaign which followed demanding ‘President’s rule’ in Maharashtra. Chavan also said the state government was investigating who was patronised the campaign on social media and who created the confusion that led migrant workers to flock the Bandra station.“We are investigating the entire episode of crowding by the migrant workers at the Bandra station on Tuesday evening. We are investigating who was patronising the social media campaign holding the state government responsible for it. It smells of a political conspiracy as the demands are being made for the imposition of the President’s Rule in Maharashtra. It needs to come to fore who was behind the messages and wrong information spread among the workers,” said Chavan at a video press conference.Maharashra Congress president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat too participated in the press conference. Chavan who is also a former chief minister said that Tuesday’s incident was very serious and could have led to a stampede had it not been handled well by the police. He also alleged that a letter issued by South Central Railways about their plans to start special trains for the migrant workers created confusion among the migrants and led to the crowding at the Bandra station.“There was a letter issued from the office of the chief commercial manager’s office in Secunderabad that created confusion among the workers. The letter was making rounds on the social media and led the workers to believe that the Railways were making special arrangements for them. It was an irresponsible act of the Railways administration. I am not blaming anybody, but presenting the facts related to the crowding by the migrants,” he said.Thorat said that the Railways had taken online booking till Tuesday afternoon before announcing the cancellation of all the trains. “The confusion among the migrants led to the incident. It did not pertain to any specific community or the religion. The crowd included migrants from all communities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-2-0-congress-smells-political-conspiracy-behind-migrants-rush-at-bandra/story-Fxyr9fM1556zIPzYxkdxVK.html

15-04-2020||India||E-commerce firms welcome govt’s order, some seek more clarity||The e-commerce companies on Wednesday welcomed the government’s decision to ease the ongoing nationwide lockdown restrictions from April 20 by allowing some sectors such as farm activities, constructions of roads and buildings in rural areas, information technology and all interstate goods transport to function while maintaining a greater vigil in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hotspots.Several e-commerce companies faced initial challenges in catering to their customers because of delivery snags after the nationwide lockdown was enforced on March 25 to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak and since further extended till May 3, despite the government’s exemptions to them.On March 24, the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) asked states to exempt some key essential services, including e-commerce providers, and said that they be provided passage on the basis of evidence like a copy of orders, waybills, invoices, etc. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also put out additional guidelines two days later, which specified that e-commerce companies delivering essential commodities would be allowed to operate during the lockdown.A company spokesperson of Walmart-owned Flipkart said that they have been collaborating with the retail ecosystem, including local kirana stores, to ensure the doorstep delivery of essential items. The company said that it would scale up its supply chain while taking all necessary precautions and making optimum utilisation of its resources.“In line with the guidelines announced by the government and also in collaboration with all state governments and local authorities, we’ll continue to serve consumers to promote social distancing through our sanitised supply chain, contactness deliveries and healthy and safe last-mile delivery process,” said the spokesperson. An Amazon India spokesperson said that they are evaluating the guidelines and have sought clarifications from the authorities on its implementation.“The resumption of economic activity from April 20 is a welcome step that will depend on unhindered availability of labour that is critical to deliver essential products to people across the country and ensure they can stay home safely,” Amazon said in a statement.The hyperlocal delivery start-up, FreshToHome, which was facing logistical issues over deliveries, as meat products were not exempt, said its operations have resumed across the country.“Chicken products and freshwater fish are available. But sourcing mutton and seafood is still an issue,” said Shan Kadavil, chief executive officer (CEO), FreshToHome.“We appreciate the government’s bid to prioritise the movement of food and other essential items and also the resumption of farming, fisheries, and livestock, which will ensure daily sustenance of the workforce involved in these sectors,” Kadavil said, adding that most of his company’s deliveries are done through a contactness mechanism.BigBasket, an online supermarket, said that though it faced initial delivery disruptions because of lockdown restrictions, the situation has vastly improved a spike in its orders. “We have a massive backlog of orders because of exceptionally high demand over the last few days. We have increased our server capacity by 50%, as we’re facing a high volume of queries to our customer service team,” said a BigBasket spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/e-commerce-firms-welcome-govt-s-decision-to-resume-services-some-seek-more-clarity/story-rW3hrK82B9YwaJpccQ5iVP.html
15-04-2020||India||400 families block Bengal highway for 3 hours alleging no food amid lockdown||Hundreds of people from the Domkal municipality area of Murshidabad district blocked a state highway for three hours on Wednesday morning, alleging that they did not get food in 20 days amid claims by chief minister Mamata Banerjee that there was no shortage of it in Bengal and that the poor were being given free ration.There were many women and children among members of the 400-odd families that blocked the Berhampore–Domkal state highway violating lockdown orders. Most of the agitators did not wear masks or maintain social distancing guidelines.The agitators lifted the blockade when the local administration intervened, but not before the chairman of Domkal municipality, who rushed to the spot, admitted that ration dealers did not disburse the quota of food supplies to those in the below poverty line (BPL) segment. Each ration card holder is supposed to get five kg rice and five kg flour a month.While talking to HT last week, State food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mallick said, “There is no shortage of rice in Bengal. We have 9.45 lakh metric tons in stock and another four lakh metric tons are stored in rice mills. We have enough rice to feed people till August. Our government does not procure rice from the Food Corporation of India. We buy directly from farmers.”The administration has taken action against some ration dealers for not opening their shops or not giving people their full quota, said the minister.On Wednesday, Mahadeb Das, a resident of ward no 10 in Domkal municipality, said, “Dulal Saha, the ration dealer in our area, gave a kilo of rice each to a handful of families in the last two weeks. It is not enough to feed a family of 4-5 members.”“Most people from this area work as wage labourers in Bengal or other states. We lost our livelihood because of the lockdown. We were told that the state and the Centre are providing free food for the poor,” he said.Subodh Das, another agitator, said “The government is not allowing us to work. Are we supposed to starve to death? We know we risked our lives by gathering so many people for the agitation but there was no option.” Chairman of the Trinamool Congress-run run Domkal municipality, Jafikul Islam convinced the agitators to lift the blockade.“More than 1.57 lakh people live in Domkal and 69 per cent of them belong to the BPL category. We received only 42 quintals of rice from the government for distribution among poor people. More supplies are coming,” said Islam.“I have come to know that the local ration dealer has not given people the quota of ration they are entitled to. Stern action will be taken against him,” Islam added. “I have promised each of the aggrieved families 10 kg rice and 5 kg potato,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/400-families-block-bengal-higway-for-3-hours-alleging-no-food-amid-lockdown/story-qCMGdkk0HLdETzPQcvG4sM.html
15-04-2020||India||As Trump threatens to cut WHO funding, India says Covid-19 should remain focus||The Centre on Wednesday reacted cautiously to US President Donald Trump’s decision to cut funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO), with people familiar with developments saying the world community’s focus should remain on the Covid-19 pandemic.During his daily briefing on the Covid-19 crisis, Trump announced the US would halt funding for the WHO for “severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the Coronavirus”.The move was soon criticised by world leaders, and UN chief Antonio Guterres said this was “not the time to reduce the resources for the operations” of the WHO.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe Indian government was more circumspect in its response, with people familiar with developments insisting that the focus of global efforts should remain on overcoming the Covid-19 pandemic.“At present, our efforts and attention are fully focused on dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. Once the world has addressed this crisis, we can revisit this question [of funding for the WHO],” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while participating in a virtual summit of G20 leaders last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had called for the reform of the WHO, which was based on the “last century’s models” and hadn’t adapted to deal with new challenges.At his daily briefing, Trump, who has repeatedly criticised the WHO in recent weeks for its handling of the pandemic and for allegedly toeing China’s line, said: “Today I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organisation while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organisation’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the Coronavirus.”He noted that American taxpayers “provide between $400 million and $500 million” a year to the WHO, while China “contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less”. He added, “As the organisation’s leading sponsor, the US has a duty to insist on full accountability.”Trump further said: “One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives.”The US president is himself facing criticism for his handling of the Covid-19 crisis in his country, which has recorded more than 614,000 infections and more than 26,000 deaths.UN chief Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the need of the hour is unity in the global battle against Covid-19 and not cutting the funding for the WHO.“It is my belief that the WHO must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against Covid-19,” Guterres said.While acknowledging the need to review the actions of different entities in responding to the Coronavirus, Guterres said: “Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis.”He added, “The lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future. But now is not that time.”German foreign minister Heiko Maas tweeted: “Blaming does not help. The virus knows no borders…One of the best investments is the @UN, especially the underfunded @WHO, to strengthen…the development and distribution of tests and vaccines.”Microsoft founder Bill Gates tweeted: “Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-trump-threatens-to-cut-funding-for-who-india-says-focus-should-remain-on-covid-19-pandemic/story-xJXdfupz7I3TCN4tg8QtOL.html

15-04-2020||India||Military’s innovations to help combat Covid-19||From modifying quadcopters to spray disinfectants over large areas to ultra-violet light sanitisers and assisted respiratory systems to 3-D printed masks, the armed forces have come up with a raft of innovations to combat the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), three officers familiar with the details said on Wednesday.A quadcopter can disinfect an area of the size of a football field in less than five minutes and each unit is likely to cost around Rs 7.5 lakh, said one of the officials cited above. It can be used up to a surface elevation of 6,000 feet, with an effective spray height of 10 metre. The quadcopters are currently under validation at an army base workshop.Different wings of the defence ministry including the armed forces, the Defence Research and Development Organisation and the Ordnance Factory Board, have designed and developed a wide range of products to support the country’s effort to contain the spread of the pandemic.The UV light sanitiser designed by the army can kill 99.9% surface bacteria and viruses without the use of chemicals, and it would help prevent hospital acquired infections, said the second officer cited above. He said the device, likely to cost Rs 800, had been validated by Military Hospital, Agra.The Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, has developed an assisted respiratory system (ARS) that is likely to reduce the requirement of invasive ventilation of Covid-19 patients, said the third officer cited above. “This could reduce the requirement of intensive care and loading of the hospitals. The ARS can be used as a personal respiratory aid device,” he added. The unit cost of an ARS unit is expected to be around Rs 7,500.An army base workshop has developed reusable 3-D printed masks to help tackle the shortage of face masks.The navy has already developed equipment for safe air evacuation of Covid-19 patients from warships and remote islands. The air evacuation pod (AEP), developed by the Naval Aircraft Yard Kochi under the Southern Naval Command, will allow patient transfer without the risk of pilots or the rescue teams getting infected.Earlier, the Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, designed and developed a hand-held infrared temperature sensor and said it had the capacity to scale up production if agencies require these instruments in large numbers to screen people for fever amid the Covid-19 outbreak.The navy said the instrument had been developed to overcome the scarcity of temperature guns in the market where these were being sold at a very high price.As the country prepares to handle a rising number of cases and meet its need for ventilators, which about 5% of the Covid-19 patients may require, the navy has also pitched in with an innovative ventilator design that can cater to six patients simultaneously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-s-innovations-to-help-combat-covid-19/story-TMO4zfKFpft2WIXE3Ps8KM.html

15-04-2020||India||All 5 Covid-19 patients who died in Bhopal are gas tragedy victims, say organizations||All five Covid-19 patients who have died of the disease in Bhopal so far were also victims of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, certain organisations representing the gas tragedy survivors have claimed. The city currently, has 158 coronavirus positive patients. One of the organisations has moved the high court for a direction to the state government to denotify the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) as a non-Covid-19 hospital so that it can treat the Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims. The hospital was notified as a Covid-19 hospital by an order of the district administration in the third week of March. The Covid-19 patients who have died are between 49 years to 80 years and lived in different localities affected by the gas tragedy. The first Covid-19 patient among the Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims died on April 6, second and third on April 12, fourth on April 13 and the fifth Covid-19 patient died on April 14. One of them was suffering from oral cancer. Another was suffering from tuberculosis but he had recovered from the disease. The three others too were suffering from ailments. One of the five happened to be a journalist, as per associations and officials from the district administration.Bhopal Group for Information and Action convener Rachna Dhingra accused the government of neglecting the victims and said, “Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims are dying of Covid-19 as they are more vulnerable to the virus and they have been deprived of treatment at BMHRC which is meant for them as the hospital has been notified as a Covid-19 hospital.”Rachna Dhingra said, “The Bhopal Group for Information and Action filed an application in the high court on Tuesday for an urgent hearing through video conferencing on the organisation’s petition already filed after the state government notified the hospital for Covid-19 patients. This is regarding denial of all medical facilities at BMHRC to gas tragedy victims.” Member of the Supreme Court’s monitoring committee for gas victims, Purnendu Shukla said, “After BMHRC was notified as a Covid-19 hospital the OPD service was discontinued at the hospital for gas victims. As many as 65 patients were discharged from the hospital. Only a few patients were allowed to remain at the hospital as they could not be shifted from there given their serious condition. As many as 31 patients on dialysis were shifted to another hospital, where there was only one technician for dialysis.”“The government’s decision to not allow the gas victims to be treated at BMHRC was beyond comprehension as the gas victims are more prone to contracting the virus given their co-morbidity. And now the results are there for all to see. All the five Covid-19 patients who have died are gas tragedy victims,” Shukla said.District collector, Bhopal Tarun Kumar Pithode could not be reached for comments. He didn’t respond to phone calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-5-covid-19-patients-who-died-in-bhopal-are-gas-tragedy-victims-say-organizations/story-r6HCcoZV0QtEnx4n1or1CJ.html
15-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Odisha district imposes Rs 500 fine for spitting in public places||Authorities in Odisha’s coastal district of Ganjam have banned spitting in public places to check the spread of coronavirus and warned that those violating the ban will be fined Rs 500.Warning people against spitting outside, Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange in a tweet said if caught in the act, violators will have to pay a fine of Rs 500. In Odisha, 60 positive cases of Covid-19 have been reported so far. The disease has claimed one life in the state.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.A month ago, chief minister Naveen Patnaik too had appealed to the people to stop chewing paan and spitting in the open to stop the virus from spreading. The ban on spitting came in the wake of the Union health ministry asking all states to prohibit the use of smokeless tobacco and spitting in public places to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. “Chewing smokeless tobacco products, paan masala and areca nut increases the production of saliva followed by a very strong urge to spit. Spitting in public places could enhance the spread of the Covid-19 virus,” the ministry said in a letter to chief secretaries of all states and union territories a few days ago. States and Union Territory governments have necessary authority to ban spitting under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc).The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) had also appealed to people to refrain from consuming smokeless tobacco products and spitting in public places. Earlier this month, the Ganjam district administration had made it compulsory for anyone coming out on the street to wear masks and said those violating would be penalized with Rs 1000 in urban areas and Rs 500 in rural areas. India now has over 11,000 cases of Covid-19 and almost 400 people have died of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-odisha-district-imposes-rs-500-fine-for-spitting-in-public-places/story-DQQOTZqP3sd0hCKHDiHvhO.html

15-04-2020||India||India to get normal monsoon this year, says IMD||In what could bring relief to farmers across the country, monsoon rains are likely to be normal this year at 100% of long period average, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s forecast released on Wednesday.For the first time in IMD’s monsoon forecast history, the agency also released new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates, considering factors that have led to a change in the way monsoon progresses. IMD’s new onset and withdrawal dates are based on analysis of monsoon data from 1961 to 2013 by scientists in IMD Pune.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIMD said the agency is expecting a normal monsoon at 100% of LPA, with an error margin of +/-5% this year, because prevailing neutral El Nino and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions. El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino years in India are linked to below normal monsoon rains and higher than normal frequency of heat waves. Last monsoon, El Nino conditions led to a delayed onset of monsoon, according to scientists. IOD is characterized by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean; positive IOD conditions are associated with normal monsoon.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakIMD, in its statement, also said a few global climate models are indicating the possibility of development of weak La Nina conditions (climate pattern that describes the cooling of surface ocean waters along the tropical west coast of South America) over the Pacific Ocean during the second half of the season. La Nina is associated with a strong monsoon and above-average rains in India. “As sea surface temperature (SST) conditions over the Pacific and Indian Oceans are known to have strong influence on Indian monsoon, IMD is carefully monitoring the evolution of sea surface conditions over the Pacific and the Indian oceans,” the weather department said.On new monsoon dates, M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said while the onset date over Kerala continues to be June 1, there are lots of changes when monsoon advances over Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Bihar etc. The withdrawal of monsoon is delayed by 7-14 days from northwest India. For instance, the onset in Chennai will be on June 4 against June1; June 21 in Ahmedabad against June 14; July 1 in Jaipur against June 23; June 27 in Delhi against June 23.“The withdrawal from northwest India and central India is nearly 10 days late,” Rajeevan said. The zone-wise monsoon forecast will also be released by IMD in the last week of May or first week of June, IMD officials said.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season that generally begins in June before starting to retreat by September. The monsoon rainfall is crucial to rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds cultivation in the country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy and employs over half of its people.Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Pune’s Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said global agencies are unanimously indicating normal monsoon rains for June to September. “This is largely based on the favourable conditions in the Pacific as there is no coherent sign of an El Niño developing during the early stage of the monsoon. El Niño, if present, can weaken the moisture carrying monsoon winds and reduce the rainfall received,” Koll said.The rain in the pre-monsoon period has also been above average, which experts say will help improve and retain soil moisture and help with sowing in some parts of the country. From March 1 to April 12, central India received 165% and northwest India 52% excess rain even as east and northeast India are 44% deficient, according to IMD.Ocean temperatures in the equatorial Indian Ocean are forecast to be warmer than normal, which has the potential to reduce monsoon rains. “Our analysis has shown that such conditions can have an adverse impact on monsoon rains over central-north India. The significance of the Indian Ocean is increasing year by year as it is warming rapidly due to increasing carbon emissions. Forecast models do not generally pick this link between the warm Indian Ocean and the monsoon rains,” Koll added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-get-normal-monsoon-this-year-says-imd/story-cgNvWSHZEo5wg6ke0M6oPM.html

15-04-2020||India||Kerala’s luxury houseboats to function as Covid-19 wards||Kerala’s houseboats, a mascot of tourism in the state’s idyllic backwaters, are set to be converted into isolation wards to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.Work is underway to create at least 2,000 isolation wards in houseboats, state public works department minister G Sudhakaran said on Wednesday.“Boat owners have agreed to the proposal of the district administration and these wards will be ready by April-end,” said Sudhakaran, who hails from Alappuzha district, which has 700 licenced houseboats.Some of the double-decker boats have more than six bedrooms. Many film stars and business houses own houseboats in Kuttanad, often called the rice bowl of Kerala.Kerala is expecting an influx of expatiates following reports that some West Asian countries plan to impose severe restrictions on countries that refuse to take back their citizens amid the Covid-19 crisis. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has issued a warning in this regard.Almost one-third of the nearly three million Indians in the UAE are from Kerala, and the state is racing to prepare 200,000 hospital beds by the first week of May.Kevin Rozario, general secretary of All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Association, said: “We are happy to hand over our boats. Most of the boats are idle as there were no tourism activities in the last two months and we don’t see any revival in the coming months.“By handing over our boats, we are joining the global fight against the virus. We see it as our duty and we will provide all help.” Rozario said it will be easy to convert the houseboats as they have facilities similar to a full-fledged resort on land. In case of an emergency, boats can be taken to secluded spots just like the railway coaches that have been converted into makeshift hospitals, health experts said.Watch: Houseboats in Kerala to be converted into COVID-19 isolation wards During the 2018 floods, houseboats and fishermen played a stellar role by saving many marooned people. Alappuzha district collector M Anjana said work was on in full swing and all the boats will be anchored at the finishing point of the Nehru trophy boat race.

15-04-2020||India||Beautiful at home||While the lockdown period is a necessity given the current pandemic-ridden state we are in, and it has provided us all with ample of me time - to do stuff like catch up on reading, cooking, painting, and other hobbies – let’s accept that we do miss our routine trips to the salon for our regular dose of cleansing, facials and waxing. Plus, the onset of an early summer, which isn’t much to our surrise in a city like Mumbai – makes it much worse for our skin and hair. Although we don’t have to face the onslaught of dirt, grime and pollution that we otherwise encounter on a daily basis, staying at home has its cons too. It’s a psychological thing - we feel that because we aren’t going out, we’re all good. But the humidity does play its part, and quite well at that.So, in an attempt to end those beauty woes, we speak to beauty experts and hair stylists to dish out some easy ways to groom at home.Hair: While we aptly maintain hair and scalp hygiene by shampooing and conditioning our hair, here are a few home remedies, with ingredients that are easily available in your pantry, that one can try:1.Make a paste of egg, honey, olive or coconut oil, apply it to your hair and wash it after 15 to 20 minutes. This will reduce hair fall and improve hair growth2.Ally coffee powder on scalp after shampooing, and massage along the length of your hair. Let it settle for 20min and then rinse with lukewarm water. This will stimulate hair growth. Skin: Cleansing, toning and moisturising once in 15 days is quite effective but here are a few remedies to get that radiant glow on your face and keep your body supple:1. Mash a ripe banana and massage the skin with the pulp. Banana contains moisture, potassium and vitamins E and C, which are responsible for promoting clear ski.2. Mix oatmeal, honey and raw milk and apply to your face. Gently massage and leave it on for about 10 minutes. Oatmeal has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that removes dead skin cells and coupled with antibacterial honey, it’s a true skin-soothing treat.3. Make a quick and easy face mask using aloe vera gel and grated cucumber. Rinse after 15 minutes.4. When it comes to body care, target each area individually as the skin varies. For thicker skin on your elbows and knees, apply lemon juice and sugar scrub to reduce pigmentation and to make them softer. For the rest of your body, whip up a scrub with honey and sugar. Apply it evenly by cutting a tomato in half and using it as a loofah.Feet:With no hopes for a pedicure at a salon, try this DIY feet care mask to hydrate your feet. After your shower, massage your feet with petroleum jelly for five minutes. Apply a bit of cuticle oil on your toenails. Top it off with some more petroleum jelly and wrap your feet with cling film. Leave it on for three hours so that the jelly gets absorbed well into your skin.(With inputs from Jay Kishan Pawar, master barber and trainer, Truefitt and Hill; Megha Asher, founder, Juicy Chemistry; Sana Dhanani, founder and managing director, The White Door India and Nandeeta Manchandaa, founder, Enns Closet)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/beautiful-at-home/story-E52chyTGu3lLlQO2LoTdbP.html

Police and administration @MamataOfficial failing to effect 100% #SocialDistancing or curbing religious congregations be shown door. Lockdown must succeed-examine central para forces requisitioning!” he tweeted.His tweet came in the wake of Kolkata Police and West Bengal Police taking additional steps to prevent crowds as people venture out of their homes to buy essential supplies.Drones are being used across the state to trace crowds and identify people violating the nationwide lockdown that has been extended till May 3. Police are also using loudspeakers to urge people to stay indoors.A senior official of West Bengal Police, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “Over the past few days, as many as 1,174 markets have been relocated to spacious areas nearby so that social distancing is maintained in markets, while the area of 963 markets has been expanded.“There still are 256 markets that remain crowded. The administration is looking for suitable alternative places nearby.”Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has often clashed with the governor, has repeatedly said she wants “a strict lockdown with a humane face”.The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress party criticised the governor but said it would rather ignore him.“The governor has no other work but to try and disturb the state government. The Mamata Banerjee administration is completely preoccupied with responding to the unprecedented situation over the novel Coronavirus and has no time to respond to someone behaving like a Bharatiya Janata Party worker,” said Trinamool spokesperson Snehasish Chakraborty.In a separate development, the BJP MP from Alipurduar, John Barla, has written to Union home minister Amit Shah, alleging the state administration has put him under “house arrest”.“I was out to supervise relief work and supply essentials to the needy but the police seized all items and told me I was supposed to stay home because the lockdown also applied to me,” Barla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-governor-triggers-controversy-by-seeking-central-paramilitary-forces/story-PAh2C419amuONItg9h6bZN.html
15-04-2020||India||Seafarers stranded abroad desperate as India refuses repatriation||April 14 marks the 30th day since Rahul Shanbhag has been holed up in his tiny cruise cabin onboard the MSC Grandiosa anchored off the coast of Italy. With the global cruise tourism industry having dropped anchor, Shanbhag along with around 200 other Indians of which 70 are from Goa, remains on board the ship bobbing as it does on the waves waiting for some sign that the Indian government will allow the repatriation of seafarers home. While the crew of other countries have already returned home, the 30 days of waiting has taken a toll both mental and physical on the wellbeing of the crew. “There were 12 cases (of Covid-19) onboard the ship including four who needed to be taken to the ICU. But they have all been discharged. But another of my colleagues collapsed out of weakness and needed to be revived,” Shanbhag said while speaking with HT.Hailing from Fatorda, Shanbhag is one of around 7000 people from Goa who makes his living sailing the seas. According to documents submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office, there are around 22,500 Indian seafarers who are stranded abroad around one-third of whom are from Goa.The global shipping industry has not come to a halt but the cruise tourism industry, which employs more people, has. Other countries, especially the Philippines, which contributes a large part to the global shipping workforce, have already repatriated their workforce, it is only the Indians who remain on board the ships. “Everyone is frustrated here and we cannot even visit each other’s cabins. Two among us also needed to be hospitalised because they became sick with worry,” Shanbhag, who worked in the dining section of the cruise liner, said. Also read: What Covid-19 lockdown guidelines mean for hotspots, containment zonesFor the past month, Shanbhag and his colleagues have written to the ministry of external affairs, Goa government and local representative for help in getting back home. “People here are scared. We understand these are difficult situations but we quarantined here on board the ship and are willing to quarantine even upon arrival. But there needs to be some action. The situation should not be allowed to deteriorate,” Shanbhag said. The Centre has refused to repatriate those Indians stranded abroad, be it students or tourists. It told the Supreme Court, which was hearing a petition to repatriate Indian students, that evacuation of Indian expatriates amid the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease could pose a risk to India’s domestic population. The top court, while posting the matter after four weeks, asked those abroad to ‘Stay where you are’. For some, like Pizarro Andrade, that means staying put within the transit zone of the Dubai international airport. He is one among 23 Indians who were on their way to India when the government announced a cessation of International flights. “The situation is that neither the Indian government nor the Indian embassy in Dubai is helping us. Thanks to the Dubai government and Emirates (the airline) who are taking care of us here,” Andrade said while speaking HT.“There are few Goans working in Dubai try to get in touch with me asking about me and see if they can try to help me any possible way they can,” he said.While those working abroad are usually taken care of by their employers, in the case of the cruise tourism industry, their stay is on board the ship and with the industry shut down, they are out of work and with nowhere to go. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant admitted that the seafarers’ situation was different than those others stuck abroad and has assured that he was ‘seriously’ pursuing the issue with the ministry of external affairs.He also stressed that there was little he could do beyond waiting for a change in stance from the central government. “Within two to three days we will place the complete data before the Prime Minister’s Office. We are seriously pursuing the issue. The seafarers’ issue is different from others stranded abroad. We will request them to reconsider the issue,” Sawant said. Sawant is under increasing pressure both from the opposition as well as within his party as legislators have regularly been meeting him to begin repatriation. Several legislators have also written directly to the Prime Minister’s Office. “The Indian seafarers have contributed immensely to the economic growth and foreign exchange earnings of the country and particularly Goa. I humbly request your immediate intervention and request you to kindly give necessary instructions to all concerned to take steps to bring back these stranded Indian seafarers,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat said in a letter to the Prime Minister. The Goa government has also set up quarantine centres with space for around 20,000 people awaiting the return of their sons, but the central government is yet to relent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seafarers-stranded-abroad-desperate-as-india-refuses-repatriation/story-N96nY87PbCPmtWmObu73sI.html

Till late Tuesday night, the city reported 427 cases.The chief minister said the numbers will likely see an increase as the administration has started testing extensively.“People in Indore shouldn’t be scared, numbers will increase. If someone doesn’t know that they’re positive, they’ll not only risk their own lives but that of others too. So we decided to conduct testing extensively. This will help control corona,” said Chouhan.An analysis of the data shows that till Wednesday morning, the death rate of Covid-19 patients in the city was around 6.8 per cent, higher than the national average.“There was no testing infrastructure earlier, tests were not even being done till March 23. Now we have nine functional labs. We are also sending samples to Delhi for tests. That is why the number of cases is rising,” the CM added.Elaborating on details of the cases, Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) Praveen Jadia said most of the new patients from Indore are either relatives or close acquaintances of people who earlier tested positive for coronavirus. All those, he added, who came in contact with these patients have already been isolated as a precaution.So far, 37 people have been discharged after recovery, he said. The local administration has imposed curfew in urban limits since March 25 after the first coronavirus patients were found in the city. The chief minister also assured migrant workers from the state stuck in other places that money will be transferred to their accounts and arrangements are being made for them. Yesterday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the nationwide lockdown will be in place till May 3. Soon after, rail and train services were also shut till the end of extended lockdown. “Many workers of MP are stuck in other states.They couldn’t return when lockdown was extended.We talked to other CMs to make arrangements for their food and shelter. We’ve decided to transfer Rs 1,000 in accounts of such workers. They’ll be able to withdraw it wherever they are,” said Chouhan, who took oath as CM on March 23.The chief minister underlined that his government is standing with the workers in this critical time. “Don’t worry we’ll send you more money if needed. We’re standing with you. I request people’s representatives to make a list of all such people and send it to the Chief Minister’s Office or District collector’s office. We will send money as and when the list is sent to us,” said Chouhan.Of the total 377 coronavirus deaths, Maharashtra tops the tally with 178 deaths, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 50, Delhi at 30, Gujarat at 28 and Telangana at 17.

For the nurseries of Sikkim and the Darjeeling hills, the plant is a lucrative source of revenue, much in demand as an adornment in corporate lounges and luxury hotel foyers, at weddings and other galas. A single stem of the Cymbidium retails for as much as Rs 700 in Indian metros.In recent weeks, in the aftermath of the lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) that started on March 25, nurseries in the Himalayan region throwing the flowers away. The emergency measure went underway when production of the Cymbidium was at its peak.March and April are the peak season for Cymbidium cultivation and also the end of its harvesting season. Almost half the annual production is harvested in these two months. Flower farmers stopped harvesting the flowering plant when the lockdown began.“The only option for us is to cut the flowering stems and throw them away,” said Prakash Chettri, marketing manager of Mainaam Garden at Namchi in Sikkim. “The plants have to be maintained and for this we have to cut the stems. But neither can we transport these nor can we take so many flowers home. We have dumped thousands of flowers.”The flower farm is owned by Tika Maya Chamling, wife of former chief minister Pawan Chamling. It is the largest orchid farm in Asia with around 100 employees and an annual turnover of Rs 5 crore, said Chhetri.The farm, spread across 20 acres, had been hoping to sell around 150,000 Cymbidium stems this year. It sold around 100,000 stems in 2019.“Cymbidium orchids are the most sought after at star hotels, at big parties, weddings and government programmes around the world,” said Chamling. “Though tropical and temperate varieties of orchids are comparatively cheaper and grown in a lot of places, Sikkim and Darjeeling hills, which have cold and humid climatic conditions, account for more than 90% of the best varieties in the country. Cymbidium is the most expensive among these,” she said.Many nursery owners in the Darjeeling hills started growing the Cymbidium because of potentially huge demand for the flower both at home and overseas. The lockdown has dashed their hopes.Chamling said, “Russia recently placed orders with Mainaam Gardens for 300,000 Cymbidium stems every month. Although we have 500,000 of 300 varieties, it was impossible for us to meet this demand. There is an annual demand for 5 million Cymbidium stems in India against which only 150,000 to 200,000 can be produced.”With an eye on the market, many nursery owners in the hills of Sikkim and Darjeeling started growing the Cymbidium.Bhaskar Mukhia, owner of Mukhia Nursery at Pokhriabong in Darjeeling, said, “The lockdown has shattered us. Sikkim and Darjeeling hills have the natural conditions required for {growing} these orchids. However, the lockdown has forced many farmers to throw away the flowers.” Sunil Agarwal, chief executive officer of Darjeeling Gardens Pvt Ltd, which has its nursery in Mirik and is the largest producer of the Cymbidium in Darjeeling, said, “Fifty percent of the flowers is already wasted and we dumped another 15,000 stems.”Prasant Choudhary, managing director of the company, said, “We sell Rs 40 to 50 lakh worth of Cymbidiums a year. The virus attack has devastated us.”Hundreds of independent growers sell their produce through Mainaam Garden and Darjeeling Gardens Pvt Ltd.Their plight is worse.Sikkim’s agriculture and horticulture minister LN Nepal said “We have taken the matter seriously and are trying to find ways to compensate the orchid growers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nurseries-in-sikkim-darjeeling-wilt-as-lockdown-hits-king-of-orchids/story-f4blBScCP1rh3ScJJKdVFP.html

15-04-2020||India||West Bengal: Medical services hit after patients in general wards test positive of Covid-19||The Bengal government has finally formulated a standard operating procedure (SOP) to stop mixing of Covid-19 suspects with non-Covid patients in state-run hospitals. This came after a few state-run and private hospitals got hit when some patients were detected with coronavirus while they were being treated in general wards along with other patients.Various wards in state-run and private hospitals had to be closed down for sanitization, dozens of doctors and nurses had to be sent in quarantine and samples of many non-Covid patients had to be tested because they had all come in close contact with Covid-19 suspects. The suspects ultimately turned out to be coronavirus patients.“The SOP was formulated to stop mixing of Covid suspects with others. The SOP contains detailed guidelines on how Covid-19 suspects should be handled at the emergency sections and in other wards of hospitals. It also includes guidelines on how to handle relatives of such patients and suspects,” said a top official of the state health department. The SOP was issued on Tuesday.On April 12, a woman was detected with Covid-19 soon after giving birth at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. The woman and her newborn had to be separated, the labour and surgery room had to be closed down for two days for sanitization and other patients in adjacent beds also had to be tested. Doctors’ samples had to be tested and they were asked to go in quarantine. Earlier, other state-run hospitals such as RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and NRS Medical College and Hospital were also hit for similar reasons – general patients, being treated in general wards, were subsequently detected with the virus. A private hospital had to be temporarily closed down for sanitization and at least 40 medical staff of the hospital had to be quarantined after a patient died and was posthumously detected with the disease.  A few days ago, the superintendent of the Howrah state general hospital tested positive after handling Covid patients. More than 60 medical staff and some top officials of the district administration had to be quarantined.“The SOP says that the hospital ward where low-key Covid-19 suspects are being kept will now be treated as potential confirmed Covid-19 patient ward. There will be separate elevators and trolleys for such patients. Security guards wearing PPE will screen all patients and relatives entering the emergency department with a thermal scanner,” said a top official of the health department.Neither any patient nor any relative will henceforth be allowed to enter the hospital premises without wearing masks. Relatives won’t be allowed to enter isolation wards where suspected Covid patients are admitted. Healthcare staff, including ward boys, have been asked to wear PPE while approaching suspects.  “This SOP was absolutely important given the fact that pressure is mounting on hospitals and more suspects are coming in. The test results are taking at least 48 hours to reach us. This intervening period is very crucial. In north-Bengal, a Covid-19 suspect, who was treated alongside a Covid patient, later tested positive. We don’t know whether the second person contracted the disease during his stay at the hospital,” said Dr Sumon Poddar, associate professor, Institute of Child Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-medical-services-hit-after-patients-in-hospitals-general-wards-test-positive-of-covid-19/story-0Itebb5VKcrJcByzbfKmsI.html

15-04-2020||India||FAQs: Nine things you must know about the govt order on lockdown 2.0||The government released guidelines on the second phase of the nationwide lockdown on Wednesday, aiming to consolidate what it called gains in the first phase while also kick-starting certain sectors to aid farmers and daily wage labourers whose livelihood has been badly affected due to the restrictions.What does the second phase of the lockdown look like?Pretty much the same in terms of restrictions on movement and social gathering. The ban on commercial air and rail travel as well as travel by road continues. Educational and training institutions will remain closed. Citizens are prohibited from engaging in industrial and commercial activities, and hospitality services. All cinema halls, shopping complexes, theatres, and religious places/places of worship will be closed. Social, political and religious gatherings are banned.Has the government tightened restrictions?The fresh government order says “very strong containment measures” will be implemented in districts that have emerged as hotspots (designated by states/UTs) of Covid-19 infections. Only essential services will be permitted in these zones, while strict perimeter control and restrictions on movement will be enforced.Certain activities in the rest of the country will get some relaxations from April 20.What are these relaxations and what are they aimed at?The government says the revised guidelines are aimed at operating those sectors of the economy that are critical from the perspective of rural development, agriculture sector and daily wage workers. The three-week lockdown imposed on March 25, and then extended by 19 more days till May 3, is expected to take a big toll on the economy.What are the specifics? Farming operations, including procurement of agricultural products; agriculture marketing through notified mandis and direct and decentralised marketing; manufacture, distribution and retail of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds; activities of marine and inland fisheries; animal husbandry activities, including the supply chain of milk, milk products, poultry and live-stock farming; and tea, coffee and rubber plantations are allowed.Industries operating in rural areas, including food processing industries; construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings and industrial projects in rural areas; Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) projects; and operation of rural Common Service Centres (CSCs) too have got the green light. Are there any more exemptions?Yes, manufacturing and other industrial establishments with access control are permitted in SEZs (special economic zones), EoU (export-oriented units), industrial estates and industrial townships. Manufacture of IT hardware and of essential goods and packaging too feature in the list. So does coal, mineral and oil production. Transportation of goods, without any distinction of essential or non-essential items, is allowed.What about banks?All important components of the financial sector, such as the Reserve Bank of India, banks, ATMs, capital and debt markets as notified by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) and insurance companies will be functional.The government has also identified digital economy as an important factor for national growth. E-commerce operations, operations of information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, data and call centres for government activities, and online teaching and distance learning are all allowed.Are there any riders?Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his speech on Tuesday that all exemptions are conditional and can be rolled back if a Covid-19 case is reported of resurfaces in the area concerned.In the guidelines issued on Wednesday, the government said the select industrial activities are allowed to resume with adequate safeguards and mandatory standard operating protocols (SOPs). Essential services will continue like they have been. Won’t they?The revised guidelines permit all health services and the social sector to remain functional; public utilities will function without any hindrance; the supply chain of essential goods will operate; and important offices of the Centre, state governments and local bodies will remain open.Is there anything else that I need to know?Yes, the government order mentions national guidelines — such as mandatory masks or face covers at workplaces and in public places, strong hygiene and health care measures such as using sanitisers, opting for staggered shifts, and imposing fines for spitting, among others — that citizens need to follow. An individual violating the guidelines will face penal action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faq-nine-things-you-must-know-about-the-govt-order-on-lockdown-2-0/story-WlLAoO4urDqSO1eY7KKQoI.html
15-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Meghalaya reports 6 new cases, all linked to 1st patient||Meghalaya reported six new Covid-19 positive cases on Wednesday morning with all of them having links to the first patient, a doctor who expired in the wee hours of the day.Chief Minister Conrad Sangma took to Twitter to inform that of the total tests conducted, 6 have come positive and all had connections to the doctor who was the state’s first Covid-19 patient and was also the managing director of Shillong-based Bethany Hospitals group .“Of the 68 tested so far, 6 have come out positive who are all family members and helpers of the first Covid-19 positive case. 6 other cases are being retested. All the rest of the cases are negative,” Sangma tweeted.The deceased patient had tested positive on Monday and the state government had traced nearly 2,000 primary and secondary contacts. Tests had been conducted on 90 samples, nearly half of the primary contacts of the patient.“I am deeply saddened to inform that the first Covid-19 positive patient in Meghalaya passed away this morning (Wednesday) at 2:45 am. My heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones,” Sangma tweeted.The first patient, a popular doctor in Shillong, passed away in Bethany Hospital. It is suspected that he got infected from his son-in-law, a pilot with Air India who had returned from New York to Delhi on March 16 and came to Shillong on March 24.Though the pilot was under quarantine till April 7, he was asymptomatic and wasn’t tested for Covid-19 earlier.“Preliminary investigations suggest that one of the relatives of the concerned person had a travel history to one of the infected countries and he was back in Shillong before the 14-day quarantine period was over,” Sangma said on Tuesday.“Though the person took all precautions but sometimes we see asymptomatic cases as well, who don’t show any signs but could be a carrier. Therefore there is a high chance that it could have been passed on from there. We are looking at all possibilities of how this could have happened,” he added. Meghalaya now has a total of seven Covid-19 cases and one fatality. The total number of cases in Northeast stands at 46 with Assam recording 32 cases, 7 cases in Meghalaya, 2 each in Manipur and Tripura and one each in Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.While one patient each has recovered in Manipur and Tripura, two deaths have been recorded, one each in Assam and Meghalaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-meghalaya-reports-6-new-cases-all-linked-to-1st-patient/story-yFK9LddAUjEmm70eRBLg0O.html

A shipment of HCQ is also being sent to Dominican Republic, the current President of the UN Security Council, as well as Uganda and Ecuador, people familiar with the development said.An official said India is also committed to supplying the two drugs to its special strategic partner Russia; Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken to PM Modi on March 25. But the special focus of the government at this point are the Gulf countries, particularly the UAE. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla are in constant touch with their Gulf counterparts. India has already sent a 15-member army medical team with supplies to Kuwait and supplied HCQ to Bahrain.Global demand for hydroxychloroquine manufactured by India boosted after some studies indicated that the drug, when paired with azithromycin, helped clear patients of the virus at a much faster rate than seen usually.The decision to quickly send the drugs to Abu Dhabi and Dubai was taken after UAE sent a request for 3.25 crore HCQ 200 mg tablets and 10 metric tonnes of active pharmaceutical ingredients. These commercial supplies will go through six Dubai-based consignees having contracts with Indian pharma majors in Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru.Also Watch | ‘No shortage of hydroxychloroquine in India, will be available in future’: Govt According to South Block officials, India has put the drug supplies to UAE and Jordan on a fast track as PrIme Minister Narendra Modi has a personal rapport with both UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and King Abdullah of Jordan.

15-04-2020||India||Iran expects India, world community to stand up against US sanctions: Iranian envoy||Iran expects India and the rest of the world community will stand against stand against the “unjust” US sanctions that are hurting millions of Iranians amid the Covid-19 crisis, Iranian ambassador Ali Chegeni has said.In an interview with Hindustan Times, he also talked about India-Iran cooperation to tackle the pandemic and the steps being taken to help the 255 Indians who tested positive for Covid-19 in the holy city of Qom and the 5,000-odd Indians stranded in different parts of Iran.Q. What is the current situation with regard to Covid-19 in Iran? Has the number of cases peaked?A. Despite the brutal and inhumane US sanctions, our situation is relatively good in fighting the pandemic in comparison with some other countries. Keep in your mind, we could not take advantage of the experiences of others while Iran was among the countries hardest hit by the highly contagious virus in the first phase of spreading of Covid-19 across the globe. Now, hopefully the curve shows that the pandemic is falling [from] the peak as the number of new infection cases have dropped from 3,200 to 1,600 on a daily basis. Besides, there are around 48,000 recovery cases out of a total of 74,000 as of now.Q. What steps are the authorities taking to control and prevent the spread of Covid-19?A. From the very beginning of the outbreak, a National Committee for Fighting Coronavirus (NCFC) was set up, headed by the President, to make detailed and practical decisions against the spread of Coronavirus. In this regard, all internal powers from the military and law enforcement forces to the NGOs etc were mobilised. All political and economic events, cultural activities, sports contests, and religious congregations were postponed at the order of the committee. After some strict lockdown measures, the NCFC announced the Smart Social Distancing scheme with the aim of reopening low-risk businesses for provinces other than Tehran. For this purpose, the ministry of health has been coordinating with business unions to register in a system and if eligible, they will receive a certificate for doing their business on the basis of health protocols.Most importantly, an Iranian biomedicine company has started mass production of serological test kits which are very much needed to detect the rate of infection among various groups of the population.Moreover, considering the holy fasting month of Ramadan, the religious gatherings will be cancelled, in case it is considered unsafe for public health and the NCFC would decide on the details of this issue in its upcoming meeting.Q. In what ways can India and Iran cooperate to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic? Are there any medical supplies and equipment or any other assistance that Iran has sought from India?A. Given the capabilities of both countries, we can deploy the full strength of relations to effectively combat Covid-19. As you know, for many years we have been importing pharmaceutical products from India and we are confident that our cooperation will continue.The close consultations of both countries’ health ministers and sharing experiences and the lessons learned in fighting the Coronavirus pandemic is very important and it could be more effective in a regional initiative. We could also cooperate on the development of medicines and vaccines as we do share great scientific and technological capacities together with research and development centres in our countries.Considering the unpredictability of the situation, it is important to look at possible options to continue exchanges of goods and commodities according to uniform health protocols. Moreover, this ongoing pandemic could be a way forward to boost mutual economic cooperation and partnership.Q. There are still some 5,000 Indian nationals, including pilgrims and students, who are still in Iran. What is their status? What are the two countries doing to look after their needs?A. Since the citizens of both countries have been engaging in a deep-rooted people-to-people contacts for different purposes, I am happy to say that Indians have always been respected and warmly welcomed by Iranian people and the government. It was expected that many would be stranded as result of the epidemic.Both countries, in a close and warm contact, have worked together to evacuate their stranded nationals and until now, eight batches of Indian nationals were transferred to India by seven Iranian airliners and one aircraft of the Indian Air Force, and the local authorities and Indian missions in Iran are providing all possible humanitarian assistance to the remaining Indians, including pilgrims, students and fisherman.Q. What is the status of the Indians who tested positive and were being treated in Qom and Tehran?A. From the very beginning, the government of Iran along with some local NGOs rushed to meet their accommodation, food and treatment. Recently they have been accommodated in some good hotels and guesthouse advised by Qom governorate under supervision and credit of Indian embassy in Tehran. Those who have tested positive, have been immediately hospitalised and offered the necessary medical treatment free of charge by Iran’s government. Indian embassy is following their situation closely.Q. What is the status of the Iranians who were stranded in India?A. Every year, especially during Nowruz festival, many Iranian tourists travel to India. However, this year coincided with the Coronavirus pandemic and consequently limits on international flights. Thanks to cooperation of the Indian authorities, we have been able to evacuate a majority of them. Still there are around 200 Iranian tourists and students who, at this stage, requested the embassy for their immediate return to Iran. We expect to send them back home by an Iran Air flight from Mumbai in the coming days.Q. What is Iran’s position on the US sanctions that have affected the fight against Covid-19? Does Iran look to India and other countries to help in overcoming these sanctions?A. The Iranian health sector, although among the most resilient in the region and the world, has been affected directly and indirectly by these unjust, illegal and inhumane sanctions. In a hypocritical way, the US administration has claimed that humanitarian supplies, including food and medicine, are exempted from anti-Iran sanctions, but freezing Iran’s financial assets in various countries, banning Iranian banks and denying Iran’s access to SWIFT for funds transfer and clear threats against several foreign banks have deterred them from doing any such humanitarian businesses with Tehran.More important for the stay at home order, we needed to support the people by relief packages but as I mentioned, Iran’s assets have been blocked by the US administration.So far, many prestigious foreign officials and international figures have called for the lifting of sanctions. We expect that the international community, including India, [will] stand against the unjust and extraterritorially imposed sanctions that are hurting millions of Iranians as well as other nations who have been paying a high price in this time of pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iran-expects-india-world-community-to-stand-against-us-sanctions-iranian-envoy/story-TkkjKZ6H8806sVh52HPLzI.html

These are applicable only to those workplaces that are functional under the guidelines issued by the government.

Not more than 2-4 people are to be allowed in elevators.  The MHA in its directive noted that those who are above 65-years of age and/or have co-morbidities must opt to work from home. Parents of children below the age of 5 years should also be encouraged to work from home during the lockdown which has been extended till May 3. “Use of Arogya Setu app will be encouraged for all employees both private and public,” the MHA release read. The government has directed all those reporting to work to be provided with a transport facility. Such vehicles should be sanitised and disinfected regularly and must carry only 30-40% of passenger capacity. This comes a day after the coronavirus lockdown was extended till May 3 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday.On Wednesday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in the country rose to 11,439. The figure includes 9,756 active cases, 1306 cured or discharged cases and 377 fatalities, the Ministry of Health stated. India has witnessed 38 deaths and 1076 new cases of coronavirus reported in the last 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/staggered-breaks-no-large-meetings-new-office-rules-during-covid-19-lockdown-2-0/story-GlljOBRzL8tnMDJ65tI3hJ.html
15-04-2020||India||Mutation in coronavirus from India random, no cause for alarm||A mutation in the coronavirus strain isolated in India has the potential to jeopardise global efforts to develop a vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has infected 2 million people and killed at least 26,000 in four months, according to a preliminary analysis of 106 Sars-CoV-2 and 39 SARS genome sequences.Leading scientists, however, warn against reliance on a single sample with a variation and say further confirmation is needed at sequence and protein level for conclusive evidence.The new study found a mutation in the mechanism Sars-CoV-2 the virus that causes Covid-19, uses to enter the human cells in the strains isolated from one of the first three cases of Covid-19 in Kerala on January 27, which was the first case of the disease in India. The findings were published in the preprint server bioRxiv, which puts scientific papers in the public domain before peer-review.Sars-CoV-2 consists of a strand of RNA enclosed in shell covered with crown-like spikes (explaining its name; ‘corona’ is the Latin word for crown). Most vaccine and drug development efforts are focusing on stopping the action of the viral spike (S) protein that it uses to enter human cells, where it replicates to cause infection.The study found changes in a part of the spike protein that allows the virus to bind to and penetrate human cells. This spike protein targets cells containing ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2), a protein found on lung, kidney, heart, and gut cells in humans. ACE-2 has several roles, including modulating blood pressure and immune response.“We identified a mutation that leads to weaker receptor binding capability, which concerns a Sars-CoV-2 sample collected on 27th January 2020 from India. This represents the first report of a significant Sars-CoV-2 mutant, and raises the alarm that the ongoing vaccine development may become futile in future epidemic if more mutations were identified,” write study authors from Australia and Taiwan. “The observation of this study raised the alarm that Sars-CoV-2 mutation with varied epitope (that antibodies bind to) profile could arise at any time,” said the study, which also provided direct genetic evidence that Sars-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than Sars-CoV, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome.Monitoring the mutation dynamics of Sars-CoV-2 is critical for the development of effective approaches to develop drugs and vaccines to contain the pathogen. “The lower receptor fit may make virus less efficient in transmission, but then we need to watch out for a change in virulence also. As of now this paper, it is ‘curiosity’ information. We have to wait and watch,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.The mutation appears to be random and not the result of natural selection by the immune system because there were no more variants in that part of the spike than elsewhere in the genome, say scientists.“The study is too preliminary and lays too much reliance on a single sample with a variation that has been previously discussed. Unless one sees this confirmed further at sequence and protein level studies, at the minimum, no conclusion can be reached. Definitive conclusion will require proper virological studies,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology, Delhi.Most work on vaccines, drugs and therapies is targeting the spike (S) protein to prevent from binding to the ACE-2 that it sues as a receptor to enter cells. Five Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in phase 1 clinical trials to establish safety for humans and 73 in exploratory or preclinical stages, a vaccine is likely to be ready in early 2021, according to an analysis of the global Covid-19 vaccine database of Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness (Cepi), one of the world’s biggest public funders of vaccine development. The analysis was published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery on April 11, just three months of China sharing the first genetic sequence of the virus on January 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mutation-in-coronavirus-from-india-random-no-cause-for-alarm/story-h1tVOps6zDjXDVNtSosn2I.html

In such cases, one passenger besides the private vehicle driver can be permitted in the backseat in a four-wheeler; in case of two-wheelers, however, only the driver of the vehicle is permitted.The important components of the financial sector, like RBI, banks, ATMs, capital and debt markets as notified by Sebi and insurance companies will also remain functional, with a view to provide enough liquidity and credit support to the industrial sectors.The revised guideline was issued after an announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19 has been extended till May 3. The lockdown was scheduled to end on April 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-lockdown-guidelines-issued-what-it-means-for-you/story-sEv7Lc5JOsrxt6OaN2DJjI.html
15-04-2020||India||Govt permits resumption of some industries in rural areas after April 20||The Narendra Modi government will allow a series of economic activities including food processing industries, construction of roads and industrial projects in rural areas to create job opportunities and give a fresh boost to Indian economy after several industries came to a grinding halt when a federal lockdown was imposed to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.Even as the country enters into a longer lockdown till May 3, a union home ministry notification on Wednesday underlined opening of industries in rural India after April 20.“To provide an impetus to the rural economy, industries operating in rural areas, including food processing industries; construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings and industrial projects in rural areas; works under MNREGA, with priority to irrigation and water conservation works; and operation of rural Common Service Centres (CSCs) have all been allowed,” said the notification.These activities will create job opportunities for rural labour, including the migrant labour force. In his speech on April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed concerns about the livelihood of the daily wage earners.While the government had already exempted agricultural workers from the lockdown apart from those in containment zones, the home ministry notification declared that “procurement of agricultural products” and “agriculture marketing through notified mandis and direct and decentralised marketing” will be allowed.“The manufacture, distribution and retail of fertilisers, pesticides and seeds; activities of marine and inland fisheries; animal husbandry activities, including the supply chain of milk, milk products, poultry and livestock farming; and tea, coffee and rubber plantations are allowed to be functional,” said the notification.While the permitted activities from April 20 are aimed to ensure that agricultural and related activities remain fully functional and provide maximum efficiency to the rural economy the government also wants to create employment opportunities, especially for daily wage earners and other members of the labour force.Transportation of goods is also permitted without any distinction of essential or non-essential goods.However, no industrial activities will be allowed in areas demarcated as containment zones by local administration as these areas will remain under heavy curbs on movement of people.“The objective of the revised guidelines is to consolidate the gains achieved during the 1st phase of lockdown and further slow down the spread of Covid-19 and at the same time provide relief to farmers and labour and daily wage earners,” a press release issued by the information and broadcasting ministry said.Travel by air, rail and road; operation of educational and training institutions; industrial and commercial activities, hospitality services, all cinema halls, shopping complexes and theatres will remain closed. All social, political and other events, religious places or places of worship for members of public, including religious congregations have been stopped.The government has also said that some national guidelines, such as mandatory home-made face covers at work places and in public places, strong hygiene and healthcare measures like provision of sanitisers, staggered shifts, access control and thermal screening will remain in place. Fines will have to paid for spitting.The government has also come with very strong containment measures in the hotspot districts accounting for large number of Covid-19 cases or with fast growth of cases. Only essential services are to be permitted in these zones and strict perimeter control and strict restrictions on movement enforced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-permits-resumption-of-some-industries-in-rural-areas/story-XGyaKl5w0VS1jux6Fdjp2I.html
15-04-2020||India||Govt lockdown guidelines: What do they mean for Covid-19 hotspots, containment zones||The Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday issued the updated guidelines on coronavirus lockdown. This came a day after the lockdown was extended till May 3 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The revised set of guidelines have a section on the management of coronavirus hotspots and containment zones across the country. Coronavirus hotspots are areas that are affected by the disease. Maharashtra and Delhi are a couple of top coronavirus hotspots in the country. Containment zones are determined within a city by the administration keeping in mind the number of Covid-19 cases emerging from a particular location. For example, Delhi has determined more than 50 containment zones in the city where coronavirus cases have been identified. These areas have been sealed and restriction of movement has been placed on residents to keep the disease from spreading any further. “’Hotspots’, i.e., areas of large Covid-19 outbreaks or clusters with significant spread of Covid-19, will be determined as per the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India (GoI),” the release read. In these hotspots, containment zones will be demarcated by States/UTs/District administrations as per the guidelines. In Covid-19 containment zones, activities otherwise allowed by the MHA during the lockdown, will not be permitted. “There shall be strict perimeter control in the area of the containment zones,” the MHA stated in its guidelines. No unchecked inward/outward movement of the population in the containment zones will be allowed except for maintaining essential services and in the case of medical emergencies and law and order related duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-lockdown-guidelines-what-do-they-mean-for-covid-19-hotspots-containment-zones/story-4QSjT2PjuzDO3vZWzMllcK.html

15-04-2020||India||Attacks to appeals: What was Aaditya Thackeray’s take on Bandra incident||Maharashtra tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray had led the charge on Twitter after nearly 1000 migrant workers gathered in Mumbai’s Bandra, demanding trains back home after the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown was extended.Aaditya Thackeray, son of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, continued tweeting throughout the latter half of the day and night on the Bandra incident as his posts led to a political blame game.The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called the incident a failure of the state after Aaditya Thackeray’s outburst.Then there was a phone call from Union home minister Amit Shah to his father. The Union minister said the incidents like that in Bandra could weaken India’s fight against Covid-19 and that the administration needs to stay vigilant to avoid such incidents. He also offered his full support to the Maharashtra government and Uddhav Thackeray called for peace and assured all help to migrant workers in the state.But before logging out for the day, the young Shiv Sena leader had a word of caution and praise.“I appeal to all twitter armies who tweeted, and to those who responded to bandra incident in a polarised, political or communal way, let’s not do that. This is a time for focus. Join hands, we’re all in this together (sic),” he wrote.Also read: Coronavirus cases in India climb to 11,439, death toll at 377“While I was pointing out certain gaps in the process, I see 2 clear political divides as a response. That isn’t what I stand for. We need unity over division, faith over fear, resolve over panic and purity of intent over politics,” he said.This stand was different from what he had to say earlier in the day.Aaditya Thackeray had taken to Twitter soon after the police were able to disperse the crowds from the Bandra railway station. Also read: What happened in Mumbai’s BandraThe Shiv Sena leader had blamed Centre responsible for the situation and said the railways should have run special trains to take the migrant workers to their hometown as demanded by Uddhav Thackeray.“The current situation in Bandra, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the union government not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home migrant labour. They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home,” Thackeray had tweeted in one of his first reactions.Also read: What you need to know todayMaharashtra, he said, had raised the issue of enabling the workers to return home.“A mutual road map set by Union Govt will largely help migrant labour to reach home from one state to another safely and efficiently. Time and again this issue has been raised with the centre,” he said in another tweet.Later, he toned down the tweets and said the Centre and states are facing a Catch-22 situation.“The centre has taken immediate cognizance of the issue and is assisting the State actively. We understand the catch 22 situation centre and states face. I’m thankful to PM & HM for understanding the situation, while trying to ensure the safety of home states of migrants,” he tweeted.“The migrant labour issue persists everywhere. Even as we house more than 6 lakh migrant labour, with breakfast lunch and dinner, the Union and State Govts are coordinating on further relief for the same. We will continue to ensure the comfort of all migrant labour in our camps,” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attacks-to-appeals-what-was-aaditya-thackeray-s-take-on-bandra-incident/story-GqtkroAfnZFnsWGfyjoGAJ.html

15-04-2020||India||Man dies outside Indore hospital; family alleges he was denied treatment||The family of a 65-year-old man alleged he died at MY Hospital in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore on Tuesday after its staff refused to treat him, prompting the opposition Congress to launch an attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.Pandurao, a resident of Kamala Nehru Nagar complained of chest pain on Tuesday. As his family members couldn’t get any ambulance they took him to MY Hospital, the teaching hospital of MGM Medical College, on a two-wheeler in the afternoon.His relative Rahul alleged the staff at the hospital denied treatment to Pandurao and he collapsed after some time on the two-wheeler itself. Family members said an ambulance service operator had earlier demanded Rs 300 to take the patient to the hospital. They were ready to pay the amount but the ambulance service operator refused, forcing them to take the patient to the hospital on the two-wheeler.A video of the man lying on the two-wheeler outside MY Hospital and his family alleging denial of treatment by the hospital soon went viral on social media.State Congress president Kamal Nath’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja sought to know from chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan if this was the state of affairs on health services in Madhya Pradesh and how many people would die like this in the state.The government should take action against the responsible persons, he demanded. “The man died as he didn’t get treatment in the hospital and also he didn’t get an ambulance. The kin had to take him to the hospital on a two-wheeler. This didn’t happen in any remote part of the state but in Indore known as the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh,” senior Congress leader KK Mishra who belongs to Indore said.“The situation in other parts of the state can easily be gauged but the chief minister is not tired of making lofty claims about the health services,” Mishra added.Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said such a death should be a matter of serious concern for the state government. “It should immediately institute an inquiry to look into the man’s demise and his kin’s allegations. At the same time, the government should have a plan to ensure that amid the Covid-19 situation people with other ailments too get immediate and effective treatment,” Nidhi said.State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said the Congress was being hasty in its statements.“Congress is in habit of jumping the gun before getting details. Any death taking place is unfortunate. The government will certainly look into this,” Agrawal said.Dr Pravin Jadia, Indore’s chief medical and health officer (CMHO), denied the family’s allegations.“The man had gone to the hospital on Monday and later returned home. On Tuesday, he was first taken to a private hospital from where he was referred to MY hospital but when he reached the hospital he was declared brought dead. There was no question of denial of treatment,” Jadia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-dies-outside-indore-hospital-family-alleges-he-was-denied-treatment/story-mgQIhaJY7ivzkA9wFtmWzL.html
15-04-2020||India||Meghalaya’s first Covid-19 patient dies, could have got infected from asymptomatic son-in-law||A 69-year-old doctor from Shillong, the first Covid-19 positive patient of Meghalaya, passed away early on Wednesday.John L Sailo Ryntathiang, the managing director of Bethany Hospitals, died at around 3:00 am on Wednesday, sources in Shilliong confirmed. He had tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.This is the second Covid-19 fatality in the Northeast after the death of a 65-year-old patient at Assam’s Silchar Medical College and Hospital last week. There are a total of 40 Covid-19 positive patients in the region - 32 in Assam, two in Manipur and Tripura and one each in Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.Though Ryntathiang didn’t have any recent travel history, he reportedly got infected from his son-in-law, a pilot with Air India who had returned from New York to Delhi on March 16 and reached Shillong on March 24.“Preliminary investigations suggest that one of the relatives of the concerned person had a travel history to one of the infected countries and he was back in Shillong before the 14-day quarantine period was over,” Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said on Tuesday.“Though the person took all precautions, but sometimes we see asymptomatic cases as well, who don’t show any signs but could be a carrier. Therefore, there is a high chance that it could have been passed on from there. We are looking at all possibilities of how this could have happened,” he added. Meghalaya had traced nearly 2,000 primary and secondary contacts of the patient and done tests on 90 of them (nearly half of the primary contacts). The government had asked its Assam counterpart to support with testing of the 2,000 contacts. The Shillong-based Northeastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS) is the lone Covid-19 testing lab in Meghalaya.“Our basic strategy would be to identify, isolate and test all contact for the first few days till we are able to zero down and close the loop of transmission,” Sangma said in Shillong after a cabinet meet on Tuesday.Both branches of the private hospital, where the doctor worked, have been shut and the staff placed under quarantine. The government has asked everyone who may have visited Bethany Hospital on or after March 22 to register themselves by calling 108 or getting in touch with the health department.Meghalaya’s capital Shillong has been placed under curfew for 48 hours beginning 6:00 am on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-s-first-covid-19-patient-dies-could-have-got-infected-from-asymptomatic-son-in-law/story-suEPDjH7TuxJNC7tpLVmdM.html
15-04-2020||India||Naveen Patnaik says Covid-19 levelling off in Odisha, but officials sound caution||Expressing his happiness over Covid-19 cases levelling off in Odisha, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday asked the police to ensure that movement of agriculture products is not stopped and those indulging in domestic violence during lockdown are punished.Chairing a review meeting, Patnaik said that coronavirus statistics are levelling off in the state and going down. Of the 60 confirmed cases of Covid-19, 18 have recovered while one person died. “That’s a very good sign,” said Patnaik, referring to Odisha’s low ratio of positive cases to sample tested among all the states. With only 60 positive cases from 4,734 samples tested till Monday night, Odisha’s ratio of positive cases to samples tested stood at 1.26 while Delhi with 1,510 cases from the 15,000 samples tested had the highest ratio of 10.Maharashtra with 2,334 cases had a ratio of 6.55 followed by Tamil Nadu with 6.25. Among other major states, Rajasthan and Kerala have lower infection-to-test conducted ratios, at 2.7 and 2.6, respectively.“In India, the total number of confirmed cases stood at 10,363,” Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry said on Tuesday. Of these 8,988 are now being treated at various hospitals across the country, he added.Odisha health officials said Odisha’s low ratio of positive cases to samples tested showed there was no community transmission, yet sounded alarm that the state needed to test more to know the exact picture of sperad of infection. “Among the 60 cases, more than 90 per cent are asymptomatic cases. So we can’t celebrate as yet,” said a state health department official, requesting anonymity.Enthused by low number of positive cases, Odisha has already made several relaxations including allowing NREGS work and farmers to resume agricultural activities, including harvesting, selling Rabi crops and other activities to prepare their fields for the coming Kharif season. The government order said shops and establishments selling agricultural implements, cattle feed and fish feed and food processing and packaging units will be allowed to remain open. The panchayati raj department will also facilitate construction and repair of drinking water facilities. Farmers can also dig farm ponds and purchase agricultural implements.During Tuesday’s meeting, Patnaik told the police to ensure that movement of essential and non-essential commodities should not be stopped and movement of agricultural products continue. He also highlighted domestic violence as a major cause of concern during lockdown and asked Odisha Police to begin the process of identifying habitual offenders.Though the state government has so far established 20 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in 18 districts, Patnaik directed officials to ensure that such arrangement is extended in all the 30 districts of the state within next week. The state government has already chalked out a plan to set up Covid-19 hospitals in 36 places having a total capacity of 6,000 beds by the end of this month.Meanwhile, the Odisha Joint Entrance Examination 2020, which was to be held in the first week of May, has been postponed due to extension of lockdown. The annual entrance examination for admission to undergraduate courses in Engineering & Technology, Pharmacy, Postgraduate course like MBA, MCA, MTech, MPharm and Integrated was to be held from May 2-5.Similarly, evaluation of answer sheets of the annual matriculation examinations conducted by the Odisha Board of Secondary Education will be done after conclusion of the lockdown period on May 3, said school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash. Dash said textbooks for students from Class I to Class VIII will be delivered to them at their doorstep by school teachers by April 25.Meanwhile, eminent citizens, civil society organisations and advocacy groups from Odisha have demanded setting up of a National Task Force to address the hardship and difficulties of millions of migrant workers who are stranded in different parts of the country amidst a nationwide lockdown. The need for a task force has become urgent in view of the imminent extension of the lockdown till May 3, said Citizens’ Action Group on Corona, Odisha.The Citizens’s Action Group said the recent violence involving migrant workers in Gujarat’s Surat city and Mumbai showed the need and urgency for better inter-state coordination. “There are more than 2.4 million migrant workers who are currently stranded in some 50,000 camps scattered across the country. Most of them were looking to return home with the hope that the lockdown would end Monday. But now with lockdown getting extended by a fortnight, we are not sure how impatience and anxiety will shape the behavior of the stranded workers,” said CAG co-convenor Umi Daniel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-says-covid-19-levelling-off-in-odisha-but-officials-sound-caution/story-sYVFXfzJnnUXILYrYXNRHO.html

15-04-2020||India||Meghalaya’s first Covid-19 patient could have got infected from asymptomatic son-in-law||Caught by surprise with the detection of the first Covid-19 positive case in the state on Monday, Meghalaya has launched an intensive drive to locate the ‘silent carrier’ who infected the patient.Nearly 2,000 primary and secondary contacts of the patient, a senior doctor with Bethany Hospital, a private hospital in Shillong, have been traced and samples have been collected from 90 of them for testing, almost half of the primary contacts. Results are expected later.Initial investigations suggest the doctor, who doesn’t have travel history outside the state, could have got infected from one of his relatives, more specifically, his son-in-law, who is a pilot with Air India and had returned from New York last month. The son-in-law was asymptomatic for Covid-19.“Preliminary investigation suggest that one of the relatives of the concerned person had a travel history to one of the infected countries and he was back in Shillong before the 14-day quarantine period was over,” Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said on Tuesday in a video shared on Facebook by his office.According to a letter written by the Meghalaya health department to the Union health ministry, the patient’s son-in-law travelled from New York to Delhi on March 16. He travelled from Delhi to Imphal on March 17 and returned to Delhi on March 20.On March 24 he travelled from Delhi to Shillong and was placed under home quarantine from March 24 to April 7 after registering with the state government. The letter adds that a surveillance team of the health department had visited him during the quarantine period.“Though the person took all precautions, sometimes we see asymptomatic cases as well, who don’t show any signs but could be a carrier. Therefore there is a high chance that it could have been passed on from there. We are looking at all possibilities of how this could have happened,” Sangma said.Meghalaya government has asked its Assam counterpart to support with the testing of the 2,000 contacts. The Shillong-based North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS) is the lone Covid-19 testing lab in Meghalaya.“Our basic strategy would be to identify, isolate and test all contacts for the first few days till we are able to zero down and close the loop of transmission,” Sangma said in Shillong after a cabinet meeting.Both branches of the private hospital where the doctor worked have been shut and the staff placed under quarantine.

This individual who committed suicide was a substance user (drug addict) and he was admitted for rehabilitation. He also had some psychiatric problems and in all likelihood, the suicide may be the result of withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric problems,” Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma told journalists in Shillong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-s-first-covid-19-patient-could-have-got-infected-from-asymptomatic-son-in-law-an-air-india-pilot-who-returned-from-us/story-k4lSAEn8VGWIwt2JoeGozN.html

15-04-2020||India||As Covid-19 lockdown extends, airlines offer to reschedule tickets, no refund on cancelling||With the central government extending the lockdown to May 3 and the subsequent suspension of all commercial passenger services till then, domestic airlines have again decided not to refund customers in cash for their cancelled flights and instead offer them rescheduling of tickets for a later date without any additional fee.India had imposed a 21-day lockdown from March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Consequently, all domestic and international commercial passenger flights were suspended for this time period.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here However, most of the airlines had been taking bookings except national carrier Air India for domestic flights for the period beyond April 14.Aviation consultancy Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) India said the civil aviation ministry should instruct airlines to “halt unfair practice of taking advance bookings until resumption is certain and an interim transition schedule has been established”.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of lockdown till May 3, aviation regulator DGCA issued a circular stating all international as well as domestic flights will remain suspended during the lockdown.“Following orders from the Ministry of Civil Aviation issued to all airlines, we have extended the suspension of our operations until May 3, 2020.Also read| ‘Need to review WHO’s role in mismanaging Covid-19 spread’: Trump halts funding“We are in the process of cancelling the affected bookings and we will offer customers free of charge rescheduling to another date until December 31, 2020,” a Vistara spokesperson said in a statement.The customer, however, will have to pay the fare difference, if any, at the time of rebooking, the airline said.A GoAir spokesperson said that it has already “factored in” these type of scenario and that the airline will review its earlier scheme of providing rescheduling free of cost at a later date while protecting their existing bookings for one year.“In accordance with the Prime Minister’s instructions and the DGCA’s circular, GoAir has suspended all its flights till May 3,” GoAir said in a statement on Tuesday. The airline also said it is extending its ‘Protect Your PNR’ scheme till May 3, 2020 wherein customers are eligible to reschedule their flight by May 3, 2021.The airline had on Monday announced that it was extending the “Protect Your PNR” scheme till April 30, 2020.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The civil aviation ministry should instruct airlines to “halt unfair practice of taking advance bookings until resumption is certain and an interim transition schedule has been established”, the CAPA said in a series of tweets. With the lockdown extended till May 3, passengers who have purchased tickets for the April 15 to May 3 would “once again only be offered credit for future travel, rather than a refund,” it said.In case of train travel, the railway ministry has said there will be no advance bookings on trains until further notice. According to the consultancy, this continues to be unfair on consumers who have purchased a service that the airlines cannot deliver, albeit through no fault of their own. Some passengers may not have a need to travel in future during the validity of the credit and will lose their money, it noted.“Some carriers have opened full schedule for sale from 04-May. Even if flights resume from that date, which is not certain, it is highly unlikely that full operations will resume from day 1.Also read| Covid-19 cases rising exponentially, it’s critical to test more: ICMR“Further flight cancellations almost inevitable, resulting in more pax funds in credit,” it said in another tweet said. It may be mentioned here that the then customers of the erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways could not recover their money which the two airlines had amassed on account of advance bookings only after their going belly up.CAPA in its March 18 report had stated that amid Covid-19 and in the absence of government support “several Indian airlines may shut down operations by May or June due to a lack of cash.” Within hours of the government extending lockdown to May 3, budget carrier IndiGo announced resumption of flight services though in a phased manner from May 4. Announcing that all its flights are cancelled till May 3, IndiGo said, it is in the process of cancelling the reservations.”Your ticket amount is protected in the form of credit shell in the PNR, which can be utilised within one year of the issued date.” “In its endeavour to reconnect critical air corridors post the lockdown, IndiGo, India’s leading airline, will resume flight operations from May 4, 2020,” IndiGo said in the statement.Gurugram-based spiceJet also said the amount from the cancelled ticket will be maintained in a credit shell.“We are cancelling the reservation of those who booked tickets for travel till May 3, 2020. Upon cancellation your entire amount will be maintained in credit shell and the same may be used for fresh bookings and travel till February 28, 2021, for the same passenger,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-lockdown-extends-airlines-offer-to-reschedule-tickets-no-refund-on-cancelling/story-2lnmKYLeWsWyuNWXVQlIuJ.html

He added there are some areas in the city, where people were still coming out of their homes without any reason despite several appeals. “Police will now take strict action against them by booking them under the NSA.”The Dehradun police said they will also book those under the NSA who are “deliberately not taking precautions like wearing masks and spitting to spread the infection and misbehaving with health workers” in the district. Dehradun has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases —18 — in Uttarakhand. The state overall has 35 cases.Legal experts said the proposed move will amount to the misuse of the NSA as violaters can be booked under the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, which are in force to implement the lockdown.Kartikeya Hari Gupta, a senior Uttarakhand high court advocate, said, “If the police have decided to do so then they are clearly unaware of the law. When there are provisions in both the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act for the offenders, then what is the need to impose the stringent NSA?”He added the police can even book the offenders for culpable homicide or murder. “The police should understand that though this is a serious pandemic, they have to work as per the law.”Joshi said the police have decided to invoke the NSA as it is a stricter law than the Epidemic Diseases Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-nsa-against-lockdown-violators/story-t7f4r5EwZhk8MHY8D59U2O.html

Earlier, the district  administration had divided the area into 30 clusters, where aggressive testing was carried out.State health minister Raghu Sharma said: “Our target was to test at least 2,000 people in 3 days to understand the situation in Ramganj. Now that we have the results, our strategy is to completely forbid movement.”Asked about the rising number of cases in Jaipur, he said: “Rise in number of cases in Jaipur is not a worry. We are testing more people so more people are testing positive. We decided to increase testing at least 5 times to see if the Ramganj containment zone had slipped into the community transmission stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-bans-all-movement-in-13-clusters-as-cases-cross-1-000/story-Nrryv8DWYsSRHjlsUrSN9N.html
15-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The nationwide lockdown in India will continue till May 3 although the government will release on Wednesday guidelines for a phased exit in certain parts of the country. The extension of the lockdown, announced on Tuesday by the Prime Minister, means that by May 3, India would have been in quarantine for 40 days.That’s long by any measure; it is longer for a country of 1.3 billion people and with a GDP of $2.5 trillion. Assuming that the economy’s productivity has fallen by 50% in this period, that means a loss of $137 billion in GDP. And assuming that it has fallen by 60% (a more plausible number), the loss works out to $164 billion. Some people think even a 60% calculation is far too conservative.Also read: New Covid-19 count hints Delhi close to turning a corner on Tablighi Jamaat casesThe losses won’t stop at that though, and will continue even after the lockdown, which will have a lingering effect on supply chains and productivity — and the real number is likely to be higher.Even as the Prime Minister announced the extension of the lockdown, Barclays put out a report predicting that the Indian economy will not grow in 2020 (calendar year). That’s actually a more optimistic prediction than the one put out by Nomura some time back which predicted that the economy could shrink by 0.5% this year (again, calendar year 2020). The most optimistic projection thus far is by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which said, also on Tuesday, that India would grow at 1.9% in 2020 (faster than most countries, including China, which is expected to grow at 1.2%). IMF also expects India to grow by 7.4% in 2021.The IMF number seems implausible in the current context with India in recession territory. The only question that needs answering concerns the extent of recession, and how soon India can exit it. Which is why it is important that India announces a comprehensive fiscal package — for individuals and businesses.Also Read: Could Ebola trial drug be answer to Covid-19?Which is also why businesses, especially, will be watching the guidelines that the Prime Minister said would be issued tomorrow on a phased exit (this writer’s term, not the PM’s) from the lockdown in parts of the country. An analysis of Covid-19 infections by district showed that 50% of the infections were concentrated in just 20 of India’s 736 districts, with 382 districts not reporting any case at all till April 11. There’s been talk in government circles of dividing the country into zones based on infections, and allowing the resumption of business activity, conditionally, and with adequate precautions (mandatory social distancing, for instance) in areas where there are no infections. The Prime Minister did seem to suggest that this could happen from April 20 in some parts of the country, but only the guidelines will make this clear.The 40-day number is interesting for another reason.On April 1, HT reported a model by researchers at Cambridge University looking at various possible lockdown combinations. It found that the most effective was a straight 49-day lockdown, or a 21-five-28-five-18-day combination (a five-day break each time between a 21-day, a 28-day and an 18-day lockdown). In both cases, the rate of infection decreased. This, also called flattening the curve, is the aim of all lockdowns.This buys time for countries to strengthen their health infrastructure, and for scientists and researchers to work on possible cures. A paper published on Monday by scientists at the University of Alberta, Canada, highlights one such candidate — remdesivir. This is a drug that was developed in 2014 to fight Ebola (it failed). In February, the scientists at the same university showed that it worked on the virus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or Mers. The paper published on Monday claims it also works on Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. According to the paper, remdesivir prevents the virus from replicating. This is the process by which the viral DNA or RNA mixes with the host cell’s own genetic material and pushes it to replicate the viral genome. Preventing a virus from replicating pretty much stops it in its tracks. The drug remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, is an experimental drug and has not been cleared for use anywhere in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-CrJ9Pdab49Lfl4d7lmnCyH.html
15-04-2020||India||Delhi govt gears up for second act||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday that his government will implement the extended Covid-19 lockdown in full and officials in his administration ruled out any restrictions being eased before May 3 unless the Centre specifically wants them to be relaxed.Welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to extend the lockdown until May 3, Kejriwal asked residents of Delhi to strictly follow the restrictions in the city where the Sars-CoV-2 virus has infected 1,561 people and claimed 30 lives, until the battle against the disease goes on. Thirty people have so far been cured of the disease “Delhi will fully implement PM’s lockdown measures,” Kejriwal wrote on the microblogging site Twitter. Modi said in a televised address on Tuesday that the nationwide three-week lockdown, which was to end on Tuesday, would remain in force until May 3. He said the Centre may relax restrictions in some geographies after April 20 depending on the effectiveness with which the lockdown is enforced and new Covid-19 cases are stanched. Guidelines on the possible relaxations will be released on Wednesday.Senior officials in the Delhi government said the ongoing restrictions will continue, and no relaxation will be allowed on the movement of people and private vehicles, except for those engaged in the essential services.“We are waiting for the detailed guidelines to come from the central government. If they ask us to relax certain sectors, we would. But, on our own, we have no plans as of now because of the increasing Covid-19 cases in the city,” said an official, who did not want to be named.On Monday, the national capital had seen the highest spike (356 cases) in infections on a single day. The number of containment zones in Delhi on Tuesday increased from 47 to 55, the district administration said it had been instructed to follow containment and lockdown measures stringently, and consider lifting the restrictions gradually only if the number of positive Covid-29 cases in an area comes down to zero. “Relaxations in a containment zone or a hotspot and the areas surrounding it (buffer zones) will be allowed only if there is no new case reported in there for at least 14 consecutive days,” said a senior official in the health department on condition of anonymity. According to the Prime Minister, the authorities will keep a close watch on how strictly the lockdown guidelines are followed over the days running up to April 20. Areas that score satisfactorily in the assessment are expected to get a breather, with limited activities being allowed to benefit daily-wage workers.But a breather from the restrictions will be offered only if officials are satisfied that an area has eliminated the threat of Covid-19 to a large extent. If a case surfaces or resurfaces, the relaxations will be rolled back.An official in the chief minister’s office said some relaxations could be given to offices, industries, factories and stores after April 20, but that too will depend on Delhi’s Covid-19 curve..“One proposal is that offices and factories of some sectors, as specified by the Central government, will be allowed to operate but only with about 50% workforce or so. For factories which require daily wage workers and labourers, it is being considered that the owners be asked to arrange for their overnight stay within the premises or somewhere else. Staggered workforce and work times will be the key,” the official said. “If it continues to spike like it did yesterday (Monday), the restrictions will be stricter. This means the lockdown will be enforced very strictly. Not just the containment zones, but also in the neighbouring areas of these zones,” the official said, requesting anonymity.To curb the spread of the coronavirus in neighbourhoods, district magistrates across the city on Tuesday began forming “Corona Foot Warriors Containment and Surveillance Teams” in the areas under their jurisdiction. A total of 13,742 teams will be deployed across the city and each team will be led by a Booth Level Officer (BLO). “By tomorrow, all districts are expected to be ready with their teams,” said an official in the chief secretary’s office. These teams will have to do field inspections to ensure compliance with the lockdown rules, conduct foot patrols to cover every household to identify suspected Coivid-19 cases, ensure their secure transport to hospitals,and keep health workers in the loop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-gears-up-for-second-act/story-k6YJ5FB7mFTqLCdOhkWbPI.html
15-04-2020||India||India to stay locked down till May 3||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in an address to the nation on Monday that the ongoing 21-day national lockdown will now be extended for another 19 days until May 3, a move that experts said would flatten as well as delay the cycle of infections, although both the opposition and industry criticised his speech for its silence on a much-needed economic relief package. Modi emphasised that while India had done better than most other countries in the battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), it still needs citizens to make more sacrifices to win the fight against the pandemic.Acknowledging that this entailed economic costs, the PM said the priority was to save lives of Indian citizens. He did offer some hope of a phased exit, at least in some areas. If states, districts, even local sub-regions down to the police station level, till April 20, were able to enforce the lockdown strictly, and prevent the emergence of new hot spots, based on a careful review, relaxations will be introduced to resume a set of “necessary activities” in these specific geographies, Modi said. Government officials have spoke of a plan to categorise India into zones depending on the intensity and the spread of infections, and opening up unaffected areas. Addressing the nation — in his fifth speech on the coronavirus pandemic in less than a month — the PM underlined that India‘s quick and strong response to the crisis helped it cope better and defended the lockdown, for the situation would otherwise have been “unimaginable”. He offered a review of India’s efforts so far and claimed that the health infrastructure was being ramped up and measures undertaken to minimise inconvenience to citizens;said that relief to the poor and daily wage workers was topmost in his list of priorities; and made seven specific appeals to citizens. The Opposition, while broadly supportive of the extension of the lockdown, was critical of what it saw as the PM’s silence on economic relief to both industry and labour, and measures to address hunger and distress. Experts too underlined that while the lockdown will give India more time to deal with the disease, the government should have offered more specific measures to different sectors. And industry bodies expressed their disappointment at the lack of any specific relief measures for business, or even hints of those in the offing. Ramanan Laxminarayan, director at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, and a senior research scholar at Princeton University, said that the government had clearly prioritised health. “This additional lockdown will push the epidemic curve out quite far. Our options in terms of treatment options may be quite different then. Our understanding of the disease is improving each day and our ability to respond would be better if we have more time to prepare.”But others were concerned about the absence of specifics in the PM’s speech. Yamini Aiyar, president and chief executive of the Centre for Policy Research, said that apart from mentioning that the guidelines (for possible relaxations after April 20) would be announced on Wednesday, the speech did not offer clarity on what the next 19 days will be used for — in terms of enhancing health service preparedness, testing strategy and crucially, hunger and starvation.“For the next 19 days we need greater transparency on government action, including on testing, clear communication (especially for graded opening up), better centre-state coordination and crucially an economic package that instils confidence.”“It is expected that close to 40 million jobs are at risk during the period April-September 2020. Hence, an urgent relief package is also critical,” Sangita Reddy, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), said on Tuesday on the impact of the lockdown. The PM began his speech by first hailing the discipline and restraint shown by citizens during the lockdown, despite facing problems — from food to mobility to being away from families. This, he said, was an example of the collective power of “we the people of India”, enshrined in the Constitution. He then outlined how the world, including resourceful, developed countries was struggling with the pandemic and while comparisons were not appropriate, many countries which were at the same level as India sometime back, have seen a spike of cases, with 25 to 30 times more than the cases in India. “Long before we had even a single case of Corona, India started screening travellers coming in from corona-affected countries at airports. Before the number of patients reached 100, India made 14-day isolation mandatory for all those coming in from abroad. Malls, clubs and gyms were shut down in many places. When we had only 550 Corona cases, then itself, India had taken the big step of a 21-day complete lockdown,” the PM said.India, he said, did not wait for the problem to aggravate but decided to tackle it early. If these decisions had not been taken, and lockdown and social distancing not been enforced, then, the PM said, he shuddered to think what the situation would have been.His remarks on India’s preparations and decisions come in the wake of criticism of the government that it responded late to the crisis.The PM then spoke of the role of states and local self-government units — which had all been exercising utmost responsibility in this battle. He said he had been in continuous touch with the states; they had all recommended the extension of the lockdown; and some had already done so. “Keeping all the suggestions in mind, it has been decided that the lockdown in India will have to be extended till May 3. During this time, we must continue to maintain discipline in the way we have been doing till now.”Outlining the next challenge, the PM said it was crucial that the virus did not spread to new areas — and a single new case, or a single death, should be of highest concern. To do so, the PM said it was important to be vigilant about existing hot spots (a reference to zones which has seen as clusters of cases), ensure strict monitoring and lockdown in areas which could potentially become hot spots, and prevent the emergence of any new hot spots. This would be done for a week, till April 20.“Until April 20, every town, every police station, every district, every state will be evaluated on how much the lockdown is being followed. The extent to which the region has protected itself from coronavirus will be noted. Areas that will succeed in this litmus test, which will not be in the hot spot category, and are likely not to turn into a hot spot may be allowed to open up select necessary activities.” But this relaxation, the PM emphasised, was strictly conditional. The rules to go out would remain strict; permission would be withdrawn immediately if lockdown rules were violated or cases spread. A detailed guideline on these possible relaxations, in these specific areas, after April 20, will be put out by the government on Wednesday.The PM underlined these exemptions were being prepared with an eye on the poor and daily wage workers, who had suffered through major difficulties. He also acknowledged the concerns of farmers and said that with the rabi harvest around the corner, the Centre and states were working together to minimise the inconvenience for them. He assured citizens that there were adequate supplies of essentials — in perhaps an effort to ensure that there was no panic buying. While the government has faced criticism for the failure to ramp up the health infrastructure, the PM underlined that this had indeed been done — and offered statistics. From one lab to test Covid-19 patients in January, the country now had 220 testing labs; while global experience showed that for every 10,000 patients, about 1,500-1,600 beds were required, India already had 100,000 beds; there are also 600 hospitals dedicated to Covid-19 patients. Towards the end of the speech, the PM turned back to citizens with seven specific appeals. This included first, taking care of the elderly, especially those with co-morbidities; second, adhering to the lockdown and wearing home-made masks; third, enhancing immunity by following guidelines put forth by the Ayush ministry; fourth, downloading the Aarogya Setu app (which helps track health details of individuals and their possible contact with positive cases); fifth, taking care of poor families; sixth, remaining compassionate towards those who worked in one’s industry and not terminating their services in these times (at a time when companies have been reported to laying off staff), and finally, respecting frontline workers. The Opposition’s response was mixed.Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said the party understood the compulsions of extending the lockdown and supported it. “But beyond the lockdown, what was ‘new’ in PM’s new year message? It is obvious that livelihood for the poor — their survival — is not among the priorities of the government. CMs’ demand for money elicited no response. Not a rupee has been added to the miserly package of March 25, 2020.” He claimed that the poor had been left to fend for themselves for 21+19 days, including practically soliciting food. “There is money, there is food, but the government will not release either money or food.”Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati said the party supports the extension of the lockdown “but the government must keep in mind the interests of the poor, labourers, farmers and other working class, and provide aid to them during the lockdown period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-stay-locked-down-till-may-3/story-2Xgk1mxQDSopZTQrpzt1SM.html

15-04-2020||India||Aarogya Setu has 50 million users in 13 days, beats ‘Pokémon GO’ record||India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu (health bridge) became the world’s fastest growing mobile app on Tuesday night with 50 million users in 13 days. Of these, 11 million were in a single day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to download the application in his third televised address to the nation, according to the Niti Aayog team lead.With 99% downloads on Android, Aarogya Setu overtook Nintendo’s popular augmented reality game ‘Pokémon GO’s’ record of 50 million downloads on Google Play in 19 days in 2016.The downloads surged from 39 million to a peak of 100,000 per minute on Tuesday morning following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 10 am address.By midnight, 50 million people had downloaded the mobile app launched on April 2 to alert users who are at risk of exposure to Covid-19 infection over the past two weeks.“We expected to touch 50 million users by April 15, but reached it a day before. There were 11 million downloads on Tuesday, which is the sharpest single-day surge in installations since the app was launched. PM Modi’s announcement led to a spike that peaked at 100,000 registrations per minute in the afternoon, at around 20,000 downloads per minute on average over the rest of the day,” said Arnab Kumar, programme director of frontier technologies, Niti Aayog. He is part of the team that developed the app.Apart from reaching out and informing users about their potential risk of infection, this “privacy-first by design” app also shares safe behaviours and updated medical advisories about Covid-19 containment in 11 languages.Singapore has a similar mobile app called TraceTogether for contact tracing. It was launched three weeks ago, and Google and Apple are collaborating to launch a similar contact-tracing initiative.All these apps convert personal and location data into a random anonymous device identification that is saved for two weeks in your phone and the phones of other users within bluetooth range. That usually comes to around 10 metres for most smartphones.The data is uploaded on the server and shared with health authorities only when either the user tests positive or is at high risk of infection. It then alerts all other users in the contact chain.How it works is fairly simple.“Imagine someone, say Person A, leaves by train to work and then comes back home again. All is well. The next day this person reports symptoms and requires a test, which turns out to be positive, then there is an instant signal which goes to all those people who were close to that person during commuting, at work or at home. And the people who were a little far away are warned,” said Dr K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific adviser to the central government.This is important because one should not only consider those who are showing symptoms.“If we do nothing, then this is what happens. A person who is asymptomatic but positive becomes symptomatic, infects other people who also later on become symptomatic and the epidemic spreads. Now if you quarantine everyone who has symptoms and nothing else, then you will be quarantining only some of the suspects. There will always be the asymptomatic people who will still be spreading the disease. You don’t know who they are and it’s not possible to test the entire population,” he said.“You need to have a way of focusing as this asymptomatic person travels over various distances, over time. We need to find out who all were close to that person and warn the others after the person is identified as positive. This is what Aarogya Setu also does. It will find the symptomatic person and also identify all the asymptomatic people around them in the past few days and advise them too,” said Dr VijayRaghavan.“Aarogya Setu gives each user a unique anonymous device identification on registration. The linking of the device identification to a mobile number is a one-time process and is then encrypted and secured in a server,” said Kumar.All future interactions from device to server are done through encrypted device identification detail and no personal information is exchanged after the one-time registration.When a user comes in proximity of another registered mobile, the app stores an encrypted signature of this interaction on both phones. This information is not pushed on to the server unless the user is a suspect case and considered at risk, either from having come in contact with someone who was later diagnosed as a Covid-19 case, or if the user’s self-assessment categorises him or her at risk of infection.Kumar insisted that the personal and location data is only used for providing the Covid-19-related information and medical services necessary to stop further spread of the infection.“Protecting personal information is a priority and the app never reveals the personal identity of anyone, including the identity of the Covid-19 patients. Your data is not going to be used for any other purpose. All security and vulnerability aspects were reviewed by teams from IIT-Madras and a global tech-audit firm,” said Kumar.The information of all unique interactions is stored only for 30 days on the device, after which all data is deleted. The data for non-risk users is deleted from the server in 45 days, and for at-risk patients, it is wiped in 60 days.If a user tests positive for Covid-19, the location data is used only to map the places he or she visited over the past 14 days to identify potential hotspots where infection outbreaks are likely to occur and quickly sanitise them and ramp up contact-tracing and testing.Several countries are using location data for contract tracing.China used QR codes and GPS from mobiles and the social network app Baidu to track movement, while Korea have used security camera footage, credit card records, and GPS data from cars and cellphones for contact tracing. Israel has tracked mobile phones of confirmed or suspected cases, while Austria and Belgium are using anonymised data from telecom operators for contact-tracing and monitoring those quarantined.The mobile app is designed for scalability and has the architecture to support e-pass, suraksha stores and telemedicine. “It’s a building block model for a holistic health stack that can integrate all health data and healthcare delivery services in one app,” said Kumar.The Aarogya Setu app is available for both Android and iOS users, and will be available on KaiOS soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aarogya-setu-has-50-million-users-in-13-days-beats-pokemon-go-record/story-4Q25vLRuezSuzPA8jboLEL.html
15-04-2020||India||Coronavirus lockdown phase-1 ends, phase-2 begins: Summary of India’s fight against Covid-19||The last day of the first phase of 21-day-long national lockdown proved to be a significant landmark for India’s coronavirus containment efforts with the single largest growth in positive cases registered within a day amid a glimmer of hope from states like Goa and Kerala where active Covid-19 cases remained less than the number of recoveries. Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday also reported more recoveries than positive cases.The contrasting nature of the developments was aptly summed up in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation which, while recognising the important role played by the three-week-long national lockdown in preventing the contagious disease from exploding in India-- like it has done in the west—also underlined its insufficiency in ensuring a decisive victory against the pandemic, making the prime minister order the second phase of 19-day-long national lockdown.In nutshell, the day was marked with assessments that the gains made so far by making hard choices could easily be frittered away by any complacent view favouring relaxation for an immediate resumption in economic activities, when the world was being served a grim reminder with nearly two million infections and almost 125,000 fatalities.The total number of infections in India stood at 10,815 and the death toll was at 353, as per the latest health ministry data. Prime Minister Modi made it clear that India was not out of the woods yet for anyone to hope for business as usual, which he said could only be allowed to resume post April 20, that too in a graded manner after establishing beyond doubt that it did not pose the threat of a rise in Covid-19 infections.The prime minister acknowledged the huge economic cost and suffering to people due to the lockdown but reminded all that it was still the right path if the country hoped to avoid the horror seen unfolding in many countries.Soon after PM’s address, a crisis built up in Mumbai when about a thousand-strong crowd of migrant labourers gathered at a bus stop near Bandra railway station demanding the resumption of transport services to take them to their respective home states. It was controlled with police action and political assurances to take care of their immediate needs till May 3.A similar build-up of migrant workers eager to return home was also seen in Thane district and in Surat in Gujarat in a grim reminder of the dangers of letting the situation slip out of the hand.Prime Minister said that an extensive guideline governing the rules in the second phase of lockdown will be released tomorrow. It was followed by an official release by the home ministry announcing the continuation of the regulations that were enforced during the first phase.The extension of suspension of passenger train services and international and domestic commercial passenger flights till May 3 has already been announced.In his nearly 30-minute-long address, PM Modi asked people to follow the seven steps including taking care of the elderly, maintaining social distancing and helping the poor.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19PTI reported that Agriculture, fishing activities and pharma industries are likely to get relaxation from April 20 if there is no dramatic increase in the number of cases till then, while curbs in 370 districts affected by coronavirus out of the 725 districts will continue.Congress termed PM’s address as rhetoric and alleged that it was hollow on specifics. The party said there was no mention of a financial package or concrete steps to revive the economy.DMK President M K Stalin and Kerala finance minister and CPI-M leader Thomas Isaac seemed to echo the sentiment by asking the prime minister to offer concrete financial help to the states instead of just praise.

15-04-2020||India||Industry bodies call on govt for stimulus of up to Rs 16 lakh crore||Industry bodies redoubled calls for a financial package of Rs 14 lakh crore to Rs 16 lakh crore to revive the economy even as they supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to extend the 21-day lockdown that ended on Tuesday by 19 days to May 3. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) on Tuesday estimated the magnitude of daily losses arising from the national slowdown at Rs 40,000 crore . “It is also expected that close to 40 million jobs are at risk during the period April-September 2020. Hence, an urgent relief package is also critical,” Ficci president Sangita Reddy said.In his speech on Tuesday morning announcing the extension, Modi also asked companies not to retrench people. “Show empathy to people working in your business,” he said. But roiled by the lockdown, which has bought economic activity to a standstill, Indian industry is looking for an economic package from the government -- akin to the one announced by the US, around 10% of that country’s gross domestic product (GDP), in the form of assistance to individuals, companies, and states. “The economy needs a stimulus package of at least about Rs 14 lakh crore , including around Rs 2.20 lakh crore fertiliser dues, payments from public sector companies, and tax and other refunds,” Niranjan Hiranandani, president, Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), said. DK Aggarwal, president of the PHD Chambers of Commerce and Industry, demanded “an increased stimulus relief package of Rs 16 lakh crore”.The other element of the package should be focused on creating demand, which is going to be a major challenge for the industry when the economy reopens, Hiranandani said. “Cut GST [Goods and Services Tax] rates by 50% for six months to boost demand. This will cost (the government) Rs 3 lakh crore.” Demand can also be created by paying another Rs 80,000 crore through a direct cash transfer to farmers. “Pay them each about Rs 5,000 additional cash,” he said. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are on the verge of closure due to liquidity crunch and other issues, he added. “They need about Rs 2.80 lakh crore in terms of low cost credit and other incentives.”Other sectors are also hurting. Exporters, particularly small units, are on the verge of closure, said Sharad Kumar Saraf, president, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO). They have no money to pay wages this month, he added, disappointed at the extension of the lockdown.“The shifting of the goalpost will not help in avoiding the stark realities which we have to face whenever we open,” Saraf said, listing issues such as unavailability of labour and raw material and poor logistics. Industry is also keen that at least some sectors are opened up for business. “Of course, there is an impact on the economy. It will take longer to get the wheels turning. But I feel more comfortable to put this behind us rather than face a shutdown again later. I think that the farm sector should open as soon as possible,” Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president Vikram Kirloskar said.Ahead of Tuesday’s address by the Prime Minister, the expectation was that the lockdown would be lifted in phases -- in parts of the country where no infections were being seen -- and with some companies being allowed to operate factories with a fraction of their staff. Modi did hint at a staggered exit, but details on this are awaited. Ficci’s Reddy said that supplies of some essentials have started getting impacted. “The Prime Minister’s directions on graded opening will help start some production activity to ensure that as soon as lockdown opens, there are no shortages faced,” she said.CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee seconded her and said Modi’s guidance on a calibrated exit from April 20 will give crucial time for the industry to plan better. He, however, hoped that “support measures will be announced for industry, especially MSMEs, to tide over this crisis”.The deferment of the selective opening of industry, particularly exports, is “disappointing”, FIEO’s Saraf said. “Non-adherence to the delivery schedule for exports will result in cancellation, penalties and market loss, besides the business loss to enterprises.” Industry, however, endorsed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cautious approach, giving preference to saving lives. “The incubation period of the virus is 15-20 days. A 40-day lockdown is safeguarding us for two cycles of the virus and gives us a chance to consolidate the considerable gains of the first lockdown,” Reddy said.Two persons in the government with direct knowledge of the thinking on an economic package described the situation as evolving. The government is conscious of the condition of the economy and wants to revive it expeditiously, but the first priority is saving lives, one of them said on condition of anonymity. “The government has already given a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package on March 26. The next is expected sooner than later. But, priority is direct protection of vulnerable section of society, informal sector and MSME,” this person added. “It is not an easy task. How do you decide a right package? The size of the package will be understood only after exact requirement is assessed. It is a work in progress,” the second official said, asking not to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/industry-bodies-call-on-govt-for-stimulus-of-up-to-16l-cr/story-mutDjrtsslcYkmMCeNc6BO.html
15-04-2020||India||Passenger trains and flights to remain suspended till May 3||New Delhi: Passenger trains, and domestic and international flights will not operate in India till May 3, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that the three-week long national lockdown that ended Tuesday midnight will be extended by another 19 days. The government has allowed the movement of both cargo flights and freight trains during the lockdown period in a bid to keep supplies of essential commodities running. “There were good reasons for the lockdown to be extended till May 3. We can consider lifting restrictions on both domestic and international flights thereafter. I understand the problems being faced by people who need to travel and request them to bear with us,” union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said. Metro rail services too will remain suspended till May 3, the government announced. “In continuation of the measures taken in the wake of Covid-19 lockdown, it has been decided that all passenger train services on Indian Railways including premium trains, mail/express trains, passenger trains, suburban trains, Kolkata Metro Rail, Konkan Railway etc shall continue to remain cancelled till the 2400hrs of May 3, 2020. To ensure the essential supplies in various parts of the country, movement of goods and parcel trains will remain continue,” the ministry of railways said Tuesday. Air cargo services will also continue. With Indian Railways taking bookings from April 15, it is now staring at the prospect of refunding 3.9 million tickets booked for journeys during this period. It wasn’t immediately clear why it did so. Perhaps in an attempt to avoid a repeat, Indian Railways has now also cancelled advance ticket bookings. “No booking of any type of tickets, including E tickets shall be done till further advice. However, facility of online cancellation will remain functional for ticket bookings. Full refund will be given for tickets for the bookings made for the trains cancelled. Full refund will also be there for those cancelling the advance bookings of tickets for trains not yet cancelled,” the ministry added. HT reported on April 11 that the suspension of commercial flights and railway travel may be extended till the end of the month. “All domestic and international scheduled airlines’ operations shall remain suspended till 11.59pm of 3rd May 2020,” the civil aviation ministry said. India is also not allowing flights to rescue stranded Indian citizens abroad.While both the civil aviation ministry and the railway ministry have prepared plans on enabling movement once the travel restrictions are lifted, officials aware of the developments had said the government is likely to resume transport only after reviewing the number of cases after 15 days. Speaking at an industry seminar, former chairman of the railway board and Air India Ashwani Lohani said, “Airlines will have to relook at their ticket pricing model as social distancing will make it harder to generate revenue.” Once restrictions are lifted, the national carrier is planning to ensure strict social distancing norms in trains, which includes mandatory thermal screening and no allotment of the middle berth in the sleeper class. Airlines have also prepared a plan for probable opening of commercial flight operations once the lockdown is lifted. Reporting time for passengers to the airport should be increased up to 120 minutes, so that passengers may smoothly pass through all the channels like access control, random screening, check-in, immigration (in case of international passengers) by maintaining appropriate distance, according to the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/passenger-trainsand-flights-to-remain-suspended-till-may-3/story-AxU7clwvLWPdfiZrvR9bTN.html
15-04-2020||India||Convert crisis into opportunity, accelerate infra projects during lockdown: Gadkari||India should convert the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity, accelerate infrastructure projects and win the war against the Coronavirus to achieve economic growth, union minister for road transport and MSMEs Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday. “Indian industry should look at the current situation as a blessing in disguise and aim towards improving its export potential,” Gadkari said in a discussion with members of FICCI via video conference.The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) minister also told industry officials to clear pending dues owed by them to units to ease distress in the sector and inject liquidity into the market.Ensuring liquidity in the market is key during the crisis and to ensure this, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started settling all pending claims and arbitration, he said.The ministry has a definitive plan to clear all legitimate claims within three months, he said. “Time taken in reaching decisions should be kept at the minimum possible to avoid delays. For this purpose, I have requested all chairmen of such bodies to work till 7pm everyday instead of 5pm at present,” he added. Referring to the importance of liquidity in markets, he said his ministry is striving to increase credit guarantee for MSMEs to ₹5 lakh crore from ₹1 lakh crore at present, wherein 75% of advances granted by financial institutions are under the government’s credit guarantee scheme. MSMEs contribute 29% of the country’s GDP, Gadkari noted. “The government’s endeavour was to protect MSMEs from the coronavirus-induced crisis. We have decided to raise (turnover) limits for MSMEs. I would like to request you, major industries also have huge outstanding dues of MSMEs,” he said.“We were earlier considering framing a law entailing stringent rules regarding such payments. However, now is not the right time for this. We do not wish to go down that road. An order to this effect should hopefully be out in eight to 10 days, which will naturally enhance their coverage,” he added. Gadkari informed the industry that RBI has allowed rescheduling of term loans and working capital facilities. He called on the industry sector to work in tandem with the government and banking sector. Construction of highways, which witnessed record growth during 2019-20, should increase pace by two to three times in the coming years to meet growing needs for infrastructure, Gadkari said. The ministry plans to go ahead with critical projects during the lockdown.“We have spoken to the Uttarakhand government for starting work on the Char Dham Expressway National Highway project. Necessary precautions of social distancing etc will be taken for the construction,” he said. To kick-start recovery for the road sector, the ministry is open to re-starting projects at different locations on the condition that adequate measures are put in place to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/convert-crisis-into-opportunity-accelerate-infra-projects-during-lockdown-gadkari/story-8RTu6RlgVpxIB5AuhqsMJJ.html
15-04-2020||India||Longer lockdown period may help curb spread||India extended its ongoing 21-day lockdown to May 3 on Tuesday, and indicated that if the spread of Covid-19 was contained in the next week, relaxations could be in the offing.India first clamped the curbs on March 25, and the lockdown will now be 41-days long by the time the government is ready to lift it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the country needed more time to contain the disease.A similar prediction was made in a modelling study by two researchers at the University of Cambridge two weeks ago. The paper, based on mathematical modelling of disease and demographic data, suggested that one 21-day lockdown period was inadequate to reverse the rise in Covid-19 cases.The researchers found that while the 21-day lockdown led to an immediate decrease in the number of cases, the number rose after the curbs were lifted. A second scenario where a 28-day lockdown was imposed after five days of relaxations also showed that the number of infected people increased once the second set of restrictions were lifted.The researchers found that in two scenarios, the rate of new infections could be contained. The first was three consecutive lockdowns of 21 days, 28 days and 18 days with a difference of five days between them. The other was a single lockdown of 49 days.“The study highlighted the need to think of long-term containment strategies because our study showed that the rate of infection was steeper than the rate of recovery,” said Ronojoy Adhikari, one of the authors of the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/longer-lockdown-period-may-help-curb-spread/story-QNYgUFDoU8CevRWumB4Z2L.html

Bihar will start door-to-door screening of residents. Telangana will begin doorstep delivery of essentials in Hyderabad, the state capital, to make sure residents stay indoors. Tamil Nadu intends to tighten restrictions on public movement. Those are the plans some state governments intend to implement over the next few days until April 20 when the Centre will assess the effectiveness with which the states have implemented the lockdown to decide on the resumption of “necessary activities” in some geographies.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayPrime Minister Narendra Modi held out the hoper of a staggered exit in some areas in an address to the nation in which he announced an extension of the three-week lockdown, which was to end on Tuesday, until May 3. The relaxation in lockdown restrictions will be determined partly by the states’ effectiveness in preventing the emergence of new coronavirus hotpsots.Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarkhand and Madhya Pradesh, and others such as Maharashtra said they will prepare their strategies after the Centre on Wednesday releases guidelines for the possible relaxation in restrictions after April 20.States across the country plan to divide their regions into red, yellow and green zones based on high, limited and no cases of Covid-19. Here are some state-specific strategies for the second phase of the lockdown.Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand In Uttar Pradesh, district administration officers and superintendents of police will strictly enforce the lockdown; no inter-district travel will be allowed until April 20. Pool testing of samples, which entails testing for the coronavirus in batches -- a method that can be used to do up to three times as many tests with the same number of kits -- will start from Wednesday. All migrant workers in quarantine will be screened for Covid-19 before they are allowed to leave. Harvesting of the rabi crop and transportation of foodgrains to the farm markets will continue.Uttarkhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat formed a task force to study the impact of Covid-19 on the state’s economy. He announced a waiver of late payment surcharge on farmers and relaxation in payment of power and water bills. Chhattisgarh and JharkhandChhattisgarh has formed a task force to suggest measures to manage the second phase of lockdown; it will announce its plans after the Centre makes public the guidelines for relaxation of lockdown measure. Of the 28 districts, the only active Covid-19 patients are in Korba district. The Jharkhand government announced immediate release of additional rations for all the needy in the state and resumption of works under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Maharashtra and GoaMaharashtra plans to deploy additional police forces around containment areas for controlling crowds, especially in crowded areas such as Dharavi and Worli Koliwada. The state government formed a task force of specialist doctors to suggest measures to reduce the death rate and for management of Covid-19 patients in Mumbai.A decision on allowing industrial activity and easing of lockdown norms will be made only after the Centre announces its guidelines, officials said.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant vowed that the entire coastal state will be declared a green zone by April 17. Haryana and PunjabHaryana’s four Covid hotspots--- Nuh, Palwal, Gurugram and Faridabad -- fall in the National Capital Region (NCR). Eighty percent of the state’s active Covid-19 cases (114 out of total 143) have been reported from the four districts which are all in the red zone. The remaining districts fall in the green and yellow zones. Chief minister ML Khattar said industrial and economic activity will be started in a phased manner after April 14. Punjab will continue with a strict containment strategy and will come out with detailed guidelines after the Centre’s notification on Wednesday. Bihar: The Janata Dal (United)-BJP government will start door-to-door screening on Wednesday with plans to cover all villages where migrant workers have returned. Three villages — Panjwar, which accounts for 23 of the 29 cases, and Kadirabad and Murgiachak , have been declared red zones. Bihar will do block-wise mapping of the state with primary health care centres as nodal offices, said Sanjay Kumar Bihar’s principal secretary, health. Out of 38 districts, only 11 have Covid patients. Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir:Himachal has one red zone, four orange and one green zone and only five of the 12 districts have reported Covid-19 cases. There will be no relaxation of curfew until May 3, wearing of face masks will be mandatory and essential goods will be provided by the police and local administrations.

Testing of migrant labourers will be expanded.Manual work under the rural job guarantee scheme has been allowed in districts not affected by the coronavirus disease, and workers given homemade face masks. A detailed plan will be decided after the Centre’s notification.Andhra Pradesh and TelanganaAndhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who has batted for an easing of the lockdown, said the state government will follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision. Minister for municipal administration Botsa Satyanarayana said directions have been issued to collectors and health department officials to ensure that the Covid-19 does not spread to new areas. The CM directed officials to identify all people who have been taken ill, for whatever the reason and irrespective of whether they had any symptoms of Covid-19 or not, during an ongoing family survey and shift suspected coronavirus patients to hospital. The Telagana government has decided to keep only one route open in containment zones and start home delivery of household supplies in Hyderabad. Any person suspected of carrying the virus will be hospitalised immediately, said KT Rama Rao, minister for municipal administration. Tamil Nadu: Tamil Nadu’s government has appointed 12 senior Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service officers at the zonal level to monitor and coordinate the management of containment zones across the state. The state has started to impose a fine of Rs 500 on those venturing out without face masks. TN has allowed the opening of bakeries for a few hours a day and eased restrictions on the movement of seafood.

15-04-2020||India||Stigma more traumatic than Covid-19: Telangana patient zero||It has been a month since Hyderabad-based software engineer Ram, Telangana’s first Covid-19 patient, was discharged from a hospital in Secunderabad after recovering from the disease, but his days in isolation continue to haunt him. He was alone in the hospital’s isolation ward located in a corner of the facility and did not see a single human face during his treatment. “Doctors who examined me twice daily were in protective gear and other paramedical staff, too, had their faces covered completely. I felt like I was in a different world,” said Ram on condition of withholding his surname. “It is not easy...especially when you are alone in the hospital room and nobody– neither your parents nor friends – can meet you for two weeks.”Ram, who tested positive on March 2, had just one visitor, Telangana health minister Etela Rajender, who came to meet him briefly on March 6. “He was very encouraging,” Ram said.Ram had high fever and pneumonia but he was more worried about his family. “My main worry was what if my family members had contracted the virus? I was especially concerned about my father, who is diabetic. But luckily they all tested negative. And the doctors gave me the confidence that since I am young and physically strong, I can easily get cured,” he said.Ram was given heavy doses of antibiotics as doctors advised him not to read too much about the disease. “Luckily for me, there was no television in my room nor were any newspapers. I was completely cut off from the rest of the world without knowing what is happening outside,” he said.Ram mostly slept for the first few days at the hospital because of heavy medication. “I had my mobile phone and an iPad. I spent most of the time reading books on Kindle. Twice a day, I used to make video calls to my parents and that gave me a lot of peace,” he said. Ram’s mother would also sent him home-cooked food.Ram was discharged on March 14 but advised home quarantine for another 14 days before his locality was declared a containment zone on April 10. “During this period, I realised how society can stigmatise you for no fault of yours. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation had declared my colony as a containment zone though there were no other positive cases there. They told me it was because I had suffered from Covid-19, though I got cured a month ago. This social stigma is more traumatic than the disease.” Telangana has 246 containment zones, out of which 126 are in Greater Hyderabad. The city also has nearly half of the 472 Covid-19 cases in the state. There are over 25,000 people under home quarantined in the state as well.Ram also featured in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat radio address last month and the latter asked him how he contracted the virus. “I would like you to make an audio of your experience and share it on social media. It will remove fear from the people’s minds and at the same time make them aware of the necessary precautions to protect themselves,” Modi told him.Ram said he wanted the society not to stigmatise Covid-19 patients. “I felt relaxed [after talking to Modi] and have learnt to deal with such crisis situations,” he said.Ram is back to his routine now and working from home. “I went out to buy provisions from the supermarket nearby recently. Of course, nobody could recognise me, as I had a face mask on.”Ram is back to his routine now and working from home. “I went out to buy provisions from the supermarket nearby recently.

15-04-2020||India||India’s Covid fight so far is marked by hits and misses||Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, on Tuesday, announced the lockdown that was to end at Tuesday midnight would be extended till May 3. The 21-day lockdown that was to end Tuesday, saw a 20-fold increase in Covid-19 cases, pushing the Centre and the states to move to a strategy of containment , even as people showed exemplary resolve to stay indoors. During this period, the virus spread from 85 districts to 368 of the total 718 districts in India; 1,300 containment zones with a large number of Covid cases were demarcated and completely sealed. No one is allowed to enter or exit the containment areas; essentials are home delivered; and every family in the region is screened; and municipal workers santise the zones twice a day. In some of these containment zones in Mumbai, Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala, people have not moved out of their homes for more than 10 days,state government officials said. Some containment zones worked. Others did not. For instance, the attempt to replicate the Bhilwara model in Covid-19 hotspot of Jaipur did not work. State government officials say this is because the Ramganj are in Jaipur is much more congested than Bhilwara. The Mumbai containment zone plan was replicated in Pune and Nagpur but the authorities had to take a different approach in smaller and rural Sangli. And the much talked about Kerala model of massive testing and effective isolating those with Covid-19 like symptoms was replicated in a modified form, and with mixed success in Maharashtra.Most states ramped up Covid-19 testing, although not to the extent they should. The most aggressive tester is Delhi, which has tested 601 people per million. The worst is West Bengal, which has tested 24.2 people per misslion. The Indian average is 131.4 as on Monday. The US has tested 6693.1 per million population. Most governments have maintained that it is not possible to test all asymptomatic persons for Covid-19 and the first priority is testing those showing symptoms. And, that is the reason for around 80% of the tests being conducted in and around containment zones. Maharashtra has set up special fever clinics to test all symptomatic people within three kms of a containment zone, a reason for the state having conducted highest number of tests in India. One reason for the poor testing statistic in India is that there were few laboratories doing the testing when the lockdown started (53). That’s increased to 220 laboratories including the private ones. The rapid tests that give results within 45 minutes are expected to start later this week, provided the kits arrive from China. At the forefront of the Covid fight are millions of health workers, who started working in absence of adequate personal protective equipment in some states including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, although most states announced special insurance cover for them. If that was not enough, health workers have faced discrimination from people on roads and from neighbours, forcing the Home Ministry to issue a direction threatening strict action against the offenders. The biggest challenge that emerged during the 21-day period was the huge interstate migration of people, with hundreds of thousands of workers rushing back to their villages after business actvity came to a standstill. The rush started from March 26 . After two days of chaos (when all norms of social distancing were flouted) things were finally brought under some level of control; around 1.5 million workers are in 1.3 lakh government and NGO run shelter homes across India, where they have been provided food and also screened for Covid-19 symptoms. States such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, which witnessed high inflow of migrant workers, have converted the schools into quarantine homes for them.For some states, including Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan, and Jammu and Kashmir, the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in mid-March turned out to be a big source of infections. Close to 25,000 people who attended the Jamaat were tracked within five days of sealing of the Jamaat office in Nizamuddin on April ; by then they had spread across India. Around 50% of the positive cases in UP have a Tablighi link, said UP additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi. A senior officer in Bihar said the Jamaat contributed about 60% of the cases, while most of the other cases were of the migrant labourers. In Tamil Nadu, the officials said the spurt in cases happened after the testing of Jamaat attendees started. States have also taken action against 281 foreigners, who attended the Jamaat in violation of the visa rules, and 960 foreign attendees have been blacklisted by the home ministry.There were individuals also who contributed to the spread of Covid-19 too. A young man in Uttar Pradesh’s Basti district with no travel history died of Covid-19. He tested positive after death and turned out to be super spreader infecting 13 persons. A religious preacher in Punjab, who died, was another super spreading infecting 27 persons including his grandchild. A doctor of a private hospital in Bhilwara, who survived the disease, infected around 15 persons working in his nursing home. In Uttar Pradesh, Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor tested Covid-19 positive and sent UP health and police departments into a tizzy. Political leaders of three states, who either attended parties where Kapoor was present or those who came in contact with attendees, went into quarantine. A Jamaat attendee and Kashmir based religious preacher infected as many as 12 persons before his death in Srinagar on March 26Except Sikkim, all states in India have Covid-19 cases. In Ladakh, 12 of the 17 infected persons and in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 10 of 11 infected persons have recovered, according to state government health bulletins. Among the bigger states, Kerala has best recovery rate followed by Bihar, Odisha and Haryana. Only one person of the 66 infected in Bihar has died, which is lowest death rate among the densely populated states. However, the second phase of the lockdown will be important for states such as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, which have witnessed big spurt in new Covid-19 cases in the past one week or so. Cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, Jaipur, Bhopal and Indore are at a critical point of their fight against Covid-19 with most new cases coming from them.

15-04-2020||India||New Covid-19 count hints Delhi close to turning a corner on Tablighi Jamaat cases||The Tablighi Jamaat-linked cases that powered the spike in Delhi’s Covid-19 count may taper off over the next few days, a top government official told Hindustan Times after a modest increase of 51 cases in the city’s total Covid-19 count on Tuesday. Tablighi Jamaat-linked cases accounted for just 9 of these 51 cases.This is the first time in days that the increase of the Jamaat-linked cases has been in single digit, a sharp contrast from just Monday when a whopping 325 people linked to the religious congregation in central Delhi had tested positive.A senior official said Tuesday’s case count is being interpreted to imply that Delhi was close to turning the corner vis-a-vis cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat. “Test results of only 200 more people from the Jamaat are yet to come in,” he told Hindustan Times.The congregation at the Jamaat headquarters has been the single-largest source of the infection in Delhi, responsible for two-third of the 1,561 people being treated for the coronavirus disease. That is a total of 1,080.In all, 2,346 people were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, the Markaz, last month-end. The Markaz leadership had been reluctant to move out but complied with government instructions after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval drove down to the Markaz past midnight. A nationwide search was launched soon after to trace the thousands who had been the Markaz, and their contacts.In Delhi, a similar search had led the authorities to over 850 more people. Like the rest of the country, they were all sent to state-run quarantine centres in the national capital.Of all the people found in the Markaz, 536 Jamaat workers who showed symptoms of the disease had already been admitted to hospitals. As their test results started coming in, Delhi’s Covid-19 count kept rising. By 3 April, 259 of the 386 (67 percent) positive cases in Delhi were linked to the Jamaat congregation.That trend continued for the next 10-odd days. The sharpest spike came on Monday when 325 of the 351 fresh cases were linked to the Jamaat. By then, the Nizamuddin congregation had been linked to 1,071 of the 1,510 Covid-19 cases in the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-covid-19-count-hints-delhi-close-to-turning-a-corner-on-tablighi-jamaat-cases/story-US0120IjphEDRiGxwJOa9H.html
15-04-2020||India||Health experts slam Bengal testing model||West Bengal government’s response to Covid-19 is earning it a lot of criticism from health professionals for allegedly providing misleading data, testing “abysmally low” numbers of swab samples, playing down the extent of the spread of the disease in the state.The state recorded its first Covid-19 positive case on March 17, but it was only last week that the administration started ‘sealing’ some localities after identifying them as ‘high-risk spots’. Experts allege that Bengal may have woken up late. According to senior cardiologist Kunal Sarkar, identification of such ‘micro-spots’ would be of no use, if the frequency of testing does not increase.“...sample testing in India is quite low. And in West Bengal, it is exceptionally low. We need to understand that it is not a competition of low numbers. If we suppress numbers in a state, then our hot spots would amount to nothing but fallacies...,” said Sarkar.Over the past week, the state has been testing about 200 samples per day on an average.Shanta Dutta, director of National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED)– ICMR, said that the state government was not sending enough samples for testing. NICED – ICMR, Kolkata, is a laboratory under the Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory network of the Union health ministry. “...Earlier we used to get enough samples, around 80 – 90 samples every day, but over the last few days we have been receiving 10 – 30 samples. We have around 27,500 testing kits...,” Dutta said, adding that there is no shortage of testing kits.A senior health official of the state government who requested to remain anonymous, however, said, “NICED is not the only testing lab in West Bengal...we have six other laboratories. Samples are also being sent there.”The state recorded 10 positive cases on Tuesday taking the tally to 120.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-experts-slam-bengal-testing-model/story-AhieMrsEGPa8CyryjETJCN.html
15-04-2020||India||Could Ebola trial drug be answer to Covid-19?||A new study has shown that the antiviral remdesivir, an experimental Ebola drug, may stop Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, from replicating, thereby rendering the virus harmless. It is developed by US-based biotechnology company Gilead Sciences Inc., which has a patent on the drug in India. Remdesivir is among four treatments being assessed under the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) solidarity trial to find an effective treatment for Covid 19. India is participating in the trial. Gilead has also started two Phase 3 clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of the drug . Phase 3 trials are required by the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulators to approve the drug. According to a research paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry on Monday, remdesivir can inhibit coronavirus polymrerases -- enzymes that bring about the formation of polymers, particularly DNA and RNA -- in cell culture.The polymerase of Sars-CoV-2 is like the engine of the virus, said Matthias Götte, chair of medical microbiology and immunology at the faculty of medicine and dentistry at the University of Alberta, Canada, who conducted the study. Remdesivir tricks the virus by mimicking its building blocks. “These coronavirus polymerases are sloppy and they get fooled, so the inhibitor gets incorporated many times and the virus can no longer replicate,” Götte explained in a statement.A 35-year-old man who returned to the US after a family visit to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicentre of the virus, with a four-day cough and subjective fever, was found to have improved after receiving remdesivir, the New England Journal of Medicine wrote in an article on the first case of Covid 19 in the US.The man developed pneumonia and recorded an oxygen saturation of 90%. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir started on the evening of day 7. On day 8, his condition is said to have improved and his oxygen saturation values improved to 94-96%. In another paper published on April 10, the journal chronicled the case of 53 patients with severe symptoms of Covid-19 who were treated with remdesivir; clinical improvement was seen in 36 of them. However, only placebo-controlled trials can provide an accurate picture.Remdesivir has been previously tested for treatment of Ebola. It has generated promising results in animal studies for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which are also caused by coronaviruses, suggesting it may have some effect in patients with COVID-19, according to WHO.“Two Phase 3 studies are being run by Gilead in areas with a high prevalence of Covid-19 in the United States, Asia and Europe. One of these is for patients with severe disease and the other studies remdesivir in patients with more moderate symptoms. One of the many questions that these studies aim to answer is whether treatment duration can be shortened from 10 days to 5 days,” Gilead’s chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day said in a statement on the company’s website.But Gilead’s patent on the drug could mean it may take long to reach patients on a large scale. “Remdesivir was used in Ebola. And in a Covid-19 observational study it was found to benefit 2 in 3 patients in terms of critical patients going off ventilator and not needing oxygen support. It’s Gilead’s product. It’s not available in India yet but since we are a participant in WHO’s solidarity trial, which is a five-arm global trial, and remdesivir is one of the arms, it is being tried on our patents as well as part of the study,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, chief of the epidemiology and communicable disease division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“The Indian government has policy options. The government should ask US government or Gilead for some dosages of remdesivir and it should be immediately administered to say 500 patients to see if it’s truly effective. At the same time the government should put in place financial and technological measures to manufacture the drug generically. Thirdly the government can issue an order under section 100 of the Patents Act to use the drug for emergency requirement by the government,” said KM Gopakumar, an intellectual property rights expert. In this case, the section would allow the federal government to authorise generics makers here to use the patent “for the purpose of government”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-ebola-trial-drug-be-answer-to-covid-19/story-MNtg3H0PCoHSqjLG9I6ckJ.html
15-04-2020||India||India asks China to ease export of medical equipment||Facilitating India’s imports of Covid-19-related critical medical equipment and keeping the drug production supply chain open by China is the “best” signal for bilateral ties, Indian ambassador Vikram Misri said on Tuesday.Chinese companies have been contracted for nearly 15 million Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits comprising gowns, gloves, masks and goggles, and 1.5 million rapid testing kits for Covid-19 by the Indian government and private companies. Some of this equipment has already reached India, he said.India has now asked China to speed up the export of a large quantity of quality-checked medical equipment such as protective clothing, ventilators and testing kits from Chinese companies, Misri told a virtual news conference with Beijing-based Indian journalists and representatives of China’s official media.New Delhi is also in communication with Beijing on keeping the supply line of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) open for manufacturing generic drugs.“And at this time, I think facilitation of our needs and our requirements in a timely manner, in a smooth manner, on a predictable timeline at prices that are stable and orderly would be the best signal possible to send for the India-China relationship,” Misri said.“So, I think, this…may have started out as a crisis but it is definitely an opportunity for us to send out a very good message, generally a good signal about India-China cooperation.”Misri said both countries trade in medicine ingredients such as APIs. “We import…a considerable amount of APIs from China to manufacture pharmaceuticals that we export to the rest of the world. And in certain cases, Chinese companies import APIs from India to manufacture certain pharmaceuticals that they need for domestic consumption as well as export,” he said.“So, it’s important at this time when not just the two countries but the rest of the world needs medicines and pharmaceuticals, for us to keep this product line open.”The figure for medical equipment and other materials being supplied by China to India is “enormously dynamic” because there are flights “taking off on almost a daily basis from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen for India”, Misri said. “The numbers are significant…We are in the process of, or have already completed, contracting for nearly 15 million PPE kits, for instance, consisting of gowns, masks, gloves, goggles,” he said.Misri added: “Given our size, our position, I think there is considerable space for India and China to cooperate in controlling the spread of this pandemic and there are immediate short-term as well as medium- and long-term aspects to our cooperation.”The immediate aspect is cooperating in procuring “much-needed medical equipment and products in India, as our healthcare community and our healthcare fraternity, which is at the frontlines of facing this challenge, battles this outbreak”, he said.Misri noted that when China was dealing with the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak, India had provided medical assistance.“Now, we are in the process of commercially procuring a large number of these supplies. China happens to be one of the largest producers, has a number of these products. So, this offers us an opportunity of cooperating in a smooth manner by facilitating the procurement of medical assistance and medical equipment and products from China,” he said.Some of the orders were placed before China imposed regulations limiting and restricting the number of Chinese companies that can export to India, he noted. “Given [these] products are licensed for import to India, it will be a welcome step for Chinese authorities to expedite the registration of these products,” he said.The pandemic first emerged as a local outbreak in Wuhan city in central China late last year, before spreading across the country and beyond over the next three-and-half months. The pandemic has so far killed nearly 120,000 people and infected more than 1.8 million.In India, the confirmed cases have doubled in about a week to 10,000.China itself suffered from a serious shortage of medical equipment in the first stages of the outbreak in Wuhan. The peak has since passed in China and local manufacturers have ramped up production of medical equipment as demand surged across the world.“The two governments have been in touch to ensure stable and orderly purchase and procurement of these items, [focusing] on issues such as identifying bona fide suppliers of these products and entering into agreements with them,” Misri said.It is important to ensure the quality of products and make purchases at reasonable prices, he said.A number of European governments had rejected Chinese-made medical equipment designed for use to prevent and control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Thousands of testing kits and medical masks were found to be below standard or defective, according to authorities in Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands.Beijing has since tightened monitoring and inspection of medical equipment that is exported.India and China are currently observing the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties though various commemorative events have been put off because of the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-china-to-ease-export-of-medical-equipment/story-akREgC5ehzUXpVBWcQuYDJ.html
15-04-2020||India||Status report highlights logistical issues faced by N-E region related to Covid-19||A status report of the Centre has highlighted logistical hurdles related to Covid-19, including a lack of testing centres, which some northeastern states like Assam and Sikkim were facing even as the region has reported fewer cases of the disease. Experts have repeatedly called ramping up testing the best way to slow the advance of the pandemic.The report, a copy of which HT has seen, has highlighted that road blockades were leading to interruptions in supplies of food and other essential items. There is a requirement for more masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for doctors, the report said while underlining the challenges the northeastern states face.The report prepared with development of north eastern region ministry’s help was submitted to the Centre’s empowered panels on Covid-19. The eight northeastern states--Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura--are home to 45 million people as per 2011 census and have reported 36 Covid-19 cases as of Tuesday.An official, who did not wish to be named, said that state and region-wise reports were being collected to tackle all logistical issues amid the lockdown, which was on Tuesday extended until May 3. A second official called the status report from the northeast important since communication between other parts of India and the region were minimal due to the lockdown. “But in the integrated approach to tackle the pandemic, we cannot afford to overlook the problems of the region,” the official added on condition of anonymity.Assam, which has reported 30 Covid-19 cases and 1 death, has requested expeditious medical supplies and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s approval for setting up Covid-19 testing labs at Tezpur and Dibrugarh medical colleges, according to the report. The state has said there was no testing facility for the region along the Brahmaputra’s northern banks covering a part of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, it added. The Assam government has argued that such a testing lab there can be very useful for Arunachal Pradesh too. Assam has five testing labs.An Assam official said testing for Covid-19 is now being carried out at the medical colleges in Dibrugarh, Guwahati, Tezpur, Silchar and Barpeta. “As for the PPEs, we are managing with our own funds and some private donors,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Sikkim, which has reported no cases, has requested the Centre to test at least 250 samples and to designate a testing lab for the state. The Sikkim government has highlighted it has been unable to send any samples for testing to West Bengal since April 12 as it was asked not to do so until April 14.The samples from Sikkim were being tested at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital but it has exhausted all its testing kits.The status report said the Arunachal Pradesh government has reported that due to road blockades and construction works, the Food Corporation of India and Food Supplies Department were facing problems in replenishing stocks in Upper Subansiri, Tawang, Dibang Valley and Upper Siang districts. These districts are some of India’s remotest with limited communication links.An official from Arunachal Pradesh health department said they have asked for PPEs, too. “We have enough masks, but we will need more than 15,000 PPE suits to last us the next few months,” said the official.The remaining states, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram, have not reported any shortage of supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/status-report-highlights-logistical-issues-faced-by-n-e-region-related-to-covid-19/story-SiwFnNPtaysJ5txblgkHrI.html
15-04-2020||India||Centre to launch supply helpline amid worries during key farm season||The Centre is set to launch a 24x7 countrywide call centre on Wednesday to manage intersectoral movement of goods, from farming and agro-processing products to household necessities, to remove supply bottlenecks during the extended coronavirus lockdown, by far a key challenge, an agriculture ministry official said.Restoring supply chains emanating from the agriculture sector is urgent as farmers are poised to wind up winter harvests during April-May and prepare for summer sowing. The government has also activated 20 region-wise call centres for the organised sector and informal sector workers requiring help with permits, accessible through phone numbers, WhatsApp and emails, the official named above said, requesting anonymity. These control rooms are being managed by labour enforcement officers and assistant labour commissioners,.The farm sector isn’t just a supplier of food, it serves as a provider of primary and intermediate raw materials for a wide range of industrial goods, from textiles to pharmaceuticals. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced that the current lockdown will be extended until May 3. Movement of primary articles, such as foodgrains and vegetables, as well as other essential goods have continued to stumble. The Union government is still grappling with lack of compliance with its advisories in a country where ground-level decisions are taken by local administrators. In a letter to all states, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on April 12 reiterated federal guidelines on freeing restrictions in the agriculture and transport sectors, which are not being implemented in “letter and spirit.” Trucks carrying essential and non-essential goods “are being detained”, workers are “not getting authorizations” and operations of “cold storages and warehouses are not being allowed”, Bhalla’s letter stated.“The home ministry’s orders have not percolated to the ground level even though operators want their vehicles to move. Trucks are still being stopped at various state borders,” Kultaran Singh Atwal, president of the lobby group All-India Motor Transport Congress said.And without access to warehouses and cold chains, farm goods can rot. Farmers are already dumping produce for want of buyers. “The lockdown and limited movement of goods because of absence of labour, trucks and activity in wholesale markets have led to a sharp decline in supplies of commodities such as foodgrains, horticulture and sugar,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings.The Centre hopes to smoothen bottlenecks through realtime updates in its call centre, an official said, requesting anonymity. Truck drivers, traders, retailers, transporters or any other stakeholders who are facing problems in inter-state movement of essential commodities can seek help by calling at the call centre and executives will forward the vehicle ,consignment and help-needed details to state officials for resolution, the official said.The troubleshooting hub, to be anchored in the farm ministry, will be called the all-India agri-transport call centre. It will help to coordinate supplies between states for inter-state movement of perishables, inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilizer. The call centre number, 18001804200 and 14488 (not yet functional), can be accessed from any mobile or landline. As the country heads into the summer-sown kharif farm season, the Centre will provide subsidized seeds to states under the National Food Security Mission, the official said. The subsidy under the scheme shall be for varieties less than 10 years, which means farmers can access higher-yielding varieties cheaply. Retail inflation eased to a four-month low of 5.91% in March, according to official data released on Monday. However, food prices have gone up sharply in April, Sabnavis said. There appear to be three main supply-side constraints that have driven up food prices not yet captured officially. One, arrivals (of farm commodities) in agricultural markets have plunged sharply. Two, land transportation costs have risen sharply and, three, restrictions and quarantine measures have resulted in crippling labour shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-launch-supply-helpline-amid-worries-during-key-farm-season/story-mcKgiMbBzXMFwlcmnbdtqO.html
15-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Quarantined man’s father attacks Hyderabad doctors after inmate tests positive||A man whose son has been quarantined on suspicion of having Covid-19 symptoms assaulted a junior resident doctor at state-run Osmania General Hospital (OGH) in Hyderabad on Tuesday, the hospital said.The assault once again raised questions about the security of medical professionals battling the coronavirus pandemic.People with symptoms of Covid-19 are currently being kept at OGH and if any of them test positive for the virus, they are shifted immediately to Gandhi Hospital, the designated facility for treatment of the positive cases.On Tuesday, two of those quarantined at OGH tested positive for Covid-19 and they were taken to Gandhi Hospital immediately. Follow coronavirus latest updates here.On coming to know about it, the father of a young man who has been under quarantine in the adjacent bed of one of the patients who tested positive, became furious. He rushed to the hospital and started abusing the doctors ask why his son was kept close to a Covid-19 patient.He demanded that his son be discharged from the hospital and sent home as it was risky for him to be there in the ward.“We tried to convince him and tell him that the ward comprises only quarantined persons and as soon as anyone of them tested positive, he would be shifted to Gandhi Hospital. But he did not listen and assaulted me,” Dr Nikhil, one of the junior doctors attending on the quarantined people, told reporters.The junior doctors complained that more than one attendant was entering the isolation wards despite restrictions and behaving aggressively with doctors and nurses. They appealed to the government to provide sufficient protection to doctors and paramedics.Following a complaint from OGH superintendent Dr B Nagender, the police reached the hospital and pacified the father, who later apologised to the doctors for his aggressive behaviour.Health minister Eatala Rajender condemned the incident and asked the hospital authorities to ensure that such incidents do not recur. He assured of adequate police protection to the doctors at the hospital.Last week, the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) in a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah demanded that assaults on doctors be treated as non-bailable offences and that the Centre brings in a law for the medical fraternity amid rising incident s of violence at a time when they are in the frontline of the fight against Covid-19.On April 1, a Covid-19 positive patient at Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad attacked doctors after his brother was declared dead due to coronavirus. Telangana Junior Doctors’ Association had protested against the incident and threatened to boycott their duties if such attacks continue. They demanded that the government deploy Central Reserve Police Force on each floor of the hospital.Following their protests, the Hyderabad police booked a case against the assaulters under various sections of the IPC. A team of special police guards was deployed at the hospital later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-quarantined-man-s-father-attacks-hyderabad-doctors-after-inmate-tests-positive/story-4f3Wx4kSFmkE7NgAOwVUoM.html
15-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Railways set to cancel 39 lakh tickets due to lockdown extension||Railways is set to cancel around 39 lakh tickets booked for travel between April 15 and May 3 due to extension of the nationwide lockdown and suspension of passenger trains till then in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, sources told PTI.With the national transporter allowing tickets to be booked during the 21-day lockdown for journeys after April 14, around 39 lakh bookings were made by passengers hoping that trains will be in operation post-lockdown.However, with the announcement of the extension of the lockdown period, the railways on Tuesday not only cancelled all its passenger services till May 3 but also stopped all advance bookings.Even as the announcement stalled over 15,000 passenger trains of the railways, thousands of migrant workers converged near the Bandra railway station in Mumbai hoping to catch trains back to their home states. While they were dispersed later, questions were raised as to why railways kept bookings open despite the uncertainty over the extension of the lockdown period. Railways, however, said all passengers will get full refund for tickets booked for the cancelled trains as well as for those booked in advance.Railways has also said full refunds would be automatically provided by the national transporter for its online customers, while those who have booked at the counters can take the refunds up to July 31. Customers will also get full refund of their tickets if they are cancelling their advance bookings of tickets for trains that are not yet cancelled, it said.It also said that no advance reservation of train tickets, including e-tickets will be allowed till further orders though the facility of online cancellation will remain functional. “As far as trains cancelled up to May 3 is concerned, the refunds would be made automatically by the railways online to the customers while those who have booked at the counters, refund can be taken up to 31st July. Full refund will be given for tickets for the bookings made for the trains cancelled. “Full refund will also be there for those cancelling the advance bookings of tickets for trains not yet cancelled,” Railways said. Before the pandemic, on an average, around 8.5 lakh tickets were booked daily on the IRCTC website.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced that the lockdown across the country will be extended till May 3 to fight the coronavirus pandemic, saying the measure has produced a significant outcome in containing the infection. After Modi’s March 22 announcement of a 21-day lockdown across the country, the railways on March 24 had announced that its suspension of all passenger services will continue till April 14 in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.Around 15,523 trains run by the railways have been affected including 9,000 passenger trains and 3,000 mail express services which are run daily under normal circumstances. The death toll in the country due to novel coronavirus rose to 353 with 29 fatalities reported since Monday evening, while the number of cases saw a record jump of 1,463 to go up to 10,815 cases on Tuesday, according to the Union Health Ministry.The number of active COVID-19 cases in the country stands at 9,272, As many as 1,189 people have been cured and discharged, and one has migrated to another country, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-railways-set-to-cancel-39-lakh-tickets-due-to-lockdown-extension/story-8MP31g6j1xdlF0qVTagq8K.html
15-04-2020||India||Covid-19 cases rising exponentially, it’s critical to test more: ICMR||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said that it is critical to increase testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the number of cases in India is “rising exponentially”, a development that comes even as the government awaits the arrival of rapid testing kits from China.The rapid testing kits, which search for antibodies in blood samples, were first supposed to arrive on April 5. The expected date of delivery was later revised to April 10, and then to April 15. There was, however, no clarity if all kits ordered by India would arrive by Wednesday.Rapid testing kits show if a person is or has previously been infected by the virus. Apart from being a fast way to identify the extent of infections in clusters, countries around the world are looking to use these tests to determine who has immunity to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. Unlike the RT-PCR tests currently in use, which take at least five hours for a result, RTKs can give diagnoses in 25-30 minutes.“Number of Covid-19 cases in India is rising exponentially… it is critical to increase the numbers of tests conducted by laboratories,” said an ICMR document released on Monday, based on a study the premier medical research institution recently commissioned to check the feasibility of conducting pool testing in the country that can cover large sample sizes with limited resources.Public health experts have raised concerns over the disease possibly entering the “community transmission” phase, when the infections spread indiscriminately and the origin of an individual’s disease can’t be traced. The government has, however, maintained that the country is not yet in the phase of community spread, and there is some “limited community transmission” in certain clusters.The ICMR document, however, suggests that the government is aware of the possibility of a surge in Covid-19 cases in India in the coming weeks and that preparations were being made for that likely scenario.The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined four transmission scenarios for Covid-19 — no confirmed cases, sporadic cases, clusters of cases, and community transmission. Community transmission refers to a larger, uncontrolled outbreak of local transmission.The number of Covid-19 cases in the country stood at 11,479 on Tuesday night, doubling over six days, with 1,035 fresh infections in the last 24 hours. At least 390 people have died of the disease in the country so far, with the global death toll crossing 120,000.A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Exponential growth is worrying when numbers double in three days or less, as is happening in several countries. If we manage to keep the numbers from doubling in five or more days, as the lockdown has and will help us do, we will be on a good wicket.”Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Union health ministry, said in his daily health briefing on Monday: “There is no community transmission in India yet. There is nothing to hide if there was; in fact, it makes more sense to declare it so that people take extra precautions to prevent getting infected.”Experts in virology say that an outright denial of community transmission doesn’t make sense.“This seems like a schizophrenic approach to the truth where you speak only what is pleasing to the listener, and don’t say what you really believe in. Of course, people are not transmitting, perhaps aliens are,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. India ordered 500,000 kits from Chinese suppliers on March 30 and later raised a tender for 4.5 million more to be acquired in batches. In anticipation of the arrival of the kits first on April 5, India issued an advisory on starting rapid antibody testing on April 4, and revised the testing guidelines on April 9 to include rapid testing of all symptomatic individuals in hot spot areas with symptoms at least a week old.The King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, on Monday began testing of samples in pools from low-risk areas in the state as a surveillance mechanism. “The samples that we are getting to pool are all those lifted for the purpose of surveillance. It is not for diagnosing the disease as pooling samples for diagnoses is not advisable,” said Dr Amita Jain, head of ICMR’s virus research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) based in KGMU.Due to shortage of kits, the Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar has already begun performing tests in pools.ICMR, however, says there is no shortage of kits, and current stock can perform tests for at least six weeks. “We have received a supply of RT-PCR kits (on Monday), and an order for 3.3 million more RT-PCR kits has been placed that will also arrive soon. Additionally, there is a consignment of 3.7 million rapid testing kits that is expected any time now,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, ICMR’s chief of epidemiology and communicable disease, at a news briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-rising-exponentially-it-s-critical-to-test-more-icmr/story-o7fxdysyT50u73tSuyf6QK.html
15-04-2020||Editorials||The dilemma with migrants||On Tuesday afternoon, just hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of the lockdown for another 19 days, hundreds — some reports indicate thousands — of migrant workers made their way to Mumbai’s Bandra (West) station. They had been waiting for the lockdown to end — and had assumed that they could return home. Some reports say this assumption was based on an erroneous news report about special trains. With restrictions in place, including on inter-state bus and rail travel, this was not to happen. The same day, in Surat, hundreds of textile workers staged a sit-in, demanding that they be allowed to return home. This yearning is not new. Soon after Mr Modi declared the lockdown on March 24, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers began making their way home, some walking long distances to do so. These large congregations of workers — at close proximity with each other — are disturbing. They represent a sense of desperation, which is emerging from economic suffering and emotional anxiety. They also undermine the principle of social distancing, for one infected person in any of these gatherings has the potential of infecting hundreds, who may then come in contact with hundreds of others. It requires one incident to begin another chain of transmission, which can set back India’s efforts in the battle against the pandemic. And that is why a two-pronged approach is necessary to allay the anxieties of migrant workers. The first is recognising that they are economically insecure, without incomes, and often, without food. As Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac pointed out, without income support, compliance with the restrictions will be low. The government needs to immediately expand its cash transfer measure — and include workers in the unorganised sector, perhaps even incentivising those who stay in camps for migrant workers, at least till May 3. The partial lifting of restrictions in areas less vulnerable to the infection after April 20, as notified by the home ministry, will help a segment of workers. But they need more direct financial and food support. There is a second element. Many workers are anxious to return home because they are frightened — of the disease, of staying alone in the city, of the fate of their families back home. Travel will mean a high degree of risk because social distancing norms cannot be enforced in trains and buses. Travel is also difficult because their home states are not receptive to these workers, given the fear that they may spread the infection in villages. These are all real constraints, but the issue requires more sensitive communication — and the announcement of measures which allay their anxieties and encourages migrant workers to stay where they are.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-dilemma-with-migrants/story-2MKuKmHnYGYkdx7kk1zg1O.html
15-04-2020||Editorials||The gradual economic opening||On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that states, districts and subregions, which fare relatively well in the battle against the coronavirus disease, will see a partial relaxation of restrictions from April 20. On Wednesday, the Centre issued a list of activities which will be permitted, and which will continue to be prohibited. The broad approach of the government is three-fold. The first focuses on rural incomes and food security. That explains the easing of restrictions in agriculture, animal husbandry, livestock farming and fisheries. Construction and infrastructure in rural areas and work under the employment guarantee scheme will also be allowed. The second focus is on supply chains, which is why it has been reiterated that transport of all goods and e-commerce operations are permitted. And finally, there is — but only a slight — openness to industrial activities, in special economic zones and select manufacturing plants. There are three challenges. One, the extent of where these activities will be allowed will be known on April 20. Two, these activities are not sufficient to restore the economic engine — but given the constraints, they are a good first step. And finally, it will be hard to implement them if local authorities don’t have a proper understanding of permitted activities. Sensitise them. This experiment of gradually opening up the economy is critical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-gradual-economic-opening/story-yyGqSclWx4AObIs6ZuJrHJ.html
