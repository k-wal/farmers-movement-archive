06-04-2020||News||Covid-19: Economic opportunities and challenges | Opinion||When pandemics spread, they bring on an economic contagion, beyond the morbidity and mortality of the disease itself. Economic activity has been curtailed to enforce social distancing — an indispensable bullet in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) war. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the virus is pushing the world economy into a recession worse than that after the 2008 financial crisis. Moody’s downgraded India’s GDP growth rate forecast for 2020 from 5.5% to 2.5%. A United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report titled The Covid-19 Shock to Developing Countries pleaded “governments to do whatever it takes” to stop economic contraction becoming a recession or worse, a prolonged depression, and to protect the poorest.United Nations secretary-general António Guterres called for a large-scale, coordinated, comprehensive and multilateral response based on solidarity and shared responsibility. His proposals for a “double-digit-percentage” of global GDP investment, massively increasing resources to developing countries by augmenting IMF capacity including through Special Drawing Rights’ issuance and of MFIs like the World Bank are critical.The G20, representing world’s most powerful economies, expressed its resolve to defeat Covid-19, but so far, concerted global action and cooperation, and enhanced liquidity and funding has not materialised. Significant national relief and stimulus packages announced by the United States, Europe, China and India are expected to help staunch the economic haemorrhage and finance the coronavirus war. Developing countries, including India, face several economic challenges. These include volatility and precipitous fall in financial markets and commodity prices, and financing gap due to shrinking fiscal revenues and Covid-19 expenditure. Liquidity crunch, disruptions in international trade, and transport, depletion of foreign exchange reserves, devaluation of their currencies, fall in export revenues due to export controls and contraction in global markets and economic engines also causes for concern.They also face the prospects of a global food, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies crisis as producing countries impose export control and stockpiling. India could face a remittances crisis due to coronavirus-related redundancies in major labour export markets. The economic impact on India needs to be assessed by what some Harvard economists call the “shape of the shock” and it’s “structural legacy”. These will depend on the nature and extent of the disease burden, resources deployed/diverted for treatment/care/ vaccine, the trajectory of the pandemic, the collateral damage to sectors, state of the pre-crisis economy, policy responses and special measures taken.Resilience and rebound will depend on the duration of the lockdown, the stage at which the lockdown was imposed— in India’s case it was early enough — and social distancing compliance by citizens. Reducing uncertainties around health security driven economic decision-making will help and slightly longer lockdowns seem better than stop-go options.India has to ensure that in this interregnum, a banking/credit crisis does not occur, liquidity at household and corporate level is maintained, there is minimal disruption in capital formation and investments. Labour displacement is to be minimised and migrant labour encouraged to stay in place or return after the lockdown including though repurposing for the corona war.Skill atrophy should be prevented, output and supply maintained through targeted support to strategic sectors, SMEs, SHGs. Providing social protection to poor and vulnerable farmers and workers is critical. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic relief and stimulus package seek to achieve these objectives and will continue to evolve. If the lockout lasts for months, there is risk of a prolonged freeze in the real economy and recessionary prospect. We have to keep essential sectors firewalled through protective measures/PPE gear and affordable, rapid status tests and protocol until we open all sectors.Walden Bello, the author of Deglobalization: Ideas for a New World Economy notes that Covid-19 dealt a second big blow to globalisation and connectivity. With China, its flag bearer,becoming the epicentre of the crisis and economic contagion, there is rethink on the global risks of over reliance on this “undisputed workshop of the world”, the largest trader and exporter. Countries everywhere are considering diversification strategies away from China and rooting for autarky in strategic areas.Global investor reassessment about putting all their eggs in the China basket, presents an unmissable opportunity to attract them to India. Although no one should underestimate China’s enduring comparative advantage and resilience we should leverage India’s large market, human resources and diversified production base to become a manufacturing, services, research and development, and technology hub. Pharmaceuticals, biotech, medical supplies and equipment and related infrastructure for health sector capacity, supply and value chain is a vital multisectoral cluster to create with all stakeholders — private and public. Consumer durables, construction materials, electronics, engineering goods, IT, speciality textiles and garments, AI and robotics are other promising areas. Article XX of GATT / WTO permits countries “to take any actions it considers necessary to protect it’s national security interests”. We can use trade restrictions, TRIPs, TRIMs exemptions to support domestic value and supply chains to protect our health, food and economic security. A “new India” industrial and trade policy is needed to incentivise our entrepreneurs to be makers, not just traders. They must build a Make in India hub to meet domestic and global Covid-19 related demand and subsequent rebound and revenge consumption. The adversity bought on by the virus can become a transformative economic opportunity to “Build Back Better”.

06-04-2020||News||Covid-19: Draw lessons for the future, writes M Venkaiah Naidu||An invisible threat has exposed the frailty of human beings, by cutting across boundaries and claiming lives over the past four months. Ever since a 55-year-old in Hubei province in China first contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on November 17, 2019, as reported by the South Morning China Post, the world has been struggling to come to terms with it. It is still uncertain when the virus can be vanquished. Are we drawing the right lessons from the ongoing battle?Such invisible threats are not new. About 5,000 years ago, an epidemic wiped out a prehistoric village in China, leaving no place even for burials. This archaeological site, Hamin Mangha, is among the best-preserved prehistoric in northeast China, serving as a monument to such recurring threats to humanity. The Plague of Athens in 430 BC, the Plague of Justinian during 541-542 AD that marked the decline of the Byzantine empire, the Black Death, also known as the Bubonic plague of 1346-53, the Cocoliztli epidemic of 1545-1548 that claimed over 15 million lives in Mexico and Central America, the American plague of the 16th century that wiped out about 90% of the indigenous people in the Western hemisphere, the Spanish flu during 1918-1920 that took over 10 million lives, the Asian flu of 1957-58, resulting in one million deaths and the more recent epidemics of AIDS, H1N1, swine flu, Ebola, SARS, Zika, among others, are examples of the regularity of these threats. Every such threat has been overcome; this time will be no different. But the moot question is: Are we better prepared to deal with it the next time around?Urbanisation and the growing interconnectedness of the global order, through trade, human migration and increasing population densities, are facilitating the quick spread of deadly invisible organisms, leading to pandemics such as Covid-19. This requires the formulation of standard global protocols to be administered quickly by all the nations. It calls for honest and effective information-sharing among nations so that no time is lost in putting countermeasures in place. This is particularly significant in the context of issues being raised about the delay by some nations in restricting the movement of their people.Restrictions on the movement of people and economic activities, no doubt, have implications for those living on the margins. But it is the poor who will be the worst-hit if such restrictions are not strictly observed. Remedies vary from one context to the other, based on the gravity of the situation. Issues such as GDP can be dealt with once we overcome the challenge to people’s health.As we complete two weeks of the nationwide lockdown in force since March 25, let us look at our efforts to fight the virus. The lockdown has been an unprecedented decision in view of the scale and magnitude of its implications on the ground. The leadership rose to the occasion, given the gravity of the situation and limited options. Our federal spirit has seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi and all chief ministers on the same page in this hour of crisis. The political unanimity is heartening. This is a positive takeaway from the crisis. With 1.3 billion people, India’s success in fighting the virus is critical to the success of the global fight. We have acquitted ourselves creditably so far. The scale of the spread of the virus and the rate of mortality have been kept low until now, preventing community spread of the virus. But the Tablighi Jamaat episode shows that there is no room for complacency. This episode should only be seen as an eye-opener to others and not beyond.With social security networks in place, the rapid response of the central and state governments along with other initiatives has reduced the suffering of those living on the margins. People have understood the gravity of the situation and cooperated with the government, thanks to successful communication efforts. This unity of purpose and action needs to be sustained until the battle is won.The pandemic has tested the capacities of the world’s mighty nations, which are still struggling to come to terms with the challenge. This raises the issues of deficiencies in institutions, infrastructure, individuals and international cooperation. These must be rectified before the next challenge. The future emergence and behaviour of such invisible organisms cannot always be anticipated, but we can put in place systems to minimise the damage. This means that the right lessons must be drawn from the current challenge for effective local and global action.Doctors, paramedics, sanitation workers, the police, the media and governments are doing their best in this hour of crisis. Most important, people are cooperating in this collective effort. Let us stay focused. I am certain that Covid-19 will be overcome. But we need to be better prepared for the next challenge by drawing the right lessons from the current one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-draw-lessons-for-the-future-writes-m-venkaiah-naidu/story-uFXQRADE8qQEwDtKo1ukEP.html
06-04-2020||News||Not in God’s hands: Why Tabligh Jamaat’s actions are indefensible | Opinion||‘Jahiliat’ is the only suitable word to explain the indefensible actions of Tabligh Jamaat leaders and their followers, who became one of the main vehicles of the spread of Covid-19 cases across India. Ignorance is a much milder term for this South Asian organisation that has spread its tentacles in several countries across the globe. It is not only in India, but also in Pakistan that the organisation drew flak from its authorities after about 2.5 lakh Tablighis gathered at their headquarter at Raiwind near Lahore on March 11. The ijtema was finally called off the next day, packing off everyone back, but not without the expected fallout in terms of spread of the disease.Bangladesh is also facing similar issues from this organisation, but fortunately for it the ijtema there was held in January this year. Tabligh holds the second largest gathering of Muslims after Hajj at Tongi in Bangladesh every year. But at the centre of Islam, Saudi Arabia, it remains banned, as the rulers there would find it inconvenient to deal and control its Ulemas, who are based in South Asia. Saudi Muftis allege it to be connected with Sufism and ask faithful to remain loyal to their form of puritan Islam by adhering to Ahle Hadis school, which they can easily handle by issuing fatwas as desired by ruling family.The Tabligh movement, an offshoot of Deobandi school of Islam, was formed in 1927 in Mewat, Haryana, that called for Islamic answers to the challenges to the personal and collective life of Muslims under British imperialism. It rejected both the theories of either emulating western ideas or assimilating Islamic and western concepts, which several Muslim scholars, including Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, were propagating. The Tabligh founders then believed that their religion was under threat of western ideas and values on the one hand and Hindu revivalist movements like Arya Samaj on the other.Unlike Hizb-ut-Tehrir and Muslim Brotherhood, Tabligh remains an apolitical and non-sectarian organisation thereby escaping suppression by wary autocratic rulers in Muslim world. Tabligh largely remains a proselytising organisation inviting (Dawah) people to Islam and also preaching the “true and puritan” form of the religion among the faithful. Its followers proceed for proselytisation and fan out in various mosques and Muslim localities. In India, it did not attract the attention of security agencies, as it did not play into the hands of Pakistan’s security apparatus for sponsoring ‘jehad’ against India or supporting its narrative on the situation of Muslims in India. Also Read: Markaz leadership resisted, then NSA Ajit Doval dropped by at 2 amBut that should not be the reason to allow such organisations to continue preaching obscurantist thoughts among people irrespective of the religion to which they belong. In the time of Covid-19 pandemic, a population lacking scientific temper can create an unprecedented crisis for the authorities and put under strain the health infrastructure of any country. More so, that of a developing country like India. The facts remain that Gods of all religions are shutting their doors to the faithful. The Vatican has issued a decree calling upon priests across the world to observe Easter (April 12) observation without gatherings. It says “in the countries which have been struck by the disease and where restrictions around the assembly and movement of people have been imposed, Bishops and priests may celebrate the rites of holy week without the presence of people and in a suitable place…” Hajj, the largest gathering of Muslims at Saudi Arabia could be in peril, as the authorities there have asked faithful to delay plans to visit Mecca in late July. It is a rare occurrence with the last one being more than 200 years back. Mecca and Medina, the two cities pilgrims visit, have been closed down a month back with Saudis closing their borders for foreigners and restricting movements within the Kingdom. The story is no different for Hindu shrines. Among the shrines that attract large crowds that have been shut are Vaishno Devi Shrine in Jammu, Tirupati Temple, Lord Jagannath temple in Puri, Kamakhya temple in Guwahati and Shirdi Sai Baba temple in Maharashtra. So, there is no point looking towards heaven for some miracle to happen. If it happens, it will be in laboratories across the world where scientists are burning midnight oil to save the lives of people, irrespective of the religions to which they belong. Like Tabligh, anyone preaching that everything is in God’s hands would be doing a disservice to their own community and humanity at large at this critical juncture. These thoughts can play havoc within their communities and those living in surrounding areas. A supportive population understanding the pitfalls of violating restrictions would be an asset to any government to deal with this unprecedented pandemic. A regular briefing by those in the frontline of fighting the disease is a better way of keeping people abreast of latest developments and keeping them well informed for better compliance. This will restrict the space for preachers of all religions to mislead the people.(Avinash Mohananey handled Jammu and Kashmir and Operations desks in the Intelligence Bureau.

06-04-2020||News||Covid-19: To get an accurate estimate of the spread, India must ensure random community testing||In the fight against the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), policymakers are fighting blind, because we do not know the extent of the infections in the population or the mortality rate due to it. It is possible to track the number of deaths, the cases that required hospitalisation and those who have tested positive for the virus at hospitals, but those numbers present a limited picture of the pandemic. Our response to this crisis depends critically on figuring out how fast the disease is spreading outside of hospitals, in the community, and how likely the virus is to kill individuals who have been infected. The only way to obtain this information is through random testing in the population.Existing methods of measuring the disease’s prevalence are likely to give inaccurate results. India, like most countries, has a shortage of testing kits. As a result, it prioritises the testing of the individuals who have severe symptoms and show up at the hospital. It misses those who have symptoms, but not severe enough to go to the hospital, and those who are asymptomatic — lack of cough, fever or trouble in breathing — but, nonetheless, are carriers who can infect others. There are good reasons to think that many individuals are asymptomatic, which means that true caseload is under-measured. For example, the city of Vò (Italy) tested all its inhabitants, and found as many as 50% of individuals were asymptomatic. On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 18% of the infected population showed no symptoms, while in Iceland, 50% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic. A recently released report from Maharashtra suggests that 85% of cases in the state were asymptomatic, similar to the recent findings from China, published in The British Medical Journal. They suggest that we will never be able to measure the true prevalence of Covid-19 by testing only high-risk populations.We lack the essential information to fight this disease because of such data limitations. Harvard economist James Stock has identified the lack of accurate infection rates as the central information gap behind efforts to combat the coronavirus. Consider the true mortality rate due to Covid-19. This is calculated by taking the number of deaths from the virus and dividing by the total number of infections it has caused. For any level of deaths from Covid-19, the higher the infection rate, the lower is the death rate. The mortality rate is, in turn, essential to calibrate our response. If the mortality rate from the virus is very high, it calls for doubling down on suppression methods to avoid mass deaths. A lower mortality rate does not mean the situation is any less troubling—but it tells us that the disease is more prevalent in the population than currently thought, and it demands mitigation rather than suppression approach in response.While we have estimates on the number of deaths, we are flying blind in estimating the denominator of the fatality rate. If, in fact, many people are walking around with Covid-19 and perhaps do not even know of their infection status — as some doctors suggest — we need to adopt a very different approach to address this crisis. At the time of writing, India has 4,067 coronavirus cases and 109 deaths, implying a 2.7% mortality rate, without considering future mortality of the currently sick. If the fraction of asymptomatic cases was 20%, this would imply a true fatality rate of 2.1%. However, if it were more like 80%, the true fatality rate would be considerably lower at 0.5%. Where India is on this mortality spectrum will greatly influence how we think about and combat this disease – and that’s why estimating this number accurately is an urgent priority.Measuring infections accurately will also allow for targeted efforts to combat the spread of the disease. Otherwise, we will not know how many hospital beds, ventilators and doctors we will need in different areas in the coming weeks. We cannot determine whether the lockdown has been effective, how long it should continue, or if certain places can safely be released from the lockdown without sparking an outbreak.To its credit, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), at the very start of the pandemic, tested 826 patients who were admitted in hospitals with severe acute respiratory illness but no travel history. This was a valuable effort, showing that, at the early stages of the pandemic, the coronavirus had not yet spread through the community in India. The situation has since changed. There is now a wealth of evidence across countries, including in India itself, that Covid-19 can be found not just in those with severe symptoms, but also among individuals who display little or no symptoms.While ICMR has just expanded its testing criteria beyond symptomatic cases to include asymptomatic individuals with prior contacts with confirmed cases and antibody testing in hotspots, these efforts still fall short of true random testing across the entire country.The only way to determine the true mortality and infection rates is random testing in the community — identify individuals randomly from the population, rather than from in and around hospitals and hotspots, and test them in the field so we can determine the precise prevalence. Closing this information gap will be critical to making well-informed decisions on how best to combat this disease. Countries like Austria and Germany have begun random testing of the population. India must do so immediately, either nationally, or, if the capacity is a constraint, at least sub-nationally.Arpit Gupta is an assistant professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business.

06-04-2020||News||There’s light at the end of the tunnel||When I first heard Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Friday, carefully, I must confess to feeling a little disappointed. There was no condemnation of the fact that our brave “Covid-19 warriors” — doctors and other health care workers — were being assaulted; and there was no comforting statement about the efforts to overcome the lack of the personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies for the frontline workers. But, then, I heard the speech a second time, and then a third time. And I realised this was the most positive, encouraging and unifying speech by any leader to a nation. It had been nine days into lockdown when he spoke (it is 12 days now). Citizens have been battling uncertainty, fear, despair, and even depression. There is social fragmentation, the suffering of the poor, and even a growing religious blame game. In that backdrop, the PM’s address was purposeful — focused on uniting the nation, while maintaining social distancing and self- isolation. It was, importantly, about deploying combined “utsaah” (enthusiasm) as the biggest force in moving from the darkness of the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) into the light of victory. The PM’s address would have made the most accomplished psychologist proud and envious. As someone who has been deeply involved in the Indian health care system, do I see a “light “ at the end of the tunnel? Yes, and here is why. One, we have been the most proactive nation in the world against Covid-19. Numerous measures by the government — isolating the country; testing of travellers; quarantining, tracing and isolation of suspected cases; public education on hand-washing and social distancing; forced self-quarantine, and, finally, a national lockdown — were instituted even when there were very few cases in the country. This is a fact that has been appreciated and admired by World Health Organization. It has been responsible, to a great extent, for limiting the spread of the virus patients to a manageable number so far, even as Europe and the United States are dealing with hundreds of thousands of patients, overwhelming even their advanced health care systems. The responsibility now lies with the public, we cannot let the strategy down.Two, while sceptics may argue that the number of Covid-19 cases is low because we are not testing enough, and, therefore, we do not have an accurate figure, the comforting fact is that we, as doctors, know that the emergency areas of our hospitals are not getting flooded with patients with upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia and deaths. Frontline doctors are the first to sense, witness and face an epidemic, irrespective of testing. Maybe, the worst is still to come over the next two weeks — but maybe not? No one can be any wiser than the other. It is also remotely possible that public exposure in India to regular and repeated infections, and other viruses, may have developed a protective cross immunity to, at least, prevent serious Covid-19 infections. The encouraging fact is that 80% patients affected in Covid-19 just have minor flu-like illness and get better anyway.Three, more than a 100 companies around the world working aggressively on finding effective drugs for treatment as well as vaccines for prevention of the Covid-19 infection. New vaccines for prevention could take 12-18 months, but effective treatment for Covid-19 could be a reality in next four weeks. A promising anti-viral drug, Remdesivir, has been put into phase III trials. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a drug well known to India for the last 60 years for the treatment of malaria, is showing promise for the treatment and prevention of Covid-19 infections. The Indian Council of Medical Research as well as other scientific bodies globally are engaged in prospective trials on this. In the next two to four weeks, we will have the results to define the role of this inexpensive and readily-available treatment for our population. Serum containing antibodies against the coronavirus from patients who have recovered from Covid-19 infection is in trial to treat serious coronavirus infections. Breakthroughs are around the corner. Four, there are two preliminary reports, which emerged last week, providing indirect evidence that the BCG vaccine — given for the prevention of tuberculosis — may provide protection against Covid-19. Based on these observations, prospective trials have started in the US and Europe to define the role of the BCG vaccine for prevention of Covid-19 infection. Thankfully, India, unlike other western nations, has had a mandatory BCG vaccination policy at birth, for all its population. We hope that this may also in some way protect us from serious Covid-19 infections and death.The PM called on the 1.3 billion people in this country to focus and meditate together, as witnessed in the coming together of the nation on Sunday night. It is easy to mock this. But after 30 years of being in the frontline of the medical profession, and pioneering treatments of heart disease, every day, I pray to God to help me save my patients. I prayed to God to save my mother’s life when after six weeks of treating her on a ventilator, the best doctors and best of technology failed. Thirteen years ago, I organised a scientific symposium on “Do prayers heal and Cure?” And every day, I witness a person demolished by an unfortunate “act of fate” — an accident or an illness that suddenly incapacitated them. Humility helps. And it helps to combine science with spirituality, to provide us with positivity, with hope, with determination if we are to overcome the ravages of the Covid -19 disease. While there is hope, there is no role for complacency. We need to take all precautions, follow all advisories and be vigilant. We need to appreciate and respect all the efforts being put in by the frontline Covid-19 warriors who are putting their lives at risk to protect us. Though physically separated, we need to be united in spirit and mind. There is light at the end of the tunnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-s-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/story-iQyiUvi4KnrCBJWK8zX4KM.html
06-04-2020||Mumbai||Wockhardt Hospital sealed off after 52 staffers test positive||Wockhardt Hospital in Agripada was declared a containment zone y the civic body, the first private hospital in the state to be marked so, on Sunday, after 52 employees, including doctors, nurses and ward boy, were diagnosed with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). According to the ministry of health, a Covid-19 containment zone refers to the area where cases of coronavirus are found. Containment zones are created to map the local transmission of the disease and prevent the contagion from spreading.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is investigating the matter and if any doctor is found negligent, the report will be submitted to Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) for further action. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), BMC, said they have sealed the hospital and none of the staffers will be allowed to go out until they test negative of coronavirus. “It is the fault of the hospital administration that they didn’t take precautionary measures, due to which nearly 300 staffers have been quarantined.” “We have also set up a team to probe how the virus spread among so many people in a hospital setting,” he added.“Our colleague nurses and the doctors identified as Covid-19 positive are presently being treated. We have tested all those within the hospital and are treating the positive patients, quarantining the primary contacts of the infected and terminally cleaning the facility to contain the contagion,” read a statement by the hospital. “The hospital staff were unknowingly exposed to the infection in the time period. We are informing the healthcare sector at large not to be misled by asymptomatic patients,” it read further.Authorities, after holding a meeting with the hospital administration and nurses association, have decided to shift high and mild-risk patients to SevenHills and Kasturba Hospital respectively, while the low-risk ones will be kept in quarantine centres or at the hospital itself.“Soon, Covid-19 patients will be shifted to isolation facilities under civic and private-run hospitals. We are categorising patients, depending on their health conditions,” said health officials.The BMC has contacted the MMC, seeking guidance in the alleged matter of medical negligence. But as hospitals don’t come under the purview of MMC, the council can’t take direct action against the hospital. “So, we will have to wait until BMC completes their investigation. If they find any individual doctor in violation of rules, it will be referred to us. The doctor will be asked to provide an explanation, following which, action will be decided,” said Dr Shivkumar Utture, president of MMC.More than 200 nurses from Kerala are working at Wockhardt Hospital, of which, more than 150 nurses in the hospital are kept under observation.As HT had reported earlier, the infected nurses alleged that owing to the negligence of the hospital, the infection spread across to other staffers. “We have contracted the infection after we were exposed to suspected coronavirus patients who were undergoing treatment in a general ward at the hospital,” said a nurse from the hospital who has been found positive. The relatives of the patients also claimed that the infected nurses shared the same canteen, hostels and bathrooms with uninfected medical staffers. “We were asked to attend to Covid-19 patients without protective kits. Despite raising the issue, the management didn’t pay heed to us,” said a nurse from the hospital. The hospital, rather than quarantining the nurses, was forcing them to work, which further spread the virus to other staff. While recollecting the alleged harassment, one nurse said when BMC came for inspection on April 1, few of the nurses informed them about their symptoms, after which the senior officers from the hospital reprimanded them.MA Sayyed, acting chairman of Maharashtra State Human Right Commissio,n said that it also counts as a violation of human rights. “The hospital may be the employer of the nurses, but not providing basic amenities of medicos counts as violation of human rights. This is also a violation of rights preserved under the Indian constitution. As it is a private hospital, we can’t take action, but we request the corporation to punish the violator,” he said. Meanwhile, members of Jan Swastha Abhiyan (JSA) have written to the BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi seeking an appropriate action against the hospital for not providing adequate safety to medicos on duty. “We have demanded to provide proper training to nurses in handling coronavirus patients. Along with that, all nurses should be provided with personal protective equipment in all hospitals,” said Inayat Singh, JSA.The hospital has identified the source of infection as a 70-year-old patient who was admitted to the hospital on March 17 for a cardiac emergency. The patient was asymptomatic (showed no symptoms of Covid-19). On March 26, the patient developed cough, and was tested for coronavirus, which turned out positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wockhardt-hospital-sealed-off-after-52-staffers-test-positive/story-M39fOFZJYN3JwPuqjcMQzL.html

Thanks to it, people from different sectors are able to work from home and be with their families.Most of the employees from the private sector have turned their homes into a virtual office. They confess that there is less stress in working from home. Moreover, they are also getting more time to spend with their families.Chief executive officer (CEO) of Cyber Frame Solutions, Anoop Gupta, said, “Me and all my employees are working from home everyday, except on Sunday. Our working hours start at 10am and I communicate with the employees through video calls, conference calls and e-mail.”Gupta, who is an information and technology expert, said that they develop websites and mobile applications, hence they receive many queries from clients on phone and e-mail.“As most of the businesses are closed due to the curfew, we have less workload as compared to normal days,” he added.Deepak Jathani, 36, who works in non-banking financial sector, said, “As I am working from home, my day begins just like any other normal day. I receive hundreds of e-mails from customers regarding their queries, which need to be addressed. I read the e-mails and mark them to my subordinates. Due to the lockdown, I’m receiving enquiries about relaxation in paying the equated monthly instalments (EMIs).”“Working from home is less stressful and there is less workload than usual days. I can devote more time to my family and I pass time by playing board games with my children,” he said.Aashna Taneja, 25, an assistant professor at a private college, said, “Though the college is closed due to the curfew, students need help as examinations are around the corner. I take their classes through a mobile application, where I teach a batch of 15 students for two hours. After a brief break, I teach the next group.”“For me, working from home is as stressful as any normal day. The only difference is that I don’t need to go to the college, but I have to prepare the lecture every day and resolve the queries of the students,” she said.“The positive side is that I get to spend more time with my parents and siblings,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/i-am-able-to-devote-more-time-to-my-family/story-2CLyYIrzJ0vYjqVHvOQFkM.html

The performance usually starts after 7pm and can last up to an hour.“A few days ago, I started singing on my karaoke machine in the evening. A few friends wanted to hear more, so I started doing it in the balcony with the speakers on,” Ashish Sarin, a resident and CEO of AlphaCorp development, says. Sarin adds that he does not want to perform every day as people might get bored with his singing but tries to perform with a gap of a few days. He uses the gap days to rehearse and is already working on a list of songs to sing next. He seems to have set an example of showcasing musical talents during the lockdown.“When I finished the first time, we heard a piano playing. We are yet to find out who it is but he or she played for close to 20 minutes. Then we also had a resident turn on his speakers and play some beautiful Sufi instrumental music,” Sarin says. He adds that while he sings, his family joins him in the balcony.The society, as a precautionary measure, has reduced its staff to 25% of its strength. This staff is responsible for housekeeping, cleaning, maintenance and horticulture. Close to 12 staff members have been living in the condominium since the lockdown started. Cooking facilities and ration have been provided for them to make their own meals. Sometimes, residents too volunteer to provide home-cooked meals to the staff.“The in-house staff does not include the security guards as they have been provided passes for travelling and they do not interact with the residents much,” says Deepak Jain, estate manager of the condominium. He adds that despite the skeleton staff, the society is still keeping up with its efforts of composting and sewage water treatment.While the entry of maids and other household help has been stopped, exceptions are made for senior citizens who need help at all times. The society has even come forward to help procure special travel passes for them from city authorities.“Most senior citizens have their domestic help stay with them around the clock. But for those who have to return home, we helped procure requisite passes from the police. This was done for senior residents who absolutely need them so that their help faces no hindrance to their movement across the city while travelling during the lockdown,” says Sunil Mathur, the general secretary of the Residents’ Welfare Association of the society.When news of migrant labourers in the city struggling to go home reached the residents, they came together to volunteer to cook for them. Food packets were prepared by the residents at their homes, collected by a few volunteers and distributed with the help of police.“Around 70-80 houses cooked the meals in varying capacities and packed them. The meal was roti and sabzi. A few volunteers collected the packets hygienically and distributed them among the labourers,” says Mehta. He adds that a few hundred packets were distributed by the residents.The residents have also created a fund to feed daily wagers in the city. The fund has been donated to a nearby temple where food is distributed.“We collected money and ration to feed daily wagers who are now struggling to find food because of the lockdown. The temple is cooking the food and serving it to them,” says Sonica Sood, a resident.The society, for the time being, has halted all doorstep deliveries. For their daily needs, residents can place their order at the grocery and vegetable shop located inside the society. Residents are expected to pick up food deliveries from the lobby of their towers. The management is also carrying out routine sanitation of commonly touched surfaces.To take care of the senior citizens residing in the condominium, the management of the society has decided to carry out routine checks to ensure that support and help are provided to them as and when required.“We call them to make sure if they are unable to step out, we can help them out. With a skeleton staff, it is not always possible to visit them in person but we do make sure we ask them if they need anything from time to time,” says Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/alphacorp-gurgaonone-music-binds-these-residents-together/story-KgEs22lumV15v7hoRII1gM.html
06-04-2020||Gurugram||Residents step up to help with maintenance work||As the provision of many services has been affected across the country amid the 21-day national lockdown, announced to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, resident welfare associations (RWAs) of some condominiums and residential sectors in the city have turned to their residents to get maintenance work done.For instance, at Sushant Lok in Phase 1, the local RWA reached out to the residents last week looking for volunteers who could take up electrical and plumbing work in the neighbourhood.Sudhir Sachdeva, member of the RWA said that the township had tied-up with a private agency for maintenance related work in the area, but after the 21-day national lockdown was announced, the services provided by the agency services came to a sudden halt.“Last week, through our society Whatsapp groups, we asked residents to volunteer to fix electrical and plumbing related problems in our area. Twenty residents, who they said have some degree of expertise in plumbing and electrical work volunteered for the task and have been visiting homes ever since,” Sachdeva said.Residents who have volunteered said that given the unusual circumstances those who can should step up. “This is an unprecedented situation for all of us. The only way to get through this phase is by looking out for each other and when the RWA asked for assistance from residents, I immediately volunteered. I have some basic knowledge with electrical circuits and have been fixing problems related to electrical work in the area,” Anant Malik, a Sushant Lok resident, said.While some of the RWAs have already appointed duties to the volunteer residents, others are in the process of setting up similar volunteer groups in case the lockdown is lifted for only a short duration and maintenance staff choose to return to their home towns when they can.In Princeton Estate, a condominium in DLF 5, the local RWA issued a circular on Monday, asking for volunteers to take up maintenance-related work such as security, housekeeping, horticulture, electrical, plumbing, and other such work. The circular stated that the RWA is trying to constitute an ‘emergency task force’ within a week, as a standby measure to take over maintenance duties in the near future if the Covid-19 outbreak is not contained and the existing staff chooses to return to their home towns.Arati Pandya, joint secretary, Princeton Estate Condominium Association said the condominium is currently operating with 50% staff. All the staff members have been provided with accommodation within the condominium. She said, however, there is a possibility that the condominium’s staff may leave for their respective home towns in case the outbreak is not contained.“While the chances of such situation arising are very less, we want to be fully prepared in case such a situation does arise. Thus, with a view to prepare ourselves better, a circular has been issued within the condominium asking for volunteers to come forward. Depending on the response, we will constitute a team,” Pandya said.In Sector 14, the RWA has also identified residents who have volunteered for carrying out electric and plumbing related work in their area.“With the help of residents, we have made arrangements for fixing plumbing and electrical related issues in our locality. The volunteers help out those families who need some quick and basic repairs. Recently, in one house, there was some issue with the sewerage and the volunteers looked into it,” Kalyan Singh Sharma, a member of the RWA, said.At Old DLF Colony, in Sector 14, residents themselves have come together to make a similar arrangement.“We have people in our society who know some plumbing or electrical work and they have come forward to help others. People are collaborating with each other and everyone is helping their neighbours,” Kulbhushan Bhardwaj, a resident, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-step-up-to-help-with-maintenance-work/story-4JXTnSixXl5KU631yT4FtL.html
06-04-2020||Gurugram||Six more test positive for Covid-19 in Nuh||The district administration of Nuh on Monday declared Umrao village in Nagina as a buffer zone — banning the entry and exit of people in the village to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said officials. Six more people tested positive for Covid-19 in the district on Monday, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 14, said officials. The police said 13 of them had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin in Delhi last month. The superintendent of police, Nuh, Narender Bijarniya, said that they have declared a three-kilometre area around the residence of a 50-year-old truck driver, who had recently returned from Gujarat and tested positive last week, as a buffer zone and locals have been asked to remain indoors and take care of their health. “The residents of this village will remain quarantined at home. They can only come out to buy essentials between 8am and 10am,” he said.The police said if more cases are reported from the village, they will declare it a ‘red zone’. “In the red zone, the entire village will be isolated and samples will be collected from each house. There will be no movement of any person and essentials will be provided by the district administration. However, in a buffer zone, people are allowed to move to get their essentials but not allowed to move out of the village,” said Bijarniya.Bijarniya added the area has become vulnerable with regard to the further transmission of Covid-19 and it was necessary to halt further transmission of the disease in the villages. “We are taking precautionary measures to ensure the virus does not spread; therefore we have declared one village as a buffer zone as only one local case was reported positive from here. We are discussing with the district administration and chief medical officer the next steps to declare a few villages as red zones. It has become imperative to take stringent precautionary measures like declaring some villages as containment zones and surrounding areas as buffer zones,” he said.The police said there would be no vehicular movement from these villages and people would stay within their homes to ensure complete lockdown.Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Nuh, confirmed that six people tested positive on Monday. “All of them had allegedly attended the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month. Two are from Sir Lanka, one each is from Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa, and Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.The samples for nearly 300 people had been collected by Monday, said officials.“We have admitted more than 300 people to Government Polytechnic college in Malab and Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati Government Medical College, Nalhar, Nuh. More than 400 people are home quarantined,” he said.Seven more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Faridabad on Monday, bringing the total count to 21. Nine more people, all of whom had attended the Nizamuddin Jamaat, tested positive in Palwal on Monday. The officials said the number of positive cases in Palwal has reached 25, the highest among any district in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-more-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-nuh/story-s1oxEgSxw1yJBO98EVFIxO.html
06-04-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Rapid antibody testing to start by the end of the week in Gurugram district||For early detection of Covid-19 cases, the Gurugram district health department is planning to start the rapid antibody blood test by the end of the week. Health officials on Monday said the rapid test would be conducted in a three kilometre radius of the containment zone from where a Covid-19 positive case has been reported. Officials said a team of health workers and doctors would test of all occupants in 50 houses, chosen randomly, in each of the four directions of the containment zone.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary of the health department, confirmed that the rapid antibody test would be conducted. However, he said the tests would be started only by the end of the week as the kits are yet to be procured. “The rapid blood test would help us find out whether the patient has had exposure to the virus. For the diagnosis, the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) would be continued. The guidelines for the rapid antibody test were issued recently by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The test will be done in the most affected districts such as Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal, and Nuh, as part of intensive screening to restrict the transmission of the coronavirus,” said Arora.The antibody blood test gives results in 15 minutes, which would speed up Covid-19 screening in the state as there has been a spike in the number of positive cases across districts in the last few days. As of now, there are 25 confirmed coronavirus disease cases in Palwal, followed by Faridabad at 21, Nuh at 14 and Gurugram at nine. According to officials, out of all the positive cases in Palwal, a majority are those who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month -- another nine of the total of 25 were identified on Monday as those who had attended the event. With this, the total of confirmed cases in Palwal who had attended the event comes to 24 out of 25 cases. Currently, there are 70 active Covid-19 cases in the state, with Palwal having the maximum cases at 25, followed by 13 in Faridabad, 14 in Nuh and nine in Gurugram. On April 4, the ICMR had issued a letter to states on starting rapid antibody-based blood tests for Sars-Cov-2 in clusters with containment zones and large migration gathering or evacuees. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said a containment strategy has been prepared under which the serological antibody blood test would be conducted. “After a case is reported positive in a particular area, 50 houses in each of the four directions within the three kilometre radius will be covered where rapid antibody blood tests would be done. For every 50 households, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and a medical officer would be appointed,” said Punia. In such a test, a blood sample is collected to check for antibodies developed by the body’s immune system to fight the virus. The presence of antibodies helps to detect the coronavirus infection in the body.“For all those whose reports come out positive in the antibody test, nasal/throat swabs will be taken up for the RT-PCR. Even if the antibody test is negative and the medical officer feels that there is a necessity to take a sample for PCR, then throat and nasal swabs would be taken, as per the protocol followed till now,” Punia said.Punia said for those who are asymptomatic but have contracted the coronavirus, their antibody test will be positive. “There is a possibility of a recent infection. For them, a quarantine period of 10 days will be suggested, after which the rapid antibody test will be done again. If positive and symptomatic, a PCR test will be conducted on the patient and they will be admitted to the hospital for treatment,” said Punia, mentioning that the process will prevent local transmission of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-rapid-antibody-testing-to-start-by-the-end-of-the-week-in-gurugram-district/story-Ww7f7qNI8jDXIi8jltnT4I.html

During a live Facebook interaction on Monday, Pawar said that timely action could have prevented the spurt of Covid-19 cases among people who participated in the gathering. “The Tablighi Jamaat should not have organised the congregation in the first place. In Maharashtra too, a request was made to hold a congregation but state home minister Anil Deshmukh and chief minster [Uddhav Thackeray] discussed it and denied them permission. If the same concern was shown in Delhi, we would not have to see it repeatedly on television,” the NCP chief said.“Is this an attempt to create a perception about a particular community and create a social divide? They wouldn’t have got that opportunity,” he added.The veteran leader said that bull and horse races were organised in a village in Solapur recently, and thousands gathered there. The police started booking people as soon as they came to know of it. “If the same alertness was shown in Delhi, we wouldn’t have to see what is going on today,” Pawar said.He stressed the country’s need to be united and refrain from causing animosity and social divide. “Reports on television and messages circulated on WhatsApp are of concern. After the investigation, it was found that four of every five messages were fake. It appears they are being sent to create confusion and misunderstandings,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/like-maharashtra-centre-should-ve-denied-permission-for-jamaat-event-says-sharad-pawar/story-YH1cn1MBa0lbCsnHPpLsHL.html
06-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: After complaints about centre at Worli, Aaditya orders to shift patients||Patients admitted to RA Podar Ayurved Medical College, Worli, have claimed that the 376-bed quarantine centre lacks basic amenities such as clean toilets, drinking water, food and cleanliness in hospital wards. After videos highlighting the poor facilities and unhygienic conditions went viral, Worli legislator and Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted on Monday that these patients have been shifted to another quarantine centre.“Strict action has been taken against those responsible for inconvenience. These patients have been shifted to another quarantine centre. They sent me videos from there. I contacted them and apologised for what happened at Podar Hospital. I have shared my contact number with them so they can contact me if they require any help,” Thackeray had tweeted. However, officials at the hospital said the patients have not been shifted to any other quarantine centre. “Yes from the past two days, there have been some issues pertaining to the quarantine facility. But we are working on it now with the help of other departments as well as the civic body. The repair and maintenance work of the toilets are ongoing and we have also appointed dedicated staff to take care of the quarantined patients,” Dr K Rajeshwar Reddy, head of the hospital’s coronavirus wing, told HT. Earlier, one of the quarantined patients had alleging that toilets are unfit for use. “It would have been better to die with coronavirus infection at home,” the woman had said in a video. Patients had claimed that the hospital administration did not visit the ward despite several requests made by them on the unhygienic conditions at the quarantine centre. Of the patients quarantined at Podar Hospital, 35 from Worli koliwada, which has been among the worst-affected areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-after-complaints-about-centre-at-worli-aaditya-orders-to-shift-patients/story-67B2sCNDXvAlLTI8mwpZnJ.html
06-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: 14,474 home-quarantined in city so far||From the first week of March to Monday evening, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has home-quarantined 14,474 people in the city. Of them, 6,548 people have completed the 14-day home quarantine period.According to the data accessed by HT, till Monday evening, five of the 24 wards in the city account for 46% of the home-quarantined. “Earlier, only people who were in close contact with the infected or suspected patients were home-quarantined, now it has been extended to all inhabitants of containment zones, which is why the number has gone up,” said a health officer from the BMC. Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC, said, “In several wards, the number of institutional-quarantined is more than home-quarantined, like in case of Dharavi. We have shifted many high-risk people to vacant lodges and places for their safety. Fourteen days of home quarantine is also essential for patients who turned negative after they get discharged from hospitals. This also reflects in the data.”The K/E ward, which covers areas Andheri East, Vile Parle East and city airports, tops the list with 2,330 people. This ward has reported 26 Covid-19 cases. It is followed by P/N ward (east of Kurar village, west of Manori village, south of Govind nagar road, Chincholi bunder) with 1,927 people in home quarantine and 24 cases. Occupying the third position is the G/S ward that covers Worli, Tardeo and Dadar, with 1,659 people under home quarantine. This ward has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases with 68 patients. Following it is the M/E ward which shares borders with Deonar, Chembur and Govandi with 964 people home quarantined and has seen 16 positive cases. This is followed by the R/N ward that comprises Dahisar and Borivali, which has 950 people quarantined. So far, six cases have been reported at the ward. The number of positive cases is till Sunday evening.Wards A, B and C have the lowest number of quarantined people 213, 78 and 111, respectively. The number of the home-quarantined is not directly proportional to the number of infected people in wards. For example, E ward, which covers Byculla and parts of Reay Road, has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases with 44 patients. But according to the data shared by BMC, the number of home-quarantined people in the ward is only 209. Dr Shah said, “It doesn’t necessarily mean that the number of quarantined people will be equivalent to cases.” Several home-quarantined family members of Covid-19 patients are complaining of harassment. A 56-year-old man, a resident of Chembur who got admitted at Seven Hills Hospital on March 31 after being diagnosed with Covid-19, got discharged on Sunday. Talking to HT, his home-quarantined 24-year-old son, said, “From the time my society members got to know that my parents are coronavirus positive, they have been ignoring me and treating me like a criminal. If I greet them, they don’t even respond. The society members take a U-turn even if I stand 100m away from them.” He also complained that although the BMC was supposed to provide them with food, he didn’t get any help from the officers. “I also had the responsibility of my 72-year-old grandmother. So, I got groceries for 10 days from my uncle. Thankfully, I didn’t depend on the BMC or else we would have had to starve,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-14-474-home-quarantined-in-city-so-far/story-OQlj3I64PVNblO43mVVlcO.html
06-04-2020||Noida||MLAs to suggest plans to handle affairs after April 15||Day after UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a video conference with all MPs and MLAs of the state, including opposition parties, to discuss the road map of how to lift the lockdown after April 14, Gautam Budh Nagar MLAs said they would likely send their suggestions by Tuesday after consultation with all stakeholders. On Sunday, in a video conference interaction, Adityanath had told all political leaders that the state machinery must be used to prevent people from spilling out on the streets when the lockdown is lifted partially on April 15. The chief minister sought the cooperation of elected representatives and suggestions on the measures the government can take to control the spread of this highly infectious disease. Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh, who donated ₹1 crore from his constituency fund to the CM Distress Relief Fund for Covid 19, said they were in favour of extending the lockdown till end of month. “Since, Gautam Budh Nagar, with 58 Covid-19 cases, has emerged as the epicentre of infection in the state for now, we believe that the lockdown should be extended till April-end so efforts made so far are not wasted. The government is taking all steps to contain the disease and providing food and medicine to the needy,” he said, adding that it was more important to save human lives and that economies can be rebuilt if the manpower is healthy. Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary Awanish Awasthi also said that if Covid cases continue to increase then the state may not end its lockdown. Noida MLA Pankaj Singh also echoed similar sentiments saying that as of now their focus was on providing food to needy containing the disease from spreading. “We are taking suggestions from all stakeholders including farmers, businessmen, village heads, intellectuals, doctors and others before sending suggestions to the state government on how to lift the lockdown, if at all. Our priority is to ensure all needy get food, medicine and other essential services without hassle. Anybody who tags me on social networking sites or makes calls for food is getting immediate response. If we can continue to deliver essential services, no one will suffer if the lockdown continues,” said the Noida MLA, who also donated ₹1 crore from his constituency fund to the CM Distress Relief Fund. GB Nager MP Dr Mahesh Sharma said, “We have made suggestions to the UP government but will not discuss it now. However, the government should take decision on the basis of prevailing conditions in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/mlas-to-suggest-plans-to-handle-affairs-after-april-15/story-iJo9RkS8kek5ItUG5U1RhM.html

Many of them had decorated the spaces as if it was Diwali. Their were string lights, several candles and diyas. On top of that, people started clapping and ringing bells just like they did on the day of janta curfew,” said Ritika Singh, a resident of a high-rise in Sector 75.All across Noida, people came up with creative ways to mark the nine minutes. High-rises decorated their common areas while in some societies, children painted a map of India and decorated in with diyas. Chants of ‘Go Corona Go’ were also heard along with the applause.Even administrative and police personnel came forward to participate in the event. The commissioner of police and deputy commissioners lighted lamps with families while almost all police posts and stations and administrative offices were also lit up.“Residents of 16th avenue in Gaur City donated food packets containing items such as flour, pulses, and vegetables to the police post to help as many as 3,000 people. Police can share them with those coming to them for rations. We will continue to help as much as we can,” said P Chauhan, a resident of Gaur City.The police has appointed DCP, women safety, as the officer in charge of relief efforts.“We have a centralised godown at the commissioner’s office in Sector 108 where we have supply of around 2.5 lakh kilos of rice, 12,000 kilos of pulses and other essential items, including masks. We also have 5,000 ration kits and donations are being received at police posts and police stations. Approximately 1.6 lakh beneficiaries have been helped already and we are working with at least 50 organisations to continue the relief work,” Vrinda Shukla, DCP, women safety, said.So far, more than 520 FIRs have been registered in the district against people violating guidelines of the lockdown and more than 300 of them have been arrested.

06-04-2020||City||Corona crisis: GB Nagar to get two new testing labs||Ghaziabad: Amid the rising Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday gave directions for setting up of 14 new testing laboratories, including two in Gautam Budh Nagar, at 14 medical colleges across the state, senior government officials said. The CM also directed for upgrading 10 existing laboratories at other medical colleges in the state, the officials said, adding that the process of upgrade and commencement of new labs will start at the earliest with the help of UP’s ‘Covid care fund’.The 10 existing labs, which will be upgraded, are in medical colleges at Meerut, Prayagraj, Jhansi, Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Etawah and Kanpur.“The CM is of view that the state should have its own infrastructure for testing facilities. The 10 existing labs will be upgraded to BS-3 level (Biosafety-3 level) while directions have also been issued for coming up with new labs at 14 other medical colleges in Ambedkar Nagar, Kannauj, Jalaun, Azamgarh, Banda, Badaun, Noida, Greater Noida, Ayodhya, Basti, Behraich, Firozabad and Shahjahanpur,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).The two medical colleges in Gautam Budh Nagar, where the new laboratories will be set up, are Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute in Noida and Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida.“The CM has directed officials of the departments concerned to initiate the works at the earliest. The sum required for the purpose will be released from the UP’s Covid case fund. The CM has also given directions that those districts having no medical colleges should have minimum of one collection centre at their district hospitals. So, the state will have its own facilities and apparatus to deal with cases,” Awasthi said in Lucknow.The officials added that work for upgrading and creation of new labs will be monitored on daily basis.The chief minister recently set up the Covid care fund to deal with the rising Covid-19 cases and also to upgrade the health care system in the state.The UP government has also initiated the process for a three-tier system for treating Covid-19 patients. Hospitals are being converted to levels 1, 2 and 3. These hospitals will be dedicated to deal only with Covid-19 cases while their OPDs and emergency services are being shifted to other government hospitals.The state government recently notified six hospitals under the L2 category, which includes Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital in Ghaziabad. The Ghaziabad health department has started the preparations and the 100-bed hospital is likely to start functioning as L2 facility for Covid-19 patients from April 10.“All 100 beds in the hospital have been separated and completely dedicated to Covid-19 positive cases. Initially, such cases will be dealt by L1 hospital at Muradnagar. In case of some complications, these patients will come to our hospital. We have roped in 53 doctors and staff members, while 30 more are expected to arrive soon from nearby districts,” said Dr Naresh Vij, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar hospital.“Every bed has oxygen supply facility and exhaust fans have also been installed. We have five ventilators and 10 more will arrive soon. The OPD and emergency services have been shifted to MMG hospital and Women’s hospital while the dialysis centre here will continue to function,” Dr Vij added.For the doctors and hospital staff dealing with Covid-19 patients, the administration has also tied up with two hotels where they will put up after their duty hours, the officials said.Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said that 30-bed L1-category hospital at Muradnagar will suffice. The facility became operational on March 5.“In case we have more Covid-19 positive patients, they will be shifted to Sanjay Nagar hospital. Once this is full, the patients can be shifted to another 100-bed hospital of a private medical college where isolation ward has come up. For dealing with critical patients, we can send them to Meerut or Delhi,” he added.According to health department officials, the Ghaziabad district at present has 23 Covid-19 positive cases and three patients have been discharged from hospitals..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corona-crisis-gb-nagar-to-get-two-new-testing-labs/story-49tBZ3q9rJhL7gPkfKbm0N.html
06-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad MLAs in favour of partial lifting of lockdown||Two days after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath spoke to MLAs and MLCs through video conferencing and sought suggestions on the lifting of the 21-day nationwide lockdown on April 14, Ghaziabad MLAs are said they in favour of restrictions continuing partially.Most of the MLAs are of the opinion that schools and educational institutions besides malls, multiplexes, restaurants and shops selling luxury items should continue to remain shut as they are likely to attract public gatherings which may prove detrimental to the ongoing efforts of fight the coronavirus spread.“We are of the opinion that areas from where positive cases have emerged should continue to remain locked down for another 10 to 15 days so that the infection does not spread to other areas,” Sunil Sharma, Sahibabad MLA, said.“Areas where people with a foreign travel history are residing as well as areas from where cases linked to Noida-based company, Ceasefire, have emerged should remain under surveillance. Weekly markets, schools and cinema halls should remain shut. Industrial units should be allowed to open but with strict enforcement of sanitisation and social distancing norms,” he said.According to the state government, there are 305 Covid-19 cases in UP as on Monday.Dr Manju Siwach, Modinagar MLA, said pockets from where positive cases have emerged should continue to be under lockdown for another 15-20 days and effective scanning of potential patients should continue.“The public transport should open but not modes such as autos, e-rickdhaws, etc otherwise it will become very difficult to enforce social distancing. We can still wait for another month or so to visit malls, restaurants etc. Educational institutions including those related to higher education should remain closed for a further period of time,” she said.Ghaziabad MLA Atul Garg said any decision regarding the lifting of the lockdown would need to be reviewed in another seven to eight days.“For Loni, which is densely populated, more funds should be allotted to deal with anti-Covid-19 efforts. There are a large number of people who work in factories and we suggest that factories should be allowed to function so that people can resume their jobs and earn a livelihood. But the premises have to be sanitised thoroughly and social distancing should be maintained. Schools should remain closed for a further period,” Nand Kishor Gurjar, Loni MLA, said.“I don’t think the present conditions are favourable for lifting the lockdown. In Loni, the health department and police have picked up about 125 people who went to attend religious congregations. The number of positive patients has increased as a result. The Delhi-Ghaziabad borders should be locked and police barricading should continue to check movement of people,” he said.On Monday evening, additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said during a press briefing that lifting the lockdown after April 14 may not be possible as sensitivity in the state has increased due to rising number of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-mlas-in-favour-of-partial-lifting-of-lockdown/story-WMbO6OmiHxXksDmhmFz27K.html

Today, around 300 dozen mangoes are expected. “Instead of our residents stepping out to purchase vegetables and fruits, we thought we could get them good quality and organic produce from farms at a good rate. It can be a little expensive, but those who want to, can opt for it,” said a committee member.Resident Vishal Thakkar said, “Though it was delayed once and we had to call a local vendor, otherwise we are regularly provided with parcels from Nashik.”The colony’s management committee imposed restrictions on people’s movement as soon as the lockdown was announced. Initially, there was some opposition. “When the decision to not allow maids inside the society was taken, it was difficult for members to accept it. But now they appreciate the foresight,” said a committee member. Other initiatives by the committee include organising musical.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/living-in-lockdown-this-mulund-society-gets-organic-veggies-mangoes-delivered-home/story-G4wL3ZDwpYpRbBXP39l6xN.html
06-04-2020||City||UP may continue lockdown after April 14||Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh may not call off the 21-day lockdown on April 14 as a senior official in the state home department on Monday said that restrictions cannot be lifted till Sars-Cov-2 virus is wiped out from the state. Senior government officials said that the increasing number of positive Covid-19 cases remained a worrying factor.The UP’s additional chief secretary (home), Awanish Awasthi, said that before ending the lockdown they will have to ensure that there is “not a single Covid-19 positive case present” in the state.According to officials, the total number of Covid-19 cases in the state stood at 305 till Monday evening, which include 159 cases related to the last month’s Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Delhi’s Nizamuddin.“On Monday, there has been addition of 27 cases and 21 of them are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event. Out of total 305 positive cases, 159 are linked to Jamaat. There have been reports which are optimistic about ending the lockdown in UP after April 14. But, the sensitivity in the state has increased during the past four-five days as the number of Covid-19 cases linked to Jamaat has surfaced. So, it is premature to say whether the lockdown will end or not,” Awasthi said during a press briefing in Lucknow.Initially, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced a lockdown of 16 districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, in the state on March 22. Thereafter, in his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the night of March 24 announced a countrywide lockdown for 21 days to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. The 21-day lockdown will end on April 14.Awasthi further said,“So it cannot be said that lockdown will end after April 14 or not. Our teams of health, police and government officers are putting in a lot of efforts and they will have to work for a longer period. People’s participation is also required now.”The officials said that they are also trying to trace those who came in contact with the 159 positive cases linked to Tablighi Jamaat meet.“We are also scanning and searching for a third category of people who came in contact with the second category. At present, we can say that there is no community spread as cases and contacts are identified, and before ending lockdown we will have to ensure that there is no single positive case pending in the state,” Awasthi added.According to the officials, about 1,600 people linked to Tablighi Jamaat event were identified and nearly 1,200 of them were sent to quarantine facilities. They added that 159 positive cases linked to Jamaat were reported in Agra (29 cases), Lucknow (12), Ghaziabad (14), Meerut and Shamli (13 each), Hapur (3) and Saharanpur (13 cases), among other districts.Besides, 315 foreigners were also identified till Sunday and 249 passports have been seized so far and 42 FIRs filed against them, the officials said. Six people from Nepal were traced by the police in Ghaziabad on April 1 while 10 Indonesian nationals were traced and taken to a quarantine facility after they were hiding in a madarsa in Sahibabad on April 4. In Ghaziabad, there are a total of 23 Covid-19 cases and 14 of them are linked to people who attended different religious congregations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-may-continue-lockdown-after-april-14/story-Cq5zI7lb1tarDfwnu83zgL.html
06-04-2020||Noida||Lockdown puts the brakes on 10,000 trucks of GB Nagar transporters||The nationwide lockdown has stranded over 10,000 trucks, belonging to the transporters of Gautam Budh Nagar district, in different parts of the country and they are incurring losses of over ₹2 crore per day.Shiv Kumar Sharma, president of Noida transporters’ association, said that due to the lockdown, many goods carrying vehicles have halted in states such as Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. “Due to the restrictions, they could not reach Noida from their respective destinations. Drivers and helpers of these trucks are having a tough time as all restaurants and hotels on highways are closed. Thanks to the initiatives taken by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that our drivers have got meal arrangements near different toll plazas,” he said.Sharma further said over 30,000 workers are involved in the transport services. “As per a rough estimate, this lockdown is causing loss of over ₹2 crore per day. It will be really hard for us to recover the loss in the near future, even if the lockdown is lifted after its stipulated 21 days. Most drivers, helpers and cleaners have left the trucks and returned to their native places.For those who chose to stay with their vehicles, the transporters are arranging their food and stay,” he said.Choudhary Vedpal, convener of Noida transporters’ joint forum, said despite the lockdown, transporters are paying salaries to their staff. “Even once the lockdown has ended, we will have to wait for the staff to return. We expect that all trains and buses will be overcrowded. Once they are back to work, I don’t think 10,000 trucks will be sufficient to carry goods needed by the people,” he said.Appreciating the support being given by the district administration during this period, Vedpal said a little less than 10% of trucks are being used by the administration for transporting essential commodities in the district. “With the payment we received for that, we were able to arrange food and stay for the staff stranded in the district. But it is not more than a drop in the ocean,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lockdown-puts-the-brakes-on-10-000-trucks-of-gb-nagar-transporters/story-wM6NapG7Qh03qdsgap31lL.html

06-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Worli is Mumbai’s worst-hit area||The civic body has deployed 22 teams and checked more than 50,000 people for Sars-CoV-2 in Worli (G-South ward), which became Mumbai’s worst-hit area, with 11 new cases taking the tally to 68 on Monday.After a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) sweeper from Worli Koliwada tested positive on April 2, civic health staffers swung into action and screened more than 50,000 people, said BMC officials. From Monday, the BMC initiated a second survey of all homes in the area, with the help of doctors from KEM Hospital in Lower Parel.Civic commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said: “The number of cases in this particular area is increasing. So we have imposed a strict ban on movement. We are rigorously tracking high-risk and low-risk contacts.”Civic health officials said a team of four members identified containment zones in the area to conduct door-to-door surveys for suspected patients. Beyond the containment zones, the BMC has surveyed buffer zones, where the virus might have spread. As part of this survey, 320 high-risk contacts have been identified and quarantined at the local Potdar hospital for 14 days.Shiv Sena deputy leader Sachin Ahir said, “We are shifting suspected patients to quarantine centres with the help of BMC staff. We are preparing a quarantine facility of 500 beds in the parking area of the racecourse club.’’On Monday, Dadar saw another case of Covid-19 – a 54-year-old woman who lives at SK Bole road. Two buildings of the colony where she lived have been contained and the local ward office is sanitising the area. The BMC has quarantined all high-risk contacts, and their test results are awaited. The travel history of the patient is being investigated. This comes a day after a 60-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19, a few hundred metres away in Shivaji Park. The patient had no travel history.A total of 150 suspected patients were admitted to civic-run hospitals across the city, of which 57 tested positive. The rise in number has been attributed to the Tablighi Markaz in Delhi.

06-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown: Residents irked as police bar them from walk on premises||Many residents of housing societies in the city are irked after having witnessed instances of police barring them from taking a walk inside society premises.Recently, the police barged inside Gundecha Gardens at Lalbuag, Ashok Towers in Parel and had warned the residents. “We take adequate care while exercising and maintain adequate distance. We need some activity and cannot sit throughout the day at home,” said Anil Parmar, Parel resident, who walks for an hour with his wife. Parmar says that such an order is bad, especially for patients of various disorders like diabetes for whom walking and exercises are a must. The city, as well as suburban city collectorates, had issued orders soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced, asking housing societies to enforce stringent social distancing measures. The orders said that congregation at the society gardens or common areas should be barred, sanitisers must be kept at the entrance of the buildings, essential goods supply must be regulated and vendors must drop the goods at society entrances etc.Sharmila Ganesh, a resident of Mulund said, “Why should police interfere within society premises. As long as one is taking a walk by herself or with a family member maintaining social distance, there should not be a problem.”Well-known diabetologist Dr Pradeep Gadge agrees that walking and exercises are must for diabetes patient but said that the current situation is extraordinary. “The Covid-19 threat is more fatal than diabetes and hence it might be best to do walking inside their home for some days,” said Gadge.City collector Rajiv Nivatkar said, “We have asked people to not step out of the premises unless it is an emergency. Our order also lays down that congregation of members must not be allowed at gardens, common areas etc. The rest like whether taking a walk is to be barred within the premises is to be decided by the residents themselves.”He added, “Housing societies can make their own rules based on consensus considering the wellbeing of the community. If there are a few members who are causing trouble by not following social distancing measures then the society office bearers should make a complaint to the deputy registrar.”Another official from the suburban collectorate said that the problem arises when societies are not well aligned and there are differences between the members. He also added that not all societies have implemented social distancing norms properly.“Despite several warnings, the residents continue their outdoor activities and we don’t have adequate powers to enforce this,” said Dhaval Shah, chairman, Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens Association. He quoted a recent incident where a resident bashed up the building secretary for disallowing maids from coming to work due to lockdown.Mumbai Police PRO Pranay Ashok said residents should ideally not come down. “The residents can walk at home or use the stairs. They are expected to not come down,” said Ashok.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-residents-irked-as-police-bar-them-from-walk-on-premises/story-UsPYW2N82D6PK5YtxWmGbI.html

Both were members of former party leader Jeremy Corbyn’s team.Starmer said: “I’m proud to have appointed a shadow cabinet that showcases the breadth, depth and talents of the Labour Party. This is a new team that will be relentlessly focused on acting in the national interest to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding Labour so that it can win the next election.”According to parliamentary rules, the shadow cabinet is the team of senior spokespeople chosen by the leader of the opposition to mirror the cabinet in government. Each member of the shadow cabinet is appointed to lead on a specific policy area for their party and to question and challenge their counterpart in the cabinet. In this way, the official opposition seeks to present itself as an alternative government-in-waiting, the rules state. Starmer, who promised to be a rallying figure in the party, defeated Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey in the leadership election that was triggered after Corbyn stepped down following the party’s fourth election loss in a row in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/preet-kaur-gill-vaz-in-labour-s-new-shadow-cabinet-in-the-uk/story-GIWcEZScOM7Q7w2h4eFEfO.html

The one-year-old animal, which had fallen into the well about two weeks ago, was being kept alive by locals who would throw cat food in the well.The young cat is currently being kept under medical observation at the forest department’s office in Charkhi Dadri, and will be released in three to four days once it regains strength, wildlife department officials confirmed.Satish Sangwan, the owner of the farm where the well is located, first noticed the cat after hearing some sounds emanating from the deep well. “It is an old 200 feet well that we no longer use. One day I heard the animal’s sound clearly. It was howling,” Sangwan told HT over phone.Sangwan said that he immediately reached out to local conservationists -- Rakesh Ahlawat and Sonu Dalal -- who informed the divisional wildlife officer, Hisar, under whose jurisdiction the area falls. On March 27, a wildlife inspector arrived at Sangwan’s farm to attempt a rescue, but was unable to lower a cage till the bottom of the well. The inspector left the cage behind at Sangwan’s request. “Luckily, I was able to borrow a hydraulic crane from a neighbour. It is usually rented out, but it has been lying in the village since the lockdown began,” Sangwan said.Over the next few days, Sangwan, his family members and other villagers made multiple failed rescues. “We lowered the cage and a bucket with food in it multiple times into the well, but could not succeed in bringing out the cat,” Sangwan said.Finally, Dalal and Ahlawat reached Pichopa on the morning of April 5. “We attached the cage to the hydraulic crane, and I sat on top of the cage as it was lowered into the well. After sitting at the bottom for about half-an-hour in the dark, I felt that the animal walked into the cage. I immediately shut it, and instructed the crane operator to pull us up,” said Dalal, describing the successful attempt. Wildlife officials said that the rescue operation was not possible without the help of the villagers, and Ahlawat and Dalal. “We did not think a rescue was possible. However, we managed to save the cat with the help of locals. The cat is a young female, not more than a year old. She has been taken care of by a vet, who will do another routine check-up in a few days. The animal does not seem to be injured, but is extremely weak. We will release it back once it gets better,” said Pawan Grover, divisional wildlife officer, Hisar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jungle-cat-rescued-from-200-ft-well-in-charkhi-dadri-after-two-weeks/story-0tSz96azbqTx7aK4YwHlgP.html

Private traders, who were, anyhow, purchasing the crop below the MSP (minimum support price) this season, are unlikely to jump in the procurement exercise amid Covid-19 outbreak, sources say. Cotton is the economic lifeline of farmers in the semi-arid belt of south Malwa region as the crop is sown in eight districts, mainly in Fazilka, Mansa, Bathinda and Muktsar. Hoping for higher price by private traders, about 5 lakh quintal cotton stock is still held back by farmers, before the curfew was imposed, officials claim. This season, the CCI has purchased about three lakh bales (one bale of cotton weighs 170kg) at the MSP of Rs 5,450 per quintal. Cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel told HT on Monday that deliberations are on with the CCI to commence buying of raw cotton within the next 2-3 days. “Modalities are being finalised and farmers will soon be apprised about it. We are concerned about the pandemic and all steps will be taken to ensure safety,” said Goel. Mansa and Faridkot have already accorded permission to the CCI to resume purchase.However, CCI officials say they are facing multiple problems in the middle of national emergency to restart cotton purchase. Private ginning units associated with CCI have reportedly said there is shortage of labour to process more raw cotton.An official added that the CCI was mandated to buy cotton stocks till September 30, so purchase should be started after pandemic situation eases.“Owing to the national lockdown and curfew in Punjab, transportation of ginned cotton is completely stopped. Private buyers from Punjab and others states are unable to get binola, which is used as cattle feed, from CCI warehouses and the central agency has hardly any space left for a new purchase,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-wants-cotton-procurement-to-restart-cci-cites-lack-of-space/story-qcDuYkKau4Hs83eUNVHyPK.html

The facility will have 20 ventilators. The special facility, to be used after the 350 bed-facility for COVID-19 at the Jalandhar civil hospital and 500 beds at the Punjab Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), again only for covid-19 patients, are fully occupied, has been set up in a fully-AC building on 5 acre at Billi Chuharmi village on the Shahkot road. A charitable facility, Sant Waryam Singh Dahiya Charitable Hospital, was to start here in May. Now, doctors from private hospitals will oversee treatment to covid-19 patients here without charging anything.Jalandhar deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, who has visited the building to oversee its readiness, said the hospital was a novel idea that private players in healthcare had floated. “The IMA offered that, in case of outbreak of the disease, instead of keeping one or two patients in each private hospital, a single covid-19 facility must be created. Each private player has provided at least one ventilator,” the DC added. As of now, the civil hospital and the PIMS combined have 12 ventilators. The district administration will provide consumable medicines to the set-up, private players will bear the other expenses on the project. KhalsaAid will take care of logistics related to food for patients and attendants.“The patients to the IMA facility will be shifted after the civil hospital and the PIMS facilities are full,” the DC added. IMA Punjab president Dr Navjot Dahiya said all facilities available in ICUs of private hospitals were available in the Centre, which will be ready to induct patients in two more days. “Private players are ready to offer their own spaces as well, in case an outbreak happens. We also have the infrastructure to ramp up capacity at this new special covid facility to 60 beds,” he claimed. Five pvt units to make PPEsFive private units have cleared the testing phase to deliver personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N-95 and N-99 masks to support the state government. Punjab industries minister Sunder Sham Arora said that for the manufacturing and supply of Protective Personal Equipment (PPEs) Ludhiana firms Shiva Textiles, Swamy Textiles and Shingora had been approved by the South Indian Textile Research Association (SITRA), Coimbatore, which is the authorised testing agency. The minister added, “JCT Fabrics, Phagwara, and Ever Shine garments, Ludhiana are the other two.” For making N95 and N 99 masks, Surgeine Hosphiarpur and Oxyclear had got the go-ahead with two other Ludhiana-based firms, Gurkirpa Textlies and Navyug Laminates given permission to make the PPE fabric.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-jalandhar-pvt-hospitals-join-hands-to-set-up-40-bed-covid-facility/story-KcP6j1X31dIlEpmmdmskiN.html

Bathinda hasn’t reported any positive case of Covid-19 so far.Manpreet said adequate availability of PPE will be ensured in a week by the state government at any cost.“This is perhaps the first-ever guard of honour in India meant exclusively for the medical and paramedical professionals. It is meant for the bravest of the brave and the visiting dignitaries. I think everyone in the country will follow this practice of arranging a special guard of honour to express their appreciation and gratefulness,” he said.Dr Gurmail Singh, district president of the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association, said PPE kits are available but the guidelines to use them are strict, exposing many employees to the risk.Swaranjit Kaur, a staff nurse deployed at the hospital’s isolation ward, said, “We don’t even have N-95 masks. We are attending to the suspected patients with simple masks.”A delegation of employees who met civil surgeon Dr Amrik Singh for setting up a separate quarantine centre for staff raised slogans against him when they were not satisfied with his response.The civil surgeon claimed they have sufficient PPE kits to be used as per the state government guidelines. On the demand for setting up separate quarantine centre for staff he said that issue has been taken up with the higher-ups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-workers-fighting-pandemic-rue-lack-of-ppe-kits/story-ov2FoZ3EpwwBZZYXmdb7zH.html

Covid positive cases in the state are increasing daily. Reports have been carried in certain sections of the media that the lockdown will be lifted in UP after April 14. The state government wishes to make it clear that lockdown is not likely to be lifted till there is a single coronavirus case in the state. The lifting of the lockdown means UP has become coronavirus free,” additional chief secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said at a press conference in the state capital.“The state government has taken effective measures to check the spread of the coronavirus in the state. If the lockdown is lifted, the purpose of enforcing it to check the spread of the coronavirus will be defeated. If there is a single Covid case in the state, the chances of its spreading looms large. There is a need to put all Covid positive patients in isolation wards of hospitals and track and quarantine those who came in contact with them,” he said.Earlier, there was speculation that the lockdown might be lifted by the middle of the month as chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a video conference with MPs and ministers on Sunday, telling them to prepare a work plan for the post-lockdown period, management of crowd and give suggestions on how curbs should be lifted.

The letter from Taloja jail authorities on April 1, 2020 comes after prisons in Mumbai and Thane stopped admitting new prisoners due to overcrowding and the imminent threat of COVID-19 virus. At Taloja prison, every new prisoner is kept in the isolation ward to quarantine for the required period of a fortnight which has seen that the jail’s capacity to hold more prisoners come down, a senior police officer said. “All the prisons from Arthur Road, Byculla, Thane Central prison and Aadharwadi at Kalyan stopped taking new prisoners, and hence all the prisoners were being sent to Taloja. We have been receiving 10 to 15 new prisoners every day, and now we do not have the facility to accommodate all of them. So we have requested the courts to not send more prisoners to Taloja, and to let the accused go on bail if the offence is not grave in nature,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpvid-19-do-not-send-any-new-prisoners-taloja-jail-authorities-urges/story-cXiVWPAaYuNRil1M61TG4I.html

Sandhu said Surinder Kaur had gone to Mohali where she probably contracted the virus and died at a hospital.“After the death, the family was asked to complete the formalities to claim the body. However, the family refused, saying it was administration’s responsibility. After this, duty magistrate Jagsir Singh, along with police officials of the area, completed the formalities and the administration took the body in its possession,” said Sandhu.“They didn’t agree even as we told them that all the preventive measures will be in place and they could light the pyre from 12 feet away using a bamboo, but sadly they refused,” Sandhu said.A cremation ground worker was asked to light the pyre. The person was sanitised, covered with a PPE kit before he lit the pyre from a distance, said Sandhu, adding the administration will also perform the bhog ceremony of the woman at Baba Deep Singh Gurdwara on Saturday for which money is being pooled.Several attempts made to reach the family for a comment went futile and once a woman picked the call made on Surinder Kaur’s phone number but refused to talk saying she was busy and has nothing to say on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kin-sit-in-car-as-admn-cremates-covid-19-woman-patient/story-IJZOXCKzcs5iythy6JiL9J.html

These districts are Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Ferozepur and Fazilka districts; farmers here claim that they are in urgent need of the money, as the lockdown has affected their crop. The Centre and state governments contribute 50% each for the compensation, which is Rs 10,000 per acre. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had, during its tenure from 1997-2002, started the scheme as borders farmers faced problems in accessing their land due to the fencing and other restrictions in place. The compensation was enhanced to Rs 15,000 per acre in 2015. “The government should release the compensation at the earliest. Now, harvesting of our crop will start only after the lockdown ends. Farmers here do not even have money for harvesting,” claimed Surjit Singh Bhura, vice president of Border Area Kisan Welfare Committee (BAFWC), adding that the lockdown had made the situation worse for them.

Once that happens, it would be even more assuring, and life would become easy. Presently the reports that medicine shops, petrol pumps and many kirana stores are being kept open have been greeted with relief,” said RK Dey, another resident and a database administrator with a government department.His wife Sumita, a self-employed teacher, is stuck in Bengaluru where she had gone on a private visit before the ‘Janta Curfew’ and the lockdown announcement that led to suspension of all trains and flights in the country. “I have asked her to stay put there and wait for the entire lockdown period to get over before coming back. Till then WhatsApp chats and a few video calls are keeping us connected,” said Dey.“This is time to perform your duty to country and community by adhering to the guidelines and restrictions strictly. In these challenging times, saving life is the priority than the food that we eat,” he said.MAIDS, SANITATION STAFF ON LEAVE, IT’S JOINT CLEANING HERERecognising the need for waste disposal and keeping the building clean, the residents here have devised an alternate day joint cleaning and garbage disposal exercise.“Three alternate days have been selected by us jointly for cleaning of the building when the roof and floors are swept and washed by residents in the morning wearing gloves, masks and head covers. The other three days the members of the society collect garbage and dispose it off. The main gates are being kept bolted to deter casual visitors even as using the elevator in groups have been stopped for all,” said Vivek Dhaka, a high court lawyer and secretary of the complex’s Residents’ Welfare Association.He along with his two kids Shreshta (class 9) and Aujasvi (class 6), as well as wife Geeta, a home maker, are observing the lockdown in their fifth-floor apartment here. “I believe the lockdown was needed as achieving effective social distancing is always an uphill task. It’s great that we have not recorded a COVID-19 positive patient till date in Prayagraj region, including Pratapgarh and Kaushambi districts. It’s time to ensure that this trend continues, he added.Geeta said the strict lockdown was best for all, especially the kids and the elderly who are the most vulnerable. “So, it’s watching TV, cooking food and managing studies of the kids besides the household chores that we are doing together that takes the whole day. As the festival of Holi had just passed, our stock of ration was already with us and we are managing with it,” she added.MANAGING HOMES, DUTY WITH GUSTOSanjay Jangwan runs a medical store at Balson crossing and is having to keep the shop open that is witnessing heavy rush of people desperate for their medicines. “He goes every morning and comes in the night but is taking all precautions. Here at home I am managing with my two kids Aishwayra, who is an MBA student at an institute in Lucknow and son Aryaman, a BTech student with a university in Jaipur. While Aishwarya’s institute is holding regular online class sessions that she attends from home, Aryaman is keeping busy online,” she shared.On the fifth floor, there are also Singh family — having five members, including three grown-up children. Sanjay Singh is an accountant with a private firm while his wife Shweta is a housewife. Their eldest son, Saurabh, younger one Shubham and only daughter Nandani are all keeping themselves busy—well within their three-room apartment. “This is the time to show social responsibility and so none of us are venturing out. With Navrataras on, I am spending time in prayers and fasts beside household chores while the husband is busy maintaining the accounts of his office. The kids are having a tougher time keeping indoors but they too are managing with Internet and few visits to rooftop when it is empty,” shared Shweta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/inside-divyakunj-complex-in-prayagraj-inmates-take-up-cleaning-job-in-rotation/story-UMTiSUN0I75VMiz8ScOYpO.html

One can imagine our situation,” she said adding the government of India must restore high Internet services in the valley.The high-speed internet services were suspended in the valley on August 5 last year, following the abrogation of Article 370. However, 2G mobile internet and low-speed broadband were also restored last month with limited access to social media.The people have also demanded that the government must restore the cross-LoC bus service which was shut a year ago. The Karavan-e-Aman (peace bus) between Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service was started on April 7, 2005, on fortnightly basis as a confidence-building measure between India and Pakistan when the two countries were engaged in a composite dialogue.The cross-LoC bus service was suspended in March last year following the Pulwama terror attack on February 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-limited-access-to-internet-kashmiri-families-divided-by-loc-unable-to-contact-each-other/story-a2sw7Qkwc5ZMWyK0SfbwWP.html

She was subsequently asked to remain in the quarantine facility set up by the district administration till lockdown ends, officials said. Due to lockdown, the couple was returning to their home in Nepal. However, the authorities stopped them and asked them to stay in quarantine until the lockdown ends. The woman’s husband is a migrant worker, who was working at a hotel in Faridabad.“This woman, who had come from Nepal, was pregnant. But we could not allow her to go back because of the lockdown. Hence, we had admitted her to the district hospital where she was taken full care of and later delivered a baby boy,” additional district magistrate JP Gupta told news agency ANI.Gupta said both the mother and the new-born were healthy and the hospital staff was taking good care of them. On being asked that the mother had named her boy ‘Covid’, the ADM said that he would not like to comment on that. “Every mother has the right to choose a name for her boy or girl,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/woman-names-baby-boy-covid/story-48iOEi9oTNh344BHvjK3bN.html
06-04-2020||City||Floriculture crisis: No demand, growers forced to destroy flowers in their fields||As the curfew enforced in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak has brought down the demand for flowers in the market to almost nil, flower growers in Punjab are destroying their yield in the fields. The farmers say due to the curfew people have deferred their celebratory functions, and the demand for flowers in temples and gurdwaras has also plunged to a minuscule level. There are 10 farmers in Tarn Taran district’s Jagatpura village, who have been growing flowers for the past 10 to 12 years. Most of these farmers have tilled the flower plants — marigold and gultak — in their fields while seeing no hope of growth in demand in near future. The situation is no different in other parts of the state. “Breaking wheat-paddy circle, I have been growing flowers in my fields. Like every year, I spent Rs 40,000 per acre in planting flowers in December last year. From per acre yield, I was to earn Rs 1.20 lakh. Since curfew has been enforced, there is no demand in the market as shops have been shut and marriage functions deferred,” said 65-year-old Balwinder Singh, who had grown flowers over 2.5 acres. Balwinder has now tilled the flower plants, which had just started blooming, in his fields and has transplanted maize. He said he has suffered a loss of around Rs 2.5 lakh.Lakhwinder Singh, 60, and Ajit Singh, 65, of the same village have also destroyed flower plants in their one-acre and two-acre fields respectively. Balwinder said the 10 farmers in the village had grown flowers over around 15 acres of land. “Most of them have destroyed their grown flower plants,” he said. Lakhwinder said, “We had already been facing losses due to the untimely rain and hailstorm this season. The coronavirus has now hit us hard. We are forced to destroy our flowers as most of the temples are now closed for devotees and the demand for flowers in gurdwaras has also dipped drastically.”State convener of Kisan Sangharsh Committee Satnam Singh Pannu said the situation of floriculture farmers across Punjab is the same as in the Jagatpura village. “The state government should announce a package for flower growers in the state,” he said.Joint director, horticulture, Gulab Singh Gill said flower growers in the state have been facing problem due to the ban on celebrations in hotels, marriage palaces, and organisation of religious functions. “Growers are demanding compensation. A report about the situation will soon be sent to the government in this regard,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/floriculture-crisis-no-demand-growers-forced-to-destroy-flowers-in-their-fields/story-ghTsTrgr3WaLM6TmaljpKP.html

The accused has been arrested.The injured cops have been identified as assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Saroop Singh (52) and home guard Rashap Singh (51) posted at the Nurmahal police station.According to the police, the cops were going on a motorcycle when the accused, Des Raj, threw a petrol bottle on them, a day after he was confronted by the police over roaming on the road. Superintendent of police (Investigation) Sarabjit Singh said preliminary investigations revealed that the accused got influenced from a movie scene and was reportedly under stress.“The accused is a daily wager. He filled the petrol in a beer bottle and threw it on the cops. The exact cause behind the attack will be ascertained in the investigations. He will be medically examined,” the SP said.The SP said the cops sustained 20% burns on their bodies and are undergoing treatment at a government hospital where their condition is stated to be stable. Meanwhile, the accused was arrested under Section 307 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) of the IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-held-for-attacking-cops-with-petrol-bomb-in-jalandhar/story-41XAnEmTbNtyzeUGNilrMJ.html

When the lockdown came into force, none of them knew how to fly back. Many of them don’t know how to get curfew passes issued from the authorities online. We are helping them for their smooth and safe return.”“We have been trying to book chartered planes for Canadian citizens hailing from Punjab for the last fortnight. We even negotiated the price of a chartered plane with some companies that are willing to fly out of the Chandigarh or Amritsar international airports. As the Canadian High Commission issued clearance for this today with the intervention of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), a glimmer of hope has emerged for a direct flight from Punjab at an affordable price,” he said.He said the Punjab government has even offered to provide buses for transportation of the NRIs to airports.The role of Canadian ministers and MPs of Punjab origin, who are 19 in number, has been far from satisfactory in helping these people, he added.Sukhi Sandhu, a Punjabi community activist in Canada, said, “The Canadian government is duty-bound to help its citizens in any eventuality anywhere in the world. To our surprise, none of them bothered to respond to our calls, emails, Facebook posts or tweets.”Colonel (retired) Gurnam Singh, an overseas Canadian citizen from Mohali who along with his wife came to India in October 2019, says, “We got registered on an official online portal of the Canadian High Commission. But nothing concrete has happened so far.”Moreover, many found the already operational special flights too expensive.The first flight from Delhi to Toronto on April 4 cost 3,988 Canadian dollars per passenger. For those flying to Vancouver in the same flight were charged 4,262 Canadian dollars. More flights are departing from the Amritsar airport via New Delhi on Tuesday and Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-blues-thousands-of-canada-based-nris-wanting-to-fly-back-stuck-in-punjab/story-gNT3YcquomhsinGKXSZepM.html

Police too put in diversions in place across the city in order to facilitate movement of people to the areas on that particular day. However, considering the Covid-19 pandemic, leaders have asked people to celebrate the birth anniversary at home.RPI leader and Union minister for social justice Ramdas Athwale issued a press statement, saying, “Considering the present situation, citizens must remain at home. If people come out to celebrate and do not follow social distancing norms, it would create problems. Residents can hoist a flag at their homes on the 14th and prepare sweets and celebrate it indoors. Many festivals too have been cancelled during this period and hence, it is necessary to cancel the rallies and marches on April 14.”Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar also appealed to the residents through social media to celebrate the birth anniversary at homes. Mahila Utkarsha Prathishthan’s Utkarsha Shelke said,“The birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar should be celebrated by reading books. During this lockdown, it would be better to remain at home and read the books written by Dr Ambedkar. Activists can circulate such literature on social media so that people can read it on their mobile phones.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/celebrate-dr-ambedkar-s-birth-anniversary-on-apr-14-by-staying-at-home-reading-books-written-by-him-leaders/story-aciW4tDqByn1JbBc0njL9I.html

This is because the main contributing states, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, and parts of south India are badly affected due to the coronavirus crisis.The association has demanded that the relief package should cover water, electricity, sewerage cess and garbage collection fees, besides property tax and demand charges by state power board.Apart from this, the body has asked the government to consider liberal working capital limits, term loans and enhancement of existing limits with nominal rate of interest.“The country-wide lockdown due to Covid-19 ahead of summer has dealt a blow to the tourism industry which is dependent on seasonal business. The sustainability of tourism units – hotels, travel agents, restaurants, taxi operators – is hanging in the balance as 100 % bookings for the coming season have been cancelled,” said Seth.There has been a steep decline in the inflow of tourists and hotel occupancy suffered further due to online travel companies offering accommodation for as low as ₹400 to ₹500 per day. Due to this, the hotel industry had to fill the gap of operational costs of their units either by raising loans or by liquidating their deposits. More than 95% of tourism units in the state are small and medium enterprises. These units hardly have any cash reserves to ensure payment of staff salary, electricity and water bills, taxes, loan interest, rent, insurances and repair and maintenance costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-tourism-industry-demands-special-package-to-cope-amid-lockdown/story-c3gyvicSCQCmZiBvfYh87L.html

The isolation coaches will be moved to such areas.“Once prepared, the coaches can be moved to rural areas which lack proper medical facilities so that more people will be benefitted,” a Railway Board official said.Of the 20,000 isolation coaches, the Central and Western Railways will be converting 942 into isolation wards, of which 652 coaches will be available for Maharashtra. Central and Western Railways are identifying rural locations in the state where the coaches can be moved. However, the Central Railway (CR) plans to retain some coaches for the city. The coaches are being converted into isolation wards at Matunga and Lower Parel workshops, as well as at Wadi Bunder, Bandra Terminus and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) railway depots in the city.“We are discussing and finalising a plan. The coaches are being converted but we plan to keep few coaches for Mumbai in case the cases surge further,” said a senior CR official.The railway ministry has also directed all the railway zones to ensure that every bed has an oxygen cylinder next to it, the toilets are clean, there is adequate distance between the beds, and enclosed reception counters with microphone and speakers are provided, along with other facilities, in all isolation ward coaches.The ministry has asked the railway zones to tie-up with all state governments and hospitals and provide the isolation ward coaches for interim duration to handle coronavirus patients.Meanwhile, the Central and Western Railways have also started making masks and protective equipment for its employees. CR has made 2,830 masks, while Western Railway (WR) has produced more than 1,000. The railways has also begun manufacturing of coverall suits. Zonal railways will also commence manufacturing of coverall suits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/railways-isolation-coaches-likely-to-be-moved-to-rural-areas/story-WdNNtXJa9Uj6CWYMTqGrzM.html

Many women who do cooking and cleaning work in the apartments are now left to fend for themselves, as they have not received salaries from their employers after the lockdown was announced.“They have been out of work for a month now and while some people have given them their salaries, many others have denied giving them any money, as they have not been able to work. This has put many of them in a very difficult situation as they barely have money to buy food and essentials,” said Surendra Bansode, a city-based activist who works for the welfare of domestic workers.Neelam Jirve, who lost her husband to tuberculosis last week, travels from Vasai to Prabhadevi every day where she cooks in five households. With two children to fend for, Jirve is having a tough time making ends meet. “The people with whom I work have agreed to give me my salary, but there is no way I can collect it from them under this lockdown. They asked if they could transfer the money online, but I have no bank account or debit card for the same,” she added.Bansode said that while some NGOs and voluntary organisations are helping them with food, there is a lot of uncertainty about the coming days. “If they go out of their homes, they won’t be paid in the coming months. It is going to be an uphill battle,” he added. “There is so much uncertainty. We don’t know when the lockdown will be lifted,” said a 38-year-old woman who works as a house help in Borivli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-domestic-workers-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-as-families-refuse-to-pay/story-aB6zzwdUyQYnivAJoCMtEJ.html

06-04-2020||City||Cancellation due to lockdown: Govt should step in to help consumers get full refund||It’s really unfortunate that the aviation and hospitality sectors are refusing to return consumers’ money, following cancellation of bookings caused by the unprecedented three-week countrywide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Ironically, as far as airlines are concerned, consumers did not even have to make the cancellation. All flights were cancelled by the airlines themselves, following the government’s decision to suspend all domestic passenger flights from the midnight of March 24, 2020. Yet, they are unwilling to refund the amount and want consumers to re-schedule their travel plans. The only concession that they are offering is waiver of re-scheduling charges! But there is a catch here too – the re-scheduling has to be done within a particular time frame – some are offering credit notes valid for a limited period. But that’s not all – if the rescheduled tickets are higher than what is paid for, then the consumer has to bear the additional burden! This is totally unfair, particularly in these uncertain times when nobody really knows when the pandemic will come under control and one can travel without the fear of catching the infection. So for all you know, the ‘credit notes’ may well expire without the consumer making that trip. Besides, once the airlines begin their operations, the demand for travel will be so high that the fares are bound to skyrocket. So eventually, consumer is the loser! Consumers are getting a raw deal from the hospitality industry too. Many hotels are pointing to their terms and conditions to collect hefty charges from consumers for cancellation. If you want to escape such penalty, you can re-schedule your booking, but here again, if the room charges are higher during that period, you have to pay the difference. Consumers feel that they are being penalized for no fault of theirs. Ram Prasad, for example, was part of a 25-member group that planned an engineering college reunion at a holiday resort in Karnataka. Since it was a large booking, the hotel wanted in advance, 50% of the room charges. Following the lockdown, the group cancelled the booking. But the hotel is refusing to return the money and asking them to re-schedule their trip, within a certain specified period. Here too, there’s a condition attached to it -- that the group will pay higher charges if the room rents have gone up. The group does not want to reschedule because it is not easy for so many to come together, given their work schedules. Besides, many in the group are entrepreneurs, who have been hit hard financially by the lockdown and are not interested in the reunion anymore and want their money back. Prasad and his group are not alone. Many hotels are pointing to the terms and conditions of booking and refusing to refund the money on cancellation. First of all, these are standard terms and conditions which can be challenged if they are unfair and also if the hotel never brought them to the notice of the consumer at the time of booking. But more important, here the cancellation has been done under exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the consumer. In fact, the consumer is forced to stay home, by law, on account of the lockdown declared by the government (and also to prevent the spread of the coronavirus) and given this situation, hotels cannot enforce their terms and conditions, even if the consumer had seen them, agreed to them and signed on them.Consumers can go to the consumer courts on these issues, but considering the extraordinary and unparalleled circumstances, the government should step in and ensure that consumers get the full refund, without their having to wage a long legal battle.

This time, we had decided to immerse the ashes on April 12, one day before Baisakhi. However, we will wait till the lockdown is lifted,” said Raj Kumar Arora, a member of the organisation. Karnal deputy commissioner (DC) Nishant Yadav said, “Nobody is allowed to cross the border. In fact, the ghats at Haridwar are also shut. People could keep the ashes with them and could immerse them later.”On asking if any movement pass is being issued for the purpose, the DC said, “We have no problem in issuing passes for movement within the state. But, crossing the border is prohibited. It’s better for the families to wait.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/death-in-times-of-lockdown-ashes-of-dead-piling-up-at-haryana-cremation-grounds/story-KEeKDydUd0QVU4drC5jJOM.html
06-04-2020||Pune||War against Covid-19 myths has Pune scientists helping world keep it real||Under the umbrella of Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 (ISRC), a team of scientists, graphic designers and translators from around the country have also come together to bust myths, hoaxes and superstitions surrounding the virus. Professor and astronomer Surhad More from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Iucaa) has developed software to translate from text to images, the information regarding Covid-19 (coronavirus) that is being collated from all around the globe. These images are being “translated” into 16 different languages.“We are group of scientists, collectively trying to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, this involves trying to burst myths on social media, trying to take the data, and go through newly available literature how they can be used to inform the public, part of the motivation having behind the group,” said More.The group aims to communicate evidence-based scientific understanding to the society in times of uncertainty.In a statement issued on Saturday, R Ramanujam, theoretical computer scientist at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, and coordinator of the ISRC, said, that the group started with about 10 and now has 400 scientists, engineers, social scientists and journalists from different parts of India. “A nanometre sized virus has brought the world to its heels. For the person on the street, this is hard to fathom. Our group not only tries to debunk the hoaxes that are going viral but is also spreading general scientific awareness by various other means. This is critical since the success of measures coming from the government depends on citizens playing their role rationally,” he said.Biologist Sandhya Koushika of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research always wanted to be a part of the something that clears misunderstandings about Covid-19 in simple language. “ISRC’s grassroots effort has brought together knowledgeable and enthusiastic people invested in the same goals. Coordinating the hoax busting team has been rewarding,” she said.Myths bustedThere is no evidence to suggest mosquitoes transmit the Sars-Cov-2 according to the ISRC hoax busters. It is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. Several astrologers and spiritual masters have claimed that the calendar followed by the spread of coronavirus follows a certain pattern that can be predicted by astrology. Countering this claim the hoax busters have released social media material making it clear that the motion of planets do not impact human bodies and tiny microorganisms. Moreover, they say, there is no evidence of any influence of eclipses and calendrical objects like Nakshatra and Rahu on human life. There is no connection, whatsoever, between astrological beliefs and the spread of epidemics, they warn.How to access?The hoax busting messages in English and 14 Indian languages are available at the ISRC group website: https://indscicov.in/busting-hoaxes/. The short and simple social media messages are available for downloading and sharing freely and have been designed in collaboration with the Association of Designers of India. The website also hosts detailed responses with additional references to scientific evidence and technical manuscripts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/war-against-covid-10-myths-has-pune-scientists-helping-world-keep-it-real/story-4ntkJ8hZixrLDTOQNUvT0O.html
06-04-2020||City||Covid-19 ‘safety station’ set up at Sangrur before wheat procurement||A coronavirus ‘safety station’ has been set up at the local administrative complex for sanitisation of farmers, commission agents, labour force and administration officials before the wheat procurement season.Though this station is part of the district administration’s pilot project, more will be set up soon, said Ghanshyam Thori, deputy commissioner.Heavy footfall was likely at the grain markets with wheat arrivals expected from April 10 and it was necessary to ensure the safety of farmers and others involved in the process, Thori said.Sangrur contributes more than 10% wheat share in Punjab’s basket.A four-step process will be followed to sanitise people passing through the station: First, an infrared thermal scanner will record the person’s temperature. Those with fever will be sent to the Civil Hospital’s flu centre. The next step includes washing hands in a basin with foot-operated taps. Then a concentrated sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution mixture will be sprayed on the person, who will then go into a booth with ceiling fans and hand dryers to “dry up.”“Hands and clothes will be dried without towel use as that can increase the risk of contamination. The safety system can easily sanitise four to five persons in a minute,” Thori added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-safety-station-set-up-at-sangrur-before-wheat-procurement/story-AwQFSghEFO7LeCGa0lGERL.html
06-04-2020||City||Shimla under lockdown, hungry monkeys head for villages, forests||Wild animals, such as leopards, sambars and even elephants, are roaming the streets of locked down cities like Chandigarh and Dehradun these days but Shimla has a different tale to tell.Twelve days into the lockdown effected to check the spread of the coronavirus disease, and Shimla, which is home to an estimated 1,900 monkeys, is seeing the simians shifting base back to forests and periphery villages.Shimla divisional forest officer, wildlife, Rajesh Sharma, says, “This is a temporary phase. They will be back once the hustle-bustle of the town returns. Over the years, the monkeys developed commensal habits by feeding on garbage, street-food waste and raiding homes. With shops, restaurants and eateries closed for almost a fortnight, their source of food has depleted.”Commensalism is a long-term biological interaction in which members of one species gain benefits, while those of the other species neither benefit nor are harmed.Of the simians, most langoors have headed back to the forest in search of food, while most monkeys have chosen to settle down in villages on Shimla’s outskirts. In the forest, monkeys become omnivores, feeding on rats and insects but in cities, they develop commensal habits, living off hand-me-downs and left-overs.MISSING FROM JAKHU!It’s strange to visit the Hanuman Temple in Shimla’s Jakhu Hills without monkeys for company. The temple priest, who performs the rituals in the absence of devotees these days, says he has never come across such a sight in his four decades at the temple.“At any given time, about 500 monkeys would roam in and around the Jakhu temple but now they have simply vanished,” says Anil Thakur, who stays near the temple and runs a travel business.The monkeys have made their way to the nearby jungle.CHALLENGE FOR FARMERSThe monkeys that frequented the Sankat Mochan temple at the entry of Shimla town have taken refuge in Rajhana village and adjoining Anandpur panchayat of 12 villages. Farmers are worried as the simians tend to feed on seasonal vegetable crops of pea, cauliflower, cabbage, radish and carrot.“These monkeys are now finding it difficult to survive. I have noticed a behavioural change in them. While most of them have shifted from Shimla town to the rural areas, those who chose to stay behind are turning aggressive,” says retired forest officer Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, who also heads the Kisan Sabha, a conglomerate of farmer bodies that ran a statewide campaign against the growing wild animal problem.VIRUS DOES WHAT GOVT COULDN’TFor three decades, the wildlife wing of the forest department struggled to curb the growing monkey population across the state, particularly in Shimla, but in vain.Besides the sterilisation drive, primate parks were set up, food zones for monkeys were notified, and even monkey watchers, armed with air guns and catapults, were appointed to scare the simians away but nothing worked.The monkeys are a problem in several localities such as Chhota Shimla, Jakhu, Sanjauli, Lower Bazaar, Brockhurst, Khalini, Annandale, Kaithu, Summer Hill, Boileauganj, Porters Hill, Observatory Hill, Lower and Main Mall Road.In 2016, the state government urged the Centre to declare monkeys vermin in Shimla and a notification was issued that allowed state forest authorities and people to cull monkeys but it never took off as simians are venerated in honour of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shimla-under-lockdown-hungry-monkeys-head-for-villages-forests/story-2HypP627pBShJJ0vRWJguI.html
06-04-2020||Mumbai||Provide facilities for migrants as per SC ensure steps to control virus spread: HC to Aurangabad administration||Taking cognisance of the plight of 50-60 labourers who despite having been accommodated at a zilla parishad school are not getting proper facilities, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Aurangabad administration to take the help of voluntary organisations to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court (SC) on the issue of migrants. These labourers were sheltered in the school after they were stopped by the police when they were walking to their homes in Madhya Pradesh from various areas in Aurangabad.The court also directed the administration to investigate a message on social media that some foreigners were receiving treatment for Covid-19 in a private clinic and ensure that proper measures are initiated to avoid spread of the virus in the city.After news reports on the plight of the labourers sheltered at the school came to light, the bench of justice Prasanna Varale took up suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) to address the issue. While referring to the news reports, the court observed that though the mirgrants had been provided with food, the administration was not following the guidelines directed by the SC and the central government, and hence the authorities should rope in voluntary organisations for providing proper facilities to the labourers.The bench also admonished the Aurangabad municipal corporation for not taking cognisance of the message on social media which stated that some foreign nationals were receiving treatment for the Covid-19 virus in a private clinic. The court directed the authorities to investigate the message and if it was found to be true to take measures to contain the spread of the virus in the city.Referring to a report of health workers being pelted with stones in Indore, the bench directed the administrators to apply the provisions of the National Security Act if such an incident were to take place in Aurangabad. The bench however, added that to avoid imposing the stringent National Security Act, the administration should rope in reputed organisations and individuals to create awareness among the masses and avert a repeat of the Indore incident.The PIL was then posted for further hearing on Wednesday for which the administration, police and corporation were asked to make statements about their respective actions and measures initiated by them to contain the spread of the virus. The bench also appointed advocate Amol Joshi as amicus curiae to get first-hand information on the condition of the labourers and file a petition thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/provide-facilities-for-migrants-as-per-sc-ensure-steps-to-control-virus-spread-hc-to-aurangabad-administration/story-8URCvxuvOz3wm5VzmlfLgN.html
06-04-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Our best option is to stay safe, stay positive||A 12-year-old child I know has happily taken to doing the dishes with her dad after he showed her how it is done “the American way.” It’s far more efficient and effortless as compared to the Indian way and it’s become quite a fun thing to do.Since the domestic help is on a paid leave during the period of the national lockdown, she also helps with mopping the floor, operates the washing machine, and is learning to cook with her aunt and writing down those recipes.Life under the lockdown is boring without being able to go down to play with her friends; but on the brighter side, there are many fun things to do: do her favourite activities such as painting and sketching, continue with her Djembe classes over the Zoom app, watch movies and read books. She detests the television because of the dark clouds of Covid-19 over the entire world. The only option before us is to stay safe and stay positive, locked-up as we are in our homes during the lockdown. By now, almost everyone- upwards from the milkman and the newspaper vendor- is following safety precautions: masks are being used, hands are being washed with soap, physical distance is being maintained and we are largely staying indoors to contain the virus. Dealing with our mental state, especially with children and the elderly in the family is also a big challenge that needs to be addressed effectively. Two mental health experts from Maharashtra have made valuable suggestions: Dr Bhooshan Shukla advised in a tweet against TV watching to deal with the anxiety, alarm and sensation that is created by the news channels. Another mental health expert, Dr Anand Nadkarni, spoke at length in an interaction on the Marathi news channel, ABP Mazha on how families can stay mentally fit and positive during this lockdown. Learn to do new things, become creative and participate joyously in household chores such as washing vessels and cutting vegetables; let children do things on their own; give them the freedom to make a mess with their clay, paints or toys, and join them to clear the mess, he suggested. Since family members are spending the entire day in each other’s company, it’s a good time to become nostalgic about the past, he advised. This is particularly emotionally satisfying for our elderly parents and grandparents, he advised. Be flexible and accommodative with one another and let there be a sense of humour in our interactions. Let us be more accepting of ourselves and others. We can deal with our fears and anxiety by focusing on doing what is in our control, he advised. Finally, our objective should be to learn from this experience and come out as emotionally stronger human beings. The guidance from health experts on the safety measures against Covid-19, and the guidance from mental health experts on effectively dealing with this crisis as a family, are the only two pieces of advice that we need at the moment, I think.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-our-best-option-is-to-stay-safe-stay-positive/story-AypCk3EGR5xF0ze7KArlgP.html
06-04-2020||City||Coronavirus outbreak: Mumbai to get fever detection thermal cameras||The city may soon see fever detection thermal cameras installed in various areas, as part of the surveillance gear to tackle the spread of the coronavirus.The Mumbai Police are conducting trials for installation of the cameras, which will detect individuals with high body temperatures. The aim is to find suspected virus carriers. The home ministry said discussions on the implementation in Mumbai are on, after which a decision on replicating it same in other cities, if required, would be taken.Home minister Anil Deshmukh told HT: “For fever detection thermal cameras, we are in talks with Larsen & Toubro. L&T, along with the Mumbai Police, is working out ways to implement this technology here. The thermal cameras can help detect high body temperature, talks on the best possible locations are on.”Deshmukh added, “There is a shortage of several equipment and material, and for this, we are working with several stakeholders from various industries. We are taking help from the industries to help us tackle shortage of masks, ventilators and personal protective equipment. Globally, several bodies involved in defence manufacturing are also getting involved in manufacturing equipment required to deal with the coronavirus.”An individual who is likely to have the coronavirus shows symptoms such as fever, coughing, and breathlessness. However, many Covid-19 positive patients don’t show the symptoms because their immunity can stave off the infection, even though they are carrying the virus. Fever detection cameras have been used in China and several other countries. In China, security agencies also wear smart glasses, which help them ascertain the temperature of individuals from a certain distance.SN Subrahmanyan, CEO & MD, Larsen & Toubro, said, “L&T Smart World Communication has been working with various city administrations and state governments to effectively manage complex civic functions in metropolitan cities.” In Mumbai, L&T has been working on installation and operation of CCTVs along with the BMC’s Disaster Management Cell. The CCTVs and video analytics are being used to monitor 241 containment zones in the city, where positive cases have been ascertained.In a statement, L&T said it is helping the authorities combat Covid-19 through drone-based surveillance to keep eye on crowd formation and fever detection using thermal cameras at Mumbai. Between March 22, 2020 and April 03, Mumbai Police’s control room got 246 alerts of crowd gathering in the city, with 15-30 alerts daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-outbreak-mumbai-to-get-fever-detection-thermal-cameras/story-GJDLRpJUZVTW20HKOrgXzO.html

No one knows how to cook so they struggle every day to make meals. However, they still support me because they know these destitute children need me more than they do,” says Kumari.The four shelter homes have over 300 children. As the lockdown was announced to curb the spread of coronavirus the UT social welfare department requested the caretakers to start living in shelter homes and work for 12 hours instead of eight.Caretakers camping in the shelter homes include nine out of 37 housemothers with three cooking staff at Snehalaya girls and Aashiana. Out of 25 caretakers, four housemothers and three housefathers stayed at Snehalaya boys from March 24 to March 31.“We are like the children’s parents and take care of their bathing, bedding, feeding and school work,” says 40-year-old Naresh.Pia, 15 (name changed), an orphan living in Snehalaya girls, says “I feel secure that the housemothers are living with us. I am happy that they don’t go out as this can be dangerous for them as well. Meri apni family nahi hai, jo hai bas yahi hai. (I don’t have my own family; they are all I have).”Aishwarya, 17 (name changed), is grateful to the caretakers. “My housemother helps me with my studies, my clothes, my hair and my hobbies. She tells me to wash my hands regularly and to wear a mask. She also told informed me about coronavirus.”About staying connected to her family, Praveen Kumari, 41, says, “My husband, son, mother and father-in-law are at home. We keep video calling each other through the day. My husband is very supportive. He is taking care of everyone at home.”Yashpal Garg, secretary, social welfare, says looking after the children “is our responsibility. We are also emotionally connected with the kids. It is just like our extended family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-lockdown-caretakers-at-snehalaya-chandigarh-become-fathers-and-mothers-for-destitute-children/story-aDP42vbh0pwaR5XR6462fK.html
06-04-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow: Cantt core army area ‘complete lockdown’ brings life to standstill||The ‘complete lockdown’ in Lucknow Cantonment’s core army area brought life to a standstill on Sunday. Not only the army personnel were affected, but the move badly affected the population of more than 50,000 civilians residing in, and nearby, the core area.The Central Command had announced a ‘complete lockdown’ on Saturday, a day after 12 persons were found coronavirus positive in Kasaibada locality of Sadar area in Cantonment, which is near the army core area.Though emergency services and supply of essential goods like milk and vegetables were excluded from the 48-hour lockdown (from Saturday midnight to Monday midnight), the civilians of the area termed it even worse than curfew.Other than the core army area, areas like Tope Khana, Rajman Bazaar, Bahadur Shah Road, Kastoorba Road, Sardar Patel Road, Subhash Marg, some parts of Nehru Road, Sanjog Kshetra Vihar Colony, Nirbhay Vihar Colony etc were affected by the lockdown.“The population of around 50,000 to 80,000, largely civilians, got badly affected during the lockdown that was initiated without giving prior information,” said Pramod Sharma, former vice chairman, Cantonment Board, and present member of the board.Sharma, who resides in Tope Khana Bazaar area, said fearing the complete lockdown, the shop owners dealing in essential goods and groceries who used to open their shops during the national lockdown, didn’t turn up to open their shops.“Not a single shop opened today (Sunday), be it medical store, grocery shop or those dealing in milk, bread, eggs etc. The market remained completely closed,” added Sharma.He said the army should at least allow movement of locals, including families of defence personnel, till nearby vegetable markets. Some civilians called it even worse than curfew as most of them were not even allowed to move out of their houses to but medicines from medical stores. Some locals also blamed army personnel for restricting their movement within the colony premises. “We were asked to stay indoors. Two army personnel took control of the colony gate and asked us to stay indoors. They also restricted the entry of cleaning staff,” a resident of Nirbhay Vihar Colony said.Defence officials said the decision was taken as a precautionary measure, which is part of the exercises that are being conducted pan-India to reduce contact with civilians and outer environment after the coronavirus outbreak.Under the move, some practices like banning the entry of civilians into unit lines, sanitising persons and vehicles, distancing oneself from individuals and limiting interaction are being followed across the country to check ‘contamination’ among soldiers.Gargi Malik, public relations officer (PRO), defence, said, “No curfew has been imposed in Cantonment area. Yes, there is a ‘complete lockdown’ in Cantonment since March 25, except for essential services. And following the detection of coronavirus positive cases in Sadar, it has been declared ‘out of bounds’ for army personnel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lucknow-cantt-core-army-area-complete-lockdown-brings-life-to-standstill/story-mHwUeI5AGgWWIqye5KKS2N.html
06-04-2020||Lucknow||Sadar Bazaar Lucknow ‘out of bounds’ for armymen||The Central Command Headquarters on Sunday declared Sadar Bazaar ‘out of bounds’ for army personnel, terming it ‘unsafe’ for them. The area will remain ‘out of bounds’ for the armymen of all ranks till further orders.The Central Command’s move comes two days after 12 Tablighi Jamaat members, who were camping in a mosque in the area, tested coronavirus positive.“In the wake of the frequent coronavirus cases from Sadar Bazaar area, the area has been declared ‘out of bounds’ for the soldiers,” said Gargi Malik, public relations officer (PRO), defence, Lucknow.“In military terms order of ‘out of bounds’ is generally passed to restrict movement of troops, temporarily or permanently, into an area where they are not supposed to go. It could be for an area, the exposure to which is not good for the soldiers. It’s like protecting our troops from falling prey to any social evil, mentally or physically,” said lieutenant general RP Shahi, chief of staff (retired), Central Command.Central Command officials, meanwhile, said the ‘out of bounds’ order is an outcome of a pan-India exercise of the army that aims at cutting down the chances of the disease infecting the troops. “And declaring Sadar Bazaar area ‘out of bounds’ is part of the same exercise under which efforts are being made to reduce contact of army personnel with civilians,” an official, who didn’t wish to be named, said.Sadar Bazaar, one of the oldest general markets in Cantonment area, is also nearest to the core army area. Some locals said Sadar, being the biggest market, used to be the most preferred places for the defence personnel, who often used to visit the market to make brisk purchases of vegetables, fruits, milk, medicines, electronic goods and groceries. But apprehending the possibility of army personnel getting infected with coronavirus, the area has been declared ‘out of bounds’ for them.This is not the first time that an area has been declared ‘out of bounds’ for soldiers. Similar orders have been issue in the past too.Some retired defence personnel said it was around four years’ back that Tope Khana Bazaar -- another prominent market in Cantonment area -- was declared ‘out of bounds’ for soldiers after some financial ‘issue arose between a group of army personnel and shopkeepers. Similarly, they said, areas especially some colonies surrounding Cantonment Race Course, which were infamous for selling of illicit liquor and even flesh trade, were also declared ‘out of bounds’ for the soldiers almost a decade back. They said this is a British era norm that is often enforced from time to time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/sadar-bazaar-lucknow-out-of-bounds-for-armymen/story-IiLZ7KYsrntGTQbsuKuNRL.html
06-04-2020||Lucknow||Lock-down impact: Zoo carnivores forced to eat frozen meat||The pan-India lock-down to contain spread of Sars-Cov-2 has not only brought human life to grinding halt but also adversely affected animals, both strays and caged.The carnivorous inmates of the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden in Lucknow are forced to feed on frozen meat instead of fresh, which they got earlier.Zoo officials said the lockdown had badly affected the supplies of fruits, veggies, fodder and meat to the zoo that houses 1,000 animals, including birds and reptiles. The zoo authorities managed to restore the supplies of fodder, vegetables and fruits since the local markets are allowed to operate during lockdown. But the supply of meat is yet to be restored to normal.Of the total animals lodged in the zoo, around 45 are carnivorous. Zoo officials said around 200 kg meat per day was needed to feed the animals once. But the supply first got disrupted on March 22, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the ‘Janata Curfew’ call to laud the efforts of medics. “On that day, we somehow managed. But a day after (on March 23) the UP government announced three-day-lockdown (till March 25) in around 16 districts of Uttar Pradesh to contain the virus outbreak and a day later the PM announced the national lock-down. Hence all the local meat suppliers refused to meet the whopping demand of 200kg meat a day.“It was a panic situation for us. We tried contacting a few slaughterhouses in neighbouring districts. In Unnao we finally found a slaughterhouse which agreed to supply us frozen meat. It indeed turned out to be a saviour,” said RK Singh, zoo director.Some officials said the effect of feeding on frozen meat was quite visible on the animals also . Mubarak Ali, one of the oldest zoo staffers who has been feeding carnivores for almost 30 years now, too believes the same. Some officials said, “Unlike previous days when the fresh meat used to be served, the animals, eating frozen meat, no more greet the feeders with excitement.”Apart from the ‘meat crisis’, financial issues are an added problem. “Ours is not a state government zoo. It’s managed by the Prince of Wales Zoological Garden Trust and we solely depend upon the ticket income. But following the lock-down, our income came to a standstill. The director said following the closure of the zoo it had become difficult to pay the salaries of the staff. “We pay around Rs 55 lakh as salary and spend Rs 35 lakh on food and repairs every month. Hence it would be tough for us to survive if the condition persists,” he added.As per historians, Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden was initially a zoological park and was established on November 29, 1921 in order to commemorate the arrival of the Prince of Wales to Lucknow.“The park was conceived by the then Governor Sir Harcourt Butler and the complex was established in the 18th century by Nawab Nasiruddin Haider, the then nawab of Oudh. Initially, it was known as Banarasi Bagh and the Nawabs of spent their leisure time amid lush greenery,” said Padmashree Yogesh Praveen, a noted historian.During the British rule, the nobility spent their evenings here, added Praveen. The zoo records suggest that the park was established between 1921 to 1926, comprising 26 buildings, at the total cost of Rs 2,08,800. In 1966, its administrative control was given to the forest department and the advisory was reorganized and the principal secretary, forest and chief wildlife guardian was made the administrator of this advisory. In 2001, the zoological park was changed from ‘Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens Trust’ to Lucknow Zoological Garden. The zoo management said it would approach the chief minister, demanding adequate meat supply to feed the animals. “This is the only option left with us to save our zoo,” officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lock-down-impact-zoo-carnivores-forced-to-eat-frozen-meat/story-EhSeQ49i8Sz3DZUyUWdMaM.html

They come to us in Delhi for a very short while tied in bunches with a bit of a twine.

06-04-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The call of duty||Shobha Devi pleaded, cajoled and finally started crying, asking him not to leave the house. She also reminded her husband that “Modiji”, the prime minister himself, had asked the citizens not to step out of the “Lakshman Rekha” of home during the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Shailesh Singh, 35, understood his wife’s anxieties but left nevertheless, with a heavy heart, to perform his duty. A security officer in a Gurugram apartment complex, “I could not sit at home and let my colleagues on their own… I have several guards working under me... where would they find motivation if I stayed home?”One early morning, Mr Singh is talking on WhatsApp from the grounds of the said apartment complex—the picture is taken through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter. In a smoothly flowing Hindi, the soft-spoken man explains that he, along with other security staff, is stationed 24/7 in the apartment complex. “We guards cook our meals together.” He adds that the housing complex’s resident welfare association is “providing our rations and the caring board members are looking after us like their own children.”Though his family is staying only a few miles away, in a house they rent in Sainik Khera village, Mr Singh isn’t going to meet them for the time being “just in case I have the virus — I don’t want to pass it on to them.”This has been a sensitive time at work. “We don’t let anyone without a mask and we are taking the temperature of everyone entering or leaving the complex.”Mr Singh admits he feels scared of catching the infection himself. “The nature of the job is such that you have to come into close contact with so many people... and though we are taking all precautions, there is always a risk of the virus getting to you in a way or another.”He however takes pains not to discuss such insecurities with his wife, with whom he exchanges phone calls at least a few times a day “for I don’t want to add to her tensions.” Before he left the house on the eve of the lockdown, Mr Singh bought Shobha Devi several weeks worth of ration, while “she manages to buy fresh vegetables daily.”His face covered behind a mask, the security guard explains it is the first time he has been away from his wife since their marriage in 2006. “My sons are missing me too.” Aman, 12, often calls him on the mobile and Aryan, 9, says, “Papa, ghar aa jao (come home).”Then there are also worried phone calls from his home town, Gaya, in Bihar. “Bhayya and bhabhi want me to return with the family. I can’t. But we will visit for a holiday, after the lockdown ends.”Duty comes first, Mr Singh repeats. He is not romantic about bravery though, he clarifies. “I’m a human being and I greatly fear for my personal safety.” He also realises the comparative value of a man’s worth. “For people living in the apartment complex, I’m just a part of the security, but for my family I’m the sansar (world).A minute after this chat, he WhatsApps a picture of his “sansar”—wife Shobha Devi and sons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-call-of-duty/story-wObgDRAAw61nFsTe72skSK.html

The governor also expressed regret over the state government not informing him about the steps taken to tackle the deadly virus. “The entire world is fighting this pandemic. This is not the time to hold on to political differences but to forget those and work together as one. “It would have been good had the chief minister attended the recent video conference by the PM. I would request her to work together with the Centre in combating the disease,” he said, while responding to the prime minister appeal to switch off lights at homes at 9 pm.

This is why I have offered myself to any authority/team working to make a vaccine for Sars-Cov-2.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“No new vaccine can be administered without human trial and I am ready to be that first human,” he said.“I do not know exactly who are involved in making a vaccine, but I offer myself for human trial, whether in India or anywhere else, ” said Singh who lives with his father and brother.He has written to the health department, the local MLA and also to Sikh Sangathan in Lucknow in this connection.Asked what inspired him to make the offer, Singh said, “The Sikh community has been known for serving mankind and I am just doing the same.”About the dangers involved in such a trial, he said, “I am well aware of what can happen during a trial. But the cause is much greater than the dangers. I have made up my mind and then expressed such a desire.”He said he was ready to go to any place or country. Asked about the reaction of his family, he said, “I have not yet discussed with them but believe they will not stop me from doing my bit for mankind.”However, medical experts said there were medical and ethical issues to be addressed first.“Such an offer should be appreciated but one has to fulfill medical criteria to prove fitness for a trial. Secondly, there are ethical issues that are looked into by a medical/pharmacology committee of the state and then centre,” said Prof Samir Misra, member of the governing council of the state medical faculty.He said a vaccine was ready for human trial only after animal trial. Hence human trial could not be done directly but if the committee found him fit his offer may be kept in pending for such a trial if it happened in India.“Such a human trial will take a long time as there are many stages for a vaccine to come to human trial,” said Prof Misra, also senior faculty at department of trauma surgery at the King George’s Medical University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kheri-man-offers-to-roll-up-his-sleeve-for-human-trial-of-any-corona-vaccine/story-YBVW2iWYI5GViqqqH64LGK.html
06-04-2020||City||State hedges bets on easing lockdown after April 14||PATNABihar is adopting a wait and watch policy before it firms up plans to ease the lockdown after April 14.Senior health professionals Saturday advised Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar against fully lifting the lockdown, as it would defeat the purpose of containing the fast spreading contagion.“We are closely monitoring the number of Covid-19 cases, which is doubling every 4-5 days in the country. Fortunately, that is not the case in Bihar, where we have 32 cases as of now. We have screened nearly 4,000 foreigners and are now testing domestic travellers. The daily evolution of the infection trail is complex and possibility of exponential growth poses a great challenge. The following week would determine the post lockdown strategies,” said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health.Prataya Amrit, principal secretary, Bihar’s disaster management department, too, said it was too early to comment on easing the lockdown.“We will keep a close watch on hot spots. If cases do not go up, say for example, in Gaya, Siwan, Gopalganj and other districts, having a sizeable migrant population, we may consider easing the lockdown district-wise. If cases are localised in a few blocks, we may even go for block-wise lockdown, while relaxing norms in the district,” said Amrit.Both Amrit and Kumar are members of Bihar’s crisis management team.Of the 32 Covid-19 cases detected so far in Bihar, seven are from Munger, followed by Siwan (6), Patna and Gaya (5 each), Gopalganj (3), Nalanda (2), Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Bhagalpur and Saran with one each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-hedges-bets-on-easing-lockdown-after-april-14/story-2IduNNzPxSi80xRT9bbGyI.html

The eyewitnesses said more than 78 migrants kept in Rajpur middle school in Siwan had demanded their release after test reports declared them negative. Patients were not happy with the facilities, said the eye witnesses.On getting information, the BDO along with police reached the spot and allegedly slapped one of the suspects. Irate over the BDO’s action, they started shouting slogans against the administration and damaged chairs and tables, demanding action against the officer. DGP Gupteshwar Pandey said that he had got the matter examined. “It is not a big issue. Some people wanted to go to the market from the quarantine centre and when they were stopped, they started ransacking the premises. All those involved will face action under the relevant sections of the IPC and national management act. They will have to go to jail after completing their isolation period. There are 70 labourers kept there,” he added.In Munger, more than 35 suspects kept in Goyenka Dharmsala allegedly broke plastic chairs and created nuisance. On getting information Kotwali police reached the spot and pacified the mob.The suspects alleged that on April 1, the Munger administration collected samples from 118 persons and 86 of them were quarantined at GNM School and 35 at Goenka School.An official said that 40 out of 86 were on fast, demanding that the administration should release them after their reports came negative. Nodal officer-cum-district welfare officer Hriday Narayan Das said the Munger administration did not have any order to release them.In Narkatiaganj (West Champaran) and Nalanda, the medical staff had a difficult time when some of the coronavirus suspects created unruly scenes, used vulgar comments and allegedly demanded mutton in food. According to reports from Pawapuri in Nalanda, four persons were detained from Ahiyapur Mosque in Sheikhpura and kept an isolation ward of Vardhaman Institute of Medical Science (Pawapuri). According to the medical staff, the suspects had used vulgar language and spit on them.All of them claimed to be Islamic scholars returning from New Delhi.

06-04-2020||Patna||Bihar’s 4th testing facility at PMCH to start today||For a population of nearly 11.5 crore, Bihar has so far carried out just around 2,700 tests, which comes to barely 0.0023%. Of that, there are just 32 positive cases spread across nine of the 38 districts, with just one death reported and three recoveries. The good news is that few more have also responded well to treatment and could be discharged in the next few days.However, doctors say while recoveries are a positive and confidence-boosting sign, the lower number of tests was a worrying factor in the face of growing risk potential due to return of around 1.80 lakh migrant workers to Bihar, apprehension about missing Tablighi Jamaat attendees, high population density and many people returning from Gulf countries to their native places in Gopalganj, Siwan, Saran and few other districts over the last 20-25 days.Bihar’s health minister Mangal Pandey said the government would increase the capacity of testing and the fourth testing centre at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) would get functional from Monday with the PCR (polymerace chain reaction) kits. Trials are going on at present,” he said.While Rajendra Medical Research Insitute (RLRI) in Patna is a permanent research institute of the ICMR, the Bihar government recently added two more facilities at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). According to sources, one more testing centre, preferably in Bhagalpur, could be set up in view of the growing need.Pandey said the government was alive to the need of greater testing and chief minister Nitish Kumar had also said so during his interaction with health experts on Friday.On the need to go in for vigorous testing with rapid kit tests, as is being done in Kerala, Pandey said the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) had approved it only for the hot spots so far. “We have not got approval for that. But we will augment our own capacity of testing with PCR tests. All need not be tested for COVID-19,” he said.The health minister said that in the first phase, all those who came from abroad till March 18 would be tested and sample collection has been completed to a large extent. “Later, we will screen all migrant workers who have returned and those found with apparent symptoms would undergo PCR test,” he said.Pathologist Dr Prabhat Ranjan, who had written to chief secretary as well as principal secretary (health) for use of starting rapid kit tests, however, said there was a growing need to increase testing in the state and depending only on the costly and cumbersome PCR tests, which could only be performed by trained manpower, was not desirable at this age.Ranjan said the ICMR director general has already written to the health secretary for dissemination of advisory to all states start to rapid antibody-based blood tests for COVID-19 in clusters and gatherings due to large migration. “Overall testing for COVID-19 using RT-PCR is increasing. We will be approaching full capacity in near future. We are expecting delivery of rapid kit tests for use in response to COVID-19 situation,” he said.Padam Shri recipient Dr S N Arya, who was present during the doctors’ interaction with the CM on Saturday, said though there were certain efficacy issues with the rapid kit tests, it was still the best in the prevailing situation, more so due to return of people from abroad, their mingling with local population and delegates from Nijamuddin Markaz.“The government is sincere but the task is mammoth. More testing would be the only way out, but all countries are struggling. Therefore, rapid kit test is the only way out to meet the shortfall of PCR kits and trained manpower. It can help immensely in hot spots,” he said, adding there was also a need not to withdraw lockdown in one go and continue with restrictions in the vulnerable pockets after clearly identifying them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-s-4th-testing-facility-at-pmch-to-start-todayreturn-of-1-80-lakh-migrant-workers-missing-nizamuddin-attendees-dense-population-fuel-fears/story-qqlwjI4OL2cARn8UTou1xO.html

We would wait for 48 hours for police action and after that we would decide the course for safety,” said Dr Anurag Srivastava, secretary IMA.JHSA president Dr AK Chaudhary, secretary Dr Uttam Kumar, Referral Hospital incharge Dr Jitendra Singh and Dr Nitish Chaudhary were members of the delegation.The incident took place around 7.30 pm on Saturday. Rattled by the incident, the doctors and nursing staffers of the hospital stopped their duty and sat on a dharna on the gate of the hospital, demanding arrest of the JMM leaders.Hearing the incident, deputy superintendent of police (headquarter), Satish Chandra Jha, BDO Shashibhushan Sharma and nspector Md Rustam reached the spot . After filing an FIR, the doctors and nurses resumed the duty.Dr Ranjan said the JMM leader came for a BP test for the second time in the evening. “When I asked to wait, he lost his patience and hurled abuses loudly. As I protested, he started thrashing me. They also assaulted the nurses and other health staffers who had come to rescue me,” said Dr Ranjan.However, JMM district president Hiralal Majhi denied charge and said only a heated discussion had taken place.“Pankaj had gone to the hospital for a test in the evening. But the doctors refused to do, saying that ‘at night, they do not conduct any BP test’. On this, an altercation took place. It is false charge that Pankaj had beaten anyone,” said the JMM president and added that “doctors should not make such a small incident an issue”. IMA secretary Dr Srivastava said: “In such pandemic situation, the doctors do not want to disturb the health services but our safety is of course a matter of concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jmm-leaders-beat-up-doctor-nurses-at-bokaro-hospital/story-0OWeVgHkcZBsneKCT0s8tI.html
06-04-2020||Ranchi||Third corona-positive case in Jharkhand||A woman from Bokaro district who had returned from Bangladesh after attending Muslim religious congregation Tablighi Jamaat in Dhaka, was on Sunday found to be infected with Covid-19.This is the third positive case of coronavirus infection in the state. On March 31, Jharkhand registered its first confirmed case when a Malaysian woman was tested positive. She was the part of 22- people group of 17 foreign nationals who were recovered from two mosques in Ranchi. The group had descended to Ranchi last month after attending Tablighi Jammat in New Delhi’s Nizammudin.The state’s second case was reported from Hazaribag district when a 52-year-old man was tested positive for Covid-19. The man had returned to the district from West Bengal’s Asansol on March 29 amid nationwide lockdown.Confirming about the third case, Bokaro deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar said, “The affected woman is a resident of village Tello under district’s Chandrapura block. She has been shifted to Covid-19 ward of Bokaro General Hospital and treatment has been started.”“There is no need of panic as the district machinery has started the exercise of contact tracing to identify people who came in direct or indirect contact with the affected woman. Health care workers and sanitation team have been deployed in the village to carry out their work, including door-to-door health checkup of residents and sanitation of entire village,” added the DC, who was camping in the village.According to local sources, the affected woman, along with her husband and two other couples of the same village, returned from Dhaka on March 15. All have been in 28-day home quarantine.“Few people, including this woman and her husband, had visited Bangladesh and returned last month. We are collecting further details in this regard,” said the DC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/third-corona-positive-case-in-jharkhand/story-SzV6gd3E4ACfmCXkpzzHwO.html
06-04-2020||City||More people ‘lock down’ villages for outsiders to keep Covid-19 at bay||One after the other residents of several villages in the state have been barricading the entry points for outsiders to keep the dreaded coronavirus infection at bay. In tribal-dominated West Singhbhum district, some villages had pulled the shutters down even before PM called for Janata Curfew on March 23 and nationwide 21-day lockdown a day later. Hundreds of villages across Kolhan division, comprising East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts, have banned entry of outsiders into the villages. Entry is only allowed after coronavirus tests, they said.On Saturday, a person had to desert his SUV near Sidhdih-Lengdih villages under Chowka police station area in Seraikela-Kharsawan district as villages chased the vehicle. SDPO Dhinrendra Narayan Banka and inspector Rajendra Prasad Mahato later seized the vehicle and said it hailed from Kapali area of the district.Four villagers — working in Usha Martin in Adityapur — was chased away from Kathjora village near Dalma Hills under Chandil subdivision when they had reached Kathjora on their way to their native village Jamtara. “Anybody will be allowed only after medical check-up and a negative report,” Narsingh Saradar, Kathjora mukhiya told HT.“We have barricaded the entry points of our village and entry is allowed only after the gram sabha’s approval. Anyone coming from other states are being taken to health centres and quarantined in panchayat bhawan. We ourselves are strictly maintaining social distancing,” said Lalmohan Surin, munda (village head) of Dimbuli village under Manoharpur block if West Singhbhum. Mangra Surin, another munda of the same village, echoed similar thoughts.In Bandgaon block of West Singhbhum, villagers have blocked the Nakti Dam and Kansara Temple roads to block entry of outsiders into Nakta and Kansara villages under Kearaikela PS. Taratara village in Manoharpur block also sealed its entry points and banned entry of outsiders on Saturday.“Now, it has become rampant and most of the villagers have now blocked entry of outsiders. Even traditional village heads are taking no chance of trying ritualistic healing and cure practices,” Devendra Nath Champia, former deputy speaker in Bihar Assembly, told HT from Chaibasa. Villagers of Malkundi village in Chakulia block, Nayadih and Chatro in Dhalbhumgarh block, Bhrukadih and Jaria in Pitka block and Baghuria village in Ghatsila block in East Singhbhum have also set up makeshift barricades banning entry of outsiders into the villages. The only exception is for health workers, and administrative officials reaching with medicines, relief materials etc.On the other hand, Kurmi Sanskriti Vikas Samiti (KSVS) workers have put up barricades and notice boards on the borders of Nayadih and Chatro village in Dhalbhumgarh and Baligumavillage in Chakulia blocks banning entry of outsiders.“We are stopping outsiders from entering our villages by putting up barriers on the main road. Many of our fellow villagers work in other states, we are taking care that they too get into the village after proper testing so that the coronavirus doesn’t spread here. We are putting them in quarantine in panchayat bhawan even after negative reports,” Sapan Mahato, KSVS president said. Similar posters and barricades have also been set up around Baghuria village under Ghatshila block.Villagers of Rolaghutu village in Tiring panchayat under Potka PS on Odisha border have also put up barriers on the road to prevent entry of outsiders. Villagers have set up barriers in Jagannathpur under Seraikela and Kadamdiha and Simla villages under Kharsawan blocks of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-people-lock-down-villages-for-outsiders-to-keep-covid-19-at-bay/story-cuy7y4ZHU37286ZURZHxMP.html
06-04-2020||Ranchi||Covid-19 suspect dies in RIMS emergency ward; probe ordered||State health minister Banna Gupta has set up a probe into the alleged lapses committed in handling a corona-suspect patient who died in an isolation ward in Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) on Saturday and his body was found lying in hospital’s emergency unit.“It is a major negligence. Such lapses will not be tolerated at any cost. I have written a letter to health department’s principal secretary demanding a report on the entire things within 24 hours,” said the minister.The incident relates to a 55-year-old male patient who was admitted in RIMS isolation centre on Friday and his samples were taken for Covid-19 test. But the patient died on Saturday morning and his body was found lying in hospital’s emergency unit creating controversy.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe deceased family members, who are residents of Ranchi’s Khelgaon, levelled serious charges on hospital’s management. They said the patient was admitted on Friday and samples were taken for Covid 19 test.“ No attendant was allowed to live with the patient. On Saturday, when we visited the hospital to inquire about our patient’s well-being, we were told that the patient was missing from isolation ward. On further inquiry, we came to know that one body was lying in emergency unit. We then identified the body,” said a relative of the deceased.He added that the RIMS authorities refused to handover the body till the Covid-19 test report comes.“The test report has not come till 8.15 pm on Sunday. We will handover the body after the report arrives,” said Dr DK Singh, RIMS director.After holding a meeting with task force, doctors of medicine department and others on Sunday, Singh said no lapse had happened in the treatment of the patient. He, however, admitted that some mistakes did occur in communication.He said, “There was a communication gap. The patient’s family member should be informed after the death. We do not find evidence that the patient’s family members were properly communicated. Responsibility has been fixed on each and every working staff. Teams have been constituted to deal with post death disposal, which assumes significance in handling the Covid-19 menace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/probe-set-up-over-death-of-covid-19-suspect-in-rims/story-CKJTe0BeVe5vLPsuj3FdbO.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Moti Bagh ‘containment zone’ is fully cut off, except telephonically||It was a busy day for Suraj Singh Pradhan as he fielded calls from a wide range of people in his slum neighbourhood in South Moti Bagh, which has emerged as city’s first coronavirus containment zone beyond the two cluster hot spots of Dilshad Garden and Nizamuddin. Pradhan told HT on the phone that as per instructions of the district administration he is now the conduit for all communication between locals in the slum and the government machinery after one of its residents—a contractual sanitation worker at the AIIMS Trauma Centre—tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. While he was admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, his family was shifted to a quarantine centre in Chhattarpur. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe community leader’s phone rang off the hook on Sunday. While fellow area dwellers, now quarantined at home, called Pradhan to arrange for milk, vegetables and other essentials, the police called intermittently to ask if locals were adhering to the lockdown and sanitation workers called to check if there were any disinfectants left from the batch received in the morning.The development has left residents anxious about the possibility of community spread, several of whom spoke with HT over the phone. Rishiraj Pal, a 20-year-old resident of the slum, said the fear in the slum was palpable. “Policemen are patrolling the area round the clock ready to thrash people spotted roaming the streets. But more than that, we are scared of the infection. We don’t know if staying home would actually protect us. But what else can we do,” he said.Within hours of the result being declared, three out of four connecting routes to the slum from the Ring Road, the South Moti Bagh market and interconnected lanes that lead to the South Campus of the University of Delhi were blocked using trucks. The fourth exit route was barricaded by the police, allowing only patrol vehicles, sanitation workers and government officials to enter the area inhabited by more than 1,000 families. HT went to the neighbourhood on Sunday till the permissible limits set by the police and district administration.An area of around 1 sqkm was turned into a containment zone with a stricter version of the ongoing lockdown imposed here. All shops, including those selling essentials, were closed, sanitisation workers were seen spraying disinfectants at regular intervals and door-to-door drives were conducted twice a day by government officials to check if any of the residents of the slum had developed any flu-like symptoms, said a senior officer in Delhi government’s revenue department.“The residents have been asked to stay inside their homes and call the beat staff, local police station, or hunger helpline over the phone if they need food, ration or other essential items. The other option is to call their community leader (Pradhan), who can further send the message across. Arrangements have been made to get the essentials delivered at the slum so the residents do not have to venture out,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Devender Arya.“The slum residents have been briefed about the coronavirus symptoms and that they must alert the police if they see anyone flouting the lockdown rules. Anyone violating the quarantine order will face legal action,” he added. “About 15 health staffers used a tanker of 15,000 litres of diluted sodium hypoclorite to sanitise the area,” said a senior official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).WHAT IS THE CONTAINMENT PLANAs per the “containment plan” on the Union health ministry’s website, any movement has been prohibited within a containment zone to prevent local transmission of Covid-19. The size of the containment zone, as suggested by the guideline, is directly proportional to the population density of the cluster in question and the scale of the outbreak.In the case of South Moti Bagh’s, 1,000 families live in the affected slum and its periphery, while its “buffer zone” includes another slum, a Gurudwara, a temple, a 24x7 petrol pump and a market. “The cluster containment strategy would be to contain the disease within a defined geographic area by detecting cases in the nascent stage, breaking the chain of transmission and preventing its spread to new areas. This would include geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing all suspected cases, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts and risk communication to create awareness among public on preventive public health measures,” the document uploaded by the health ministry on its website.“Geographical containment strategies, however, were being discussed since the day the lockdown was imposed,” said a senior official in the Union health ministry.PLAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS PER DEMOGRAPHYHowever, states and Union Territories have implemented containment strategies in conformation with the local demography. A comparison between Delhi and Mumbai highlights the differences well.Mumbai has created 241 containment zones in the past seven days, virtually locking down a population of around 9,00,000 people, HT had published on Saturday. In Mumbai, a containment zone means at least one person from the area tested positive for COVID-19. The patient’s family and the building are identified as a cluster zone and at least four to five adjoining buildings on all sides are mapped in the containment zone, depending on the area’s population density. Mumbai too confronts concerns of possible community transmission after cases were reported at slum clusters in Dharavi.“In Delhi, we have adopted a different approach,” said the senior revenue department official. He elaborated. The city has two cluster hotspots – Dilshad Garden, where a woman who returned from Saudi Arabia was the source of infection for numerous relatives, neighbours, two doctors and their patients, and Nizamuddin where a congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat was organised in March. The containment zones in these two hotspots areas, among 22 identified in the country, range between 3 sqkm and 5 sqkm.“Beyond hotspots, localities in which positive cases were reported were subjected to intense surveillance and isolation norms but they were not converted into geographic containment zones. It would be unnecessary to create multiple containment zones. The strategy should be efficiently deployed,” said the officer.District Magistrate (New Delhi) Tanvi Garg, who is in charge of South Moti Bagh area, and additional chief secretary Satya Gopal, who is in charge of the monitoring of the coronavirus prevention exercise in Delhi did not respond to phone calls and messages.The government has maintained that India is yet to slip into the community transmission stage in which the source of infection for a person becomes difficult to ascertain. So far, the coronavirus disease has claimed at least 64,000 lives across the world and at least  100 in India, of which seven have been from Delhi...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/moti-bagh-s-containment-zone-is-fully-cut-off-except-telephonically/story-kTtjAYvtHBnqcCMLNSd89K.html
06-04-2020||Chandigarh||Crackers sound jarring note as Chandigarh tricity lights up on PM Modi’s solemn plea||The stillness which had become so much a part of the tricity over the last two weeks was shattered by exploding firecrackers on Monday night as people in their enthusiasm to follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s solemn call for a candlelight vigil to unite to fight the coronavirus epidemic exceeded their brief to keep things low-key.Even as residents, following PM Modi’s Friday call to show solidarity and battle the pandemic, switched on their mobile phone lights and lit candles and diyas on Sunday at 9 pm, the sound of crackers sounded a jarring note. “This is the height of insanity and insensitivity to celebrate death and disease with so much pomp, show and bursting of crackers. This is a real wake of call for people who love India and the Indian ethos of compassion and humanism above all,” said, Pramod Sharma, who heads Yuvsatta, an NGO. “It was very peaceful initially. People had lit candles in their balconies, many were playing bhajans on their music systems, when suddenly crackers started popping. This was a solemn occasion, not something to celebrate,” said Nayna, a resident of Sector 43.Dr Ravindra Khaiwal , additional professor, environment health, The School of Public Health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said, “The purpose (of lighting diyas) was for showing solidarity with the citizens who are at the forefront of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, but a few people resorted to bursting of crackers. That’s an undesired step,” he said. “We are in the midst of a pandemic and people are celebrating as if it’s Diwali,” quipped Mohali mayor Kulwant Singh. Former railways minister and Congressman Pawan Kumar Bansal felt this showed “the over enthusiasm and hype built up over the PM’s announcement. What was supposed to be voluntary action has now become a must-do thing.”Crackers were burst in most parts of the tricity. In some localities, enthusiastic Bharatiya Janata Party workers resorted to sloganeering in favour of their party and PM Modi. “It appears that people, by bursting crackers, did not understand the sensitivity involved in the issue. The call was not for this,” said Dr Pramod Kumar, director, Institute for Development and Communication (IDC), Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/crackers-sound-jarring-note-as-chandigarh-tricity-lights-up-on-pm-modi-s-solemn-plea/story-ofebPRojCEH0Smhky0FU2L.html
06-04-2020||Chandigarh||48% Covid-19 positive patients in Chandigarh tricity aged between 21-40||Health authorities have confirmed that majority of the 35 Covid-19 positive patients in the tricity, at 48.6%, are aged between 21 and 40.The age bracket hit the next hardest is between 41 and 60 years at 25.7%. Senior citizens, who are above 60 years, account for 20% of the positive cases, all from Mohali.In Chandigarh, it’s mostly the younger population that has been infected by the virus, as 72% of the 18 positive patients are in the age group of 21-40 years.Experts correlate this with the mobility of the young. “If we see the trend in Chandigarh, the five patients, who had travel history to foreign countries where Covid-19 cases were reported, are all below the age of 35,” said PVM Lakshmi, an epidemiologist at the Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). “The young individuals mostly mix up with their peers more than their families, and this is one reason that more cases were reported among the younger population in Chandigarh,” she added.On the contrary, the maximum cases in Mohali, at 46.6%, are in the 61 to 80 age group, while no one among the Chandigarh or Panchkula cases falls in this age bracket.Dr G Dewan, director health services, Chandigarh, said the disease’s trend here was the same as that found at the national level. Around 83% people infected in the country are below the age of 60, almost a similar trend seen in the tricity. “However, we need to be more cautious with regards to the senior citizens, especially those also suffering from comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension, as these have been associated with severe symptoms and complications,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/48-covid-19-positive-patients-in-chandigarh-tricity-aged-between-21-40/story-IQclQ9YZPD5MpRMfPfXUhO.html

She added that a helpline number, 1800-180-2013, had been activated for tenants to report such issues to the MC.If found guilty under Section 188, a person can be punished with imprisonment up to six months, or with fine up to ₹1,000, or both.Kataria also asked the employers of industries, shops and business establishments to pay salaries to their workers without any deduction on the due date.She said social distancing should be maintained, but lockdown measures should also not be violated. Kataria said for effective implementation of the lockdown and to reduce the economic hardship of migrant workers, the government has made adequate arrangements for temporary shelter and food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/house-owners-in-panchkula-told-to-defer-rent-collection-from-migrants-students/story-MeWR32j7s3EexTkBAN9OAN.html
06-04-2020||Chandigarh||My customers are postponing payment, says Ludhiana milkman||Working during the novel coronavirus pandemic isn’t proving to be very rewarding for 56-year-old milkman Sukhwinder Singh. With customers’ deferring payments, the cost of fodder increasing and the mounting cost of sanitisers, is it any surprise that Sukhwinder, who hails from Jassowal village and supplies milk to different areas of the city, cannot wait for the lockdown to end. “Through the lockdown, I have ensured that I supply milk to customers on time as they need more milk than the regular days as they stay at home all day, however, I still will make less money than usual,” says Sukhwinder. “A number of customers have already requested me to collect dues next month on top of it mixed feed, which would earlier cost ₹2,400 per quintal, is now being sold for ₹2,700 to ₹2,800. While I am trying to accommodate my customers, who are also facing a hard time due to the pandemic, deferred payments are only increasing to my worries,” he says. Sukhwinder starts his day at 7am and supplies milk to around 110 houses in Phullowal, Model Town, Model Town Extension, Sarabha Nagar, Randhir Singh Nagar and Barewal with the help of his son, Jaskirat. Singh also supplies milk to the Verka plant. Sukhwinder is cognisant of the risk of contracting the infection and takes precautionary measures, “During the course of my work, I come in contact with lots of people, which is why I always carry a sanitiser with me and maintain distance while putting milk in their containers. After I finish my work, I only step out of my home when I have to feed cattle in the evening,” he says. Sukhwinder who lives with his wife Kuldeep Kaur and two sons Gurpreet Singh and Jaskirat Singh in the village requests the administration to ensure strictness in the rural area: “While people in the cities are following the rules, villagers are yet to take the coronavirus outbreak seriously,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/my-customers-are-postponing-payment-says-ludhiana-milkman/story-E0ZaSigwyBhCKsQUvk1GdM.html
06-04-2020||Chandigarh||Industry in Chandigarh will need major impetus by government post lockdown, say businessmen||With shops and manufacturing units closed due to the curfew imposed to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), traders fear economic recovery will be difficult.It is for the first time that all business activity, trading and manufacturing, has been shut down in the city.“There is great uncertainty among businessmen as to what the future holds. People have even stopped planning how to manage the after-effects of the shutdown. We also don’t know for how long businesses will remain disturbed because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Neeraj Bajaj of the Chandigarh Business Council.In the city’s industrial area, more than 30,000 are employed in manufacturing and service units.“Beyond the short-term struggle, the industry will need major impetus from the government in the short and long term. There should be moratorium period or extension of six months for payment of liabilities including utility bills, taxes and duties to the government,” said Pankaj Khanna, president, industries association, Chandigarh.Industry is also seeking for loans accounts, which become non-performing assets (NPA) during lockdown, to not be considered wilful defaulters.“Stimulus package for MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) should be considered for the financial year 2020-2021. Financial support for unorganized sectors will also be required,” Khanna said.Chandigarh Beopar Mandal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Friday, seeking help, as they struggle to deal with the acute economic crisis caused by the pandemic.“We request the government to allow us to pay our employees ₹4,000 to ₹5,000 per month as ration cost till the lockdown continues,” the traders’ body stated in its communiqué.“Most of our traders have taken overdraft/CC limits or term loans in order to run their businesses. When there isno business activity, paying these interests is also a big challenge,” said Charanjiv Singh, chairman of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal.FACTORY WORKERS ISSUED CURFEW PASSES TO FACILITATE WAGE DISBURSEMENT TO LABOURTo resolve the issue of payment of wages to more than 25,000 factory workers in the city, the UT administration has started issuing curfew passes to factory officials to allow them to disburse wages.“So far, we have issued 120 curfew passes for factory officials. In case there are any problems regarding this, we are taking them up on priority basis,” said Harjit Singh Sandhu, director, industries.Due to restrictions on movement imposed because of the curfew, both factory owners and workers have been facing problems with the disbursement of wages. Various industry associations had taken up the issue with the administration.The UT labour department, too, has contacted industrialists and factory owners regarding payment of wages to the labourers. “Around 10,000 labourers have already received their salaries. Efforts are being made to ensure that the remaining labour is paid wages at the earliest,” said a senior UT official, wishing not to be named.Meanwhile, household workers like maids, gardeners, etc are finding it difficult to collect their monthly salaries because of curfew restrictions. “The administration should devise a plan that allows household workers to collect their salaries from houses of their employers. They are not able to visit their workplaces and they don’t have curfew passes either. This is causing them a great deal of hardship,” said RK Garg, a city based social activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/industry-in-chandigarh-will-need-major-impetus-by-government-post-lockdown-say-businessmen/story-qjZfuVfUg0pQGoUtAutqtM.html

Son of a senior UT official, the youth had tested positive for Covid-19 on March 22 after he came in contact with the brother of Chandigarh’s first coronavirus patient, a 23-year-old woman from Sector 21.“One cannot be too careful. Though I did not have severe symptoms, all of us, even the young, are not immune to it. Advisories for social distancing and hand washing should be followed religiously,” he said.“During the course of my stay at the hospital, I learnt that there is nothing to be afraid of, but we need to be careful. My morale was high and I was confident of quick recovery,” he said, while adding that those affected by the disease should not lose hope as recovery was possible.The youth reported to the hospital after his fever rose, alerting him that he could be infected. “In isolation, even though I was not allowed to move out, I spent my days reading and talking to my friends. The doctors, nurses and the supporting staff were immensely helpful,” he said.The 25-year-old brother of the city’s first positive patient was also discharged from GMCH on Saturday. He had tested positive on March 20 after coming in contact with his sister, who flew back from the United Kingdom on March 15 and tested positive on March 18. Their mother, who had also contracted the infection, was discharged on Saturday.On his recovery, the youth said following the instructions of the doctors was vital to get cured at the earliest. “Different bodies react to the virus differently. I did not have many symptoms, while other positive patients had cough and fever.

He believes that the lockdown, necessitated due to the Covid-19 pandemic’, has given us time to contemplate about our lives.Choosing to see the glass half-full during this unprecedented situation, Bains says, “Though a number of people are facing a tough time, but it was important to impose the curfew to combat Covid-19 effectively. With people holed up, nature is getting a chance to coalesce from the damages inflicted by mankind. The lockdown has given us a chance to decompress and enjoy the company of our loved ones.” “Earlier, my hectic schedule, did not allow me to spend quality time with my family. However, the pandemic has put things into a fresh perspective for most of us. Money, careers and other worldly affairs are not as important. Nature has its own pace and we need to sync ourselves to it,” he says.Ask him how he spends his days in confinement, Bains says,” I am utilising this time by working out, gardening, cooking, playing the piano and writing new stories and screen plays.” “I live near Rakh Bagh, with the lockdown in place, I find it peaceful to sit in the courtyard and listen to the birds chirp,” he says, adding that he has discovered new species of birds near his house. Reflecting on his life amid the lockdown vis-à-vis life before it, he says, “I used to always stay busy with shoots and travelled intensively between Ludhiana, Bombay and Chandigarh. I never got a chance to marvel at beauty of nature. Nowadays, the days are all the more beautiful because of decreased air pollution,” says Bains, adding, “The government should fix 15 days of quarantine a year. It will not only benefit us but will also help nature to reclaim its space.”Bains is also limiting the use of mobile phone and is distancing himself not only from people but from social media, too.“I appeal residents to stay calm and spend time with themselves, enjoy nature and distance yourself from social media to save yourselves from the negativity,” he signs off .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/take-lockdown-as-an-opportunity-to-self-reflect-says-film-director-rai-yuvraj-bains/story-gjIgsvqRZGzUGTPQa0LSpN.html

06-04-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown aftermath: Chandigarh petrol pump sales plummet 90%||Most of the city’s 35 petrol pumps have reported a 90% drop in petrol sales after curfew was imposed here from March 24.Even as the pumps to stay open from 6am to 9 pm every day, only vehicles operating for essential services come in as curfew orders prohibit other vehicles to run in this period without a pass.“I used to sell about 1.2 lakh litre of petrol and diesel per day but now the figure is around 11,000 litre. Only one-third of our staff is present and around 50% of the dispensers are suspended,” says Amandeep Singh, general secretary, Chandigarh Petroleum Dealers Association.Before the curfew, approximate daily consumption of petrol and diesel in all pumps of the city was around 730 litres a day. Now it is around 70 kilo litres a day. With employee salaries and electricity and other bills to be paid, pump owners say they are losing more money than they are making. “Fuel is an essential service and we are doing our part to make sure that the government’s essential services run effectively. There will be no shortage once the curfew is lifted and we expect sales to climb back up again,” Amandeep Singh adds.Staff living near premisesEven as most petrol pump employees have been issued masks, gloves and hand sanitisers, some pump owners have ensured their staff stay close to the premises and don’t risk getting infected by moving around. Anil Manrao, proprietor of Mann Filling Station in Sector 49, says he has formed a team of eight staffers who have been living close to the station since curfew was imposed. “They are bachelors and instead of going home and coming in contact with others they are sleeping in a temple right next to the pump and I have provided them with enough rations to live comfortably.” Manrao says he visits them daily and will be paying them extra incentives for their services after the curfew is lifted.No air pressure checkNot many petrol pumps are offering services to check tyre air pressure or vehicle repair during the curfew. Meenu Chaudhary, proprietor of a pump at Sector 31, says, “We are barely making any sales, so staff strength has reduced to bare minimum.”Petrol pumps at the city’s borders were offering the services, she adds.Due to the relaxation given by the government, pollution checking services have also been suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-aftermath-chandigarh-petrol-pump-sales-plummet-90/story-1RAhw5xbkF18ksKU9TqiYJ.html

There is confusion on whether the salary cut to fund this is voluntary, or if the employees have to give consent. Salaries for April are yet to disbursed. According to the department’s declaration, officials of group A and B will contribute seven-day salary, group C three days and group D one day. Sources said a week’s salary of a group-A staffer was around Rs 40,000.At least 100 industrial training institutes, 25 polytechnic institutes, four engineering colleges and two technical universities are under the ministry’s administrative control. Workshop instructor union president Harkesh Kumar said, “All staff members in the department irrespective of level had agreed to contribute a day’s salary. The announcement, however, was made, for contributing up to seven-day salary. If given more time, we will have agreed to this as well,” he said, adding that if a government order was issued, no would oppose it. “We are asking for consent, but all should contribute voluntarily,” said Jasvir Singh Gill, Polytechnic Gazetted Teachers Association. Baljit Kaur, president, of an employees body in state-run polytechnic colleges said, “There is no clarity as yet on salary cuts for different levels. No employee can refuse to contribute, if made compulsory.”Additional director Mohanbir Singh Sidhu, who was in touch with employee unions before the announcement, said, “I am not an authority to announce such deduction. One should not mind contributing during such adverse times.” Technical education minister Charanjeet Singh Channi said Saturday’s decision was based on the majority view. “All should be socially responsible,” he said, adding that he had contributed one-month salary to the relief fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-agreed-to-give-1-day-salary-dept-announced-deeper-cut-claim-technical-edu-staff/story-9NKUKPv9wP3TBEYVnjllmN.html

We learn, grow, revive and enjoy by being in social setting but the lockdown has forced us to stay indoors for three weeks. While we are trying to protect our physical health by staying inside our houses, it is equally important to keep ourselves mentally fit. Many people are reporting depression or feeling of sadness and loneliness at this time, and exercise is the only way out of it,” said Navneet Singh, a fitness instructor who also owns a gym near Lodhi Club. 45-year-old Singh ensures that his clients continue with their fitness regime even during the lockdown. “Today, I conducted a live aerobics class on Facebook. I have been in touch with all my 400 clients through WhatsApp group, where I not only conduct different exercises, including aerobics, yoga, zumba, but also share important article on health and fitness,” he added. While Navneet has been managing to stay in touch with all his clients, however, paying rent and salaries to his staff has become a major challenge for him. “Monthly rent of my gym is ₹2.5 lakh and I have 10 staff members to pay salaries to along with the monthly EMIs and domestic expenditure. While the business has stopped, bills have piled up. If the lockdown is prolonged, financial situation of many businessmen like me will only worsen,” he said. Other than taking classes, Singh who is a resident of BRS Nagar, spends his days playing games with his daughters Jessica and Bhavnit and reading ebooks. “While I have been continuing with my fitness routine, I’m also enjoying different delicacies made by my wife Satinder Kaur.

06-04-2020||Chandigarh||Despite heavy borrowing, lockdown to leave Punjab with Rs 5,009-cr deficit||The 21-day coronavirus lockdown is expected to hit the debt-ridden Punjab government hard, leaving it with a deficit of Rs 5,009-crore in the first quarter of financial year 2020-21.The state is staring at this huge shortfall in the April-June period despite market borrowing of Rs 5,300 crore to meet its committed expenditure such as salaries, pensions and interest payments, according to a presentation made by the finance department on the financial impact of the curfew before the state cabinet on Friday.“This is the scenario if the present national lockdown is not extended, but the financial impact will be much more severe in case it gets extended,” officials said. As per the scenarios presented by the department, the deficit will rise to Rs 5,948 crore in the first quarter if the lockdown ends on May 15 and Rs 6,700 crore in case it gets extended till June 15.The state government, which is already grappling with rising debt, plans to borrow Rs 3,000 crore in April, Rs 1,400 crore in May and Rs 900 crore in June to just meet its committed liabilities. The monthly outgo on salaries is Rs 2,100 crore with pensions accounting for another Rs 720 crore.“There is no move to cut salaries, but the state government will have no option but to borrow more to bridge the deficit,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.The state government has already requested Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to relax the borrowing limit under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, from three to four per cent. Under the Act, the state is allowed to raise market loans not exceeding 3% of their gross state domestic product (GSDP).The enhanced FRBM limit will allow the state government to raise another Rs 6,000 crore this fiscal and help it tide over the financial crisis created by the coronavirus outbreak and the consequent curfew – lockdown in other states – that has brought all business activity revenues in the state to a grinding halt.As per estimates, the state economy is taking a hit of Rs 1,700 crore everyday due to the present shutdown. However, the upcoming wheat procurement and payment of Rs 26,000-odd crore to farmers for their produce over a period of two months are expected to provide relief. “This money in farmers’ pockets will give a boost to the state economy as and when the curfew is lifted,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-heavy-borrowing-lockdown-to-leave-punjab-with-rs-5-009-cr-deficit/story-hbyxKVmh5CTiVHGHNRbIYM.html

Therefore, to create an awareness among the residents and to guide them about the diet and exercises to be followed during this period, fitness expert Manmeet Singh of Basant Avenue has started taking health sessions via video conferencing. He has been helping people with the activities they should involve themselves in while remaining indoors. Singh has been working as a fitness expert and a trainer in different gyms and conducts health sessions in different hospitals too.On Sunday, he took two sessions to guide residents about the lifestyle that they can follow while remaining indoors.“To properly communicate my message and interact with the residents, I include only 15 people in a session,” he said.He said today people are cooped up in their homes and level of physical activities has also reduced. “Most of the residents are often lying down or sitting while reading books, watching television or while using mobile phones the entire day. This is making them lethargic. Moreover, if one stays in such atmosphere for a long time, the stress level also increases and when stress increases, body releases hormones which further increases hunger,” he explained.So it is necessary that one should indulge themselves in physical activities and should follow some relaxation techniques to stay healthy.He said people should avoid taking heavy meals and rather consume light meals 5 to 6 times a day to improve their metabolism. He also warned against adding more spices and asked people to avoid sugar in tea and coffee, as sugar increases craving to eat. He said that one should prefer boiled vegetables and pulses in their regular diet.Sharing about physical activities, he suggested that people can do pranayama, walk on the terrace, meditate or do crunches. “Moreover, as maids are not available these days, one can help their mothers, wives in their daily chores, which will improve their physical activities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/physical-activities-must-to-combat-sedentary-lifestyle-fitness-expert/story-GUDczBsXMIXvWxjRJCo5mN.html

Thus, the toll rate hike would directly affect the people using private vehicles or commercial vehicles. The cost of common goods transported by freight carriers would also get increased,” he added. “Industries are shut and so are the businesses. More than 5 lakh migrant labourers have already gone back to their villages from the state. Most of the raw material for industries comes from other states by road and Haryana’s industries produces the finished products, which is transported to all over the country. In such circumstances, every small burden put on commercial vehicles makes Haryana’s industry non-competitive,” he said.Surjewala asked why the BJP-JJP government was silent on the issue. “Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala came to the power on a promise of uprooting toll plazas. Why is he maintaining a mysterious silence?” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/don-t-hike-toll-fee-after-lockdown-is-lifted-surjewala-to-hry-govt/story-rMAPBg3lQQLdrzpIGwGVqL.html

06-04-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid-19 tally touches 748||The number of deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across the country touched 100 on Sunday as the total infections crossed 4,000 – 748 of them in Maharashtra – with the Central government pegging the doubling rate of the pathogen’s spread at 4.1 days, a figure it said would have stood at 7.4 in the absence of the Nizamuddin cluster. Maharashtra recorded 13 more deaths — the highest 24-hour jump — on Sunday, taking the toll to 45, even as the state reported 113 fresh cases of the infection, revealed figures released by the state health department.Sixteen deaths and 514 new infections were reported on the 12th day of a national lockdown that has been put in place to break the chain of infections. “Our focus is that we chase the virus, rather than the virus chasing us,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said during a news briefing. The Union health ministry said that 505 new Covid-19 cases and 15 deaths were reported since Saturday and the total Covid-19 cases were 3,577, with the death toll being 83. However, a tally by Covid19india.org that was cross-checked by HT, showed that the number of cases stood at 4,198, with 114 deaths. There is a lag in the Union health ministry’s data when compared to that of states. Officials say this is because of procedural delays in state-wise cataloguing of cases.The recent spike in infections has largely been propelled by the detection of hundreds of patients who attended the congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group, in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti last month in a violation of several restrictions. Cases linked to the meet have been reported across 17 states and Union Territories so far.Of Maharashtra’s 13 deaths, eight were in Mumbai, taking the city’s toll to 30, the highest in the country. Three deaths were in Pune and one each in Kalyan-Dombivli and Aurangabad. Four of them died in Kasturba Hospital, Mumbai; two in KEM, Mumbai; two in separate hospitals in Chembur; two in Sassoon Hospital, Pune; one at a district hospital in Pune, while one died in a government hospital in Aurangabad. Most of them had no travel history and barring four, all others were above 60 years of age. Of the 113 people who tested positive for the infection (Sars-Cov-2) in Maharashtra on Sunday, 81 are from Mumbai, 18 from Pune, six from Navi Mumbai, four from Aurangabad, three from Ahmednagar and one from Osmanabad.A 55-year-old taxi driver, who died in a Chembur hospital, used to ferry passengers from the Mumbai international airport, the state health department report stated. Most of the people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat programe in Nizamuddin on March 18 have been traced and are being either kept in isolation or quarantine, the health department has stated. “The local administrations are tracing the people who came in contact with them and are still unidentified. Of the Tablighi attendees, seven have tested positive for coronavirus. Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Ahmednagar had two patients each, while one is from Hingoli. Five others found positive are the relatives of these attendees,” health department official said.With a sudden spike in cases in Mumbai and the state, the state administration has been asked to be on their toes with stricter monitoring of containment zones. District collectors and municipal commissioners have been directed to concentrate on the zones, treating them as hotspots. The administration believes that the monitoring of the zones will help the government contain the rise in patients. In Mumbai, the administration has identified around 300 such zones, which are being monitored minutely to restrict the spread. “According to our estimates, we expect the cases to go up for ten more days in Mumbai and other cities, where infected people have been found in large numbers. We expect the figures to reach a plateau by April 15, and then the number of cases will stabilise. But bringing back the situation to normal will take a week after that. We firmly believe that by concentrating on hotspots, we will be able to contain the spread,” said an official from Mantralaya.State health minister Rajesh Tope said 3,078 teams of health workers have so far tracked more than 10 lakh people and they are being monitored for further procedures.Mumbai and Navi Mumbai have 519 and 196 teams, respectively, working to implement the cluster containment action plan. Pune and Nagpur municipal corporations have engaged 439 and 210 such teams respectively.The state government has tested 16,008 samples for coronavirus infections. Of them, 14,837 tested negative. 56 patients have been discharged from various hospitals after their post-isolation tests came negative. 3,122 people are in institutional quarantine, while 46,586 are under home quarantine.The administration has also been directed to concentrate on districts where the cases are zero. “There are around ten districts with no cases so far. As they continue to be unaffected, we can ensure that administrative machinery in those districts can be utilised in other areas if need be,” an official from the public health department said.The state government has asserted that Maharashtra has not reached the third stage of Covid-19 transmission, the stage in which the infection through social transmission is rapid. It has, however, taken measures to ensure that the machinery is prepared even if social transmission began. Every collector and municipal commissioner in the state has identified/acquired schools, colleges, lodges and marriage halls in their respective areas as measure of preparedness. Doctors from all streams have been given training, while students from National Cadet Crop (NCC) and other social services activities at school and college levels, too, are being trained, said an official from the state government.“The videos of training modules are being circulated among health workers and 1.25 lakh more doctors are being trained as preparatory measure,” said Rajesh Tope, state health minister.Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray lent a helping hand to people stranded in Delhi by announcing that they can be put up at Maharashtra Sadan. He spoke to one such Mulund resident, Elizabeth Pingle, on Sunday. Pingale, who was in 14-day quarantine, was left stranded as the hotel she was staying in shut for business and she could not find a place to stay. Thackeray spoke to Pingle and assured her with the arrangements for stay at Maharashtra Sadan. More than 15 such people with negative test reports are staying at the Maharashtra Sadan, chief minister office said.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the city recorded 103 coronavirus cases and eight deaths in Mumbai, the highest in a day so far. Of the new cases, 55 are from private laboratories between March 31 and April 1. After reconfirming pending reports, BMC added the figure on Sunday. This takes the total number of Covid-19 cases in the city to 433. Of the city’s eight deaths, three cases were recorded between March 31 and April 3, which were pending cross-checking with BMC. A 67-year-old woman from Dombivli died at Kasturba Hospital last evening. She didn’t have international travel history. She had diabetes and hypertension. Similarly, another 64-year-old man died at Kasturba Hospital on Saturday. One 62-year-old man died on April 1 at Nair Hospital with respiratory problems and was found Covid-19 positive on April 2. A 52-year-old male died on April 3 at Kasturba Hospital with a known case of hypertension and diabetes. A 70-year-old woman died at KEM hospital Mumbai last night. She was a patient of diabetes and hypertension. Owing to her chronic kidney disease, she was on dialysis. A 77-year-old man died on Saturday morning at Kasturba hospital, who had hypertension and diabetes. An 80-year-old man died on Sunday morning at a private hospital in Chembur. He was a patient of diabetes, hypertension and suffered from epilepsy. Meanwhile, Thane city recorded five new cases on Sunday, taking the city’s coronavirus count to 21. Apart from the three, one each in Kalwa, Mumbra and Kajuvadi, out of the remaining two cases, one is a doctor from Naupada, who had examined the Palghar man who died, and another is a resident of Vrundavan society.An official of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is not airborne. “If it was an airborne infection, then in a family whoever has a contact they all should come positive because they are living in same surrounding as the patient and the family is breathing the same air. When someone is admitted in hospital, other patients would have got exposure (if it was airborne) but that is not the case,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR. ICMR has issued an advisory that said spitting in public places could enhance the spread of Covid-19. On the question of rapid antibody tests, Gangakhedkar said test kits should be available by Wednesday.The country’s apex biomedical research organisation on Saturday released an advisory on how and where to use the rapid test, which can determine the immunity of an individual and help people get back into the workforce. The advisory includes people in high-risk areas (containment zones), large migration gatherings and evacuation centres. A task force constituted to review the testing guidelines did not open up rapid testing to the private sector.At the briefing, Agarwal said cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a meeting with district magistrates, superintendents of police, chief medical officers, state and district surveillance officers, state health secretaries, district health secretaries and chief secretaries to review the situation.District officials shared strategies on how they delineated containment and buffer zone, how they carried out door-to-door survey through special teams and how through telemedicine and call centres people who came from foreign countries were monitored.Covid-19 cases have been reported in 274 districts (till Sunday afternoon) and the cabinet secretary requested all DMs to maintain uniformity in their response and establish a crisis management plan, he said.The government said all states were asked to put in place a district-specific containment strategy in place based on the detailed large outbreak control plan issued by the health ministry on Saturday. “Surveillance and contact tracing has been our main focus, and we will continue to put emphasis on that,” said Agarwal.(with inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-tall-touches-748/story-ulbipEIxD6fbK5TXdcBstN.html

However, according to the BMC, the city recorded 103 cases on Sunday. At Dharavi, one more coronavirus case was detected on Sunday after a 21-year-old man residing on 60 Feet Road was tested positive.

The BMC has traced around 185 of his close contacts, including his five family members. According to the civic body, around 3,450 people across five containment zones in Dharavi have been home quarantined.As Dharavi is a congested area and is Asia’s largest slum area, the civic body has set up a clinic at the containment zone in Baliga Nagar, where all the 2,500 residents, including 132 senior citizens and 32 residents with respiratory ailments as well as cough, cold and fever, will give their swab tests. BMC on Saturday had set up 10 clinics in the city for swab tests. A confirmed case has also been detected at the densely-populated Lalbaug area on Sunday. According to BMC officials, the patient is a man in his 30s. He has been admitted to Kasturba Hospital and seven of his close contacts have been quarantined. BMC issues SOP for officials working at containment zonesBMC on Sunday also released the standard operating procedures (SOP) drafted by municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi which consist of guidelines for officials working at more than 241 containment zones in the city.Some of the guidelines include marking of the buffer zones near the containment zones if necessary and preparing a report of all establishments such as hotels, lodges and hospitals/ clinics in the containment zones. The SOP also directs BMC officials to prepare a list of people who had complained of flu, cough or fever in the past few days at the clinics and hospitals within the containment zones.According to the SOP, officials from BMC also have to count the number of people within a containment zone every day to ensure that nobody goes missing. Further, the SOP has also directed institutional quarantine for those who are close contacts of positive patients, but administer self-quarantine measures as they reside in small houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-wards-account-for-53-of-mumbai-s-positive-coronavirus-cases/story-U3XFUIdfKIlbJwRcsslDNM.html

These clusters have been identified in order to streamline the flow of food and essential supplies, such as water, soap and toothpaste, to these areas. An estimated 15 to 20,000 families, mostly daily wage migrant labourers, reside there.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe MCG, with the help of several volunteers and NGO groups, has attempting to supply these families with at least two cooked meals a day.MCG joint commissioner Vivek Kalia said, “We have been actively mapping areas in the city where aid is required and updating this list. Initially, we were focused on providing residents with dry ration, but now we are instead providing cooked food as many of the families living in these clusters do not have stoves or LPG cylinders. There are several kitchens at work in Gurugram, from where MCG officials and volunteers are collecting and distributing food packets.” Logistically too, providing cooked food instead of dry ration packets has proved to be easier for the MCG.As per a statement issued by the district administration on Sunday, a total of 172,000 individuals across the district are being provided with cooked food and other essential supplies every day. Those who aren’t receiving delivery of supplies in their neighbourhood also have the option of visiting any of the 77 relief centres which have been set up across the district, of which 56 are located within the MCG area. Approximately 168,000 food packets, along with 2,500 dry ration packets, are being provided to people each day.Kalia urged residents, who wish to volunteer by either providing cooked food or helping with distribution, to approach the district administration or their local councillor before doing so. “We have noticed that many of the slum clusters in newer parts of the city are being adequately serviced, because of their proximity to condominiums. However, there are large informal housing settlements in older parts of the city too, and we need to ensure equitable distribution of food and other essential items,” he added.To ensure equitable distribution, the MCG has created a centralised, digital map for each of the city’s four zones, marking the exact locations of these clusters, along with the number of families residing there. “Volunteers and officials, when referring to this map, are also able to see when food was last delivered to a particular area. This way, we avoid duplication,” Kalia explained. Each of these clusters has also been assigned a citizen volunteer, who is directly responsible for coordinating food supply to the families there.Among the NGOs at the forefront of this effort are IAmGurgaon, the Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, Agrasar, Janata Rasoi (a community kitchen being run out of DLF3), and Rasoi on the Wheels, in addition several smaller citizen initiatives at a neighbourhood level, and the city’s civil defence personnel, who have taken the reigns on distribution efforts. In rural areas, it is the local panchayats who have become involved, as per a Sunday press release issued by the administration.Latika Thukral, founder, IAmGurgaon, said, “It is extremely necessary to streamline the distribution process now, as the administration and citizens together will have to take care of the city’s underprivileged for at least the next two months, if not longer. We are actively trying to raise funds to ensure a constant flow of supplies.” According to an estimate by Agrasar, it will take approximately Rs 3250 per family, per month, in order to ensure a daily supply of cooked food to the city’s needy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-civic-body-identifies-250-slums-for-supply-of-essentials-number-six-times-initially-estimated/story-KoAa1vFORUQJxGfYfpHMAN.html
06-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Labour dept seeks industry feedback on how to resume operations post lockdown||With the country halfway into the 21-day lockdown, the state government is working towards creating a strategy to restore operations of various sectors across Haryana after April 14. In this regard, high priority has been accorded to the industrial sector to ensure supply of essentials is not hit across states. The district labour department has sought the opinion of industry owners to suggest if industries should be allowed to restore operations in phases or fully after April 14. The industry owners have been asked to submit their replies by Monday.The industries have been closed since March 21, a day before the voluntary Janata Curfew was observed. For industries, mainly for small and medium scale industries, the complete shutdown of operations has been damaging in many ways.The officials of district labour department spoke to various industrial associations on telephone on Saturday.“The government wants feedback from every stakeholder on whether lockdown should continue after April 14 or not. The government wants to know directly from the industry owners about what they feel would be effective ways to restore operations. We have asked the industry owners to submit their replies on Monday. We have asked them to share their views on what are the difficulties they are currently facing and the problems they anticipate after the lockdown is lifted or if it is continued. We will send industry owners suggestions to the Union government,” said Ramesh Ahuja, deputy labour commissioner, Gurugram.Industry owners HT spoke with had a mixed response. While some of them wanted lockdown to continue to till the pandemic is under control, some said prolonged lockdown would be damaging for small and medium industries, and another section backed restoring operations of industries involved in manufacturing of essential goods and raw materials.Industry owners also pointed out that many workers left in the migrant exodus in the initial days of the lockdown and those still around might not return to work in fear of the coronavirus disease, which is highly infectious.“Many industry owners live in Delhi, Noida, Faridabad and nearby cities and we do not know if the lockdown will be lifted at once or state-wise. Delhi or Noida, for instance, are under lockdown, how will the owners reach their factories? Similarly, factories are interdependent on goods supply within the states and nation and many clients are foreign based and most of nations are under lockdown. So we are not in a position to say anything,” said Ashok Kohli, president of Chamber of Industry Udyog Vihar.For small- and medium-scale industries continuation of the lockdown could end of operations altogether.“We are small-scale industry owners with fewer than 100 workers, who are dependent on us. We cannot distribute salaries as our clients are affected. We are very much indecisive and confused. We want the government to help us with a relief package as we will be overburdened with GST, income tax, electricity bill surcharge, bank loan interest and many other expenses. We will submit our reply on Monday,” said Deepak Maini, chairman Industrial Welfare Association of Sector-37.Some like Pawan Yadav, the president of IMT Industrial Association Manesar, said, “Lockdown should continue, as our priority is the nation. Cases of coronavirus are increasing and the government should not take a risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-labour-dept-seeks-industry-feedback-on-how-to-resume-operations-post-lockdown/story-vcFeBC6bFx1ghXJkuMIbQM.html
06-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Ivy Apartment residents use ‘smart’ solutions for social distancing||Amid the ongoing national lockdown, announced to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, Ivy Apartments in Sushant Lok Phase 1 has come up with a ‘smart’ solution to ensure that residents are able to buy essential items without crowding the grocery store within the complex. Residents in the condominium use a mobile application to book a 30-minute slot for buying groceries and other essential items from the store.The mobile app allows only six residents to book a particular slot which ensures that not more than six people enter the shop in one go and maintain social distance.Vijay Chopra, president of the RWA, said that the condominium was using a similar mechanism to manage bookings for the tennis court before the lockdown was imposed, and decided to adopt the approach to abide by social distancing norms at all times. “We have also marked circles on the floor at a distance of 2 metres so that social distancing is maintained when people wait outside the shop,” Chopra said.Apart from relying on the service of the grocery shop on the premises, the condominium’s resident welfare association (RWA) has also tied up with vendors who provide residents with vegetables and fruits on a daily basis. “The fruit and vegetable vendors come everyday between 9am to 11am, this has been a great help in procuring food items. For medicines, there is a network of people who have been provided with curfew passes, and we place requests for these necessities with the management and those with the passes procure it for us,” Neel Mason, a resident, said.In view of the lockdown, the apartment has cut down the strength of its staff and is managing with a small number of staffers to keep essential services such as diesel generator (DG), maintenance, STP (sewage treatment plant) and waste disposal running. The staff has been provided with boarding and lodging facilities within the condominium to reduce the chances of exposure to the outside world.“We have reduced the staff members on the premises since the lockdown started. The housekeeping staff, security guards, technical team, and even the grocery shop owners are staying inside the premises. We have collected money through a donation drive and provided ration and other essential items that the staff may need. They cook for themselves and we don’t want them to go back to their villages since everyone is scared of the pandemic spreading further,” Chopra said. He added that the staff members were also provided with Vitamin C tablets and an in-house doctor was monitoring their health every day.The condominium has also put in place a volunteer network to cater to the needs of residents, especially senior citizens that may require special assistance during the lockdown. Similarly, an emergency response team comprising doctors who live within the complex has also been formed. The RWA has roped in the housekeeping staff to ensure that apartments of senior citizens who do not have full-time domestic helpers are cleaned and sanitised at regular intervals.“We had asked part-time helpers not to come to the society amid the lockdown and had anticipated that the temporary suspension could severely affect the elderly senior citizens who live on their own. In order to help them, we are some estate housekeeping staff clean the identified flats on alternate days,” Chopra said. The condominium has compiled a list of the elderly residents who’d need these services. The residents are required to pay a nominal fee for the service.The condominium has barred the entry of part-time domestic help such as maids, cooks, drivers, car washers, and dog walkers among others. Entry for external vendors such as food delivery persons, meanwhile, has been restricted till the tower gate. Food and courier delivery agents are allowed til the entrance gates of the towers and the deliveries are made in a marked area that is disinfected regularly. All those entering the towers are screened by thermal scanners and are required to wash their hands in a portable wash-basin placed at the gate entrance, and use hand sanitizers. Within the condominium, common areas are regularly sanitised. The RWA has purchased a chemical solution and undertakes daily disinfection and fogging exercises regularly. Further, plastic sheets have been placed on buttons inside the lift and the sheet is disinfected every few hours.“We have also shared a format for practicing social distancing within the lifts. People using the lifts have been advised to stay at a distance and face the walls of the lift. Not more than four people are encouraged to use the lift at the same time. The lifts are sanitised on a daily basis,” Chopra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-ivy-apartment-residents-use-smart-solutions-for-social-distancing/story-XMXU5pRPiZ5muCN4UzHJfO.html

The officials said that they may soon run out of the stock as the number of Covid-19 cases so far has reached 23 till Sunday evening.“At present, we have about 350 PPE kits, while the daily usage is about 35-50 of such kits. Therefore, we have placed an intermediate order for procuring 300-400 of these to meet the present requirement. Another order of 5,000 has also been placed. We are also running short of testing kits. Presently, there are 150 kits available. Our daily usage is about 100-150 kits per day.

06-04-2020||Noida||Covid test result delayed, patient from Ghaziabad appeals on Twitter||A few patients in the isolation ward of the MMG Hospital in Ghaziabad are a worried lot as their Covid-19 test reports have been delayed by five to six days, so much so that one of them took to Twitter and tagged the Prime Minister’s Office, among others, to highlight his plight.Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta said generally, Covid-19 test reports are received in two to three days and his department was trying to expedite the process in the case of these patients.A 29-year-old IT professional said he came to the hospital voluntarily after he developed fever. He said he arrived at MMG Hospital on March 31 and his sample was collected the next day.“It’s been five days but I am yet to get the report. I had developed a mild fever and I came here for tests on March 31. There are 11 others like me whose samples were collected on April 1 and they are also yet to get their reports,” the 29-year-old man, who resides in Indirapuram, told HT over phone.“My family stays in Punjab and they are also worried about me. If our tests are negative, we should be allowed to go home. But the doctors say they are yet to get the reports,” he added.A patients also took to social media with his grievance. The IT professional posted on Twitter about the delayed test reports and tagged Rashtrapati Bhavan, Prime Minister’s Office, Union Minister Smriti Irani, Delhi CM’s office, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, among others.He also posted his mobile phone number and stated that the staff and doctors will be responsible if anything happens to him. He said if the government wants to save people, then it should start looking into what is happening at the government hospitals as by keeping positive and negative suspects together will not help contain the virus.Another IT professional, who lives in Vijay Nagar, said he had arrived from Nigeria on March 22.“On March 29, I developed a mild fever and cold. So I decided to get myself tested. My sample was taken on March 30. I was told that the report will come in 24 hours. But , it is April 5 and I am yet to receive my report. My family in Varanasi is worried,” he said.“The officials told us that as per the revised policy, three samples will be taken from each patient and we will have to remain in isolation for 14 days. I am ready to stay for 14 days. But if I am negative, I should be shifted to the quarantine ward,” he said.Another patient who lives in Vijay Nagar and works with Noida-based company, Ceasefire, said that he arrived at the isolation ward with four others on April 1.“We, too, are yet to get our test reports. Our samples were taken on April 1. None of us has symptoms at present,” he said.Dr Gupta said it generally takes three days to get the results. “Some reports are received in a day while others arrive within two or three days. Some reports may also take up to fie days. However, we will enquire why the reports are delayed. Patients should not worry. We will also ask our counselling team to speak to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/test-reports-delayed-patient-in-isolation-vent-his-worry-on-social-media/story-MD5gt99hsl330htasKlr5I.html
06-04-2020||Noida||Noida: Schools, colleges not to ask for fee from parents during lockdown period||Taking serious note of parents’ concern regarding fee notices from various schools and colleges in the midst of the nationwide lockdown to curb the Covid-19 outbreak, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has directed all schools and educational institutes not to ask for fees from parents till the 21-day lockdown is over.District magistrate Suhas LY said if people are not able to submit their wards’ fees during the lockdown period, it won’t affect the students’ enrollment to online classes, being offered by different educational institutes.“If any school is found to have compelled guardians to pay fees during the lockdown period, the school head will either have to face one year’s imprisonment or will have to pay monetary fine, or both. If the fee notices appear to be causing loss to the masses, the jail term could be extended to two years for the errant school heads,” he said.Welcoming this order, Yatendra Kasana, president of Noida parents’ association, said the step will provide respite to the parents who have repeatedly been asked by schools to deposit the fees. “We have raised this demand with the district administration that parents must be given some exemption from paying the fees for the first quarter of the present academic session in this time of crisis. It has come as a big relief as schools had been asking for fees which were hiked exuberantly, beyond the permissible limit of 8%. This order will certainly bring relief to the thousands of people who are facing a financial crisis due to the Covid-19 outbreak,” he said.Kasana added that this order will also give respite to all those parents who were apprehensive about getting permissions for online classes for their wards from their respective schools.When contacted, Kamini Bhasin, the principal of Delhi Public School in Sector-30, who is also the president of Noida unaided schools’ association and a member of the district fee regulatory committee, said her school is following all guidelines issued by the district administration. “We have neither compelled the parents to deposit the fees nor has it been hiked beyond the permissible limit,” she said.When asked about other unaided schools of the district, she said the unaided schools’ association is a platform to discuss various issues. “We can’t force other schools to follow us. However, I do not know whether other schools are following the district administration’s guidelines,” she said.The DM, earlier, had also asked landlords in the district not to compel tenants to pay their monthly rentals and urged them not to ask the renters to vacate if they fail to make payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-schools-colleges-not-to-ask-for-fee-from-parents-during-lockdown-period/story-gWjm88c20R5JJKwR5O370L.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Alaknanda turns to digital artis, meditation to stay connected||At 5pm daily, a small group of residents of Mandakini Enclave in south Delhi’s Alaknanda meditate and then later share their experiences with each other. This has been their routine for over a week now. The participants of this group, however, have not met each other physically ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown last month. Anshu Bhandari, president of Mandakini Enclave residents’ welfare association, says he started this group on WhatsApp to help people stay calm in “these tough times”. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic “We share an audio or video clip related to meditation on the WhatsApp group and listen to it together while sitting at our homes. We then share our experience in the group. This has been really helpful, as most of us have not stepped out of the house or the block.”Almost 500 metres away, in Aravali Apartments, one of the 12 residential societies in Alaknanda, which largely has DDA flats, Poonam Arora has been connecting with people while practising social distancing. Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative asking people to come out in their balconies to clap and clang utensils to thank doctors, nurses and those at the frontline on the battle against COVID-19, Poonam organised an aarti (a prayer) on the third day of Navratri. “I have a loudspeaker, so I called people to their balconies and we sang the aarti at 7pm,” she said. On Ram Navami (last day of the Navratras), Arora and her 10-odd friends participated in a joint celebration online. “We all downloaded a mobile application and sang bhajans. This is helping us stay connected and most importantly, stay calm,” said Arora. Spread over an area of nearly 1 square kilometre, Alaknanda has over 12 residential apartments, mostly DDA flats and is surrounded by Chittaranjan Park, Greater Kailash-II and Govindpuri. As the number of Covid-19 cases began to increase in the national capital and after the lockdown was announced, the RWAs in the area decided to stop entry of vendors, domestic helps, online delivery and courier service people; banned evening and morning walks and even restricted the number of entry gates that are open. “We have got arterial roads barricaded to ensure minimum movement in the area. The entry to all residential societies is restricted. Also, we have been coordinating with the local councillor to get disinfectant sprayed in all the societies,” said Saurabh Mishra, president of the federation of Alaknanda RWAs and a resident of Shivalik Apartments. Several societies have procured thermal scanners to screen those entering the society, including their sanitation and security staff. As for guards and sanitation staff coming to the residential neighbourhood, the RWAs have provided sanitizers and facility to wash hands at the gates. The restriction on entry of domestic helps, residents admit, has posed a problem for some senior citizens. Bhandari said that the RWAs are in constant touch with the elderly people living in their localities. After the lockdown, Mandakini Enclave, which has 600-plus flats, has formed a ward-wise or block-wise WhatsApp group. “Though we have common WhatsApp group for all the residents, a ward-wise group was formed after the lockdown was announced.. Each block member looks after senior citizens in their ward or block,” she said. Most societies have just kept one or two gates open and temporarily suspended door-to-door collection of waste. In some societies, waste is collected from homes of elderly people while others have to come down and hand over their waste to the garbage trucks. “This has been done to minimise the chances of spread of the infection. So far, there are no positive cases from Alaknanda, though there were a few people in home quarantine,” said Ajay Kumar Lal, a resident of the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/alaknanda-turns-to-digital-artis-meditation-to-stay-connected/story-u8fPmICWipE0QhlNnMkbpI.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Many health workers in Delhi infected by Covid-19||In just over a month since the first Covid-19 case was reported in Delhi, at least 24 healthcare workers—doctors, nurses, sanitation staff—have tested positive for the disease in the city. While a couple of them had a history of international travel, some of them—like the doctor couple who worked in two mohalla clinics in north-east Delhi and a resident doctor of respiratory medicine in Safdarjung Hospital—were infected via their patients. For the others—like the two doctors and six nurses from Delhi State Cancer Institute and the resident doctor from AIIMS—the source of infection is unclear. Around 108 staff members from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital had to be quarantined after coming in contact with two Covid-19 cases unknowingly. Similarly, around 81 people from Maharaja Agrasen Hospital were quarantined after two of the patients admitted to the hospital for almost 20 days tested positive for the disease. One doctor, three nurses, and a member of the housekeeping staff have also tested positive at the hospital. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAll hospitals, including private ones, have been screening every patient for fever, cough and travel history before they are allowed in. So far, Delhi has reported 503 cases of Covid-19, of which 320 are linked to Tablighi Jamaat. So many healthcare workers have taken ill, at a time when the Delhi government is preparing for a surge in the numbers of up to 1,000 cases a day. Why are so many healthcare workers getting infected? Experts believe it is because they are out and about during the lockdown. “Currently, most people are at home so they are not being exposed to the infection. However, doctors are out and about. They are also more likely to come in contact with people who have the infection at hospitals and clinics. And, no matter how much screening you do, there is bound to be 20 to 30% of the people who will not have fever or cough yet will be able to transmit the infection to the doctors,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.So, what can be done? Virologist Dr Jacob John says universal respiratory protection is what will keep the doctors safe for the upcoming surge.“I have been saying this. Everyone needs to wear a mask. Patients—even if they are going to a hospital with a broken toe—should wear a surgical mask. The doctors should all wear N-95 masks. But that is not all, they should also wear goggles that can be sanitised every day to prevent the infection from entering through their eyes. This is for every doctor, even in clinics. As for those in Covid-19 wards, the government has to ensure proper protection. We need all our doctors when the numbers shoot up,” he said.For judicious use of the limited personal protective equipment (PPE) stock and to ensure no cross-infection, the Delhi government has dedicated two of its hospitals only for Covid-19 patients.“No other patients will be seen in these two hospitals. This is a great step by the government to prevent cross infections. This also ensures that our PPEs are used judiciously, at the same time all our doctors and healthcare workers get adequate protection,” said Dr JC Passey, medical director, Lok Nayak Hospital campus, which is one of the two centres to become dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. No doctor from the hospital has got the infection so far, even though it has the highest number of Covid-19 positive and suspected cases.The government has also ensured that after working for 14 days at a time, all the healthcare workers in the Covid-19 wards get to stay in hostels on campus or in luxury hotels so that they do not go home and pass on the infection.Central government hospitals like Safdarjung and Dr RML, which also have isolation wards, have arranged for accommodation for healthcare workers in hostels on campus. The 28-year-old Covid-19-positive senior resident from the physiology department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences had passed on the infection to his wife who was nine months pregnant. She delivered a healthy baby boy at the hospital on Friday. The sanitation worker from AIIMS trauma centre, who tested positive for Covid-19, had passed on the infection to his wife, another sanitation worker in Charak Palika Hospital.The shortage of quality PPEs—full-body suit, goggles, mask, gloves, and shoe covers—is another problem that the governments are facing in their Covid-19 fight. “Due to the shortage in the market, several small manufacturers have come up and their products are not always quality, but one or two out of five manufacturers can give us decent PPE kits,” said an official from Lok Nayak Hospital.The Delhi government has asked the centre for around 200,000 PPE kits and their Central Procurement Agency (CPA), which is responsible for buying all medicines, consumables and equipment for Delhi government-run hospitals, already has a tender in place for 1,20,000 PPE kits with three companies, which are being supplied piecemeal. Most hospitals have just about enough and are working on using them judiciously. “We have around 1,800 kits in our store, around 500 are needed in a day. But, there is another shipment scheduled to arrive on Tuesday,” said a doctor from Safdarjung Hospital.“The doctors are a part of our society and they are susceptible to the infection like everyone else. We need to examine where all of them got the infection from. Plus, we also need to ensure not only the availability of PPE kits but also that they are being used and taken off properly,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/why-are-so-many-doctors-infected-in-delhi/story-xrQY3VQkKO18yo9uNLnccJ.html
06-04-2020||India||Anti-malaria drug is the best bet against Covid-19 until a cure is created||A cheap, safe and widely available drug that has been used to treat malaria for at least a century has emerged as the most sought-after medicine in the world after preliminary trials from China said it boosted recovery and lowered the severity of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has sickened 1.2 million and killed 65,000 around the world within four months.India on Saturday completely banned the export of hydroxychloroquine, of which it is the world’s biggest producer, even as President Donald Trump urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to send the medicine to the United States, which has reported at least 300,000 cases and close to 8,500 deaths.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA blanket ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine and its active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are the chemicals used to manufacture the drug, will help India stockpile and ramp up production at very short notice. India has approved the use of the drug as prophylaxis to protect health workers and close contacts of Covid-19 patients from infection.What majorly boosted the global demand for hydroxychloroquine were the results of a small placebo-controlled clinical trial in China that demonstrated the anti-malarial drug shortened the duration and reduced the severity of cough, fever and pneumonia in patients with mild and moderate disease. Hydroxychloroquine also prevented the illness from worsening in patients given the drug, compared to the placebo group, said the study, which was published on medRxiv, which publishes studies before peer-review to expedite access to new research.A placebo-controlled trial is done with two groups of patients, one of which is given a placebo with no drug action, while the drug is tested on another group. This method rules out bias in the outcome and ensures the drug’s effects are actually caused by the treatment and not external factors.Since the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is about four months old, clinicians worldwide have been depending on experimental therapies using existing drugs in different permutations and combinations to treat symptoms and stop disease progression.Repurposing medicines with established safety and drug action on the human body is the fastest way to treat new diseases against which there is no clinically proven treatment. It allows clinicians and public health specialists to begin treatment until drugs and vaccines with specific action against Covid-19 are approved. China, France, South Korea, Italy and now the United States are using antimalarials with some success to treat people severely ill with Covid-19 even though to a recent paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine said “data to support the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are limited and inconclusive”. It added there was an urgent need for well-done, randomised clinical trials to test potential therapies, including hydroxychloroquine.No drug has been approved to treat Covid-19, which leads to potentially fatal complications in about 5% of the people infected. India has approved the combination of two antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, lopinavir and ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively), to treat Covid-19, but the first major study of Covid-19 treatment published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) found it did not work on severely ill patients in China. “Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement,” concluded the study based on randomised, controlled trial on 199 hospitalised patients in China.Globally, there are 332 registered clinical trials, of which 188 are open for recruitment and 146 trials are preparing to recruit, found review of clinical trial registries as of March 24, published in the scientific journal, The Lancet. Most of these trials are taking place in China, South Korea, and high-income countries in Europe and North America. In the absence of an evidence-base therapy, there is a critical need for large, multi-centric controlled clinical trials in limited-resource settings. India’s Empowered Committee on Covid-19 Response is boosting national innovation in the development of vaccine, drugs and diagnostic kits in the country. India is part of the World Health Organization’s multi-country solidarity trial to study potential treatments for Covid-19 to be conducted in Asia, South Africa, Europe, and the Americas. A Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator was launched on Friday to bring together global multidisciplinary expertise and clinical trial capacity to accelerate multicentre trials of the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But until we have a specific drug, therapy or vaccine against Covid-19, drugs like hydroxychloroquine are the best bets to treat and protect patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/healthwise-using-anti-malaria-drugs-to-treat-and-protect/story-7CpCOklOgvPdDTBSWGdOPP.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt may start taking over private hospitals for treating Covid patients||Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal has directed the state health department , as part of a contingency plan, to identify private hospitals which can be taken over by the government ‘if needed’, in light of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital, senior officials said on Sunday.The direction was issued during a review meeting on Saturday and an identification process is underway, an official in Delhi chief minister’s office confirmed.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA senior officer in L-G’s office said, “It is a contingency plan. In government hospitals, treatment for patients suffering from diseases other than Covid-19 cannot be stopped. In view of this, private hospitals can be engaged for the same. Officials have been asked to prepare a list of private hospitals, that can be taken over if needed.”Till Sunday evening, Delhi had recorded 503 Covid-19 cases and seven deaths, the government said.Delhi currently has at least 24 private hospitals which cumulatively offer more than 300 isolation beds for treating Covid-19 patients.Max hospitals in Saket and Patparganj opened up a total of 40 isolation beds this week, the healthcare group had earlier said in a statement.On Sunday, a spokesperson of Max Healthcare group told HT: “We are in a position to quickly scale-up the number of beds across our facilities. In fact, the hospital is working towards creating a dedicated Covid-19 hospital if needed.”A spokesperson of BLK hospital in Rajendra Place said: “We have already streamlined numerous processes, such as isolated designated areas, for first-level the screening process of patients suspected of having the virus. We can scale up our efforts if needed.”Indraprastha Apollo hospital in South East Delhi’s Sarita Vihar has created a 12-bed isolation facility which is likely to be increased to 30 beds in the coming week, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-may-start-taking-over-private-hospitals-for-treating-covid-patients/story-PuoJIn9vhKiGsGbD9UWMxM.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||All Covid patients in Delhi to be shifted to 2 designated hospitals||To contain the spread of Covid-19, the Delhi government has moved to bring all such patients to two of its hospitals dedicated to treat the disease in the city.After the Nizamuddin Markaz gathering came to light, the Delhi government began preparations for a possible surge in cases and designated five of its tertiary care hospitals as Covid-19 centres on March 31. However, the government has now worked out that enough beds were available in two such hospitals and that it would be better to marshal its resources and dedicate them solely for the treatment of Covid-19.A total of 177 Covid-19 patients — 38 in Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital in Hari Nagar, 30 in Dr Baba Sahib Ambedkar Medical College and Hospital in Rohini and 109 in Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in Dilshad garden — are being moved to Lok Nayak Hospital near Delhi Gate, which is treating 319 such patients, and Rajiv Gandhi Super-speciality Hospital at Tahirpur, which is treating 155 such patients. These hospitals treat both confirmed and suspected patients.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDelhi currently has 503 confirmed patients, some of whom are being treated in other private and public hospitals.At present, the three hospitals were treating patients with other conditions too, although Covid-19 patients were being treated in an isolated ward. They will remain among the designated hospitals to treat the disease in case numbers surge.“There are about 2,000 beds in Lok Nayak and associated GB Pant hospital and another 450 in Rajiv Gandhi hospital, these are enough to treat the number of Covid-19 patients that are there currently. The decision was taken to completely stop intermixing of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients in all the hospitals thus reducing the risk of transmission to other people coming to these hospitals,” said a senior official from the Delhi government.In turn, Lok Nayak Hospital has been directed to shift all its services, including maternity and paediatric care, to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. Some of the critical paediatric surgery patients will be moved to Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya.Some surgical emergency services of the hospital will be run from Sushruta Trauma Centre in Civil Lines.Indoor patients from the superspeciality hospital Govind Ballabh Pant, included in the Lok Nayak hospital complex, will be transferred to government hospitals like AIIMS and to other private hospitals.Lok Nayak hospital had earlier shifted its out-patient clinics to the separate orthopaedics block and finally shut it down Saturday onwards.“Our out-patient clinics were right in the middle of two blocks where Covid-19 patients were being treated, which increased the chances of people with Covid-19 coming in contact with those who did not have it, increasing the risk of transmission of the disease. So, we had moved the clinics to the ground floor of the orthopaedic block, which has a separate entrance and is not connected to the main hospital building. It was later decided to close the services altogether,” said Dr JC Passey, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital campus, which includes the government’s superspeciality hospital GB Pant.The hospital had also moved its surgical emergency to Sushruta Trauma Centre in Civil Lines.With around 2,500 beds dedicated for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, the health secretary has also directed various departments to start scaling up isolation beds outside the hospital. According to the minutes of the meeting, the Sarin committee report had estimated that for every 2,500 patients admitted to the hospitals, the requirement of isolation beds outside the hospital for people with mild symptoms would be 10,000.“The facilities outside hospital may be created either in hotels, dharmashalas, or banquet halls,” the minutes of the meeting say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-stem-infection-risk-all-covid-patients-being-moved-to-two-designated-city-hospitals/story-Mg9KUXnzOYYv6pR9qGljwO.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s homeless children having tough time in lockdown||Kuldeep Singh, 15, who calls a patch of footpath under a flyover near Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium his home, has been dependent on others for his meals since the lockdown. “Outsiders or NGOs get khichdi for us daily and it causes stomach ache. Due to the curfew, we cannot step out to collect wood and cook our meals or earn a livelihood. There have been times when my family has gone to sleep on an empty stomach,” he says.Kuldeep is among the thousands of street children in Delhi who are bearing the brunt of the lockdown. Often, neither them nor their families are aware of the government relief measures.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSanjay Gupta, director of Childhood Enhancement Through Training and Action (CHETNA), says, “Many of these children live in inner lanes and bylanes of the city and it has been difficult to reach out to them considering how our movement has also been restricted.” The non-governmental organisation works for homeless street children.Last year, a survey conducted by the Delhi Commission for Protection for Child Rights (DCPCR) across the national capital had identified over 70,000 children who were found to be in ‘street situation’. Most, according to the survey, were either found engaged as labourers in factories and stalls or found begging or indulging in substance abuse.“Even before the lockdown, these children struggled in getting their daily meals and often relied on leftovers found in trains that arrived at Nizamuddin station. Now, with the lockdown, that option no longer exists for them,” says Gupta, adding that the lockdown will lead to behavioural changes in the children, which can only be assessed at later stages.Social workers and activists are also finding it difficult to contact the street children living near Nizamuddin or Sarai Kale Khan. Nizamuddin has become one of the biggest cluster for Covid-19 in India.“Local RWAs prevent movement in their area fearing the spread of the virus. Besides, the Nizamuddin issue has made them more cautious. So far, we haven’t been able to establish a connection with these children ,” says Gupta. Though the government has converted over 500 schools into hunger relief centres, the street children are yet to benefit from them.Indu Prakash, member of the Supreme Court-appointed state-level shelter monitoring committee and a member of the advisory panel on food relief work, says, “The nutrition of children has been hit. The children in many areas can’t access these centres because of police personnel beating them.”Sanitation issues is also a major challenge. “We know we have to wash our hands to protect ourselves against the virus. But we don’t get so much water,” says Kuldeep. “Even the public toilets are not clean.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/homeless-children-having-tough-time-in-lockdown/story-XyK6iSyinlRocNEz5MUfgM.html
06-04-2020||Pune||In act of solidarity, to light candle of hope, Pune switches off at 9pm||The ‘9 pm for 9 minutes’ call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi was followed through by many residents in the city.Most saw it as an act of unity to stand together to fight against Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection.Several street lights were switched off in many areas, while people stood out in their balconies, waving their mobile flashlights, some lighting diyas and candles, and children shouting ‘Go Corona’ at the top of their voice.Parmar society in Salunke Vihar, which has 200 flats, observed diya ceremony with fanfare. Ashita Pillai, a resident said, “We are following the tradition set by the PM to ward off Covid-19. Last time, we clapped hands as told by the Prime Minister and this time it was lightening of diya to dispel darkness.”While another society Ganga Kingston in Wanowrie where there are 2,000 residents, felt that this act was a part of the oneness of this nation against deadly Covid-19.Rutuja Pawar, a committee member of Ganga Kingston Society, said, “We observed it as it was aimed at removing depression and fear from the minds of the people.”In Phursungi, 400 families of a society came together lighting candles and standing in their balcony. “It is a symbol of showing unity and augmenting the leadership of the country, where we are standing with mobile / lights in the balcony to show solidarity,” said Satya Natrajan, a resident oF Phursungi.Some residents felt residents like Megha Shimpi of Gokhalenagar felt, “By doing shows of solidarity, one is not going to scare Covid-19, instead I am donating to the chief minister’s relief fund, for that is the need of the hour, where our doctors are fighting a battle against this disease and need all the protection they can get to help save lives.”Arvind Mishra, a resident in Pashan, said, “I don’t think, by switching off electricity for nine minutes will help in the fight against the coronavirus. Instead, if the people unite together and follow rules and maintain social distancing, that will help reduce the cases.”Vedant Patkar, a student living in Aundh, “We switched off the lights and took a break for ten minutes. We need to respect our prime minister and hence I followed it, despite me having project submissions online.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-act-of-solidarity-to-light-candle-of-hope-pune-switches-off-at-9pm/story-Cj9GzZfmlzvmMs1vKOqE6K.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi MCD workers subjected to taunts||Forty-four-year-old Lekhraj Singh has been suffering shoulder pains at nights over the last week. A field worker of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), he carries a 10-litre backpack tank of disinfectant to spray at quarantined households every day. “Even the heavy laptops you carry on your back to office don’t weigh more than three kilos,” he says, with a smile.Singh has been spraying mosquito larvicide in drains for the last 13 years, for a monthly salary of ₹13,300, which, he says is meagre, compared to what the abroad returns, whose houses he is spraying disinfectant in, make.“I have been provided a list of addresses, of those who have recently returned from abroad or a visit to the airport. I have been asked to cover the Khel Gaon (CWG) Towers near Akshardham and Mayur Vihar, particularly. My job is to reach their doorsteps, inform them of my purpose and spray the sodium hypochlorite solution on their doors, especially the knobs/handles, doorbells and vehicles,” he says.When asked if the residents acknowledge his efforts, he says that some people appreciate it. “About 10% of the people offer me water or tea, and I really appreciate that. The rest peek through their doors and then shut it, after which I do my job. Maybe they are just scared,” says Singh, shrugging it off.The weather, though, hasn’t been kind to Singh or the 124 other field workers deployed by the EDMC to do this job. “Most people are staying indoors due to the lockdown and don’t realise that it has become quite hot already,” he says.“It’s just the beginning of April, but the afternoons are hot and sunny. We (the field workers) move about on our bicycles. Some of us have motorbikes, but the corporation doesn’t compensate us for fuel expenses; so this is more economical. By the time I finish my work, which goes on from 9am to 5pm, I am drenched in sweat,” he says.The lockdown has created such a circumstance that in case of a tyre puncture, there is no repair shop to be found, he says. In a few instances, workers’ bicycles have been stolen while the workers are disinfecting an area inside a building. “This happened to my colleagues last week. Thankfully, it hasn’t happened to me so far,” Singh says.Besides, Singh says that the workers have to put up with misbehaviour quite often. “On March 31, I was leaving the house of a quarantined family when a man shouted at me from his balcony — ‘O Macchar! Yahan bhi spray maar ja.’ (Hey mosquito! Spray the disinfectant here as well),” he says, about name-calling, which has become common.However, he says that he will continue to do his work meticulously. He says that the happiest part of his day is when he can spend time with his family. “My wife Sunita keeps badgering me to stay home, but I feel one must not turn their back on their duty. Besides, when my two sons, both of whom are in college, find employment, I can enjoy my time at home,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mcd-sprayer-doing-back-breaking-work-with-a-smile/story-GFFkWQSETJWdg4tCcKRBPK.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Suspected Covid-19 patient in Delhi attempts suicide, fractures legs||A 37-year-old suspected Covid-19 patient tried to kill himself by jumping off the third floor of the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital building in central Delhi late Saturday, the police said.The man’s legs were fractured. He is being treated at the hospital, they said. They added that the man, a shopkeeper, does not have any travel history abroad, and his test reports are awaited.“Prima facie, it appears that he was depressed and feared being infected with Covid-19,” a police officer said. The police said the man is not from the Nizamuddin Markaz, from where more than 2,300 people, including foreigners, were evacuated by authorities after many across the country who had attended a religious congregation there were found Covid-19 positive. Sanjay Bhatia, the deputy commissioner of police (central), said the man, who lives with his family in a residential area not too far from the hospital, had walked into the hospital on March 31, complaining about cold and cough. After initial medical tests, the doctors said he was suffering from regular flu and had no symptoms of Covid-19.“They discharged him but he returned the same day and insisted on being admitted so that his tests could be done again. The man was admitted,” Bhatia said, adding that the result of the man’s test for Covid-19 test was awaited.On Saturday around 11.30pm, DCP Bhatia said, the man jumped from the third floor of the hospital. He first fell on the metal roof below and then landed on the ground, because of which he survived, but fractured his legs.“Doctors have told us that his condition is stable,” Bhatia said.An official from the hospital, which has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, also confirmed that the suspected patient jumped from the building. “We do not know the reason yet. He is alive and his injuries are currently being evaluated and treatment is being given,” the official said.“Whether it was a suicide or accident is being investigated,” another senior official from the hospital administration said.On March 18, a 35-year-old man who had returned from Sydney and immediately moved to Safdarjung Hospital on suspicion of being infected with Covid-19 allegedly killed himself by jumping from the hospital building. An official from the hospital had said that the man was suspected of being infected with the virus, but the disease was not confirmed, as his test result was awaited. His test reports later showed that he didn’t have the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/suspected-covid-19-patient-attempts-to-kill-self-fractures-legs/story-9zXfVlXnWGvyA3viNlm7cK.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi man arrested for impersonating customs official to circumvent lockdown||A 30-year-old man was arrested for impersonating a senior customs official and using a forged identity card to avoid the lockdown restrictions on the movement of private vehicles across Delhi-NCR, the police said on Sunday.The police seized a Swift Dzire car from the man along with the forged identity card. The man, identified as Suraj Singh Bisht, was driving the Dzire car which had “Government of India” written over it, the police said. They also seized a police uniform from him.Bisht is private driver by profession and used to work for a government official, a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOn April 3, the officer said, a police team from the Patparganj Industrial Area police station was deployed at Anand Vihar to implement the lockdown and prosecute those motorists who were violating the prohibitory orders. Around 6.30 pm, the policemen stopped the white Dzire car and asked its driver to show his “curfew pass”-issued by Delhi Police and Delhi government for the movement of essential service providers. The driver produced a government identity card in the name of Suraj Singh Bisht which mentioned his designation as an assistant commissioner from the customs department. The police said that the identity card looked suspicious and the driver was asked to furnish another identity card.“The driver then produced his driving license. When the policemen looked at the minute details mentioned on the identity cards, they detected that date of birth mentioned on both the identity cards was different. When the driver was questioned, he confessed that the identity card showing him as ‘assistant commissioner’ was forged. He said he got it prepared by scanning the original identity card of a government official,” a statement by the police said.During questioning, Bisht also confessed that he had got forged the identity card to cross toll plazas and was using it to drive around Delhi-NCR amid the lockdown, the officer added.A case was registered in the matter at the Patparganj Industrial Area police station under sections 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471(using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/30-year-old-man-impersonates-customs-official-to-avoid-lockdown-restrictions-arrested/story-ugbkYvjCGxOeWZgIMR0u9O.html

The total count is now 84 in the city, and 105 in Pune district, according to district authorities. No new cases were reported in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Sunday.The Jamaat Tablighi cases have become a contributing factor, but residents not following the social distancing norms, especially in congested pockets on of the city has also led to a surge in the number of cases, according to officials.Naval Kishore Ram, district collector, said, “In some slum areas and congested pockets of the city, the social distancing norm is not being followed and so, this is one of the reasons for the rise in the number of cases.”“There were five fresh Covid-19 infections reported due to the Delhi’s Tablighi Markaz event which is a contributing factor too,” added Ram.As of Sunday 6pm, there were 61 cases in PMC, eight in rural areas of the district and 15 in Sassoon hospital, according to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).The five people who spent their incubation period and tested negative twice for the infection after 24 hours were discharged from Naidu hospital. Out of the 1,306 admissions up until now, 1,217 have been tested negative while 15 have been discharged in Pune city after being cured of the infection, according to PMC.There are 71 people still admitted at various hospitals of the city and are in stable condition while two are in critical condition.

06-04-2020||Pune||Eight Tanzanian nationals who tested Covid -ve twice; booked for violating assembly prohibition orders in Pune||The Pune police booked eight nationals of Tanzania of the Tablighi Jamaat for allegedly carrying out community-related services during the lockdown period. Among the eight, four are women and four are men. They were sent to the Naidu Hospital for a Covid-19 test twice - on Sunday and once on March 24. On both the instances, they were found to have tested negative for Covid-19, according to assistant police inspector PR Shikalgar of Samarth police station who is investigating the case.They were all found at Chand Tara Masjid in Nana peth which is the local head office of Tablighi Jamaat, according to API Shikalgar.“They were found by the Wanowrie police station officials once on March 24 and a test was conducted on them. They had tested negative then and were advised to remain in home quarantine. However, since then, they visited multiple other masjids, against the advice. They have tested negative today as well. However, now they are in institutional quarantine at Draupadibai Khedekar Hospital in Bopodi,” said API Shikalgar.Their passports were seized and a case under Sections 188, 269, 270 of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 14 of Foreigners Act, 1946; Section 3 and 4 of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and Section 21 of Maharashtra Covid-19 regulations has been registered at the Samarth police station against the eight people.

The embassy has asked Sharda University to make arrangements for the students to reach the IGI airport from the university campus. “Due to the Covid-19 situation, the Royal Government of Bhutan is planning to evacuate its citizens from India to Bhutan on a special flight. The students will have to travel from their current location to Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi so that they can all travel together in the same flight,” said Dolay Tshering, education attache, Royal Bhutanese Embassy in his letter to the Sharda University authorities.The Bhutanese government is sending its national carrier Druk Air to evacuate the students and its other citizens. A total of 41 students from Gautam Budh Nagar will go back to Bhutan in the special flight that will leave at 2pm on April 9. Out of 41 students, 39 are from Sharda University while two are from other colleges. “We have been in touch with various embassies since the Covid-19 outbreak started to ensure that no student or their family member gets worried. The Bhutanese embassy has asked us to make arrangements for vehicles so that the students can reach the airport. We will take all the required permissions to drop these students to the airport,” said Ashok Daryani, director, international relations, Sharda University.Over 94 Bhutanese nationals study at Sharda University, out of which 60 have opted for staying the university hostel. Currently, 25 students are living in the hostel, while 14 are staying outside the campus. Few of the students had left before the national lockdown was announced, the university officials said.“The students will leave in a Druk Air flight from Delhi to Paro on April 9. Recently, the government had also taken over Sharda Hospital to treat Covid-19 patients, and we are in touch with the concerned officials to get the required permission to facilitate the students’ travel to the international airport amid ongoing lockdown. The Bhutanese Embassy is also trying to get the permission for hassle-free movement of students from our campus to the airport,” Daryani added.Students who will leave for Bhutan want to get back to their families soon and said they are scared that it will take months for everything to get back to normal. “It looks that it is going to take a long time before things get back to normal so we are happy that our government has made arrangements for us to go back home. I am not sure about when I will come back to India as we don’t know how long it will take for the situation to come under control. The university authorities are providing us all the facilities, but we want to go back to our families,” said Tenzin Drakpa, 24, a third-year BBA student.“A lot of our friends have gone back home. Few of us are left behind, and some of us are inside the campus. University authorities are taking the pandemic seriously and our following the lockdown instruction strictly, nobody is allowed to leave the campus or to come inside. We are hopeful that the situation gets normal soon,” Ugyen Dema, 20, another third-year BBA student, said.More than 3,000 foreign nationals study in Greater Noida, out of which, over 2,000 students are pursuing various courses at Sharda University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bhutanese-students-to-be-evacuated-in-a-special-flight/story-tTpAAsgWjU5KO68lCrqM5I.html
06-04-2020||Pune||Pune division’s PPE, mask supply for doctors shows little margin for error||With at least seven Mumbai doctors testing positive for the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, as of Sunday, April 5, the safety of front-line medical practitioners in Pune is now in the spotlight.Data released by divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar’s office shows that the Pune division has access to 2,282 personal protective equipment (PPEs) kits; 29,600 N-95 masks; and 1,93,365 triple layer masks.These are currently available in government hospitals across the Pune division of western Maharashtra. Is that enough?Dr Sanjay Patil, former president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune chapter, says, “There are 200 doctors in government hospitals in Pune city alone; 200 in the rural areas of Pune district; and 300 in Sassoon hospital. IMA has 4,800 doctor members in Pune district. Most of these doctors need basic masks and those in the high-risk departments like ENT, ophthalmology, pulmonary and infectious diseases, need PPE, while other doctors need at least masks. With increasing cases in children, paediatricians also need the PPE. “While private doctors are willing to pay for the kits, the problem is that there are no kits or masks available in the market. Even when we give bulk orders to traders we have to pay four times the cost of the kits to vendors and deposit the entire amount in advance,” Dr Patil says.In Pune district, the number of Covid-19-positive patients has crossed 100, while city has witnessed a total of six deaths attributed to the virus, till Sunday evening. Currently, patients infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus are being treated at 24 hospitals in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, including Naidu hospital, Sassoon hospital and the YCM hospital. Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra chapter president, Dr Avinash Bhondwe said, “We have asked the government to provide us with safety kits for private doctors and those who run small clinics, as all doctors are equally exposed to the risk of infection. Currently, only government hospital staff is being provided the kits, but if the government wants private OPDs to function then the private doctors need to be supplied with these kits.”District collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “We are prepared with enough stock of the kits and we are working with the state government to fulfil our requirements.” Dr Bhondwe says, “We have submitted a list of doctors who will require the masks and kits because currently doctors at OPDs are working without masks and risking their lives. The government has promised to supply the stock whenever possible.” Pvt donations build up PPE, mask stocks Responding to a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Pune appeal, to donate /contribute with requisite materials needed for the prevention, protection and testing of Covid-19, the following donations have been made: •Sany Heavy Industries donated 16,000 N95 Masks on March 28,•Starcke Abrasives India donated 5,000 pairs of gloves on March 28 •Elkay Chemicals donated 200 PPE (full kit) on March 31•Kion India donated 450 PPE (full kit) on April 1 GE India donated to Pune Police and Pune Municipal Corporation on April 2 •3-ply surgical masks - 20,000 nosN-95 masks – 1,000 nosHand sanitizer (500 ml bottles) - 100 nosDisposable surgical hand gloves - 100 boxes, 50 pairs in each box||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-division-s-ppe-mask-supply-for-doctors-shows-little-margin-for-error/story-MWMSrfjZGVkwtgOh0PCtEN.html
06-04-2020||Pune||On the Frontline: People’s participation vital to conquer Covid-19, says mobile dispensary coordinator Shashikant Munot||Shashikant Munot of the Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana (BJS) is the project coordinator of the mobile dispensary service, one of the projects undertaken by the sanghatana. He is also a social worker, a banker and hails from Ahmednagar. He speaks to HT about the work the BJS has undertaken and hurdles faced while reaching out to patients affected by Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection.What is the ground-report for the services BJS is involved in?We have undertaken three projects. In the first project, we have set up a quarantine facility for 2,000 patients at the hostel of Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana at Wagholi, which has been handed over to the Maharashtra government. Under the second project, we are collecting 20,000 units of blood because a massive need for blood will arise after April 14. All the surgeries which have been put on hold will begin. With the resumption of traffic, there will be road accidents and overall, there will be a high demand for blood. We have prepared for that situation. The third project the mobile dispensary service along with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) with the support of Force Motors.Personally, how does this determine your average day?At the start of the day I call and coordinate with the drivers of all 15 mobile dispensaries. We wash all the vehicles and sanitise them, which I personally overlook. I also have to make sure that all the vehicles have enough medicines and surgical equipment like thermometers, stethoscope, blood pressure operator, make sure everyone has N95 masks - the health care workers and drivers. Doctors also need personal protective equipment (PPE) which is vital. I also have to check whether the PA system is working and the tanks of the vehicles are full. I also coordinate with the doctors and we discuss the spots we have to visit for that particular day.I am also incharge of material procurement which includes medicines,PPEs and mask kits. In the evening I have to collect the data and make a record of the day’s work - number of patients and doctors reports.What precautions are you taking personally?I perform yoga daily for 45 minutes when I get up at 5.15 am. Then I sit to plan my day and make sure I have my breakfast on time and my medicines, as I have a heart ailment. It is imperative that I stay fit. While working with my staff, I always wear the mask and every half an hour use sanitiser to wash my hands.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 situation in Pune? The authorities in the city have taken many preventive and containment measures and are on their toes to stop the spread of Covid-19.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?The crisis is well contained in the city. People from all walks of life are stepping out to help the needy with food packets and even many are feeding stray animals. The only problem is the complete participation of the general public in this fight. They should comply with rules put in place by the government and take all the necessary precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-frontline-people-s-participation-vital-to-conquer-covid-19-says-mobile-dispensary-coordinator-shashikant-munot/story-ebU7N9JFzy1YkBe2la4QqO.html
06-04-2020||Pune||Lockdown gameplan: Swimmer Mihir Ambre’s 2 breakfasts, 2 workouts, one online gameplay strategy||Winning medals in the pool is a habit for Mihir Ambre. The 20-year old, an international swimmer, has repeatedly showcased his talent at the Khelo India Games –winning five gold medals at Khelo India Guwahati (youth games), followed by three gold, one silver and one bronze medal at Khelo India Bhubaneshwar (university games).Ambre has also won one gold, one silver and one bronze at the South Asian Games in Kathmandu in 2019. Ambre started swimming at the age of 10 and till date, he has won 12 international medals. Ambre trains at Champions Aquatic Club, Kothrud, and Dolphin Aquatics, Bengaluru, stays at Mayur colony, Kothrud. Morning sessionCurrently my day starts at 9am. I have divided my breakfast in two parts –after waking up, I have a light breakfast of eggs and coffee, and then I work out – which includes all types of static and dynamic exercises on our terrace. These exercises are very important to keep yourself fit when you are not getting chance to train in the pool.Once these exercises are done, I have my heavy breakfast. I shift my focus to studies as I am currently in my second year of International Business Management. Giving time to study becomes very important as I have regular assignments and projects which are to be submitted on regular basis in the college.Afternoon sessionIt is all about leisure, as I spend time on the internet watching informative videos on YouTube. It is something which keeps me updated. Then, I rest for two hours.Evening sessionThis time is dedicated to fitness and after having my afternoon coffee, I do core stability, abs, flexibility, stretching and balancing. The session lasts for an hour and 30 minutes.Once it is done I have my dinner and then I play games like Counter Strike – Global Offensive and PubG, with my family and friends. Since these games are multiplayer games - I spend quality of time with my friends or family. Sometime I also play these games during the night.One thing which has happened during the lockdown, is I am able to play online games which I had not played for more than a year. In regular time, the schedule is so tight that I cannot spare time for all these activities.No gym, no poolI cannot have all the equipment at home so yes, the gym is missed, but I am keeping myself fit with the home work outs. The biggest missing is training in the swimming pool as replicating the swimming technique and stroke is difficult.We swimmers do have set of activities in the pool and which is completely missing due to the lockdown. HobbyI like listening music and it is in my daily schedule as it soothes my mind and body. And, then, the online games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-gameplan-day-10-swimmer-mihir-ambre-s-2-breakfasts-2-workouts-one-online-gameplay-strategy/story-StuGta2hKOaNRNh0bXVTnN.html

This compels us to realise that, similar to climate change, ignoring science can quickly intensify problems to a global scale,” said Professor Arnab Bhattacharya, who leads the TIFR Mumbai science communication initiative Chai and Why?.Partner institutions in CovidGyan initiative have diverse capabilities in scientific research, science communication, and science education. “It is extremely important to localise reliable scientific information, which takes into account the individual complexity of Indian conditions,” said Professor K. Subramaniam, director, Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/covidgyan-portal-launched-by-premier-research-institutes-for-latest-information-on-coronavirus/story-HmqdXEki0KrQtj1rxrfXgP.html
06-04-2020||Delhi||Steep drop in pollution since janta curfew, lockdown||Since the janta curfew was announced on March 22 and the country-wide lockdown two days later, particulate matter concentration in the Capital showed a significant fall, according to a central pollution control board (CPCB) report.Between March 22 and 23, PM10 concentration(coarse pollution particles with diameter less than 10 microns) fell by 44%, while that of PM2.5 (ultra fine particles) fell by 8% from peak values recorded on March 21. After lockdown, PM2.5 levels fell by 34%.While the March 22 curfew was a voluntary event on a Sunday, orders from the Delhi government prior to it had already shut down most schools and gyms, and advised citizens to remain indoors as much as possible. On March 23, the Delhi government clamped a lockdown in the city shutting all but essential services.The measures between March 22 and 23 are significant as there was a steep reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and aided by favourable weather.On the days, there was 51% drop in oxides of nitrogen (NOx)and 32% reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) levels compared to March 21.CPCB analysed the trends based on hourly PM10, PM2.5, NOx and CO data in the national capital region. Its scientists said favourable meteorological factors like rain and moderate wind speed also helped with dispersal of pollutants. “Air quality monitoring data reveal that during the lockdown period, PM10 and PM2.5 levels were reduced by about 35% to 40%, which may be explained as a possible reduction from industries (10% considering continued operation of power plants with 7% – 8% share), transport ( 15% with essential service vehicles and a small part of fleet still plying on roads), dust (10-15%; with continued contribution due to soil and wind-blown dust because of high surface winds),” the report reads.Experts say the steep reduction could be because the country-wide lockdown cut off most sources of pollution not just in the city but surrounding areas as well.“Janta curfew was only for a day when the PM level started dropping but the maximum effect of restrictions were seen during the lockdown. The question is how can we achieve similar air quality targets even after the outbreak resolves. We need systematic solutions that will help us to sustain this kind of air quality. Collective community action during this pandemic can help us to reinvent longer-term solutions to reduce our vulnerability to toxic risk,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/steep-drop-in-pollution-since-janta-curfew-lockdown/story-I0MexTklti9DOWsWa6JJMJ.html

06-04-2020||World||Irish PM Varadkar returns to hospital duty to help Covid-19 patients||Leo Varadkar, who remains the caretaker prime minister of Ireland after the February general election threw up a hung parliament, has returned to his earlier profession as a doctor to resume duty to help with coronavirus patients.He is among several politicians in Ireland and the United Kingdom who have re-joined the medical profession as doctors and nurses to help deal with the pandemic, after governments appealed to retired and former professionals to return to the frontline of treatment.Varadkar, 41, interned in KEM Hospital Mumbai after gaining medical qualifications in Ireland. His Indian father was a doctor in Britain’s National Health Service and his mother was a nurse; the family moved in the 1970s to Ireland, where Varadkar was born.He remains the prime minister while parties negotiate to form a coalition government.Reports from Dublin said Varadkar, who practiced medicine for seven years before joining politics, rejoined the country’s medical register in March to work a session a week.Varadkar is helping with phone assessments of people who may have been exposed to Covid-19 and are assessed initially over the phone rather than in person to curb the spread of the virus. His partner, Matthew Barrett, and his two sisters and their husbands, also work in the health services, the daily reported.Ireland’s Health Service Executive appealed in March for healthcare professionals not working in the profession to register in a mass recruitment drive to deal with the crisis. Some 50,000 people applied in less than three days, The Irish Times reported.In the UK, Nadia Whittome, the Indian-origin MP from Nottingham East and the youngest at the age of 23, has also returned to her former work as a carer in a retirement village in Nottingham.“I’m back in my old team in a retirement village complex in Nottingham that houses 500 residents, 50 of whom receive the whole range of care; from medication and food through to personal and end-of-life care”, she said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irish-pm-varadkar-returns-to-hospital-duty-to-help-covid-19-patients/story-QPw55NRvlgOm3Iym7GUs0J.html
06-04-2020||World||Covid-19: British PM Boris Johnson is in hospital, but ‘still in charge’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson was said to be “still in charge” of the UK government on Monday after he was hospitalised on Sunday night as a precautionary step for tests, 10 days after he tested positive for coronavirus that isolated him in Downing Street.A spokesperson on Monday dismissed as ‘disinformation’ reports that Johnson is on ventilator, but did not deny that he received oxygen on Sunday night. He was described as being in “good spirits”, having spent a “comfortable night” in hospital, where he will stay another day.Johnson’s move to a London hospital was announced on Sunday night soon after Queen Elizabeth delivered a rare message to the Commonwealth, reassuring people that “we will succeed” in the fight against the pandemic, and that “better days will return…we will meet again”.Johnson’s hospitalisation prompted a fall in the pound’s value and apprehension in various quarters that authorities were not disclosing the full extent of Johnson’s ailment that needed the move to hospital, after he was said to have minor symptoms.Downing Street previously announced if he were unable to perform prime ministerial functions, foreign secretary Dominic Raab would lead the government, but housing secretary Robert Jenrick insisted on Monday that he remains in charge. Raab chaired Monday’s meeting on coronavirus-related developments.Jenrick said, “We hope that as a result of these tests (the prime minister) will be able to come back to Downing Street as soon as possible. He’s been working extremely hard leading the government and being constantly updated. That’s going to continue.”“I’m sure this is very frustrating for him, for somebody like Boris who wants to be hands on running the government from the front, but nonetheless he’s still very much in charge of the government,” he added.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, home secretary Priti Patel and business secretary Alok Sharma were among several leading figures across the political spectrum to wish Johnson speedy recovery.The Downing Street spokesperson said on Sunday night: “On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests. This is a precautionary step, as the Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus”.“The Prime Minister thanks National Health Service staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, also tested positive but is said to be recovering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-british-pm-boris-johnson-is-in-hospital-but-still-in-charge/story-QeJmtG17mEzeTKlfo6YhvK.html
06-04-2020||World||China testing Wuhan residents to find out actual rate of Covid-19 infection, antibodies||China is carrying out a large-scale “seroprevalence” survey to check for Covid-19 antibodies in the population of Wuhan where the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year before spreading rapidly in three months to trigger a global pandemic.It was initiated in March under China’s national health commission (NHC), the central ministry coordinating the country’s control and containment measures against the outbreak.A seroprevalence study is carried out by collecting blood samples from a large population sample across age groups to check for antibodies against particular disease – in this case, Covid-19.Besides the general population, the “sero” investigation is likely focussing on high-risk groups like those who worked in wet markets in Wuhan, and people who dealt and traded in wildlife.The result will aid in separating the confirmed and symptomatic cases from the asymptomatic ones or those individuals, who have been infected, do not show any symptom but could infect others.In simple terms, the survey results will reveal for the first time the total number of Covid-19 infections in Wuhan, and not just the number of the disease cases.China has so far not made public any information about the study, which could have potentially been done on hundreds of thousands of Wuhan residents, the first epicentre of the pandemic and a city of around 11 million people.The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – which works under the NHC – and the office of respiratory expert, Dr. Zhong Nanshan, who heads the top experts’ team advising the government on fighting the outbreak did not respond to HT’s questions on the survey.HT’s questions were sent out through the information department of China’s cabinet, the State Council.Wuhan has so far accounted for over 2500 deaths and more than 50000 infections in China’s tally of 81708 confirmed cases and 3331 deaths.China has only started to share the number of asymptomatic patients in the country from last week.The WHO is not part of the survey but is aware that it is being conducted, the WHO’s china representative, Gauden Galea, told HT earlier.“We know that China is now doing a ‘sero’ survey. This is a survey to look at antibodies in the blood of people in Wuhan,” Galea said.Galea explained both the survey and its importance.“I distinguish between infection and disease. So, being infected is the process of getting the infection and it taking hold inside the body. And, then it manifests as the disease Covid-19. But the disease is distinct from the infection but when people are infected, their immune system reacts and develops antibodies,” Galea explained.Why is it important?“…there’s a big question in the world how many asymptomatic people are there who got infected but don’t (show symptoms)…you hear very many estimates…but seroprevalence survey would give the answer. It would tell you,” Galea said.In a recent medical paper on Covid-19 titled “Estimating the ascertainment rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan”, an expert on epidemiological surveillance and intervention, Theodore Lytras, from the Athens-based National Public Health Organisation wrote about the importance of seroprevalence surveys.“That’s the most important conclusion that should be drawn for our study. We urgently need seroprevalence surveys, which involves testing blood from a population sample to find out whether they have antibodies to the coronavirus, and thus how many of them had been infected,” Lytras told HT.Lytras’ and his colleagues’ modelling suggested that most of the population in Wuhan became infected (probably with little to no symptoms), and although the lockdown obviously helped, the outbreak stopped because there were few uninfected people left for the virus to infect.“This (seroprevalence survey) will give us definite answers about how many people are actually infected with the coronavirus. Our modelling for Wuhan suggests that nearly every one got infected, but we could be wrong. Only a seroprevalence survey will tell,” Lytras added.The WHO’s Galea said the results of the survey – when published – will be avidly followed by governments, researchers and planners all around the world.“This (China) is the first country that has experienced a wave of community transmission, at least in Wuhan. Therefore (the seroprevalence survey) will give you the shape of the infection curve, and not just the disease curve, which is what we have been able to see up to now,” Galea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-testing-wuhan-residents-to-find-out-actual-rate-of-covid-19-infection-antibodies/story-wXOg8LCnB3ixgB4Y7sfOOI.html
06-04-2020||World||Iran will never ask United States for coronavirus help: Report||Iran will never ask the United States for help in the fight against the new coronavirus, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Monday.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has rejected offers from Washington’s for humanitarian assistance to Iran, the Middle Eastern country so far most affected by the coronavirus, with 3,603 deaths and 58,226 people infected.“Iran has never asked and will not ask America to help Tehran in its fight against the outbreak ... But America should lift all its illegal unilateral sanctions on Iran,” Mousavi said in a televised news conference.Tensions between the two countries have been running high since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump quit a 2015 agreement that lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear programme. Washington reimposed sanctions which have crippled the Iranian economy.Iranian authorities say U.S. sanctions have hampered their efforts to curb the outbreak, urging other countries and the United Nations to call on the United States to lift them.“They (the U.S.) are trying to force Tehran to accept negotiations with America,” Mousavi said. Trump says the nuclear deal was not strong enough and wants to apply “maximum pressure” on Iran to accept tougher curbs to its nuclear programme, halt its ballistic missile work and end its support for proxy forces in the Middle East. Iran has long said it will not negotiate unless Washington lifts sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-will-never-ask-united-states-for-coronavirus-help-report/story-KIOZRdqW2GXzIjtB2ZLX0J.html

It was a planned admission to undergo some routine tests. He is doing well, I am told, and we look forward to him being back at No. 10 soon,” the Cabinet minister told the BBC on Monday morning.The update on the 55-year-old prime minister’s health came following his admission to a National Health Service (NHS) hospital in London on Sunday evening for tests after he showed “persistent symptoms of coronavirus”, including a temperature, even 10 days after testing positive for the disease.His hospitalisation was described as a “precautionary step” taken on the advice of his doctor, a Downing Street spokesperson said on Sunday.“This is a precautionary step, as the Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus ten days after testing positive for the virus,” the spokesperson said. “The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government’s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,” the spokesperson said.Downing Street said that it was considered sensible for doctors to see the UK prime minister in person given he has ongoing symptoms but he remains in charge of the government and in contact with ministerial colleagues and officials.UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab, the First Secretary of State, is the UK PM’s chosen second-in-command and stepped in to chair the daily coronavirus response meeting, dubbed the COVID-19 war cabinet, on Monday morning.Johnson has until last Friday continued to chair the daily meetings remotely via video conference from his self-isolation in his private quarters in Downing Street since his diagnosis 10 days ago. The British prime minister was last seen, still looking quite poorly, when he made a brief appearance at Downing Street on Thursday night to join the national “clap for carers” applause in appreciation of the hardwork of National Health Service (NHS) workers on the frontline of the fight against the outbreak.“Remember that incredible clapping again last night for our fantastic NHS. We’re doing it to protect them and to save lives. Let’s focus on doing everything we can. Stay at home folks, protect our NHS, save lives,” he said. Johnson posted his last Twitter video message on Friday in which he said he was still displaying minor symptoms. He had extended self-isolation on Friday, which should have marked the end of the stipulated seven-day self-isolation period after his COVID-19 diagnosis last week.He said he still has a temperature, one of the symptoms associated with coronavirus, and would therefore have to stay in isolation for longer.“Although I’m feeling better and I’ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom. I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self-isolation until that symptom itself goes. But we’re working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus,” he said in the video message.The UK has reported over 48,000 cases of COVID-19. On Sunday, the Department of Health said 621 more people died in hospitals in the UK over 24 hours after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total death toll to 4,934 in the country.US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending “our nation’s well wishes” for Mr Johnson’s “own personal fight with the virus”.“All Americans are praying for him. He’s a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,” Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is “a strong person”.Newly-elected Labour Party leader Keir Starmer also wished Johnson well, saying he hoped for a “speedy recovery”. Over the weekend, Johnson’s pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds had revealed her own coronavirus symptoms as she said that she was “on the mend” and feeling stronger.“I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend,” said the 32-year-old, who has been self-isolating separately at her south London flat.UK health secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for coronavirus and returned from self-isolation after seven days last Thursday to host the daily Downing Street press briefing.The UK government’s chief medical adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms, as has Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-doing-well-in-hospital-stays-in-charge-of-covid-19-response/story-01GZsS6Oq9HhGureEuXc8I.html

A giant protective dome was put in place over the fourth reactor in 2016.Fires are common in the forests near the disused power plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radiation-spike-as-forest-fire-hits-chernobyl-nuclear-zone/story-kJ7Ou5WYCSIIaQvBNPSIBO.html

06-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Across West Asia, life in lockdown is a study in contrast||In the early days of March, a striking image of Mecca’s Al Haram Mosque went viral. The popular Saudi mosque was empty. Its white floor stood out in contrast to the towering Kaaba, Islam’s holiest site.In contrast to many countries around the world where lockdowns came too late, the Saudis had swung into action ahead of time in February end, decisively closing doors to tourists and pilgrims.The measures came even before the kingdom reported its first case of coronavirus disease Covid-19.“Other countries that didn’t take matters seriously should have followed all the measures taken by the kingdom to protect its people,” G Sultan, a resident of Riyadh, told HT. “If you go to the supermarkets, you find what you want and in very abundant quantities, and the prices haven’t changed.”Sultan lives at home with his family, closely following up on his children, who are studying through distance education.“The government has instituted strict measures to prevent people from leaving home, yet you can get what you want by using electronic requests,” he says.Today, Saudi Arabia is the worst-hit among the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) group of Arab oil monarchies. It had reported 2,179 cases of confirmed infections till Saturday and 29 deaths. The first case positive coronavirus case the country was a Saudi national returning from Iran through Bahrain.Iran was Middle East’s focal point in the first days of the coronavirus epidemic, where the hotspot was the country’s holiest city of Qom. The virus quickly spread to other cities across the country and its neighbours, including several of its regional allies, suffered outbreaks that were linked to Iran.“I don’t think they (the government) are doing enough - at all,” said an Iranian man who lives in Hormozgan. He wished not to be named. “There haven’t been quarantines, no roads have been closed, people are free to travel, there are still planes coming and going. It’s the people who are taking care of each other.”“In Iran, it has been disaster after disaster - the killings of protesters, the shooting of the Ukrainian plane, and now the outbreak. It has just been a never-ending nightmare. I am just happy to be alive, and I try everything I can to protect the people I care about,” he added.The death toll in Iran from the outbreak has reached 3,603, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement broadcast live on state TV on Sunday. 151 people have died in the past 24 hours, he said. The Islamic Republic, the Middle Eastern country worst-hit by the epidemic, now has a total of 58,226 infections.Iran has been accused of covering up the crisis in the country. On March 12, the Washington Post published satellite images of a mass grave near Qom, the epicentre of Iran’s outbreak, indicating that the death toll is likely much higher than the state is publicly admitting. Iran has denied these claims.The story is nearly the same across the border in Iraq. The health ministry says Covid-19 has killed 56 Iraqis and infected more than 800 others. But many suspect the real numbers to be much higher, as only a few thousand people from a population of 40 million have been tested.Iraq on Friday suspended the work of Reuters news agency for three months, following a report by the agency the previous day that said the Iraqi government was underreporting confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. The Reuters report said the true number ranged from 3,000 to 9,000.Baghdad resident Zainab laments the country was too late to react. “They were late in closing the airports. They allowed Iranian visitors to come in,” says the 23-year-old engineer.“Curfew procedures are not serious. Plus, the government hasn’t been firm with some religious groups who insist on gathering for rituals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-across-west-asia-life-in-lockdown-is-a-study-in-contrast/story-kqcLFvfHxGpiScYgtu5uRJ.html
06-04-2020||World||We are tougher, tweets Trump as US battles coronavirus outbreak||US President Donald Trump has said that the country is dealing with an invisible enemy, but is tougher and smarter.“We are learning much about the Invisible Enemy. It is tough and smart, but we are tougher and smarter,” Trump tweeted ahead of a White House briefing on tackling the coronavirus pandemic. We are learning much about the Invisible Enemy. It is tough and smart, but we are tougher and smarter!The United States has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, with thousands dying of the Covid-19 disease across the country. Senior official on Sunday warned of the “hardest” week ahead, but some saw glimmers of hope from a slight slowing of fatalities.New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week, deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases.“Maybe that’s a good sign,” Trump later told reporters at a White House briefing, referring to the drop in fatalities in New York.Trump also said the United States was “very far down the line” on developing vaccines for the coronavirus. “We’ll see what happens,” he said. But he offered no specifics.Louisiana has become a hot spot for the virus, reporting a jump in deaths to nearly 500 and more than 13,000 cases. The governor predicted the state would run out of ventilators by Thursday.Places such as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Washington, DC, are also starting to see rising deaths.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that new hospitalisations had fallen by 50 per cent over the previous 24 hours. He cautioned that it was not yet clear whether the crisis was reaching a plateau in the state, which has a total of 4,159 deaths and more than 122,000 cases, by far the most of any US state. Nationally, cases the respiratory disease topped 336,000, while the death toll stood at 9,573.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-tougher-tweets-trump-as-us-battles-coronavirus-outbreak/story-m3urI4HyrhQmEDEiTYcCVK.html
06-04-2020||World||Tiger at NYC’s Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus||A tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the new coronavirus, in what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the U.S. or a tiger anywhere, federal officials and the zoo said Sunday.The 4-year-old Malayan tiger named Nadia — and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill — are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn’t yet showing symptoms, the zoo said. The first animal started showing symptoms March 27, and all are doing well and expected to recover, said the zoo, which has been closed to the public since March 16 amid the surging coronavirus outbreak in New York.The test result stunned zoo officials: “I couldn’t believe it,” director Jim Breheny said. But he hopes the finding can contribute to the global fight against the virus that causes COVID-19.“Any kind of knowledge that we get on how it’s transmitted, how different species react to it, that knowledge somehow is going to provide a greater base resource for people,” he said in an interview.The finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which confirmed Nadia’s test result at its veterinary lab, says there are no known cases of the virus in U.S. pets or livestock.“There doesn’t appear to be, at this time, any evidence that suggests that the animals can spread the virus to people or that they can be a source of the infection in the United States,” Dr. Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and a USDA official, said in an interview.The USDA said Sunday it’s not recommending routine coronavirus testing of animals, in zoos or elsewhere, or of zoo employees. Still, Rooney said a small number of animals in the U.S. have been tested through the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and all those tests came back negative except Nadia’s.The coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say.There have been a handful of reports outside the U.S. of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn’t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.Some researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the virus, and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health.The American Veterinary Medical Association and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals — advice that the veterinary group reiterated after learning of the tiger’s test result.In general, the CDC also advises people to wash their hands after handling animals and do other things to keep pets and their homes clean.At the Bronx Zoo, Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed dry coughs, and some of the cats exhibited some wheezing and loss of appetite, said Dr. Paul Calle, the zoo’s chief veterinarian.The staff figured there could be a relatively routine explanation for the cats’ symptoms but tested Nadia for coronavirus out of “due diligence and an abundance of caution,” Breheny said. Only Nadia was tested because it takes anesthesia to get a sample from a big cat, and she had already been knocked out to be examined.The seven sickened cats live in two areas at the zoo, and the animals had contact with the same worker, who is doing OK, zoo officials said. They said there are no signs of illness in other big cats on the property.Staffers who work with the cats will now wear infection-protection garb, as primate keepers have done for years because of the animals’ closer genetic ties to human beings, Breheny said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiger-at-nyc-s-bronx-zoo-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-8pvDsuVAC6RRzR6TLYZQ8N.html

This means that trains will be able to leave, the airport will resume flights out, and cars blocked from exiting as the pathogen roared through Wuhan can take to the highways again.People, however, move around cautiously, keeping their distance. Everyone, without exception, is wearing masks.While factories in this Chinese city are allowed to re-start, workers are slow to return and supply chains are in disarray. Shopping malls have re-opened, but they’re largely empty, most people still too scared to go out for anything but essentials.With more than half of China’s officially reported virus cases and deaths, Wuhan is both where Covid-19 began, and where it left the deepest wound. Once a regional powerhouse where gross domestic product growth for last year was expected to have come in at 7.8 per cent, it’s now grappling with the challenges of starting again.Early signs indicate it will be a slow and painful process, with the shock of the epidemic still lingering and fears of a second virus wave keeping businesses from resuming full operations.“Our goal for 2020 is first to survive physically,” Ma Renren, 33, who runs a small marketing agency, told Bloomberg. “Second is for our businesses to survive.”Three deaths were reported on Saturday - all from virus epicentre Hubei Province - taking the coronavirus death toll in China to 3,329 people.The overall confirmed cases in the mainland reached 81,669 on Saturday, including 1,376 patients undergoing treatment and 76,964 others discharged from hospitals after recovery.On March 27, Wuhan’s coronavirus risk evaluation was downgraded from ‘high risk’ to ‘medium risk’. Now, Hubei Province has no cities or counties marked as ‘high risk’.Signifying the slowdown of the virus in the country, China on Saturday held a nationwide memorial for martyrs and victims of the coronavirus in the country.Chinese President Xi Jinping led the national mourning from Beijing. Three minutes’ silence was observed all over the country and flags flew half-mast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-once-epicentre-of-covid-19-gets-ready-for-life-after-lockdown/story-e1zPpuSxvKODbmDazAKjhM.html

Osaka and Hyogo prefectures may also be under emergency, it said. Calls for more stringent measures to contain the deadly virus had been growing, as a recent spike in infections sparked concerns Japan is headed for a crisis on the levels seen in the U.S. and several countries in Europe.The Japan Medical Association warned last week that the jump in cases in the nation’s most populous cities is putting more pressure on medical resources and that the government should declare a state of emergency. A poll conducted by broadcaster JNN showed 80% of respondents said the declaration should be made.Tokyo reported 143 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, its largest single day. It marked the second straight day the city’s daily infection tally exceeded 100.Japan Worries Country on ‘Brink of the Brink’ of Virus Surge (1)Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has said an emergency declaration by the government will provide the legal background to implement a policy to prevent further spread. Abe told parliament Friday that the situation didn’t yet warrant an emergency declaration, but said he wouldn’t hesitate to do so if that time comes.Declaring a state of emergency hands powers to local governments, including to urge residents to stay at home. By contrast with some other countries though, there is no legal power to enforce such requests. Japan’s confirmed cases exceeded 3,000 over the weekend -- excluding those related to the Diamond Princess cruise ship -- a jump from less than 500 just a month ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-declare-emergency-in-tokyo-as-coronavirus-cases-hit-1000-in-the-capital-report/story-khWa5td7OM5XOFZIKGKBLO.html
06-04-2020||World||US navy captain fired for voicing coronavirus concern tests positive: Report||The US naval commander whose widely publicized plea for help for his coronavirus-affected crew led to his dismissal has reportedly himself tested positive for the disease.Captain Brett Crozier’s COVID-19 test result was reported Sunday by the New York Times, just hours after US Defense Secretary Mark Esper defended the captain’s firing.Esper told ABC that Navy Secretary Thomas Modly had “made a tough decision, tough call” in deciding to fire Crozier from his command of the aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt, now docked in Guam.Asked about a report that President Donald Trump wanted Crozier fired, Esper replied, “This was the secretary’s call. He came and briefed me ... It was the secretary’s call. I told him I would support it.”The firing was widely condemned as a callous and unfair punishment of a respected officer who was looking out for the welfare of his crew when he implored his superiors to let him quickly vacate the ship after it docked in Guam.“We are not at war,” Crozier wrote in a letter that leaked to the press. “Sailors do not need to die.” But some senior Pentagon officials said Crozier erred by letting his plea go public.Crozier “demonstrated extremely poor judgment in the middle of a crisis,” needlessly worrying family members and undermining the chain of command, Modly said.Trump, speaking in a news conference Saturday, supported the dismissal. “He shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter,” he said of Crozier. “I thought it was terrible what he did.”The Times, in reporting Crozier’s test result, cited two of his former classmates at the US Naval Academy. It said he had begun exhibiting symptoms before leaving the ship on Thursday.Hundreds of sailors cheered Crozier as he left the ship, as seen in video that quickly went viral. Some called him a hero.Democrats have also sharply criticized the dismissal.Joe Biden, the leading Democratic candidate for president, condemned the firing on Sunday, telling ABC it was “close to criminal.” “I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired,”the former vice president said.And a statement from Democratic leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said Crozier might not have handled the matter perfectly, but that his dismissal was an “overreaction.”Protection and readiness Esper declined Sunday to say whether other Pentagon leaders agreed with the firing, pointing to an ongoing investigation.He told CNN that more than half the Roosevelt’s 4,800-member crew had now been tested for the coronavirus. In all, 155 sailors tested positive but none required hospitalization, he said.Crozier’s dismissal came as the Pentagon struggles, amid the spreading pandemic, to maintain the readiness of its air, sea and ground forces worldwide. “We have had to cancel exercises. We’ve had to constrain basic training, for example,” Esper said, before adding, “We think those are all manageable.”Esper pointed to the particular challenges facing the military -- it is impossible to respect social distancing in a crowded bomber plane or in the confinement of a nuclear submarine, he told ABC.He said the military overall was “ahead of the curve” in balancing troops’ health and military readiness.The military has also been called to help the fight against the coronavirus inside the US.Trump said Saturday that 1,000 military personnel, mostly doctors and nurses, would be deployed to help in New York City, the epicenter of the US outbreak.Troops have already been helping out at the Javits Convention Center, which has been transformed into an enormous hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-captain-fired-for-voicing-coronavirus-concern-tests-positive-report/story-GCuGvbniswA7eu17daYNZK.html

This comes after an attempt by Estonia to have the UNSC discuss the pandemic with more transparency and accountability was blocked by China, Russia and South Africa  who argued that the coronavirus spread was not a peace and security issue and hence outside the UNSC’s mandate.According to diplomatic sources in Washington and Delhi, the demand for informal consultation on the pandemic, made as it impacts the peace and security of the world, was pushed by UNSC President Dominican Republic on Friday. It was backed by Vietnam, Indonesia, Germany, Belgium, Estonia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Niger and Tunisia.It is understood that UN Secretary General Guterres will first address the UNSC through video conference and then announce the date for informal consultations this week. Guterres is expected to brief the member countries on the status of the pandemic and measures taken to control the killer disease.There is, however, a huge question on the possible outcome of the discussions on the disease that originated in China’s Wuhan city before it rapidly spread across the world. China is expected to be supported by Russia. The United States, on the other hand, is yet to take a stand. But the Trump administration has of late adopted a softer stand on China, particularly after Beijing supplied 1,000 ventilators for New York.France and the United Kingdom are likely to be in favour of an outcome at the informal consultations.As per John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen has infected 1.2 million people across the world and killed 66,542.The US has reported the maximum number of cases with over 3,12,000 Covid-19 patients and over 8,500 deaths.Experts believe that the virus will destroy a lot more lives than it will take. Governments across the world have ordered lockdowns to slow the pandemic and minimise the lives that it takes, forcing the global economy into a recession that may take years to get over.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wants a global ceasefire to be announced so that member countries can focus on the fight against the virus and the global misery that will follow. But this may not be accepted by Russia which has stakes in the Syrian civil war and the Libyan strife.To be sure, little is expected of the informal consultations on Covid-19 at UNSC. But permanent member China, which is riled up at any description of the disease as Wuhan virus, will have to allow itself to be targeted by other UNSC members.UNSC members also surely expected to raise questions on the role of World Health Organisation that failed to recognise the disease as a pandemic earlier and Beijing’s initial denials when the outbreak took place as early as November 17, 2019||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hurdle-out-of-the-way-unsc-to-discuss-covid-19-pandemic-this-week/story-fE1GV73hbr1U5zD2hf1ajO.html

The airport management had to operate the airport beyond the notified timings especially for this flight.”According to the state police, there are around 300 to 400 foreigners still stranded in the state with maximum in Rishikesh, Nainital and Almora due to the lockdown. So far about 700 foreigners had left the state with arrangements being made by their respective embassies. “All the foreigners stranded are in quarantine.

06-04-2020||India||Telangana joins list of states seeking extension of lockdown||Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao said on Monday that India should not lift the nationwide lockdown until the Covid-19 outbreak is brought further under control, becoming one of the most prominent officials yet to suggest that the unprecedented curbs be extended further. A similar opinion was expressed by a top bureaucrat from Uttar Pradesh, who suggested the state – UP has recorded 305 infections – may continue to be in a lockdown after April 14, the date till when the current curb is scheduled to last.“The lockdown is the reason the country is saved and has seen very few cases. A country like India has to be careful otherwise it will become uncontrollable. The economy will get hurt but at least we are not seeing deaths like Italy, Spain and the US,” KCR said, adding that he had suggested to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the curbs be extended for two more weeks.“At least some of the restrictions should stay for a bit more. Otherwise, India will not be able to handle things if the lockdown is hastily lifted,” he said.In UP, additional chief secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi, said that following a recent spike in Covid-19 cases, the lockdown in the state is likely to continue. “The state government wishes to make it clear that the lockdown is not likely to be lifted till there is a single coronavirus case in the state. The lifting of the lockdown means UP has become coronavirus free,” additional chief secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said at a press conference in the state capital.Officials from multiple states have indicated previously that districts with no Covid-19 cases are likely to be given relaxations from curbs on movements and business activity first, but those that are classified as hot spots are likely to stay under severe restrictions.This approach is also the strategy outlined by the Union health ministry, which has briefed states on the need to ring-fence districts with large outbreaks or multiple clusters so that infections do not spread. Punjab is expected to continue with the lockdown in most parts, but issue curfew passes to allow harvesting from April 15. “A final call will be taken on April 12 or 13,” Suresh Kumar, Punjab chief minister’s chief principal secretary, said on Sunday.Last week, a minister in Maharashtra indicated the state may extend the lockdown by a couple of weeks, especially in Mumbai and other urban areas of the state. “Lifting it fully in a city like Mumbai is unlikely,” health minister Rajesh Tope said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-joins-list-of-states-seeking-extension-of-lockdown/story-GjwHl2MbQQT4h9OylJOkeP.html

06-04-2020||India||FIR against Assam daily newspaper for ‘false’ report||GUWAHATI: The Assam government has started taking action against people allegedly spreading misinformation on Covid-19 on social media and also against news organisations airing or publishing unverified news articles about the infectious disease.On Sunday, the information and public relations department of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government filed a first information report (FIR) against Jugasanka, a Bengali-language daily published from Silchar, for carrying an alleged “false news report” about the state’s first Covid-19 positive patient.While the patient is still admitted to the Silchar Medical College Hospital, the news story mentioned that he had been cured of the disease. It said the second test carried on the patient was found negative.“According to doctors, the news item is completely baseless and the patient has not recovered yet,” said the FIR lodged in Karimganj police station by Sajjadul Hoque Choudhury, the district’s information and public relations officer.Publication of the news item has resulted in “inconvenience in maintaining law and order”, the FIR said. The case was lodged against the reporter and the publisher of the newspaper under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience of orders duly promulgated by a public servant) and provisions of the Assam Covid-19 Regulation, 2020. Under this law, no person, institution or organisation is allowed to use any print, electronic or social media for dissemination of information on Covid-19 without verifying the facts and clearance of the government. “There was some confusion about the name of the Covid-19 patient admitted to Silchar Medical College, and another patient with a similar name was admitted for another disease...there was no ill intention behind it. We had already carried a corrigendum on the front page of the paper on April 5,” said Chinmoy Kumar Das, the editor of Jugasanka.The information department has also taken to Twitter to name and shame news platforms for publishing and airing alleged fake news. The Eastern Chronicle, an English-language daily, and Pratidin Time, an Assamese news channel, have been named out for putting out misleading details on Covid-19 patients.The actions came three days after the department constituted a five-member committee “for monitoring and checking of fake news in all forms of media.” Members of the committee are officials from the information, health, police and disaster management departments.Besides monitoring purported fake news, the committee directed district information officers to streamline social media handles and activate WhatsApp numbers so that the public can get access to correct information.The police department has already become active in surveillance of social media users spreading rumours about the disease. Till Sunday, 12 cases had been lodged, seven persons arrested, 80 others counselled and over 100 purported fake reports removed from various social media platforms.Warning of stringent action, the police have requested citizens not to share or provide unverified or provocative content on social media. The department also asked the public to inform it about rumours on its Facebook page, Twitter handle and WhatsApp helpline number: 9132699735.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-assam-daily-newspaper-for-false-report/story-mSOkKLysiODMpjwHwyDAbL.html

This can come in handy for front line workers combating the pandemic. We can put out the data online and create a thermal map,” he said.Tiwari and the Congress’ Anil K Antony thought it would be a good idea to create a national Covid-19 Action Group with people cutting across party lines -- members of Parliament (MP), public policy organisations and health experts. The group has been named Parliamentarians with Innovators for India (PII), whose primary task is to ensure that the solutions reach the masses.“The vision is to bring together think-tanks, policy experts with parliamentarians to conceptualise innovative solutions in the fight against Covid-19,” Anil Antony, co-ordinator, south and west, for the initiative said. “The focus is technological solutions such as low-cost medical solutions like ventilators and testing kits. We have even reached out to some premier venture capitalists in case funding is needed for any of these projects.”BJP’s Rajat Sethi is the co-ordinator for the north and east. The coordinators reached out to several parliamentarians including the Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi. “The idea is to put together a group of people from different political ideologies and rise above our political differences to fight this pandemic together,” Chaturvedi said. The fledgling group consists of 14 MPs including Chaturvedi: National People’s Party’s (NPP) Agatha Sangma, BJP’s GVL Narsimha Rao, Jamyang Tshering Namgyal, Varun Gandhi and Sudhanshu Trivedi , Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s Kalanidhi Veerasamy, the Congress’ Karti Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Rajeev Gowda , Bahujan Samaj Party’s Kunwar Danish Ali, YSR Congress Party’s Lavu Krishna, Trinamool Congress’s Mahua Moitra and Biju Janata Dal’s Sujeet Kumar.The group has also partnered with the Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Indore, Confederation of Indian Industry, Delhi, and the Population Foundation of India. Health experts such as Meenakshi Datta Ghosh, former special secretary, Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; Dr Arnab Mukherjee of IIM-Bangalore and Dr. Amir Ullah Khan, advisor, Indian School of Business (ISB), are a part of the novel initiative.The group has invited suggestions from the public on its website (piiindia.org) and will meet once a week from April 15. “We’ll need protocols and suggestions as to how to tackle many other possible problems such as traveling in public transport after the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown is lifted,” Tiwari said. “We need to start thinking about the next step right now.” The group is also planning to collate videos in several languages to offer healthcare professionals tutorials on the pandemic. “This will be a knowledge-sharing platform that has a wide scope,” said Congress MP Rajeev Gowda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-experts-join-forces-to-form-covid-19-action-group/story-8BetJOqrHJDlHtYnf49CgN.html

06-04-2020||India||India between Stage 2 and 3 of Covid-19 pandemic: Health Ministry||India is between Stage 2 and 3 of coronavirus pandemic with large number of cases being found in particular areas, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday concurring with the AIIMS Director’s remarks that localised community transmission is being observed in some pockets of the country.  AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria, who is also a member of a Task Force on COVID-19, on Monday reportedly said that “localised community transmission” has been seen in some pockets and that India is between Stage 2 (local transmission) and Stage 3.  He had clarified that the most of India is currently at Stage 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Asked about Guleria’s remarks, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said, “What the AIIMS Director has said is not in variance with what we have been explaining to you.” Explaining further, Agarwal said that they go for a cluster containment strategy when limited cases are reported from a particular area while the government’s action and intervention gets intensified when larger number of cases are reported.“We tell you every time that if there will be a community transmission we will be the first one to tell you so that everyone gets alert. If we go by the wordings (of AIIMS Director), he said localised community transmission, which implies larger number of cases are being found in a particular area,” the official said. “We are in between Stage 2 and 3 and that implies that our efforts and actions should be focused on ensuring we do not shift to stage 3,” the joint secretary said, adding there are clear defined strategies for containment in areas reporting larger number of cases and the government was working according to that. In Stage 2, disease transmission is limited to those with travel history to affected countries or those in contact with the infected persons. Community transmission or Stage 3 means a patient was infected though he had no known contact with another confirmed case of COVID-19 or travelled from a country affected by the pandemic. Agarwal said there had been 693 new COVID-19 cases and 30 deaths since Sunday. The total number of cases stand at 4,067 with the death toll at 109. However, a PTI tally based on figures reported by states directly showed at least 126 deaths across the country, while the confirmed cases reached 4,111. Of them, 315 have been cured and discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-between-stage-2-and-3-of-covid-19-pandemic-health-ministry/story-49drkMu0rpUrLo1eM3bi0I.html

06-04-2020||India||Amid coronavirus pandemic, doctor BJP MPs are returning to hospitals||For Sanjay Jaiswal the day begins with a rushed breakfast and some quick exercises. Then he sets out for the hospital, where on any given day he takes between 500-700 phone calls from those seeking medical advice and examines patients. In the wake of the Corona pandemic, and the ongoing 21-day nation-wide lockdown, restrictions have been imposed on patients seeking medical care in hospitals and other medical centres such as nursing homes.It is here that tele-medicine has come to the rescue of doctors. “Earlier, there was no permission for doctors to conduct consultations through tele-medicine, but now conditions have been relaxed by the MCI and we can at least see our patients online or speak to them on the phone. My wife is a gynecologist, and we have strict protocols in place to ensure there is no spread of infection in the hospital,” he said. In between his duties as a doctor, Jaiswal, who is also the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bihar unit chief and Lok Sabha MP from West Champaran, has to field calls from party workers, and attend daily meetings with party bosses.But it is his Hippocratic oath that overrides all else these days. Jaiswal said, while he has volunteered to be deployed (for care of corona patients); to ensure that the other health care workers in his hospital are safe, a 140-bed isolation ward has been set up in his hospital.“We have requisitioned for PPEs and cardiac monitors as there is a shortage all across,” he said.Referring to the overall monitoring of Covid-19 spread in the state, which is among the most populous with severe gaps in healthcare, Jaiswal said Asha workers, ANMs and tola workers in rural areas have been empowered to monitor every resident with travel history.“Each Asha or tola worker has been assigned 10 people who have come from outside. They check on them regularly and share the data of checking blood samples etc. Luckily, so far we have not had a single positive case,” he said.Another doctor-turned-MP, Anil Jain, who is also the BJP general secretary, has been monitoring the situation on the ground in Haryana and Chandigarh. A consultant surgeon with the Apollo Group, Jain has not been practising medicine since he took oath as an MP, but finds time to speak to those who call for consultations.“I hear their concerns and tell them what to watch out for and when to rush to the emergency, but I have not been practicising,” said Jain, a Rajya Sabha MP.Jain, who also attended party meetings online, is focusing more on logistics on the ground to ensure hospitals have supplies and patients are being looked after. “We are making sure that patients who need dialysis for instance are being looked after. While the pandemic has affected regular services, we are ensuring that treatment is not stalled,” Jain said.Former minister and now MP from Gautam Buddh Nagar, Mahesh Sharma has also returned to the examining table. As per a party aide, Sharma, who runs the Kailash hospital chain, is also examining patients at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-coronavirus-pandemic-doctor-bjp-mps-are-returning-to-hospitals/story-KWTKkqoIO05cdlcPNhgkoI.html

The family then informed his son Mohammad Arif who works in Mumbai’s Bandra (West) area as a security guard. By Monday evening, Hussain had been moved from Jammu to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Chandigarh for advanced treatment after he had been evacuated from Rajouri on Sunday.“The CRPF has also tracked his 30-year-old son Mohammed Arif near Jodhpur in Rajasthan and he will also be ferried by us to Chandigarh,” said CRPF’s Jammu sector spokesperson and deputy commandant Shivnandan Singh said earlier in the day.With transportation snapped because of the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, Arif had embarked on a gruelling 2100 km long journey on a bicycle with Rs 600 in his pocket on Thursday.“CRPF Madadgaar helpline reached out to this man in distress. His father Wazir Hussain was airlifted in a Pawan Hans chopper from Rajouri to Jammu on Sunday before being sent to Chandigarh through road,” said Singh.“The CRPF units worked in close coordination in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir to help this family, the officer said. Arif was in Gujarat when the CRPF tracked him down.“We tracked Arif in Gujarat through 100 Rapid Action Force of the CRPF in Ahmedabad and gave him sanitizers and food. Thereafter, we tied up with civil police and arranged a vehicle for him. He is nearing Jodhpur now. From Jodhpur, CRPF will make further arrangements to ferry him to Chandigarh,” said the official.In Arif’s native village Panjgrain in Rajouri district, CRPF’s 72 battalion doctors visited his ailing father and shifted him to Rajouri district hospital from where he was airlifted to Jammu on Sunday. He was referred for treatment in Chandigarh on Monday in view of his condition.Two doctors of the CRPF and his nephew accompanied Wazir Hussain to Chandigarh. “We pray he gets well and all hard toil of this young man is rewarded,” Singh said.However, senior officials in the establishment said that coming from Maharashtra makes Arif a potential case of coronavirus and 14-day quarantine would be essential for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-crpf-comes-to-the-rescue-of-rajouri-man-cycling-from-mumbai-to-see-ailing-father/story-cDTT1WThCQA3oo3IPKlFCJ.html
06-04-2020||India||92 hospital staff quarantined after patient contracts Covid-19||At least 92 staff members, including several doctors, of the D Y Patil Hospital here in Maharashtra have been quarantined after an accident victim, who was being treated at the facility, tested positive for coronavirus, an official said on Monday.A senior civic official denied speculations of the COVID-19 patient having direct or indirect link to the Tablighi Jamaat which organised a religious congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi last month that later emerged as a coronavirus hotspot in the country.The patient, an autorickshaw driver, met with the accident on March 31, said Jitendra Bhawalkar, dean of the D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital, a private medical facility located in Pimpri Chinchwad township here.“The man,who is in his 30s, came to the emergency section of the hospital on March 31 after the accident. He was operated upon and on the second day, he developed fever. The doctors got suspicious and his samples were sent for testing which came out positive for coronavirus,” he said.The patient was immediately shifted to the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital.“We then tried to find out those who came in contact with the man and quarantined our 42 doctors and 50 paramedical staff members as a precaution. Samples of all of them have been sent for tests,” Bhawalkar said.Some people claim the man has link to the Tablighi Jamaat while some say he had transported people belonging to the Islamic organisation, the official said, adding that the patient hid the information from the hospital after he was admitted following the accident.Asked if the man has any link to the Tablighi Jamaat, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar said the patient does not have any connection to the outfit.“Thepatient is in ICU. People are speculating about his links, but right now we can only say he is not from the Tablighi Jamaat. He is from the different community altogether,” the official said.

In total, it plans to modify 20,000 coaches that can accommodate nearly 3.2 lakh beds for isolation wards. The work is being carried out at 133 locations across railways’ workshops in the country. The railway board has suggested the isolation coaches be used in rural areas where there is no access to hospitals.“In times of lockdown, when manpower resources are limited and have to be rationalised and rotated, different zones of railways have almost done an impossible task of so many conversions in such a small span of time. With the conversion of around 2,500 coaches, 40,000 isolation beds are now ready for contingency. Once the prototype was approved, conversion action was started quickly by zonal railways,” the ministry of railways said.It may be noted that these isolation coaches are being prepared only as a contingency and to supplement the efforts of the ministry of health in fighting coronavirus, it added. These coaches are equipped as per medical advisories issued. Efforts are being made to ensure best possible stay and medical supervision as per norms.The first prototype was prepared by the Northern Railways, it is equipped with 10 isolation wards per coach. The coaches are being sanitised before and after they are converted into isolation wards. “The hospital isolation coaches will have provision of air curtains in each compartment. We have converted two toilets into bathrooms by plugging the toilet pan and (installing) proper flooring. We have removed the middle berth,” a Northern Railways official said.The national transporter has also begun manufacturing of low cost Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) after two of its samples made by Northern Railways workshop were cleared by DRDO. The Indian railways is planning to make 100 PPEs per day to meet shortage of production in the country.Railways has also begun developing ‘disinfection tunnels’ or fumigation tunnels. They are designed in a manner where nozzles spray one part per million sodium hypochlorite solution, as people walk for a duration of between three to five seconds inside the tunnel. The Indian railways has said the tunnel costs around Rs 10,000 with a capacity of 500 litres, the disinfection tunnel will work uninterrupted for 16 hours, requiring refilling only once a day.The Indian railways has also been tasked with using its large manufacturing and locomotive production units and workshops for manufacturing essential medical equipment hospital beds and stretchers, among others. The national transporter has issued directions to this effect to its production units -- the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai and Diesel Loco Works in Varanasi, among others. The Rail Coach Factory (RCF), Kapurthala, has manufactured a prototype low-cost ventilator design. It has now been sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for testing and approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-prepares-covid-19-isolation-coaches-in-mission-mode/story-YYwGmKaADMKysN9pffz7PO.html

J&K Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh told Hindustan Times.The Jammu and Kashmir police chief said the Muridke-based group has also readied terrorist groups for infiltration into Uri, Karna, Keran and Kala Roos sector in north Kashmir. The situation south of Pir Panjal has also been hot with infiltration alerts at Mendhar, Balakot, Savjian, Nowshera, Samba and Hiranagar sectors.Also Read: Five army commandos, 5 terrorists killed in LoC ‘hand-to-hand’ battleThe renewed attempts at infiltration are an attempt to boost the terrorist strength in Kashmir where 50 terrorists have been neutralised in the last three months.According to an estimate by the security establishment, there are, however, no less than 242 active terrorists in the Valley. About 100 of them are foreign terrorists belonging to the Lashkar and Jaish-e-Mohammed.According to inputs, while Lashkar is trying to use the north Kashmir route to infiltrate, the JeM groups are trying to infiltrate in the Jammu sector.“Already there are visuals of food and shoes being stockpiled at launch pads at Tattapani across the Kupwara sector indicating infiltration activity will pick up in the coming days when the snow melts at high mountain passes,” said a senior security official.According to counter-terror operatives, even though the local youth sentiment may be inclined towards extremism, terror groups had not been able to recruit them due to shortage of weapons and communication clampdown.Kashmir was placed under a communication lockdown just before parliament ended the erstwhile state’s special status in early August. The internet ban, which was imposed during this period, was relaxed when the government allowed people access to 2G mobile networks. There have, since then, been demands to restore 4G network.Security agencies have, however, asked the government to continue with the restricted internet connectivity. Officials insist that the terrorists were shifting to platforms such as the Wire, Telegram and Conion to communicate, which would be difficult to track. Since these Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) platforms would require 4G networks, security officials are telling the government to continue the restrictions for some more time.Even though the recent release of National Conference father-son duo has been seen favourably by the public in the Valley, it is testing time for the new Altaf Bukhari Apni party as Pakistan based groups will mount heat this summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-kashmir-struggles-with-covid-19-pak-preps-to-send-across-more-terrorists/story-o27C6XBCioRON9e6Z0YvCP.html

We will not be in a position to lift the lockdown even if a single case of Covid-19 is left in Uttar Pradesh. So it can take time,” said additional chief secretary (home) Avanish Awasthi, according to ANI. Uttar Pradesh has recorded 305 cases of coronavirus in the state so far.

So we have to strategise accordingly. Please come up with suggestions to help the government,” Adityanath told MPs and central ministers from Uttar Pradesh during a video conference.He also told the MPs and ministers that the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi had undermined the state’s hard work in checking the spread of Sars-Cov-2 but the government was tackling even that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/little-possibility-of-lifting-lockdown-says-top-uttar-pradesh-bureaucrat/story-CePP5WOg4Sg9myygsR1hBO.html

Compassion, empathy, and self-sacrifice are central to this idea. Together we will win this battle,” he tweeted.Gandhi also posted a picture of two young children of different religions walking with their arms around each other.Earlier, his sister and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra urged the people to raise their voice for more aggressive testing, saying it’s the only way to prevent the spread of Covid-19.She said the mantra should be to test as much as possible and raise the testing levels and then treat the infected people.“The only way to prevent infection of coronavirus is through more and more testing. Only then can we treat the infected person. Test as much as possible and treat --- this should be our mantra. My request to all of you is - raise your voice for more testing,” she tweeted in Hindi.The Congress has been calling for more aggressive testing, saying India’s testing has been the lowest in the world, going by its population count.The party said that if testing was not “exponentially ramped up”, the country will be wasting precious time in the fight to save lives. “We just cannot afford to lose even a single day,” it warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-of-india-will-together-fight-covid-19-rahul-gandhi/story-ofsWv0HjxtP6yUF81JRYtJ.html

The need of the hour and immediate necessity is to share a part of this profit made by the government in the last six years,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters through video-conferencing.He said it is time to reduce taxes or give it back in some other form to farmers, labourers and common people suffering amid the 21-day nationwide lockdown, which started on March 25 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant economic downturn.“It is not a time for profiteering, it is a time for the government to do profit sharing and do some sharing and caring. This is the need of the hour and immediate necessity,” added Singhvi.The Congress leader also alleged that the Centre has made a profit of around Rs 20 lakh crore in the past six years.“Our question today to you is, why are you not passing on a fraction of these humongous gains. The Bharatiya Janata Party needs to realise that it has to stop solo profiteering; instead of stealing touch it has to give a healing touch.”Singhvi recalled that the price of crude oil internationally was hovering around $108 per barrel in March 2014 and now, six years later on March 30 it was at a historic low of $23 per barrel.“Lives are most important, followed by livelihood. We want to draw your attention to GDP -- Gas Diesel Petrol -- during the lockdown and how they should be harnessed to deal with it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/share-profits-from-low-crude-oil-prices-with-people-in-lockdown-congress-tells-govt/story-uyeZaIpv1y8ZDWJHleWTaL.html

People between 40 and 60 years account for 30% of the deaths, and below 40 years account for 7%, Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary of the health ministry, said. He added that 73% of the deaths occurred in men and 27% in women, indicating that men face a significantly higher risk due to the infection in India.Agarwal said 86% of the patients who died had conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and heart-related problems. “...we must realise those with comorbid health conditions are at a higher risk of developing a severe form of illness, and need to be extra cautious,” he said.Agarwal put the total number of cases at 4,067. According to the data compiled by the Union health ministry, men account for 76% of the total Covid-19 positive cases in India in comparison with the 24% infection rate in women, he said. Forty-seven per cent of the cases involved people who are aged below 40 years, 34% of the patients are between 40 and 60 years, and 19% of cases pertain to those above 60 years. Agarwal added that of the total cases in India, 1,445 (or about 35%) are linked to a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the national capital. According to the home ministry, at least 25,500 Jamaat members or people who came in contact with them have been quarantined across India.The six-storey headquarters in Delhi, where the mid-March gatherings of the Islamic missionary group took place, has emerged as India’s biggest hot spot of the fast-spreading infection.“In Haryana, five villages have been sealed as it was found some foreign nationals of the Jamaat had stayed in those villages,” said Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary of the home ministry.She also stressed that the government was trying its best to ensure smooth transportation of essential items such as medical supplies and food grains during the three-week, nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25.“It has been directed...that medical oxygen is an essential item and its manufacturing and transport is exempted from lockdown measures,” said Srivastava.The railways has also transported 1,340 wagons of sugar, 950 wagons of salt and 360 wagons/tanks of edible oil so far. In all, 16.94 lakh (1.69 million) metric tonnes of food grains have been transported, she said.At the same briefing, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it is also gearing up to test more samples, and has increased its testing capacity to 25,000 tests in a day in two shifts.“We have order about 500,000 rapid testing kits that we should get by April 8 or 9, and will be deployed in states as per the requirement,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, chief, epidemiology and communicable disease, ICMR.According to an ICMR advisory, rapid testing kits (for antibody tests or blood tests) need to be deployed in areas where mass testing is required, such as evacuation camps, large cluster areas, and migrant workers camps.“Our containment strategy is largely divided in two parts: one for areas where large number of cases are reported, and areas where large-scale local outbreaks are being reported. All states have been asked to form a district-specific containment plan even for districts that have not reported any cases so far. Our strategy is to remain proactive and over-prepared to deal with any eventuality,” said Agarwal.He, however, denied any widespread community transmission, the phase of the disease when the source of an individual’s infection cannot be traced and isolated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/63-of-covid-19-deaths-in-india-among-elderly-says-govt/story-8dKqAkDSe9p0jyZFarvkpL.html

Moments after, his party colleague, Lok Sabha MP Manickram Tagore, tweeted that RS members are not up to speed with realpolitik. “It’s sad that how Rajya Sabha MPs are completely disconnected with the ground reality,” Tagore tweeted. Tagore told HT that the move to suspend MPLADs is driven by “pure politics”. “It is a well-thought strategy to block Opposition MPs doing anything in their constituencies,” he said. Another senior Opposition member said that the LS members were anticipating trouble regarding MPLADS funds for a while. “There were strong indications and in a meeting that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders had held with an Opposition party a senior BJP leader had let it slip,” said the leader. The move has found other supporters and detractors inside the Congress. The party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the move is a “huge disservice”. “Please note that MPLADS is meant to execute developmental works in the constituency. Suspending it is a huge disservice to the constituents & will undermine the role & functions of MP,” he tweeted.Manish Tiwari called it an overstretch. “MPLADS is a targeted & nimble instrument to customise micro-level interventions to alleviate distress. I think MPLAD funds need to be restored,” he tweeted. Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor also said that the move was problematic. “MPLADS is the only means for an MP to direct development resources to his constituency. An order to earmark all MPLADS spending for #COVID19 related measures would have been OK; I used mine to get urgently-needed #rapidtestkits & PPE to Thiruvananthapuram’s health workers,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temporary-suspension-of-mplads-leads-to-fissure-within-the-congress/story-QNfhXC6my2NTsTRCPtr15I.html

06-04-2020||India||Political ideologies aside, MPs, experts come together to fight Covid-19||A device as rudimentary as a thermometer got Samajwadi Party (SP) spokesperson Ghanshyam Tiwari thinking about a group, which could come up with innovative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.“Our thermometers are primarily contact heavy,” Tiwari told Hindustan Times. “We need contact-less thermal sensors that can collate data, as Covid-19 spreads through contact. This can come in handy for frontline workers combating the pandemic. We can put out the data online and create a thermal map,” he said.Tiwari has set the ball rolling to create a national Covid-19 action group with people cutting across party lines such as members of Parliament (MP), public policy organisations and health experts. The group is named Parliamentarians with Innovators for India, whose primary task is to ensure that the solutions reach the masses.“The vision is to bring together think-tanks, policy experts with parliamentarians to conceptualise innovative solutions in the fight against Covid-19,” Anil Antony, south and west states coordinator for the initiative said. “The focus is technological solutions such as low-cost medical solutions like ventilators and testing kits. We have even reached out to some premier venture capitalists in case funding is needed for any of these projects.”An alumnus of Harvard University, Tiwari believes that the MPs have the last-mile connectivity with people on the ground and are best suited to spread public awareness about Covid-19.He started the initiative by reaching out to Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi. “The idea is to put together a group of people from different political ideologies and rise above our political differences to fight this pandemic together,” Chaturvedi said. The fledgling group consists of 14 MPs including National People’s Party’s (NPP) Agatha Sangma, GVL Narsimha Rao, Jamyang Tshering Namgyal, Varun Gandhi and Sudhanshu Trivedi from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s Kalanidhi Veerasamy, Karti Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Rajeev Gowda from the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party’s Kunwar Danish Ali, YSR Congress Party’s Lavu Krishna, Trinamool Congress’s Mahua Moitra and Biju Janata Dal’s Sujeet Kumar.The group has also tied up with the Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Indore, Confederation of Indian Industry, Delhi, and the Population Foundation of India. Health experts such as Meenakshi Datta Ghosh, former special secretary, Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; Dr Arnab Mukherjee of IIM-Bangalore and Dr. Amir Ullah Khan, advisor, Indian School of Business (ISB), are a part of the novel initiative.The group has invited suggestions from the public on its website starting Tuesday and will meet once a week from April 15. “We’ll need protocols and suggestions as to how to tackle many other possible problems such as traveling in public transport after the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown is lifted,” Tiwari said. “We need to start thinking about the next step right now,” he added. The group is also planning to collate videos in several languages to offer healthcare professionals tutorials on the pandemic. “Not everyone knows all the protocols. The government can’t do everything, so we’re trying to do our bit. The solutions will be posted on LinkedIn, a social media network for professionals, as we need to synthesise expertise for public welfare,” he added. “This will be a knowledge-sharing platform that has a wide scope,” said Congress MP Rajeev Gowda.“The exchange of information will help cross-fertilisation of ideas to fight Covid-19,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-ideologies-aside-mps-experts-come-together-to-fight-covid-19/story-W2sO9Fhj0EGQuC6ra0r5FJ.html

The government anyway has imposed a three-week, nationwide lockdown, which began on March 25, to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease.The advisory urged the following precautions such as highlighting immediate preventive steps to be taken to stop the spread of Covid-19 among wildlife, reducing human-wildlife interface, setting up of a task force of veterinary doctors, biologists, and field managers, creating a 24x7 reporting mechanism, enhancing disease surveillance and reporting action taken to ministry.“Human activities such as consumption of wild meat, wildlife trade, habitat change, and fragmentation are leading to increasing contact between people and wildlife. Multiple zoonotic diseases have emerged resulting in transmissions between wildlife, domestic animals and people. Covid-19 is, perhaps, the most destructive example … Interspecies transmission is extremely worrisome --- whether it be from pangolins, bats, civets or tigers. Mammals are vulnerable but we don’t know enough as of now,” said Krithi Karanth, chief conservation scientist at the Centre for Wildlife Studies and adjunct associate professor, Duke University, North Carolina, USA.The tiger at the Bronx Zoo is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the US or a tiger anywhere, the authorities said on Sunday.The four-year-old tiger named Nadia – and six other tigers and lions that have also taken ill – are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn’t yet showing symptoms, the zoo authorities said. The first animal started showing symptoms on 27 March, and all were doing well and expected to recover, they added.

The new funds will help the Indian government to “slow the spread of Covid-19, provide care for the affected, and support local communities with the tools needed to contain the disease”, the statement said. The new funding builds on a foundation of more than $1.4 billion in health assistance, and nearly $3 billion in total assistance, that the US has provided to India over the past 20 years.Praising India’s efforts to counter the disease, US ambassador Kenneth Juster said the USAID assistance will further support the country’s response.“Covid-19 is a global public health threat that can be addressed best by close collaboration among governments and international organisations. The US government, through USAID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other US Department of Health and Human Services agencies, is working closely with the government of India and multilateral agencies to support India’s response to this global pandemic,” he said.The US has been the world’s largest provider of bilateral assistance in public health for several decades. Since 2009, American taxpayers have made available more than $100 billion in health assistance and nearly $70 billion in humanitarian assistance globally.US contributions to WHO in 2019 exceeded $400 million, almost double the second largest member state’s contribution, while US support to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) was nearly $1.7 billion in 2019. US contributions to the UN Children’s Fund in 2019 totalled more than $700 million.“Because an infectious disease threat anywhere can become a threat everywhere, the US calls on other donors to contribute to the global effort to combat Covid-19,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/usaid-provides-2-9-million-aid-to-india-to-fight-covid-19/story-g5xrY0UCZiPNuIpyrOSbKJ.html

The problem is not of money but availability of PPE kits. We wud be grateful if u cud help us get them from somewhere immediately, Del govt will buy them. Thank u (sic),” Kejriwal tweeted.The BJP’s barbs came after Manish Sisodia, Kejriwal’s deputy, on Saturday sought central funds to fight coronavirus pandemic, saying it was the third most affected state in the country.Sisodia, in a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, had alleged the Centre released over Rs 17,000 crore to states from the disaster fund but not a single rupee was given to Delhi.  मैंने केंद्र सरकार को चिट्ठी लिखकर दिल्ली के लिए भी आपदा फंड की माँग की है. केंद्र ने राज्यों को कोरोना से लड़ने के लिए, आपदा फंड से 17 हज़ार करोड़ जारी किए लेकिन दिल्ली को इसमें एक रुपया भी नहीं दिया. इस समय पूरे देश को एक होकर लड़ना चाहिए. इस तरह का भेदभाव दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण है. pic.twitter.com/OEKMt783EzArvind Kejriwal had also claimed that his government has asked for PPE kits from the Centre but none were received.After that, Gautam Gambhir, who represents East Delhi in the Lok Sabha, had accused the Arvind Kejriwal government of “shedding crocodile tears” and “playing the victim card” over the issue on Saturday.Gambhir also said that he had offered to donate Rs 50 lakh to the Delhi government for buying PPE kits and masks, but did not receive any feedback. सुबह से शाम तक TV पे प्रचार के करोड़ों अगर PPE Kits पे लगाते तो जनता का कुछ भला हो जाता 2 हफ़्ते पहले मैंने PPE Kits और Masks के लिए 50 लाख pledge किये थे, आज तक कोई feedback नहीं. अब centre से मांग रहे हैं @ArvindKejriwal के दो हथियार, घड़ियाली आंसू और victimcard pic.twitter.com/Cm11UcyBT5Manoj Tiwari, the BJP’s Delhi unit president, had also tweeted about Arvind Kejriwal’s intention pointing to the AAP’s budget of Rs 65,000 crore and its inability to buy PPE kits worth Rs 1-2 crore.On Monday, the former cricketer targeted the Kejriwal-led government once again. “CM @ArvindKejriwal & his Dy say funds are needed. Though their massive egos didn’t allow them to take 50 L from my LAD fund earlier, I pledge 50 L more so that innocents don’t suffer!” Gambhir posted.“1 CR would at least solve urgent need for masks & PPE kits for days Hope they prioritize Delhi,” he said.At least 24 health care workers—doctors, nurses, sanitation staff—in Delhi have contracted Covid-19 and raised questions about the availability of adequate PPEs such as full-body suits, goggles, masks, gloves and shoe covers.Resident doctors at Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital have written to NGOs asking for PPE kits and masks. The doctors, however, said there wasn’t an immediate shortage, but any help was appreciated in the long battle.Delhi has the third-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The Union health ministry said on Monday morning that there are 528 cases of the coronavirus disease, including 18 people who have been cured of discharged, and seven fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-outbreak-arvind-kejriwal-responds-to-gautam-gambhir-s-big-egos-barb-explains-the-problem/story-i9CVH7Lc4rhvZSJ8hM8coL.html

06-04-2020||India||Nod to Tablighi Jamaat gathering should have been denied, says Sharad Pawar||Authorities in Delhi should not have given permission to the Tablighi Jamaat for holding an international congregation at Nizamuddin in the national capital between March 13 and 15 amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Monday. Pawar said Maharashtra, where the NCP is in the ruling alliance alongside the Shiv Sena and the Congress, earlier denied Jamaat permission for an event. The country wouldn’t have experienced a spike in Covid-19 positive cases if the permission to hold the international congregation was denied to Jamaat, Pawar said, while interacting with people during a live Facebook chat. “Tablighi Jamaat shouldn’t have organised the international congregation in the first place. There was no reason to give permission to the organisation to hold the event amid the Covid-19 outbreak. In Maharashtra, too, a similar request was made, but both chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Deshmukh decided to deny the permission. If similar concern was shown by the authorities in Delhi, then we wouldn’t have to see what is going on today,” he said.“Is there an attempt to create a perception about a particular community and foment a social divide? They wouldn’t have got that opportunity,” he added without pinning the blame on any individual or party.Pawar cited another example of social distancing from Maharashtra, where a bull and horse race competition was organised at a village in Solapur district and a crowd in thousands were gathered. The district police authorities started booking people, who made a beeline for the event, he said. “If similar alertness was shown by the authorities in Delhi then we’d certainly have averted the unfortunate situation,” he added. He also stressed that the country needs to stand united and no attempt should be made that could lead to suspicion, animosity and social divide. “Whatever I’m watching on television and especially the messages being circulated on WhatsApp is of grave concern. Later, it was found that four of the five messages were fake. It appears these messages are being sent to create confusion and misunderstanding among people,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/permission-to-hold-congregation-by-tablighi-jamaat-should-have-been-denied-says-pawar/story-uqUSwyc1YODkfQVdCBkdiL.html

06-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: What is a Covid-19 containment zone and why is it created?||With the spread of coronavirus infections, one thing that is also rising is the use of the jargons around the Covid-19 related news. One such term is “containment zone”.Mumbai authorities have declared Wockhardt Hospital a containment zone after dozens of nurses and doctors tested positive for Covid-19. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also come up with a map showing the city’s containment zones. Here’s a quick look at what the term stands for and how are such zones determined in tackling the coronavirus spread. What is a containment zone?According to the Ministry of Health, a Covid-19 containment zone refers to the area where positive cases of coronavirus are found. Containment zones are created to map the local transmission of the disease and prevent the contagion from spreading. How is a containment zone determined?The rapid response team (RRT) identifies containment zones based on the extent of cases/contacts listed and mapped by them. Every confirmed case has to be considered as an epicentre and micro-plan activities will need to be done.The RRT then demarcates the area of 3-kilometre radius around the epicentre (the residence of the positive case) in case contact listing and mapping takes more than 24 hours. This area of 3 km radius is the containment zone. If required, based on the mapping of contacts and cases, the containment zone is refined, the release issued by the health ministry read.What is a buffer zone?A buffer zone of an additional 5-kilometre radius (7 Kms in rural areas)/administrative boundary of including neighbouring districts/per-urban zone shall also be identified, as detailed in the cluster containment plan. “The containment zone will be divided into sectors with 50 houses each (30 houses in difficult areas),” the government’s release on the micro plan containing local coronavirus transmission read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-what-is-a-covid-19-containment-zone-and-why-is-it-created/story-k2qHFXwUXqr4a17mQoPtuO.html

In this regard it is hereby informed that Central Drugs Standard Organisation (CDSCO), the competent authority for the approval and issuance of license for import/ manufacturer for marketing of coronavirus diagnostic kit, has not licensed the aforesaid diagnostic kit by M/s Bione Ventures Private Limited,” the DCGI notice said, warning people against buying such a product online.The drugs controller acted on a complaint by the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), which said the Bengaluru company provided no details on the foreign manufacturers of the kits, approval status in India or the test kit’s performance. “The kit is being marketed as a single point-of-care home screening kit, and being sold directly to consumers through its website,” the complaint said. There is no self-testing kit for Covid-19 approved for sale in India at present. All tests are to be conducted by trained health experts and after following the rules laid down by the country’s apex biomedical research organisation, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-approval-for-covid-19-testing-kit-that-can-be-used-at-home/story-6KByMODJmrBFIdjI4pKHQI.html

We all must follow these suggestions by the party which have the feeling of Antodaya as well as the firm resolve of service at their core,” he said.Among his first request for the party’s workers was to provide the poor with food and not just for the duration of the present crisis. The Prime Minister said it should be a continuous service to the poor.Also read: A long war against coronavirus, must not get tired or rest, says PM Modi“Ever since this crisis has started, lakhs of the BJP’s workers have been doing this but it needs to be expanded into a bigger campaign by taking along other organisations to ensure no one is left hungry. We have to make sure of this,” he said. The Prime Minister’s second request was about masks.“When you are going to help someone else, you should always wear something to cover your face. It is not necessary to wear only those masks that are being used but healthcare workers. We can use any mask made at home and make it a practice to wear it,” the PM said.He also urged party workers to make masks for five other people in their family and distribute them among others. Also read: With 490 new coronavirus patients, India now has 4067 cases; death toll at 109“In this difficult time, we need to express our gratitude, thank those who are involved in serving the people and boost their morale. And this is not just our responsibility and we need to mobilise the entire society,” he said.His third request, Modi said, was connected with the ‘thank you campaign’.“The party has given a broad template to carry out this campaign that we need to ask families to write a letter of appreciation for five different sections of workers and reach out to them in polling booths,” he said.They are doctors and nurses in their areas, sanitation workers, police personnel, bank and post office workers and other government employees engaged in carrying out essential services.He also encouraged workers to inform people about and download Aarogya Setu, a mobile application that has been developed to fight the coronavirus disease, and said it can play an important role in curbing infection in the long term.“The more successful we are at doing this, the better we will be able to control the spread of the infection. You must be able to persuade at least 40 people to install this Aarogya Setu app and tell them about this,” he said.There’s another thing that has to be done, he said, to fight this battle against coronavirus pandemic.“Financial service is a big thing. We have seen that when the country is at war, our mother and sisters give away their jewellery. The poor give away whatever that can. We have seen this during every war,” he said. “This is no less than a war… Just as we contribute during wars and make a tradition out of it, right now lakhs of people are donating towards the PM-CARES fund,” he said.The Prime Minister said his fifth request was for workers to make an effort to make sure the donations being made for the PM-CARES fund increase. “Every BJP workers must help. We need to motivate 40 people to donate towards the fund as well,” the PM said.As he ended his address he stressed on the usage of masks, discipline and social distancing to make sure everyone is safe in the fight against the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-makes-5-requests-to-bjp-workers-gratitude-masks-aarogya-setu-are-among-them/story-M8JiPiHCDUcV5j4XKkrLKO.html

Zoos have also been asked to send samples of animals suspected to be sick, to three designated animal health institutes to initiate COVID-19 testing. The Central Zoo Authority, the apex body for all zoos in India, issued an advisory in this regard on Monday. “Zoos in the country, are therefore, advised to remain on highest alertness, watch animals on 24x7 basis, using CCTv for any abnormal behavior and symptoms, keepers and handlers not to be allowed in the vicinity without safety gear preferably PPE (personal protective equipment), isolate and quarantine sick animals, and have least contact whole provding feed to animals,” the advisory issued by the CZAI said.A four-year-old female Malayan tiger named Nadia tested positive for the coronavirus at the Bronx Zoo. There are around 160 recognised zoos in India with more than 56,800 captive animal in them. All zoos are presently closed because of the lockdown. The CZAI advisory also says “Mammals like carnivores especially cats, ferrets and primates to be carefully monitored and fortnightly samples of suspected cases to be sent to the designated animal health institutes to initiate COVID-19 testing while following all bio-containment and safety measures required to handle this high risk pathogen as per the national and ICMR guidelines.”It also says that all zoo personnel will have to to strictly adhere to safety and disinfection protocol issued by the government, time to time, on novel coronavirus disease.“Further zoos are advised to coordinate with designated nodal agencies of the government responsible for public health response and permit screening, testing and surveillance and diagnostic samples as and when required by the nodal agency,” it says.An earlier non-peer reviewed study published in BioRxiv had found that ferrets and cats are susceptible to contracting coronavirus (Covid-19) but not dogs, ducks, chickens and pigs. According to the study, these findings can be important for vaccine and antiviral drug development for the disease. BioRxiv is a free online archive and distribution service for unpublished preprints in life sciences.There is, however, no reason for panic among pet keepers or cat lovers because the findings are based on only lab experiments, and there has been no study on whether cats can pass on the infection to humans, according to experts. It is also unclear which species of cats was used for the experiments for the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-zoos-put-on-highest-alertness-after-bronx-zoo-tiger-tests-positive-of-covid-19/story-cKImw7cY7lp5oeAkkRd2nO.html
06-04-2020||India||India’s efforts to fight Covid-19 appreciated globally: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the country’s timely and proactive efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak have been appreciated globally and the steps taken so far have set an example for the world at large.The PM said this while addressing the workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the party’s 40th foundation day. He pointed out that India is among those nations that have understood the seriousness of Covid-19 pandemic and took timely actions to prevent the spread of the viral outbreak.“We took several measures, took all state governments along even though we didn’t know anything about the disease. Whatever necessary decisions were required were taken with the help of experts; whether it was about thermal screening at airports, or evacuation of people or enhancing medical infrastructure requirements. We took all proactive steps to contain the disease,” he said.He appreciated the role of the state governments for their collaborations, as the country could expedite the measures taken to fight the pandemic. The World Health Organization has also appreciated India’s efforts, he added.“India played a critical role in the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) nations’ and G-20 (Group of 20 nations) meetings. We’ve been in constant touch with world leaders and they’ve all appreciated our steps. We’re busy fighting the war against poverty. But now at this time of the crisis, we’re continually moving ahead unitedly,” he said.The PM lauded people’s adherence to the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, which started on March 25. He said the maturity and seriousness that they showed during the “Janta Curfew” on March 22 is unparalleled. “No one could imagine that in such a large country, people will show such discipline,” he said.The PM also gave his party colleagues five tasks, or panchagraha, to help strengthen the nation’s war against Covid-19.“Party president JP Nadda and the national team have already set the template, and it applies to all of us, including me. We all need to follow these suggestions that have antodaya and service at their core,” he said.The first rule to follow is to the provision of ration and food for the poor. Lakhs of party workers have been doing this, but it needs to be expanded into a bigger campaign taking along other organisations to ensure no one is left hungry, he said. “Always wear a mask while helping others, and it is not necessary to wear only those masks that health care workers use. We can use any mask made at home and make it a practice,” the PM added. He also urged party workers to make masks for five others.The third instruction is to carry out a campaign to thank health care workers, police, bank and post office workers and others engaged in essential services. He urged the party members to reach out to families in their polling booths and make them sign letters of appreciation for these front-line workers.He encouraged BJP workers to stress the need for using Arogya Setu, an app that has been developed to curb the viral outbreak. “At least 40 people should be told about how to use this app,” he said.“ When the country is at war, our women give away their jewellery and the poor give away whatever they can. This is not less than a war, just as we contribute towards war, we need to increase the donations being made for the PM CARES (Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations) fund. We need to donate and also encourage others as well,” the PM said, urging party colleagues to increase the collections for the donative drive that will be used exclusively for fighting the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-efforts-to-fight-covid-19-appreciated-globally-modi/story-OuG4LDIlwZC2gxqwAFw1sL.html

But we do not have to get tired or take a rest in this war. We have to emerge victorious. Today, the country has only one goal and one resolve: to win this war,” said PM Modi in his address to BJP karyakartas on the party’s foundation day.The PM underlined how India understood seriousness of this disease and waged a timely war against it. He said India’s efforts have set an example before the world. The PM also praised the maturity shown by 130 crore Indians during this nationwide lockdown. “India’s efforts have set an example before the world in tackling coronavisus.India is one of the countries which understood the seriousness of this disease and waged a timely war against it. India took several decisions and tried its best to implement them on ground,” said the PM via video call to BJP members. PM Modi to Akshay Kumar & Mukesh Ambani: Watch who all lit diyas | 9 pm, 9 min The death toll due to novel coronavirus rose to 109 and the number of cases in the country climbed to 4,067 on Monday, according to the Union Health Ministry.Maharashtra has reported the most coronavirus deaths at 45, followed by Gujarat at 11, Madhya Pradesh at nine, Telangana and Delhi at seven each, Tamil Nadu at five and Punjab at six. The highest number of confirmed cases is from Maharashtra at 690, followed by Tamil Nadu at 571 and Delhi at 503. The number cases in Telengana has gone up to 321, in Kerala to 314 and in Rajasthan to 253.In March, in a video conference with leaders and representatives from SAARC nations, PM Modi, chalking out a joint strategy to fight the coronavirus outbreak, said “prepare, but don’t panic” has been India’s guiding mantra in dealing with the pandemic.“We started screening people entering India from mid-January itself, while gradually increasing restrictions on travel,” Modi told the Saarc leader.In India, testing has now become more widespread and aggressive in clusters and containment zones, at least in a few states. And it will become even more widespread (and quicker) when some states start using the antibody test kits they have been allowed to procure.A document put out by the government on Saturday, and the Prime Minister’s reference to a phased exit from the lockdown in a meeting with chief ministers last week seem to suggest that restrictions will continue in at least some parts of the country — clusters and containment zones, for instance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-long-war-against-coronavirus-must-not-get-tired-or-rest-says-pm-modi/story-kVVk8XTk6CcdY3VbA9VrNK.html

06-04-2020||India||Zoos in India put on alert after tiger tests Covid-19 positive in New York||All zoos in India have been asked to remain on high alert and monitor animals for any abnormal behaviour, after a tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Zoos have also been asked to send samples of suspect animals to animal health institutes to initiate Covid-19 testing. The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI), the apex body for all zoos in India, issued an advisory in this regard on Monday.It came after a four-year-old female Malayan tiger named Nadia tested positive for the coronavirus at the Bronx Zoo, in what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the US or a tiger anywhere.Nadia — and six other tigers and lions that have also fallen ill — are believed to have been infected by a zoo employee who wasn’t yet showing symptoms. The first animal started showing symptoms March 27, and all are doing well and expected to recover.There are around 160 recognised zoos in India with more than 56,800 captive animals. All zoos are presently closed because of the 21-day, nationwide lockdown that began on Match 25. “Zoos in the country, are therefore, advised to remain on highest alertness, watch animals on 24x7 basis, using CCTV for any abnormal behaviour and symptoms,” the advisory issued by CZAI said.It asked zookeepers and handlers not to go close to the animals without safety gear, preferably PPE (personal protective equipment), and have least contact while feeding them. Zoo officials have also been directed to isolate and quarantine sick animals.According to the CZAI directive, carnivores, especially cat, ferret and primates, are to be carefully monitored and fortnightly samples of suspect cases are to be sent to three designated animal health institutes for Covid-19 testing while following all safety measures.All zoo personnel will have to strictly adhere to safety and disinfection protocol issued by the government, time to time, the guideline said. “Further zoos are advised to coordinate with designated nodal agencies of the government responsible for public health response and permit screening, testing and surveillance and diagnostic samples as and when required by the nodal agency,” it said.The Bronx Zoo finding raises new questions about transmission of the virus in animals. The coronavirus outbreaks around the world are driven by person-to-person transmission, experts say. However, concerns have been raised over whether the infection caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted between animals and humans; there are reports of a pet cat in Belgium and two dogs in Hong Kong getting infected.But Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn’t pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.Some researchers have been trying to understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the virus, and to determine how it spreads among animals, according to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zoos-in-india-put-on-alert-after-tiger-tests-covid-19-positive-in-new-york/story-YxbBKta1EfAe8YIwlbce6J.html

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had declared the hospital as a containment zone on Sunday. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), BMC, said they have sealed the hospital and the staffers are not allowed to go out until they test negative for a coronavirus test. “It is the fault of the hospital administration that they didn’t take precautionary measures, due to which nearly 300 staffers have been quarantined. We have also set up a team to probe how the virus spread among so many people in a hospital setting,” he said.As HT had reported earlier, the Covid-19 positive nurses alleged that due to the negligence of the hospital, the infection spread to other staffers. On March 20 two suspected and positive Covid-19 patients were brought to the hospital from Kasturba Gandhi Hospital. The confirmed cases were kept in isolation wards, while suspects were kept in general ICU wards where non-Covid-19 patients were also being provided care. Also Watch | Why Mumbai’s lack of isolation beds could pose problems in battling pandemic On March 28, two nurses working in the same general ICU ward tested positive for Covid-19. But soon, 10 nurses got infected and later the infection spread to 26 nurses and three doctors.“We have contracted the infection after we were exposed to suspected coronavirus patients who were undergoing treatment in a general ward at the hospital,” said a nurse from the hospital who has been found positive. The relatives of the patients also claimed that the infected nurses shared the same canteen, hostels and bathrooms with uninfected medical staffers.Staff members said that the hospital did not quarantine the nurses and forced them to work resulting in the spread of the virus to other staff members. While recounting the alleged harassment, a nurse said when the BMC came for inspection on April 1, few of the nurses informed them about their symptoms but they were reprimanded by the senior officers from the hospital.Meanwhile, the nurses who tested positive have been shifted to the hospital from their quarters in Vile Parle, while two of the infected doctors are admitted to Seven Hills and the third one to SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim. The swab samples of more than 270 hospital staff and some patients have been sent for tests.The nursing association has filed a complaint with the BMC commissioner seeking action against the hospital.

What started in the Chinese city of Wuhan has now travelled across continents to severely hit the United States and European nations like Italy, Spain, France and Germany.Amid the Covid-19 crisis, one thinks if there’s hardly any corner in the world which isn’t touched by the deadly contagion - the answer to which is, yes.According to reports, small Pacific Island nations have not reported any coronavirus so far. These island nations benefit from their remoteness as well as travel restrictions. Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa, Kiribati, Micronesia, Tonga, the Marshall Islands Palau, Tuvalu, and Nauru are places where there’s no news of Covid-19.Also Watch | China’s hollow ‘virus diplomacy’ and a look at Beijing’s missteps Interestingly, North Korea and Yemen, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan in Asia have not reported any Covid-19 cases.Some international experts are sceptical of North Korea’s assertion that it has not had a single case of the new coronavirus, which was first detected in neighbouring China.“I’m a bit surprised that North Korea decided to go ahead with its spring SPA session,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a Seoul-based analyst for a website that monitors North Korea, news agency Reuters reported.The coronavirus outbreak infected at least 80,000 people and killed over 3,000 before marching on to the rest of the world. So far, the United States of America has the highest number of cases with over 2 lakh patients and nearly 10,000 deaths.

The state administration headed by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta have been closely monitoring the action plan in these cities.Thackeray is holding a meeting with the guardian secretaries (senior IAS officers ascertained with the responsibilities of districts) of all districts on Monday and is expected to direct them to ensure containment of the virus and smooth supply of the essential commodities. Mumbai and Navi Mumbai municipal corporations have formed 519 and 196 teams of the health works respectively to work in the containment zones and monitor the people who are high-risk possibilities. Pune has 439 teams, while Nagpur city has 210 such teams. “We have 3078 teams comprising more than four members in each team across the state. They have traced more than 10 lakh people who need to be monitored to avoid the spread,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.Of the 748 positive patients (as of Sunday evening) in Maharashtra, which tops the chart in the country, 640 are from MMR and Pune. Similarly, of 45 deaths, 36 are in MMR which comprises of Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. Five are in Pune, which is less than 150 kilometre from MMR.“Of the 36 districts, around 10 have no positive patient at all. Excluding MMR, Pune and Nagpur, the remaining part of the state has hardly seen any outbreak of the virus. If we could keep the most affected areas away from the remaining part, we could rapidly recover from the rising numbers. Similarly, spread within these containment zones will have to be contained. The collectors and municipal commissioners from these areas have been directed for such concentration on these areas,” said a key official from state government.Another challenge before the state government is controlling the crowding at the vegetable markets in cities. After having shifted its major market at Dadar, the government is expected to tweak its policy for the vegetable markets temporarily shifted at grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-maharashtra-s-covid-19-containment-plan-mumbai-nagpur-and-pune-are-key/story-odT2rLdUMbGinze6Qd9d2L.html

Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai make up the MMR, which is located less than 150 kilometres away from Pune.Maharashtra has reported 781 Covid-19 positive cases until Monday morning --- the highest in the country --- of which 670 are from the MMR and Pune. The state has recorded 45 Covid-19 related deaths, of which 36 are from the MMR and five from Pune. The civic bodies in the MMR and Pune have been directed to meticulously implement the cluster containment action plan in a bid to contain the rapid spread of the viral outbreak.The state administration, headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, has been closely monitoring the action plan in these urban areas. Thackeray will hold a meeting with the guardian secretaries -- a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) from each district has been appointed as a point-person for better coordination with the state government -- on Monday. The district authorities are likely to be ordered to ensure the containment of Covid-19 positive cases and a smooth supply of essential commodities. Mumbai and Navi Mumbai municipal corporations have formed 519 and 196 teams of health workers, respectively, to work in the containment zones and monitor the high-risk people. Similarly, Pune and Nagpur have formed 439 and 210 teams, respectively. “We’ve formed 3,078 teams, comprising more than four health workers in each unit, across the state. They’ve traced over 10 lakh people, who need to be monitored to prevent the viral outbreak,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.“Of the 36 districts, around 10 haven’t reported a single Covid-19 positive case. The outbreak is only restricted to the MMR, Pune and Nagpur. If we could isolate the affected areas from the rest of the state, we could rapidly bring down the number of Covid-19 positive cases. Similarly, the spread within the containment zones can be brought under control,” said an official.The authorities, however, are facing a major challenge as far as controlling the crowds at vegetable markets in urban areas is concerned. They have temporarily shifted the markets to open grounds on the lines of their experiment with the Dadar market last week. Plans are now afoot to set up a cluster of small markets in residential areas.Senior IAS officers are appointed as guardian secretary with one district each for better coordination between state amd district administrations.

I appeal to BJP Karyakartas to follow the set of guidelines from our Party President @JPNaddavJi, help those in need and reaffirm the importance of social distancing.

06-04-2020||India||Social media comes down on those who burst crackers in response to PM’s candlelight vigil call||“It’s not a party,” “It’s not Diwali,” netizens vented their ire on social media, as people switched off lights at their homes at 9 pm on Sunday and instead of lighting candles, burst firecrackers in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a nine-minute candlelight vigil.Modi had called for a nine-minute candlelight vigil on Sunday as a means to dispel the darkness spread by the coronavirus pandemic. He had asked people to switch off the lights at their homes and light a candle or a diya at their doorsteps or in their balconies at 9 pm on Sunday.While many put up video clips and pictures of themselves lighting candles, most social media posts came down heavily against those bursting crackers.Netizens put up video clips and pictures of people bursting crackers and shouting slogans as 9 pm approached.“Corona ke Bharat aagman par deshwaasi khushi manate hue. Well done (people welcoming the entry of corona to India),” tweeted Arun Arora, taking a dig at those bursting crackers.Twitter user Sparsh Oberoi, however, attributed the celebrations to boredom.“I find that we are getting crazier by every activity. Is this due to being bored of the lockdown or just no idea of what’s going on around us. The PM never asked to burst crackers. We are not celebrating anything ppl,” he tweeted.Disability rights activist Nipun Malhotra urged people not to burst crackers and reminded them that this was not a joyous moment. “Light a diya. Be united. But crackers? Really? This ain’t a party!” he tweeted.Standup comic Vir Das indicated that he had preempted this reaction to the PM’s call two days in advance.“Repeat: Sunday is an INDOORS show of solidarity. It is NOT diwali,” he said, re-tweeting an April 3 tweet of his with a solitary “sigh”.Many wondered how people procured firecrackers during a nationwide shutdown.“Who declared crackers as essential service?” wrote Anivar Aravind.Tweeting from the handle @_NairFYI, one user saw the bursting of crackers during a pandemic as an ominous sign and said, “Before the Titanic went down they did fire rockets to alert nearby ships.” Some Twitter users also said slogans were raised as 9 pm approached.“This is so incredible & mesmerising, to my surprise ppl even shouted slogans “Bharat Mata Ki Jay” & “Vande Mataram”... #9pm9minute,” tweeted Amol Siddham.However, there were some who found humour even in the mass voluntary blackout.“Itna andhera ho gaya hai poore India main, Corona ne rasta bhatak kar wapas China chale jana hai (there is so much darkness in India that corona has lost its way and gone back to China),” tweeted a user from the handle @swatic12.Another user, Rangjogi, said, “Well, right after the first 2 quaint minutes, there were rockets in the sky. Mithai anyone??” tweeting with the hashtag #DiwaliAgainstCorona.According to the Health Ministry, the number of coronavirus cases climbed to 3,374 in the country on Sunday, while the death toll rose to 77.Of these, the number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 3,030, while 266 people were cured and one had migrated, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-media-comes-down-on-those-who-burst-crackers-in-response-to-pm-s-candlelight-vigil-call/story-gnEFkT6Z3Gi8nbFtgn9jbN.html

Tamil Nadu was second with 584 patients of the coronavirus disease followed by Delhi, which has reported 528 cases with seven fatalities.Also Watch | ‘Ruthless containment...’: Govt on district-level plans as Covid-19 cases rise The numbers in Delhi have risen after hundreds of people, who took part in the Tablighi Jamaat’s religious congregation in Nizamuddin, tested positive for Covid-19. Mumbai and other cities in Maharashtra like Pune and Nagpur have recorded a substantial rise in the number of Covid-19 patients in last few days—of these nearly 85% are in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune district, the most urbanised areas of the state.The state government has decided to focus on these areas to contain the spread of the virus. The municipal corporations in these cities have been directed to implement the cluster containment action plan minutely to restrict the spread. Municipal corporations in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai have formed 519 and 196 teams of the health works respectively to work in the containment zones and monitoring people who are in high-risk areas. Pune has 439 teams and Nagpur city has 210.“We have 3078 teams comprising more than four members in each team across the state. They have traced more than 10 lakh people who need to be monitored to avoid the spread,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.The Centre said on Saturday that the doubling rate of the pathogen’s spread was at 4.1 days and it said would have stood at 7.4 if not for the Nizamuddin hotspot.The jump in the number of coronavirus infections, officials said, has been driven by the detection of hundreds of people who attended the congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group, in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Markaz last month.Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Karnataka, Andaman and Nicobar, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh and Jharkhand have reported cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event in March.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), India’s top biomedical research organisation has said that Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is not airborne.“If it was an airborne infection, then in a family whoever has a contact they all should come positive because they are living in the same surrounding as the patient and the family is breathing the same air,” Raman R Gangakhedkar, ICMR’s head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, said on Saturday.“When someone is admitted in a hospital, other patients would have been exposed (if it was airborne) but that is not the case,” he said.ICMR also issued an advisory saying spitting in public places could enhance the spread of Covid-19. It has released an advisory on how and where to use the rapid test, which can determine the immunity of an individual and help people get back into the workforce. The advisory includes people in high-risk areas or containment zones, large migration gatherings and evacuation centres.Millions of people across India turned off their lights and lit up their balconies and doorsteps with lamps, candles and flashlights on Sunday, in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to “challenge the darkness” spread by the coronavirus crisis.The Prime Minister, who imposed a three-week-long nationwide lockdown on March 25, asked all citizens to turn out their lights for nine minutes at 9pm and to display lamps and candles in a show of solidarity.Officials in multiple states have said curbs on movement and commercial activity could be relaxed first in districts with no coronavirus disease cases as part of their plan to a staggered return to normal activity could work after April 14, when the nationwide lockdown is scheduled to end.Central officials said on Sunday that they discussed with states a “containment strategy” that hinges on identifying and cordoning off hot spot areas.This strategy could be crucial to lifting the three-week lockdown in force since March 25 without risking a resurgence of the disease. As on Sunday, cases have been reported from 274 of the country’s 718 districts. Twenty-one of the 230 districts in nine states are considered hot spots.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a conference call on Thursday with chief ministers from across the country, had asked states to pitch in with ideas on how the curbs can be relaxed in a phased manner.The number of Covid-19 cases in the world was 1.25 million on Sunday night, and the number of deaths stood at 68,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-cases-in-india-rise-to-4067-death-toll-at-109/story-gxiLOm9hx74ExahoMRbHKK.html

About 21,200 people linked to a gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat in the Capital’s Nizamuddin Basti, which has emerged as a hot spot of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), have been quarantined in India, according to government officials. The number includes 2,000 foreigners.4. More than 50 doctors and other healthcare workers have tested positive for the coronavirus disease across India, putting the spotlight on their vulnerability and the possibility of hospitals emerging as high-risk places to contract the infection.5. Odisha recorded the highest single-day surge in positive Covid-19 cases on Sunday with 18 cases being reported from the state capital Bhubaneswar hours after the government allayed fears of community transmission. From 21 cases till Saturday, the number of positive cases surged to 39 on Sunday.6. Four more people, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat’s events, tested positive for Covid-19 in Uttarakhand on Sunday, taking the number of cases in the state from 22 to 26.7. As of Sunday morning, at least 1,023 cases in 17 states and Union Territories, or over 30% of India’s total Covid-19 infections, could be linked to the mid-March gathering that has prompted authorities to launch a complex exercise to trace the footsteps of those who fanned out across the country.8. Nearly the entire top brass of Madhya Pradesh’s health department is under quarantine after 11 of the department, including two Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers and the director of health services, have tested positive for Covid-19 since Saturday.9.

On Sunday morning, the homemaker said she was not sure how to provide two square meal to her family.Ever since the government announced lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 15 lakh people linked directly or indirectly to the district’s bidi industry—considered the biggest in the state—are now dependent on food provided by the state and non-government organisations. “To help the dairy industry, the state has permitted sweet shops to stay open for four hours. Is the administration not aware of our plight?” Mohammad Jamaluddin, a wage labourer, asked.“It is impossible to survive on paltry savings and limited ration. The government must allow bidi production to save people from starvation,” he said.Also read: Railway employee becomes second person to die in north BengalIn certain pockets of Murshidabad, entire families depend on bidi making, people from the industry said. There are more than 100 factories in the district’s Jangipur sub-division alone. Bidis from Murshidabad are sold in many states. “More than eight lakh people are directly associated with the production in Shamserganj and Suti police station areas. There are families that earn up to Rs 500 a day by rolling bidis. These people have not made a penny since the lockdown began,” Emani Biswas, a bidi merchant from the Suti area, said.A factory owner, who did not wish to be identified, said the problem will not be solved even if the government allows production locally.“Bidis are sent to other states on trains. Until train services resume it is impossible to sustain production,” he said.Some factory owners have extended help to the poor workforce but most said they will not be able to pay any wage under the present circumstances.Jakir Hossain, Trinamool Congress legislator from Jangipur and minister of state for labour, owns a bidi factory himself.“I have taken up the responsibility to provide food for more than 20,000 people in my constituency. I know that lakhs of labourers are facing a crisis. Our government has taken some measures to solve their problem,” said Hossain.Also read: Man killed in clash over setting up of quarantine centre in Bengal“With no production and sales, it is virtually impossible to pay these people their daily wages.

06-04-2020||India||Rain, thunder likely over northern India||Two western disturbances (WD) will impact the north-western region from April 6 to 9, according to India Meteorological Department. Officials said the disturbances will bring rain and thundershowers in the western Himalayas and northern plains.Due to the back-to-back WDs, the maximum temperature is also likely to fall by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius for a few days even after the WDs move away. Delhi may receive mild rains but Punjab and Haryana will get moderate rain and thundershowers. According to IMD’s Sunday bulletin, a WD is impacting the western Himalayan region now and another fresh WD is likely to impact the region from April 9 onwards. “Both of these systems are likely to affect weather across northwest India from April 6 with peak during April 7 to 9, with scattered to fairly widespread rain/thundershowers likely over western Himalayan region during April 7 to 9 and over Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi on April 7,” the bulletin said.Thunderstorms, hail and gusty winds are also likely over many parts of northwest India during this period. Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall and thunderstorm is also likely over northeast India during April 8 and 9 and squall over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on April 7 and 8.“The present WD has started impacting Jammu and Kashmir and Madhya Pradesh. We can feel the impact in Delhi-NCR on April 7 when light rain, thunder and gusty winds blowing at about 30 to 40 kmph is likely. We are hoping that the temperature will increase after April 10, reaching about 36 to 37 degree C. The maximum temperature may drop marginally before that because of the WDs. The impact of the WDs reduces substantially in this season but this year, there has been an unusually high number of WDs in winter also,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.“WDs are always there but they move northwards in summer. Occasionally, they also come southwards. This year anyway, the impact of WDs has led to a lot of rain in the plains,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the centre, said this year the country is seeing chains of WDs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-thunder-likely-over-northern-india/story-Tw0BbacOFWevUiwv8wUzoM.html
06-04-2020||India||Wearing masks in public places may contain virus spread: Study||Wearing surgical masks in public spaces may help limit the transmission of viruses, including the one that causes coronavirus disease or Covid-19, according to a new study, the latest in a growing body of research in favour of masks to stop the deadly contagion. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine on Saturday days after a high-level US scientific panel said the Sars-Cov-2 virus that caused Covid-19 is airborne and can be spread through speech or breathing – contradicting previously held belief that it spreads largely through close contact. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSars-Cov-2 is part of the coronavirus family, which also caused the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic. Scientists at the University of Maryland found in laboratory experiments that the masks “significantly” reduced the amounts of airborne viruses from infected patients.Coronavirus was detected in respiratory droplets and aerosols in 3 of 10 and 4 of 10 of the samples collected without face masks, respectively but did not detect any in respiratory droplets or aerosols collected from participants wearing face masks.Donald Milton, one of the authors of the paper, cautioned that the results merely suggested that surgical masks may only limit the extent of transmission and not protect wearers from infection. “In normal times we’d say that if it wasn’t shown statistically significant or the effective in real-world studies, we don’t recommend it,” he said. “But in the middle of a pandemic, we’re desperate. The thinking is that even if it cuts down transmission a little bit, it’s worth trying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wearing-masks-in-public-places-may-contain-virus-spread-study/story-uBPn8ffKoDBsgsjBBiRFXL.html

The number includes 2,000 foreigners.As of Sunday morning, at least 1,023 cases in 17 states and Union Territories, or over 30% of India’s total Covid-19 infections, could be linked to the mid-March gathering that has prompted authorities to launch a complex exercise to trace the footsteps of those who fanned out across the country.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe foreigners’ register maintained by the Jamaat headquarters, also known as the Markaz, has been seized by the Delhi Police’s crime branch. Also, the Jamaat head Maulana Saad has been booked for defying restrictions on public gatherings. Police stations in other states, too, have registered cases under relevant laws.In an operation that began on March 29 and ended on March 31, the police and health authorities evacuated over 2,300 people, including about 250 foreigners, from the Jamaat’s headquarters in the Capital. They were taken to hospitals and quarantine centres. Of the 503 positive cases in Delhi till Sunday evening, 320 were linked to the Jamaat markaz, which also has a large following in states such as Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Rajasthan.As Jamaat workers were agitated when authorities moved in to vacate the six-storey building on March 28, national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval put to the test his relationship with the influential Darul-Uloom, Jamiat-e-Ulema Hind and Al-Hadees to convince the Tablighi leadership. It was only after that the Jamaat workers came out and boarded the buses lined up for them.The home ministry has already blacklisted and cancelled the visas of 960 foreigners from over 40 countries who participated in Jamaat activities in India. As HT reported last week, most of them came to the country on tourist visas when they should have applied for conference or missionary visas.Faced with legal proceedings, some foreigners linked to the Jamaat were also found trying to escape India through special flights being run to evacuate Malaysian and Indonesian nationals. On Sunday, Indian immigration officials stopped Jamaat workers from boarding such flights at the Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai airports.Questions are also being raised on whether due diligence was followed while giving tourist visas to Jamaat workers by Indian missions abroad, and how such a large movement escaped the knowledge of law enforcement agencies. Similar Jamaat congregations have been blamed for driving up cases in Malaysia and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21k-with-links-to-jamaat-event-quarantined/story-cZ2XlQYES0mEOObtXykXhP.html
06-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Let’s look at some numbers. The number of Covid-19 cases in the world was 1.25 million on Sunday night, and the number of deaths stood at 68,000. That works out to a fatality rate of around 5%. But, like all aggregates, this number is not representative. Covid-19 cases have now been identified in 181 countries. But there are huge variations. At one end, among countries that have seen a substantial number of cases (say, at least 10,000) is Italy. The number of cases in the country was 124,632, with 15,362 deaths. That’s a fatality rate of 12.32%. At the other end is Germany, with 96,092 cases and 1,444 deaths, a fatality rate of 1.5% (last week, this was at around 0.8%, so it has almost doubled).Every other country with a substantial number of infections falls in this range. France, with 89,953 infections and 7,560 deaths has a fatality rate of 8.4%; Spain with 126,168 cases and 11,947 deaths has a fatality rate of 9.5%; Switzerland, with 20,505 cases and 666 deaths, has a fatality rate of 3.2%. The UK, with 41,903 cases and 4,313 deaths has a fatality rate of 10.3%. And the US, with 311,536 cases and around 8,500 deaths, a fatality rate of 2.7%.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt’s possible to layer the rates with qualitative information. Germany, we know, has been aggressive with testing. Italy, Spain and the UK have not. The US was slow to start but has since become better. Clearly, aggressive testing, while it might highlight more cases (a data point at least some countries seem averse to), simply serves to grow the denominator — pushing fatality rates down. That’s important because it sends out the message that Covid-19 can be beaten.It is not clear whether geography (temperature, humidity) matters. There have been some studies, but none conclusive. It’s one of the three things that could save India — the other two being the lockdown, and the virus mutating into a less virulent strain in the country. Gender seems to be a factor when it comes to mortality (women have an advantage). As does age (older people are at greater risk). And, as one would expect, health workers are at great risk, given just how infectious Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has proven to be — this, after initial reassurances from WHO that there was no human-to-human transmission, and by WHO and the surgeon general of the US that masks were not required. With the benefit of hindsight, aggressive screening (especially at entry points), large-scale testing, the use of masks, social distancing, and early lockdowns may well have halted (or at the least, slowed) the spread of the pandemic. It’s a lesson to remember for next time — and yes, there will be a next time.India ended Sunday with 4,198 cases and 114 deaths. Testing has now become more widespread and aggressive in clusters and containment zones, at least in a few states. And it will become even more widespread (and quicker) when some states start using the antibody test kits they have been allowed to procure.The number of cases in India crossed 1,000 on March 28, and 2,000 on April 1, so it doubled in four days, and has quadrupled in eight days. All told, the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi has thus far been responsible for at least 1,000 cases and more than a dozen deaths. Subtract those numbers, and the Indian numbers are still relatively low.Sunday was also the 12th day of the ongoing 21-day lockdown in the country. A document put out by the government on Saturday, and the Prime Minister’s reference to a phased exit from the lockdown in a meeting with chief ministers last week seem to suggest that restrictions will continue in at least some parts of the country — clusters and containment zones, for instance. It’s too early to infer anything from the Indian numbers, but the trajectory of infections in other countries suggests a peak, a plateau and then a fall. But only widespread testing can tell us when we have peaked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-pRTxqCE3CD9YlKDwxqW0fO.html
06-04-2020||India||Odisha posts highest single day jump in Covid-19 cases after govt denies community transmission||Odisha recorded the highest single-day surge in positive Covid-19 cases on Sunday with 18 cases being reported from the state capital Bhubaneswar hours after the government allayed fears of community transmission.From 21 cases till Saturday, the number of positive cases surged to 39 on Sunday as 16 cases were reported from Bomikhal area of the city that has been declared as a containment zone since Friday night with entry and exit points sealed. On Friday, three brothers of the area living in a duplex apartment tested positive for Covid-19 sparking fears of community transmission after which the Bhubaneswar municipal administration sealed the area.The state government said the number of Covid-19 positive cases have surged in Bhubaneswar during the last 3 days. “Residents of the temple city are urged to take responsibility, stay indoors and work from home. During these challenging times we request people to remain calm. All possible contacts of the Covid positive cases shall be traced, isolated and tested. That is the only way to contain further transmission. Every citizen can break the chain by staying indoors,” the Twitter handle of the state health and family welfare department said.Incidentally, the surge in positive cases was reported hours after chief secretary Asit Tripathy clarified that community transmission of the disease is yet to happen in Odisha due to the lockdown and social distancing measures undertaken.“As the travel history of the fifth Covid-19 positive patient, a 60-year-old man with co-morbidity conditions was not found initially, we were scared of seeing more positive cases due to community spread. But, we contained it by sealing the area and enforcing a shutdown in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Jajpur. We have actively contained the Covid-19 hotspots during the 48-hour shutdown and hope to continue the same in the near future. The local administration has been empowered to implement the closure of possible infection hotspots for containment of the deadly virus,” said Tripathy.The chief secretary further said through door-to-door surveillance in the containment zones and meticulous planning, tracking of contacts of the positive cases, the findings established that the infection of Covid-19 was brought from outside the state.The state government’s optimism in containing the spread of the virus, however, did not last till evening, when a staggering 16 cases were reported from Bomikhal, a small locality with more than 3000 houses. “Cluster containment has been put in place and house to house survey is going on. All suspects and contacts shall be isolated and tested. Citizens are urged not to panic and stay indoors,” health department officials said.Doctors said the surge in community transmission may have begun in Bhubaneswar and in the next few days the cases would jump. “We are yet to see the peak. There would be more cases from clusters in newer districts. The government needs to contain areas and go for massive testing. The 3T of testing, tracing and treating is the only solution. More number of medical colleges should be roped in for tests,” said Prof Binod Patro, a professor of community medicine in AIIMS, Bhubaneswar.Health secretary NB Dhal said state-owned Odisha State Medical Corporation Limited has been ordered to supply triple layers of surgical masks for all field workers doing surveillance work, staff providing essential services, and ambulance drivers. He asked the Municipal Commissioners, Collectors and Chief District Medical officers to provide triple layer surgical masks to people under quarantine at home and in facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-posts-highest-single-day-jump-in-covid-19-cases-after-govt-denies-community-transmission/story-vOIhk4yheWxHyk3WXCvW4H.html

But the lockdown has had another effect on the zoo inmates. With no visitors over the past few days and the ambience tranquil, some animals are behaving in a “stress-free manner”, zookeepers have noticed. Some are even mating, a sign that the animals are feeling relaxed, zoo directors said. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhile the National Zoological Park in Delhi has got special permission from the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) — the slaughterhouses come under its jurisdiction — to slaughter buffalo calves inside the zoo premises, the lions and tigers at the animal safari of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai are being fed chicken.“The Ghazipur slaughterhouse has been shut. We have got special permission to slaughter buffaloes inside the zoo premises to feed the lions and tigers. On an average, each animal needs around 7-8 kilos of meat every day. Smaller carnivores such as foxes and wolves are being given chicken,” said Suneesh Buxy, director of Delhi Zoo.There are at least 160 recognised zoos in India; Karnataka has the maximum number with 15. More than 56,800 animals, including exotic species, and endangered Indian ones, are kept in these zoos across the country.Following the closure of the Deonar abattoir in Mumbai, SGNP authorities have been feeding chicken to the lions and tigers of the animal safari since March 26.“From Thursday, the abattoir has agreed to supply frozen beef {buffalo meat} to SGNP, which was meant for export purposes. From March 22 to 26, we had reserve stock of beef so there was no issue but thereafter animals were being provided only chicken as there was no other option,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife west), Maharashtra.On March 23, the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI), the apex body for all zoos in India, sent a letter to the states acknowledging that some zoos were “facing severe hardships in getting supply of food, drinking water and health care of wild animals in captivity due to restrictions” imposed for the containment of Covid-19. CZAI requested all states that such activities be specified as “essential services” and they be exempted from any restrictions.The Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai, the largest zoo in India, has its own fodder farm where para grass, cowpea, calopo and sorghum, among other items, are grown for herbivores.“Meetings were held with suppliers to ensure that there is no shortage of meat during the lockdown. We have enough medicines in stores,” said Sudha Ramen, deputy director of Anna Arignar Zoological Park.The Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, the oldest of them all, is running smoothly and hasn’t faced any problem. Dry food like grams, rice and dal to prepare khichdi for monkeys had already been stored while suppliers have ensured that there will be no shortage of meat, fish, milk and fruits. With hardly any disturbance and noise as no visitors are allowed, animal keepers and zoo staff in various zoos said that the animals seemed to be in playful mood, more relaxed, and behaving in a stress-free manner.“The bear has become extremely curious and is moving around in search of insects. It is digging and jumping from one end to another. At the avian enclosure, there is a significant increase in nesting seen. Overall animals are less stressed and displaying their natural behaviour,” said Sanjay Tripathi, director of Veer Mata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan or Byculla Zoo.In the National Zoological Park, the zoo’s biological assistant has also observed certain behavioural changes“Some animals have started mating, which they usually don’t. The fox, which was hardly seen during the day, has started coming out. The animals are more relaxed, the zookeepers reported,” said Buxy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zoos-find-new-ways-to-feed-animals-amid-curbs/story-FFeLpMIj5mGaabURcXLKVO.html
06-04-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 toll hits 100; Delhi infection tally 503||The number of deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) topped 100 on Sunday as the total infections crossed 4,000 – 503 of them in Delhi – with the central government pegging the doubling rate of the pathogen’s spread at 4.1 days, a figure it said would have stood at 7.4 in the absence of the Nizamuddin cluster.Sixteen fresh deaths and 514 new infections were reported on Sunday, the 12th day of a national lockdown that has been put in place to break the chain of infections. “Our focus is that we chase the virus, rather than the virus chasing us,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said during a news briefing.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe recent spike in infections has largely been propelled by the detection of hundreds of patients who attended the congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group, in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti last month in a violation of several restrictions. Cases linked to the meet have been reported across 17 states and Union Territories so far.In Delhi, the number of Covid-19 cases climbed to 503 and the death toll rose to seven, with 58 fresh cases and one death being reported. The cases included 320 people who took part in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin. A 52-year-old man admitted at the Maharaja Agrasen hospital was the seventh person to die in the national capital.“If the Tablighi Jamaat incident had not taken place and we compare the rate of doubling — that is in how many days the cases have doubled, we will see that currently it is 4.1 days (including Jamaat cases) and if the incident had not taken place and additional cases had not come, then the doubling rate would have been 7.4 days,” Agarwal said.Eight Malaysian attendees of the congregation were on Sunday offloaded from a special chartered flight to Malaysia from Delhi.In Tamil Nadu, 86 people, including 85 returnees from the Tablighi Jamaat meet, tested positive on Sunday, taking the total number of cases in the state to 571. Sunday was the fifth straight day the state witnessed a sharp rise in the number of positive cases linked to the Nizamuddin congregation.Experts say that the nationwide lockdown, one of the few weapons against the highly contagious infection that has killed 67,000 worldwide, will not achieve its objective if the positive cases originating out of such clusters are not contained in time.In Mumbai, eight people died of Covid-19, while the number of positive cases in the financial hub increased by 103 to touch 433, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said. This took the total number of deaths in Mumbai to 30, the highest in the country.The Union health ministry said that 505 new Covid-19 cases and 15 deaths were reported since Saturday and the total Covid-19 cases were 3,577, with the death toll being 83. However, a tally by Covid19india.org that was cross-checked by HT, showed that the number of cases stood at 4,198, with 114 deaths. There is a lag in the Union health ministry’s data when compared to that of states. Officials say this is because of procedural delays in state-wise cataloguing of cases.An official of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is not airborne. “If it was an airborne infection, then in a family whoever has a contact they all should come positive because they are living in same surrounding as the patient and the family is breathing the same air. When someone is admitted in hospital, other patients would have got exposure (if it was airborne) but that is not the case,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR. ICMR has issued an advisory that said spitting in public places could enhance the spread of Covid-19. On the question of rapid antibody tests, Gangakhedkar said test kits should be available by Wednesday.The country’s apex biomedical research organisation on Saturday released an advisory on how and where to use the rapid test, which can determine the immunity of an individual and help people get back into the workforce. The advisory includes people in high-risk areas (containment zones), large migration gatherings and evacuation centres. A task force constituted to review the testing guidelines did not open up rapid testing to the private sector.At the briefing, Agarwal said cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a meeting with district magistrates, superintendents of police, chief medical officers, state and district surveillance officers, state health secretaries, district health secretaries and chief secretaries to review the situation.District officials shared strategies on how they delineated containment and buffer zone, how they carried out door-to-door survey through special teams and how through telemedicine and call centres people who came from foreign countries were monitored.Covid-19 cases have been reported in 274 districts (till Sunday afternoon) and the cabinet secretary requested all DMs to maintain uniformity in their response and establish a crisis management plan, he said.The government said all states were asked to put in place a district-specific containment strategy in place based on the detailed large outbreak control plan issued by the health ministry on Saturday. “Surveillance and contact tracing has been our main focus, and we will continue to put emphasis on that,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-toll-hits-100-delhi-tally-503/story-ecTdvXh8RNvLri5zgc23sL.html
06-04-2020||India||Hospitals may become hot spots as cases among health care staff rise: Report||Over 50 doctors and other healthcare workers have tested positive for the coronavirus disease across India, putting the spotlight on their vulnerability and the possibility of hospitals emerging as high-risk places to contract the infection.Across the world, many healthcare workers have been infected; some while treating Covid patients and others through unknown sources. In the epicenter of the disease, China, a paper had warned on as early as February 7 – when the country had 34,546 cases – that hospitals could become the disease hotspots.The study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, found that 41% of the 138 Covid-19 cases examined for it were likely person-to-person hospital-associated transmissions.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe authors of the paper, doctors at the Zhongnan Hospital in China’s Wuhan, studied 138 hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19 cases at the hospital from January 1 to January 28, 2020. The study said that “presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalised patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked”.A Lancet study on March 21 reported that figures from China’s National Health Commission show that more than 3,300 healthcare workers had been infected as of early March.Such person-to-person transmissions in hospital clusters were also observed during the 2013 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in Saudi Arabia, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 said. The study, ‘Hospital Outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus’, found that of the 23 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia between April 1 and May 23, 2013, as many as “21 were acquired by person-to-person transmission in hemodialysis units, intensive care units, or in-patient units in three different health care facilities”. In Spain, of the 40,000 Covid-19 cases reported till March 24, the country’s health ministry, said that 5,400 – nearly 14% -- involved medical professionals. Cases in Spain have more than tripled since, with 130,759 cases on Sunday, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, and 12,418 deaths. In an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine Catalyst on March 21, doctors from the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo in Italy’s Lombardy region, which is among the worst-hit regions in Europe, said, “Our own hospital is highly contaminated.” The paper drew attention to the dire conditions in which the medical staff are working in the country. “Most hospitals in the region,” the doctors said in the paper, “were overcrowded, nearing collapse while medications, ventilators oxygen and PPE [Personal Protection Equipment] are not available.”According to Medscape, as many as 61 doctors and healthcare workers have succumbed to the virus in Italy till March 31. Till Sunday, Italy has reported 124,632 confirmed cases and 15,362 deaths. Highlighting that hospitals may be the main carriers of the infection “as they are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patients”, the doctors said ambulances and personnel ferrying patients to the hospitals may also become vectors of the virus.In their paper, the doctors warned that such hospital personnel, who get the infection from patients or contaminated hospital equipment, were probably carrying the contagion back into the community.The most contaminated zones in hospitals were ICUs, (31.9%), obstetric isolation wards specialised for pregnant women with novel coronavirus pneumonia or NCP (28.1%), and isolation wards for NCP (19.6%), according to a yet-to-be peer-reviewed meta-analysis of 32 studies published in MedRxiv, a pre-print server for health sciences. The most contaminated objects, the study said, are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were the most contaminated PPE.The Italian doctors called for replacing centralised, hospital based and patient-centered care with community-centred, telemedicine, to “avoid unnecessary movement and release pressure from hospitals”.Of the over 50 doctors and healthcare workers that have tested positive for the disease in India over the last two weeks, many were not involved in treating Covid-19 patients. These included a doctor at the Delhi State Cancer Institute and a resident doctor of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, and his nine-month pregnant wife. All three tested positive last week.“Indian hospitals have been adequately equipped so far. The doctors and medical staff are well aware which is why they are taking all PPE and hygiene guidelines seriously. But controlling this pandemic needs cooperation of the government and the public, which also includes medical staff. If a patient hides his/her history or symptoms, it will lead to more infections and situations like what happened at Ganga Ram where over 100 doctors have been quarantined. However, we will need more PPE and more equipment in the coming weeks, because if hospitals start becoming spreaders of the contagion like it did in Italy, the situation could get much worse very quickly,” said Dr Dhiren Gupta, a senior consultant at New Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hospitals-may-become-hot-spots-as-cases-among-health-care-staff-rise/story-adYwXLKdyDmyeDrvJKwPjM.html
06-04-2020||India||Coronavirus at Asia’s largest onion market sparks govt concern||A corona positive case in Maharashtra’s Nashik district, which came to light on March 30, has forced Asia’s largest onion trading market, Lasalgaon, to suspend operations, affecting supplies, an official of the market said.Panic spread far and wide, prompting six villages adjoining Lasalgoan to bar the entry and exit of people from outside, according to the official. These villages are the main source of labour and are also home to traders who transact in the market. This disrupted supplies across the country. The Lasalgoan market is now set to open on Tuesday, the official said.“We at Lasalgaon have decided to resume trading on Tuesday (April 7). The district collector ordered the shutdown because the corona positive case was a major bakery supplier who regularly supplied pav (Indian bread) to the entire area,” said Narendra Wadhwane, the secretary of the Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee or APMC. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAPMCs are state-regulated bodies that run wholesale markets in the country under the APMC Act.“Onion supplies to rest of India are down 35% due to closure of the financial year in March, lack of labour due to the lockdown and the emergence of the corona case in Nashik. I hope we will have adequate labour when we resume operations,” he said.According to the government note, Maharashtra officials have complied a list of all onion traders and suppliers and shared the list to counterparts in various states so that they could directly get in touch with supply agents.While Lasalgaon, a crucial nationwide supplier of onions, shut down due to the coronavirus scare, neighbouring Pimpalgaon, another onion trading hub, had been nearly idle since March 26, Wadhwane said.“Too many things coincided. Two cultural events, Gudi Parva and Amawasya, had resulted in diminished trading in the last week of March. The corona case then totally cut off labour,” said Prakash Kumawat, the assistant secretary of the APMC market. According to the market’s chief Wadhwane, of the 17 APMC markets in Nashik, which is part of a supply chain serving various trading points in the country, only two were open briefly — Lasalgaon and Chandwar. “Without labour, wholesale buying and selling came to a halt,” he said. He said traders were able to send 40% of shipments. According to a government note accessed by HT, the principal secretary of agricultural marketing recommended market committees to tell farmers to bring harvest pre-packed in gunny backs to speed up trade. “These gunny bags come in various capacities, mostly 50kg packs. So it’s easy to load in the absence of weighmen,” said Wadhwane.However, Wadhwane said farmers did not have access to gunny bags. Every establishment was closed due to the corona scare. “Since the lockdown, 1,650 truckloads of onions have been dispatched by traders of Nashik district to various parts of the country, which has helped in maintaining in steady supplies,” the government note said. According to Wadhwane, that’s about 35% less than usual supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virus-at-asia-s-largest-onion-market-sparks-govt-concern/story-AvyAllPwEcastaiewOqfOI.html
06-04-2020||India||Chhattisgarh police curtail counter-Maoist ops||The lockdown imposed to check the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has forced the Chhattisgrah police to recalibrate and scale down their anti-Maoist operations, top police officers said on Sunday. The officers said the approach is to have fewer “dedicated offensives” against the Left-wing extremists based on specific intelligence inputs.Chhattisgarh police chief D M Awasthi said only four anti-Maoist operations have been conducted since the lockdown came into force on March 25. “Earlier, we used to have 15 to 20 such operations in 10 days.” He added there are many reasons for planning fewer operations. Awasthi said bigger operations need backups like helicopters and medical teams, which may be difficult to arrange due to the lockdown. “I have given instructions to officials that operations will only be planned when there is pinpoint intelligence of Maoist movements and that big movement of security forces should be avoided.”Over 65,000 personnel, including 48 battalions of central forces, are deployed in the Maoist stronghold of Bastar, which is spread over 39,117 sq km across seven districts and links Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand.According to police estimates, about 5,500 members of the Maoists’ political and military wings are holed up in the jungles of Bastar apart from their foot soldiers.“The anti-Maoist operations have reduced by 50% in my district. Only dedicated operations are still going on by the Special Forces and it is very difficult now to push other forces into the jungles for big operations,” said a police superintendent posted in one of the districts of Bastar requesting anonymity.He said in the absence of regular traffic during the lockdown, vehicles of security forces would become easier targets for the Maoists. Even inside the jungles, there is no movement of people, thereby making the entry of security forces more difficult, he added. “The silence along roads and jungles can be dangerous for security forces. All tribal villages have imposed lockdown and there is barely any movement in jungles. Venturing out could be dangerous,” the officer said.Another police officer, who did not want to be named, said the security forces are facing shortages of essential items and getting supplies quickly is becoming difficult because of the Maoist threat. “It has created some resentment among the lower rung personnel,” a third police officer said. The officers also said that the killing of 17 jawans in Sukma in an ambush by Moaists a day after the lockdown was enforced has also taken a toll on the security personnel. Many are also worried about their families.“Many of the jawans are from rural areas in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha and are worried about their families. Some of them have also applied for leaves as they want to visit families. We have cancelled all leaves due to the lockdown which has created some resentment,” the officer said.All three police officers quoted above said in such times mobilising security personnel for operations could have an adverse physiological impact. “The jawans are being counselled by their seniors,” said one of the officers. Experts said intelligence-based operations are important and should continue in Bastar to dominate the Maoists.“This is a valid argument that police forces are more exposed on roads during this lockdown because no other vehicles are allowed but police superintendents should continue intelligence-based operations and area domination of the jungles. Police should also take care of the mental health of their personnel,” said Prakash Singh, a former Chhattisgarh police chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-police-curtail-counter-maoist-ops/story-K4sInhF2rXHAjEMlLel6wI.html
06-04-2020||India||Vigilant Jaipur Police monitors lockdown from coronavirus war room||Jaipur: A large hall on the first floor of the Jaipur Police Commissioner’s office, near the government press, is buzzing despite the 21-day national lockdown. On the left, it has three rows of eight workstations, each with three computer screens. About 30 other screens are mounted on a wall in front. The people who inhabit this workspace are tracking every movement, mapping every activity, on Jaipur’s streets by going through the feed from more than 800 CCTV cameras, and 15 drones hovering over the walled city. Any suspicious or illegal activity is flagged, and immediately reported to the concerned police station concerned. To the right, an additional 16 screens are tracking calls made to the police.This is the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) war room set up by the Jaipur Police.“We monitor live feed from cameras across the city. One-hundred-and-fifty of the 800 them are PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cameras that can rotate 360 degrees. The rest are fixed cameras,” said Adarsh Choudhary, additional superintendent of police and one of the three officers in charge of the war room.With the help of these cameras and drones, Jaipur Police are ensuring compliance of the lockdown in the city and the curfew in the walled city areas. One-hundred-and-seventy-six cameras are in the walled city alone, and 22 of them are PTZs. Constables in plainclothes monitor rotate the PTZ cameras for better views, if needed. The drones fly over rooftops to detect any illegal activity, such as gatherings of more than five people, in narrow and congested lanes.“The drone footage is also monitored by respective police station areas,” said Jitendra Singh Rathore, station house officer of Manak Chowk police station, which is on a gateway to the Ramganj area, which was the first to be put under curfew after a 45-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19 on March 26. At least 20 of his family members also tested positive later, sparking fears of widespread local transmission.The areas that fall under seven police stations in the walled city – Ramganj, Kotwali, Manak Chowk, Brahmpuri, Nahargarh and Galta Gate – have been under curfew since March 28.“Our cameras are in the marketplace and at other prominent locations. We can track activities on main roads with them. For lanes and bylanes, we needed more eyes in the sky to keep track, especially because of the curfew,” said Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commission of police (law and order).Lamba, who led the police action against Asaram Bapu in 2013 as deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Jodhpur West, also gets drone footage on his mobile phone (He keeps checking it intermittently even as he is speaking to this reporter).There were some reports of people rushing to their rooftops to see the whizzing drones flying over them but the police had no problem with that. “As long as they stay indoors and maintain social distancing, we have no problem,” Lamba said.In the war room, three additional SPs are in charge in three shifts – 6am to 2pm, 2pm to 10pm and 10pm to 6am. The call facility has two PRI (primary rate interface) lines that can handle 60 calls at a time. Four more screens on the left wall display all calls in progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/empowered-group-hits-ground-running-to-contain-pandemic/story-QgGXS2ID5OlEjxKGijAr6I.html

Then it started increasing. Frequency was maintained within a band of 49.7 to 50. 26 Hz, which means voltage was kept stable,” he said.Singh, along with the Power Secretary and other senior officers monitored the power grid operations from National Power Monitoring Centre in Shram Shakti Bhawan in Delhi during the period of lights off.The minister said there was huge response to Prime Minister’s call to switch off lights.On Saturday, the power ministry had clarified that the PM’s call for switching off lights would not cause instability to the power grid amid concerns over a possible grid collapse.The demand for power has dropped 30% demand due to the absence of commercial activity in the wake of the nationwide lockdown, and there were fears that the Prime Minister’s call could encourage people to switch off everything, reducing demand even more.A drop in demand could have resulted in a sudden change in grid frequency, leading to a potential blackout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-congratulates-power-grid-for-great-job-during-blackout/story-NBcAVLj94KttzdpO55dOBM.html
06-04-2020||India||Shortage of safety equipment crippling states’ Covid-19 containment efforts||In India’s two biggest states -- Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra that have nearly a thousand cases between them -- health officials admitted to a shortage of PPE, saying that private companies had expressed their inability to provide the kits early because of an increase in demand. This is because of a sudden increase in cases, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. Admitting the shortage, UP health secretary, Amit Mohan Prasad said 31 units in the state had started manufacturing kits and that the government had also placed orders with other companies. He did not provide any break-up of the kits needed and procured by the government. A doctor in King George’s Medical University in Lucknow, the largest hospital in the city, has been infected. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn other states such as Bihar, a large number of health workers have been provided with only masks, gloves and sanitisers -- and not coveralls. “To tide over the shortage of PPE kits, we have requested our doctors to utilise the kits rationally,” said Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health. The situation is no different in Madhya Pradesh’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot Indore, where only half of the health workers have been provided with proper kits. “Only 20 to 30% of around 55,000 to 60,000 health workers have been provided with proper kits in the state,” said MP’s health department employees’ association leader Laxminarayan Sharma. In the state, eight more health workers and staff tested positive on Sunday. All these officers used to meet one another in meetings held in the state secretariat and the health directorate and monitor implementation of the measures undertaken by the government across the state. At least 50 other officers, including head of the health department, are in self quarantine.State Commissioner of health services, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai, said, “We are providing PPE kits to health workers as per guidelines of government of India. Currently we are getting supplies from certain companies including some companies based at Indore. We are trying to get about 1.5 lakh kits in the coming days.”The northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand and the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh have placed orders with private companies for the kits but haven’t received them yet. A health worker each in Chandigarh and J&K and two in Haryana have tested positive for Covid-19. Also Read: How Delhi answered PM Modi’s call to fight ‘coronavirus darkness’In Punjab’s Patiala and Amritsar districts, nurses protested outside hospitals, alleging a shortage of kits even though the official spokesperson for Covid-19, Rajesh Bhaskar, denied the charge. The Punjab cabinet has authorised additional chief secretary Vinni Mahajan to buy kits and masks for medical staff from manufacturers in the state and elsewhere. Haryana minister Anil Vij said tenders had been floated to get the kits. The eastern states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal have also reported a shortage of kits even though local manufacturing has started. Bihar has been supplied 16,700 PPE kits against its demand for 960,000 kits. Another 21,000 PPE kits are in transit. Jharkhand has 13,000 kits as against the demand of 21,000. Kumar said they were tapping all possible sources to get the kits. Jharkhand’s health minister, Banna Gupta, said the state government had placed orders with various companies. “We have also requested the central government to ensure supply of the kits but they are not listening to us,” Gupta said.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has also blamed the Centre although governor, Jagdeep Dhankhar, had claimed that there were enough kits with the state. Doctors in several hospitals in the state have protested and refused to report for work citing inadequate safety equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shortage-of-safety-equipment-crippling-states-covid-efforts/story-tnHeIzKP8NNy9vRclzcgzH.html
06-04-2020||India||Coronavirus Update: PM Modi’s lights off call gets ‘huge response’, sharp dip in power demand||The Centre said on Sunday that the national response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to switch off lights for nine minutes at 9pm was huge and power demand dropped by 32 GW, more than double of what officials had anticipated.The Union power ministry said the sharp dip in demand was handled well by engineers deployed across the country. The ramping up of demand and supply went back to 110 GW “smoothly”, the ministry said. Concerns had been expressed that a dramatic drop in supply followed by a quick surge may trip or damage the power grid.“Huge response to Hon’ble Prime Minister’s call to switch off lights and light a lamp as a show of national solidarity in the fight against. The demand went down from 117300 Megawatts at 2049 hrs to 85300 Megawatts till 2109 hrs; that is a reduction of 32000 Megawatts,” power minister RK Singh said.  शुभं करोति कल्याणमारोग्यं धनसंपदा ।शत्रुबुद्धिविनाशाय दीपज्योतिर्नमोऽस्तुते ॥ pic.twitter.com/4DeiMsCN11Officials aware of the development said power generation was lowered to keep the grid frequency in check and directions were issued to avoid load shedding. “Generation will be kept slightly lower than load so that when load is thrown off at 9pm, the frequency would not be on the higher side,” a senior government official said. According to national load dispatcher POSOCO (Power System Operation Corporation), the total domestic lighting load reduction had been pegged at 12-13 GW. Singh and senior officials from the power ministry were monitoring the health of the grid from the National Power Monitoring Centre in Shram Shakti Bhawan, New Delhi. In a clarification issued earlier in the day, the ministry had said the PM’s directive – aimed at building solidarity against Covid-19 and encouraging frontline workers and the poor -- was only to switch off domestic home lights between 9.00pm and 9.09pm.“Indian Electricity Grid is well designed to handle such kind of load variation with several in- built levels of control and safety mechanisms to absorb any kind of frequency changes. all adequate arrangements and standard operating protocols are in place to maintain grid stability. all States/UTs/ Local bodies have been advised to keep the street lights on for public safety,” the ministry said. The power grid has seen a 30% reduction in demand due to the absence of commercial activity in the wake of the lockdown.The essence of grid management is load balancing over time (in this case, 15-minute intervals), and a drop in demand could have resulted in a sudden change in grid frequency, leading to a potential power blackout.

06-04-2020||India||Will districts with no Covid-19 cases be first to be unlocked?||Curbs on movement and commercial activity could be relaxed first in districts with no coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, officials in multiple states have said, offering some pointers about how a staggered return to normal activity could work after April 15, when the nationwide lockdown is scheduled to end. India has over 4,000 Covid-19 cases and infections have been doubling at a rate of 4.1 days, federal officials said on Sunday, adding that they discussed with states a “containment strategy” that hinges on identifying and cordoning off hot spot areas.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We held a video conference today with heads of all districts to orient them with our containment strategy, which focuses on districts reporting large number of cases such as Bhilwara, Agra and Gautam Budh Nagar. Officials from these districts also shared their insights,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary of the Union health ministry, at the daily briefing in New Delhi.This strategy could be crucial to lifting the three-week lockdown in force since March 25 without risking a resurgence of the disease. As on Sunday, cases have been reported from 274 of the country’s 718 districts. Twenty-one of the 230 districts in 9 states are considered hot spots. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a conference call on Thursday with chief ministers from across the country, had asked states to pitch in with ideas on how the curbs can be relaxed in a phased manner.Officials in three states – Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Haryana — said they were in favour of first relaxing curbs in districts that are at present free of infections. “There would be ban on entry of people from the Covid districts into these ones,” said a senior official involved in the containment plan in Rajasthan. This may be the first phase of the easing, the official said, adding that the second would cover the districts with relatively few patients. The final phase of easing would then include high containment districts. Around half of Rajasthan’s 33 districts have no case.Non-essential public gatherings, such as those for religious and political reasons, and the reopening of public places such as malls and cinema halls and educational institutions, may take some more time, the official added. A senior official in the Haryana government, who asked not to be named, said the state is in favour of following a similar strategy, but a majority of the districts — 14 of 22 — may need to live with a longer lockdown since they have several cases. “All will depend on how these districts recover in the next 10 days,” this person said, identifying key NCR cities such as Gurugram, Faridabad and Palwal, which account for 57 of 76 cases, as those where the curbs could continue. In Maharashtra, officials said a lockdown was likely to continue in most urban areas for a couple of weeks more. “I see lockdown extending beyond April 14 in urban areas,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope, adding that these had seen significant infections.Maharashtra accounts for the highest number of infections in the country with at least 700 cases, and concerns have been mounting in recent days over the disease spreading to densely populated areas such as state capital Mumbai’s Dharavi area.In Uttar Pradesh, 47 of the 75 districts are without a reported Covid-19 infection. “The good news is there is no indication of community spread in UP even though many cases are linked to Tablighi Jamaat,” said an official from a key government office overseeing the containment efforts. Three containment facilities will be created in all districts with positive cases, this official added. Agriculture and allied industries in the state, such as flour mills and the sugarcane industry, as well some industries that are far from urban areas are likely to be allowed to resume operations. Key NCR cities such as Noida and Ghaziabad, and state capital Lucknow, are unlikely to return to normal levels of activity, officials said. Punjab, which was the first state to impose curfew on March 21, may continue with lockdown in most parts, but issue curfew passes to allow harvesting from April 15. Rabi harvest would be procured from villages, and some industrial activity in Jalandhar and Ludhiana may be allowed in staggered manner with social distancing rules in force. “A final call will be taken on April 12 or 13,” said Suresh Kumar, Punjab chief minister’s chief principal secretary.The state is in favour of opening all farm markets to allow farmers to sell their produce; it wants office and business establishments to be allowed to function with staggered timings; and restoration of some interstate transport services, said Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, advisor to chief minister on public affairs. Reddy added that the state will likely send in its suggestions to the PM by April 8.Kerala has allowed leaf plucking and other activities in sprawling tea estates of Idukki and Wayanad, but with strict riders. “We have given strict instruction to keep social distancing when they work. The district administration and labour officers of the area will monitor this,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The decision came after some establishments threatened to close their units permanently.(Pankaj Jaiswal in Lucknow, Surendra Gangan in Mumbai, Sachin Saini in Jaipur, Ranjan in Bhopal and Navneet Sharma and Hitender Rao in Chandigarh contributed to this story).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-districts-with-no-cases-be-the-first-to-be-unlocked/story-alkm4rgl6nk1Bb7IiIjxsM.html
06-04-2020||India||CBSE asks its schools to inform students about PM’s Sunday call||With Prime Minister Narendra Modi giving a call to light candles at 9 pm on Sunday for nine minutes, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has asked schools affiliated to it to spread awareness about the event among their students. The HRD ministry also wrote a letter to states to this effect.The CBSE letter also informed schools about the usefulness of the Aarogya Setu app, developed in public-private partnership to help people in assessing their risk of catching the coronavirus infection. The letter by Joseph Emmanuel, CBSE’s director, academics, advised schools to inform their teachers by 5pm about the PM’s call.A similar letter was sent by HRD ministry joint secretary Maneesh Garg to states. It suggested that an action-taken status should be conveyed to the ministry. An HRD spokesperson said Garg’s email was only meant to inform students to download the app and participate in the lighting of lamps. “There is no coercion on anyone to do the same. As schools are closed, there is no question of monitoring of attendance. The action taken report asked from state education officers is to ensure that they have further disseminated the information,” said the spokesperson.Read: Decision on reopening schools, colleges to be taken on April 14: HRD ministerAfter PM Modi’s appeal to people to light candles or flash mobile lights on Sunday for nine minutes, the HRD ministry suggested that students should take part in the initiative. The ministry, however, said there should not be an assembly in colonies.The ministry also suggested students build immunity by following suggestions by the Ayush ministry, which has suggested having chyawanprash, drinking herbal tea or milk with turmeric powder and practising yoga, among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-asks-its-schools-to-inform-students-about-pm-s-sunday-call/story-zS1phCUwCKxRjyw1bStWjI.html
06-04-2020||India||India Inc awaits fiscal push from Centre to keep afloat||As businesses around the country reel under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown it has necessitated, business owners, executives and experts are looking to the government to do enough to keep companies afloat and healthy and, more importantly, to ensure that they do not engage in mass retrenchments.The government has hinted at a fiscal package – but is yet to announce one – and 11 days into the three-week lockdown to stop the spread of the pandemic, everyone is beginning to get just a little restive. “The US has announced a package that is 10% of its GDP; the UK 15%; what have we done?” asked a senior executive at a large Mumbai based fund who asked not to be named. Sure, the US package also includes cheques to individuals, but it does have payments to businesses, especially the worst affected by the pandemic.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOfficials in the finance ministry said on condition of anonymity that the ministry is monitoring the economy and will respond to any need, but declined to comment on a relief package.There is broad agreement that the Indian economy will expand at its slowest pace in years in 2020-21. Fitch Ratings expect it to grow by 2%, the slowest in 30 years. The minority view is that it could actually contract. Nomura Global Market Research expects it to, by 0.5% for the calendar year 2020.And unless there’s a strong incentive for employers to not lay off people, they will, a human resources consultant said on condition of anonymity. France, for instance, started off by deferring tax payments and payroll charges companies pay the government for the month of March. It is said to be mulling a larger bailout for firms.“At the top, support needs to be provided for the employers -- they need liquidity support. This can be facilitated through deferral of tax liabilities, exploring guarantee modalities for credit enhancement in working capital loans allowing higher limits of borrowing, direct benefit transfer by way of 25% salaries to registered enterprises with employees registered under EPF for companies with a specified turnover limit for a period of two to three months. This will limit layoffs or provide succour where layoffs are there,” said Ranen Banerjee, leader-Economic Advisory Services, PwC India.India has announced a relief package for the most vulnerable – food and cash payments totaling 1.7 lakh crore – and relaxed some statutory requirements for companies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also strongly addressed the liquidity needs of the financial system (by effectively releasing Rs 3.74 lakh crore of liquidity), and ensured its stability.But India has not offered the kind of direct relief to companies, especially large employers, that some other countries have announced. Nor has it announced relief for the salaried class – in the absence of any relief to companies, the HR consultant said companies could cut workforce “to the bone”.Deepak Sood, the secretary general of industry body the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry said an immediate stimulus package of “$100 billion to $120 billion will help revive all sectors in the country”.The consensus among most people HT spoke to is that more than sector-specific relief, generic relief – deferred tax, even tax holidays, and other such – is what is needed now. “Businesses should not be allowed to become bankrupt during this period of crisis. The government should defer tax payments of Q1 -- both direct and indirect tax payments – by a quarter,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The industry body has also suggested that the government could provide a waiver for all provident fund and gratuity payments by employers for one year if the employer does not retrench or remove more than 10% of its workforce.Even that may not be enough. CII released s snap poll of member-CEOs on Saturday that showed most companies expect revenues to fall more than 10% and profits to decline more than 5% in Q4, FY20 and in Q1, FY21. And one in four CEOs anticipate job losses, with 47% seeing cuts of up to 15% and another 32%, 15-30%, CII added. “We are looking for a larger package of at least 2-3% of GDP,” Banerjee added.“The time has come for government to consider direct infusion or investments – on the lines of Troubled Assets Relief Programme (TARP, which the US announced after the 2008 crisis) -- targeted at specific sectors, which are majorly impacted,” said Manish Aggarwal, partner and head, Infrastructure M&A and Special Situations Group, KPMG in India. He added that many countries have already announced several rounds of economic packages to aid businesses, workers and health care systems.The government will need money for this and that can come from sale of “tax free bonds, revising fiscal deficit targets and fast-tracking monetization of operating assets” in infrastructure.There’s even been some talk of “helicopter money” in some countries, including the US – a reference to the central bank or the government directing a huge amount of money to individuals and companies. The US central bank has pretty much signaled this with its chair, Jerome Powell saying that the US central bank will “not run out ammunition” to revive the economy. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, too, said last week that the Indian central bank would do whatever it takes to combat the crisis.Experts are convinced that this should broadly cover two areas. Banerjee of PwC said: “At the bottom (of the pyramid), cash doles and food distribution will have to continue for at least three to six months and be gradually phased out.”DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor of EY India, added: “A major stimulus package is expected early in the new financial year. It will be needed as soon as the economic lock down ends and normal economic activities resumes. At that time demand will have to be supported through fiscal measures and these measures would supplement the already announced substantial monetary measures. The extent of fiscal stimulus in the first instance could be at least three times the magnitude of the relief package of INR 1.7 lakh crore which amounted to nearly 0.9% of GDP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-inc-awaits-fiscal-push-from-centre-to-keep-afloat/story-DKnuHJoETIW8Xf39XlHQ3K.html
06-04-2020||India||Covid-19: ‘Spike in J&K cases due to aggressive testing, tracing’, says Governor GC Murmu||Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has seen a spike in coronavirus cases recently with the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases rising to 70. Two people have died from the infection while three were cured. Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu, however, says this is because of an aggressive testing and tracing strategy. In an interview to Hindustan Times, he outlined the steps taken by the government to contain the pandemic: Q: Coronavirus cases in Jammu and Kashmir have risen in the past few days. Is contract tracing emerging as a big challenge for you, especially as many people have come from outside the country?A: Screening of all individuals coming from outside was initiated on March 4. Till now, nearly 18,000 travellers and persons in contact with the suspected and positive cases with travel history abroad have been put under surveillance. Out of these, 10,694 are in home quarantine, 65 in hospital isolation, 622 in hospital quarantine, 4109 in home surveillance and 2187 with travel history abroad have completed their 28 days surveillance period. Till date, 1084 samples have been sent for testing of which 1010 tested negative, 70 positive (17 from Jammu division and 53 from Kashmir division) with the number of deaths at 2. The government has undertaken an aggressive contact tracing and testing campaign — that is why there is surge in the number of confirmed positive cases.Q: Have you sought the assistance of army and paramilitary forces in controlling the situation?A: No direct assistance of army and paramilitary forces has been currently sought to control the situation, though the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is deployed with the local police to assist in maintaining the restrictions during the lockdown. We have isolation and quarantine facilities in army hospitals across the UT. We have requested the army to provide additional isolation facilities of 500 beds each in J&K.Q: You have also started declaring Red zones in some parts of the UT? How alarming is the situation in those areas?A: To take precautions and contain the spread of Covid-19, 38 villages across J&K have been declared as Red Zones, where complete restrictions have been enforced for movement of people. All essential commodities are being provided to the residents of these zones. The situation in these areas is not alarming but extra precaution is being taken. Around 900 people of the UT are suspected to have participated in the Tablighi Jamaat conference in New Delhi from March 14 to March 21. Of these, 550 have been identified and quarantined and the survey and verifications for the remaining is on. We have intensified contact tracing campaign of the people who had this congregation at Delhi and are conducting 100% testing of such people and their contacts.Q: Videos are in circulation in social media showing police using force on residents, doctors, and even government officials to enforce a strict lockdown. Have you advised the police to refrain from such acts?A: J&K police is directly assisting the administration. People are exhibiting restraint and discipline during the current situation. Police is strictly controlling the situation as well as providing all necessary help and co-ordination, including distribution of ration to the needy.Q: Given the pandemic, is there any plan to restore 4G internet services for better connectivity and information dissemination?A: Currently, 3G facility by certain identified telecom providers with adequate precautions is available. The administration ensured that people did not suffer due to the internet blockade by making available internet facilities in the office of district magistrates.Q: There have also been demands to release prisoners on humanitarian grounds. Have you arrived at any decision in this regard?A: A committee has been constituted headed by chairman, state legal authority, to consider the release of prisoners on parole or interim bail depending upon the nature of the offence. Jammu and Kashmir Temporary Suspension of Sentence, Rules, 2020, have been notified, and the Director General of Police, Prisons, has been empowered to grant parole or furlough to specific category of prisoners on the recommendations of jail superintendents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spike-in-j-k-cases-due-to-aggressive-testing-tracing-governor/story-woM6RmiqqDDevd3x7LkEgL.html
06-04-2020||Editorials||Show political imagination | HT editorial||There can be no silver lining in a crisis such as the current one. The coronavirus pandemic has shaken the foundations of how citizens live and work; it has taken thousands of lives; it has caused immense economic suffering. But disasters do also offer an opportunity to address legacy issues. Take the tsunami. In Indonesia, it was after the natural disaster that the government and separatists in the Aceh province signed a peace deal, ending an armed conflict. Closer home, after the devastating earthquake of 2015, political parties in Nepal came together to draft a Constitution after years of deadlock. To be sure, it generated criticism from the country’s ethnic minorities, but the disaster ended up giving the country a stable political order.India must consider this moment to address its legacy issues, particularly conflicts. The Communist Party of India (Maoist) has offered a ceasefire and said that it will not launch any attacks on police personnel — till the threat of the pandemic subsides — and asked for a response from the government. This comes soon after a Maoist attack led to the killing of 17 security personnel in Chhattisgarh. The Maoists are against the Indian State and Constitution; they have used violence and killed State officials and innocents; and the security establishment must not, for a moment, allow them to have the advantage. But this is a moment when the regime can also display political imagination and see if it is possible to not just have a ceasefire but also have a more sustainable peace agreement. For this, the precondition, of course, remains Maoists renouncing violence and abiding by the Constitution.This is also an opportunity to heal the wounds in another key region suffering from internal turbulence — Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). The government has done well to release leaders such as Farooq and Omar Abdullah and revise its domicile policy based on the sentiment on the ground. It must follow this up with the release of other political detainees and the promise of eventual restoration of statehood. For its part, J&K’s political leadership must accept that the nullification of Article 370 is final. This can then be the framework for politics to resume in the Valley. Crises such as the pandemic should make all stakeholders in a conflict recognise that there are common challenges humanity faces and there is a bigger battle to be fought, in unity with each other, not in conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/show-political-imagination-ht-editorial/story-24ymXqW02TXJjCvba5eQpM.html
06-04-2020||Editorials||Treat patients with symptoms, now | HT editorial||According to media reports, a 55-year-old woman waited outside a government-Covid-19 medical facility in Ujjain on Friday, in an ambulance. She had symptoms of the coronavirus disease. She also had co-morbidities. But her formal test results had not come. The hospital said that since only confirmed cases were being admitted, she was not eligible. Her relatives kept pleading, to no avail. The woman died. Two days later, test results showed that she did, indeed, have the virus. Could she have been saved if she had been admitted? A human tragedy often, starkly, tells a larger story of systemic weaknesses. India is testing a lot less than it should — though to be sure, numbers have increased now. Test results then take some days to come out. But hospital rules for admission of patients are restrictive. All of this is taking a toll and costing lives. It is now well-known that the virus is deceptive — many who are infected may not show symptoms. If there isn’t aggressive testing, then it is possible that such individuals will not only continue to suffer, but spread the infection to others. But in cases where symptoms are visible too, such as in Ujjain, the health system is taking too long to test and admit patients. This is a virus where people can move from mild symptoms to turning severely ill very quickly; this makes it even more urgent to intervene, isolate and offer treatment early. For this, it is essential to liberalise patient admission norms. Hospitals must not turn away patients. Learn from Ujjain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/treat-patients-with-symptoms-now-ht-editorial/story-6eePfFHZUEf3ZlBCoPhZNK.html
