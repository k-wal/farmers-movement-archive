22-04-2020||News||Use the oil crash to boost India’s strategic reserves| Analysis||Over the last four months, the coronavirus pandemic has caused several epochal events and historical firsts. One such belief-defying event was the plunge of crude oil prices to negative territory — minus $37.63 per barrel — on Monday, April 20, in what can be seen as the surest sign so far that the global economy is headed towards a deep recession, if it is not already in one. When the futures contract for West Texas Intermediate, one of the world’s most popular benchmarks for crude oil prices, was due to expire on Tuesday, oil traders in the United States (US) began panic-selling the day before to avoid actual physical delivery of oil — a product that suddenly no one seemed to want.The images that we have seen of wide empty streets around the world without traffic signify the drastic drop in demand for the commodity. With the movement of people severely curbed, and economic activity coming to a halt, as lockdowns are instituted in cities and countries worldwide, the demand for oil has nearly vanished. All oil storage facilities in the US are almost filled to capacity and oil traders had to pay to offload their stock.This does not mean oil will be free from now on. Prices recovered and were trading at just about $3 a barrel the following day, and will rise modestly in the next few days. The price of the Indian basket of crude oil is trading at about $20 a barrel, less than half of what it was in February this year ($54).What does this mean for India?While a fall in oil prices could mean disaster for oil-producing countries, it is usually a bonanza for India — the consumer, the government, and the economy all win. Oil prices can contribute a lot directly and indirectly to the general price levels in India, and so, apart from being able to fill up their vehicles at lower prices, the Indian consumer benefits from general lowered prices. The government wins as lower prices lead to higher demand and, therefore, higher tax collections. More important though, the amount it has to spend on fuel subsidy decreases, leaving it larger fiscal space for other government programmes. Finally, since India imports nearly 80% of its oil requirements, lower global oil prices imply a fall in the country’s overall import bill and stability for the rupee.The coronavirus pandemic, however, has thrown these calculations off-kilter. With forced lockdowns, broken supply chains and a halt in industrial activity, there is no demand for the product. Inflation mechanics will be determined more by the delicate dance between unnaturally low demand (which will push prices lower) and broken supply chains (which will push prices higher).Nevertheless, the lockdown will eventually be lifted, and the economy will inch its way towards normalcy, at which point, the Union and state governments will have to make a difficult decision. By keeping excise duties and other taxes at the current level, it could earn more and use the earnings to fund the necessary fiscal measures to help the economy rebound. Or it could lower them to help consumers, so that they have additional disposable income that they can spend on goods and services, which is equally important to revive the economy. Specific circumstances of the removal of lockdown restrictions and the state of the government finances will probably dictate that decision.One area in which India can definitely use the lower oil prices to its advantage is to stock up on the commodity for future use. Like many other countries, India maintains strategic petroleum reserves (SPR), which is an inventory of oil for emergency purposes. To mitigate supply-side risks and cover for vulnerability to external oil shocks, India holds an emergency oil stockpile in underground salt caverns, which can provide around 4.5 days of import cover. There is additional capacity for five days of oil import cover, which must be filled up at this time when oil prices are at historic lows. Indian petroleum refineries hold an additional 65 days of import cover.To its credit, the government has promptly taken steps to ensure full capacity utilisation at this time by directing State refineries to place their excess crude supplies in these caverns for which they will be reimbursed. However, this was the lowest hanging fruit, and it is time to reach for the higher ones. India has been delaying the start of phase two of its SPR plans, which was to add another 12 days of oil storage capacity. This was to be done in partnership with either ADNOC (Abu Dhabi) or Saudi Arabia’s Aramco. It is probably the right time now to get this off the drawing board.Alternatively, we can also look at options outside India. We could persuade the Sri Lanka government to kick-start the utilisation of oil storage facilities at Trincomalee. This could be done in a mutually beneficial manner. We could also shop around for storage space in Oman (Ras Markaz) or the United Arab Emirates (Fujairah). Right now, we are in a bizarre situation where the storage space is more expensive than the commodity itself, but things will revert, and any investments now will help India in the long run when oil prices rise again.Finally, the private sector should look at this as an opportunity to lock into long-term contracts with oil suppliers based at current prices. The government can help the struggling Indian airline industry, for instance, by providing it lines of credit to enter into or renegotiate oil contracts.These are far from ideal circumstances, but we must think strategically about the long-term and try to seize the small opportunities that are presented..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/use-the-oil-crash-to-boost-india-s-strategic-reserves-analysis/story-aECKMfH8mpcEKVCGe2ozJK.html
22-04-2020||News||A blueprint for a testing strategy| Analysis||India has now been locked down for a month and, finally, there is a large supply of testing kits, though their quality is, apparently, a real concern. Lockdowns are the best time to test, since movement and new contacts are minimal. While it may be necessary to tailor testing strategies to the states’ local context, are there common principles that should govern when, where, how and whom to test?Since mid-March, testing has increased 30 times, to around 30,000 tests daily. But, even if a million additional tests were conducted, it would amount to only one test per 1,000, keeping India a low-test country. So, even without quality issues, efficient test strategies are needed to learn quickly and to achieve the two key goals of testing — first, finding infected persons, even if they are very few and asymptotic, and to treat them and prevent transmission; and second, generating data to implement a smart containment strategy, reducing the need for wholesale lockdowns.Should states begin by testing in hotspots? If people test positive and are asymptomatic, they will be isolated and hospitalised, if symptoms develop. Ideally, testing should change action, but, in a hotspot, they are quarantined anyway.But, hotspot testing can be informative. If positivity is less than expected, or clustered, it provides information about transmission; if higher, it signals a surge in demand for hospitalisation. This information is best obtained by antibody tests, if accurate, but learning is possible only with proper randomisation, i.e., testing as per a pre-decided statistical plan. Within the hotspot, more testing further from the core, where less infection is expected, can indicate the extent of spread. Importantly, it can also help decide when an area is no longer a hotspot.But, focusing on current hotspots alone cannot find infected persons in areas where the virus has yet to be reported. Can testing prevent future hotspots by locating asymptomatic infections?The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s current recommended testing strategy only allows testing of asymptomatic persons if they are direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. But, ICMR also says that about 69% of confirmed coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients are asymptomatic. Considering that the surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) patients indicated a positivity of over 2%, we may miss many infected persons. If even 0.1% is Covid-positive and asymptomatic, 20,000 infected persons could be infecting others in Delhi alone, as the lockdown is eased.Just going beyond ICMR’s recommendations, and testing a sample of the population, is likely to find few infected persons. One of us has computed that if 0.1% of 10 million are infected and 1,000 tests are randomly administered, the chance of not finding even one positive case is more than 40%! An efficient testing design should thus maximise the chances of finding an infection, especially those more vulnerable to the disease.This can be done in three ways.First, test asymptomatic individuals who can become “super-spreaders”, i.e those susceptible to infection, but who interact frequently with others, even during lockdowns, such as health workers and the police, but also civic workers in essential services and street vendors. Many in these groups were found to be infected after they became symptomatic. These groups can be tested at work, using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) methods, with samples pooled for those who work together. If needed, their contacts can be traced to where they live. Some states already plan to do this. Such potential super-spreaders can also form a sentinel network that is checked weekly for symptoms.Second, do risk stratification of areas, ie demarcate areas with initially high expected risk of transmission and/or high vulnerability such as dense cramped settlements, with larger numbers of elderly people and, this is very important, choose persons, within areas, in an explicit statistically-structured randomised manner and test them using RT-PCR methods. The chances of finding infected persons can improve by first using local information — people reporting symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI), and then, drawing randomly from the area’s voter list.Along with data on occupation, age, gender, and any morbidities and/or recent illnesses, basic information on the intensity of contact with others should be collected from all those tested, including in hotspots. Despite increased testing, the share testing positive has stayed steady around 4.5% — every 100 people tested led to five new Covid-19 patients. Is this because high-risk contacts are selected or because prevalence is worryingly high? If it’s, hopefully, the former, it means that contact tracing processes are not standardised in practice, since test positivity varies considerably among states.Third, states should anonymise and release this data, along with associated test results. The randomisation would enable real-time, high-quality analysis of possible determinants of transmission, even in places not directly tested. Information — this is important — from the initial stages must be used to iteratively improve sampling designs after each round of tests. This can be analysed internally, but crowd-sourcing will exponentially increase the speed and quality of analysis, thus allowing a better understanding of the disease and improving policy response.This suggested ICMR-plus strategy tests more asymptomatic persons and uses structured randomisation, to enable active learning by governments. It minimises the risk of transmission from super-spreaders, maximises the chance of detecting hidden infections, and shapes strategy in real-time for future testing, to optimise scarce medical and testing resources. Importantly, it can also calibrate containment strategies. States should consider using these principles as they embark on their testing journeys, which may, sadly, last longer than expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-blueprint-for-a-testing-strategy-analysis/story-OEx409xxBbAXbzLDV1diGI.html
22-04-2020||News||How the pandemic can hit Xi Jinping’s ‘China dream’| Analysis||The grave mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) by the Chinese government and tragic loss of lives have angered citizens. This was evident from the riots that took place at the border checkpost between Hubei and Jiangxi provinces on March 28. The pandemic has also severely affected the nation’s economy, virtually stopping its growth for the last three months and rendering millions jobless. The services sector is losing an estimated $144 billion each week. Unemployment has risen to over 6%. Financial services have assessed a 30% contraction of China’s economy. Economic recovery has been slow, prompting Chinese businessmen such as Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group, and Liu Chuanzhi, the founder of Lenovo, to sign a nine-point letter addressed to President Xi Jinping reviving demands for comprehensive reforms.Economic losses have hurt almost all sectors. Bloomberg reported a contraction of 9.9% in incomes of central and local governments in the first two months of 2020, calling it the “deepest fall since February 2009”. The report added: “Tax revenue declined more than 11%, with drops in value-added taxes, corporate income taxes and car purchase taxes”. The surge in outlays on health care and social security, however, “kept the decline to 2.9% from a year ago”. Twenty-two provinces, regions and municipalities had already cut their 2020 growth targets, with 11 regions officially admitting to missing their 2019 GDP targets. A joint survey by Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management and China’s largest hiring platform, Zhaopin, revealed that job openings in the country for the first two months of 2020 dropped more than 30%. The hardest hit are the media, entertainment, sports and services sectors, followed by information technology, telecom, and Internet sectors, which saw recruitments fall to up to 40%. Smaller firms suffered more.China’s leaders have been straining to revive the economy also because they, particularly President Xi, consider it domestically and geopolitically important to achieve the “China Dream” by 2021 and keep the country on track to become “a major world power with pioneering global influence” by 2049. The latter implies acquiring a capability to rival the United States (US) and influence and create world organisations. Failure to achieve these goals would impact adversely on their legitimacy. However, despite their efforts, economic recovery is slow.Commencing February 3, Xi has exhorted local officials to “prevent the economy from slipping out of a reasonable range”, emphasised the importance of China’s role in global trade and the need “to stabilise China’s share in the international market”. He also stressed the need to promote international cooperation and maximise the country’s role as a “responsible great power”. Meanwhile, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang tried to stabilise foreign investment and attract investments of over $1 billion in the manufacturing and high-tech sectors.Other steps to revive the economic activity include providing medium-term funding to banks and cutting the interest rate. More than 300 Chinese companies are seeking bank loans, totalling at least $8.2 billion. To encourage the service industry’s recovery, at least 10 governments are giving coupons directly to the people. The ministry of industry and information technology, however, said that, by March 24, only 71.7% of small and medium enterprises had resumed operations.China is keeping strategic interests in mind. The companies have raised the production of medical equipment and supplies to take advantage of global demand. Benefitting from the drop in oil prices, China purchased almost 1.5 million tonnes of commercial crude raising its strategic storage of oil to 29.45 million tonnes.But China’s growth will depend on the global economy and other countries. The US-China rivalry is poised to escalate. As the US, Europe and other countries grapple with the pandemic, trade will be limited and low on their list of priorities. Countries will introspect and re-examine current trade policies, as must India, with priority on eliminating dependence on a single-source of supply, especially in vital sectors. With the possibility of biological warfare now a reality, a serious complication for China will be its image, suspicions of its role and whether it shared pertinent data about the pandemic with the world in time. China blocking a discussion on the pandemic at the United Nations Security Council only heightened suspicions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-pandemic-can-hit-xi-jinping-s-china-dream-analysis/story-KvdgnSyhQOlnnA2DdByPLJ.html
22-04-2020||News||Post Covid-19, India needs increased focus on air quality||The nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is certain to bring enormous social and economic costs to the country. The lockdown has, however, afforded us a look into how our skies and trees could look if Indian cities had cleaner air. It highlights the fact that even though the government must prioritise the economy in the coming months, the other public health crisis – air pollution – can’t be overlooked. This brings into focus the Centre’s Rs 4,400-crore grant to municipal corporations (MCs) of bigger cities for 2020-21 to tackle air pollution.Covid-19 has re-emphasised the need to proactively invest in public health systems. This includes mitigating risk factors that increase the incidence of illnesses. Air pollution is the second largest risk factor – behind malnutrition – contributing to India’s disease burden. Commonly known impacts of air pollution include cardio-respiratory diseases, lung cancer in adults, and acute lower respiratory infections in children. Besides, emerging research suggests that it impacts early childhood development, including birth weight and growth. Early evidence also suggests that air pollution increases the risk of Covid-19 infection. In what now seems a lifetime ago, last winter witnessed one of the most severe smog episodes around Delhi in recent memory, accompanied by unprecedented attention on air quality, with the issues being raised in Parliament, discussed in the media, and included in the Delhi assembly election manifesto. The Union finance minister accepted the interim recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) that provides additional fiscal support in 2020-21, incentivising MCs to tackle air pollution in cities with one million or more population.To put the quantum of outlay in perspective, in 2019-20, the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) budget under the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) was merely Rs 300 crore, distributed among 102 polluted cities, with grants ranging between Rs 10 crore and Rs 10 lakhs. The outlay also dwarfs MoEFCC’s total budget of Rs 3,100 crore for 2020-21, signalling a shift in the air quality management approach, with additional resources and increased devolution towards MCs.While the MoEFCC is still developing the performance framework to determine exactly how the grant will be distributed across cities, the 15th FC report outlines the broad contours. It has recommended that the grants be allocated to cities based on their population. Thus, the total possible grant size for Mumbai would be Rs 488 crore, and for a smaller city, such as Tiruchirappalli, it would be Rs 21 crore. This grant is to be released in two instalments: Half of it upfront for “air quality improvement measures including capacity building of local bodies”, and the rest is subject to the city’s performance against its targets.This is the first time that an FC has given grants specifically to tackle air pollution. Air pollution has multiple sources in Indian cities, and many of these – such as waste burning, and road and construction dust – fall directly under the ambit of MCs. Tackling air pollution involves not only regulating emissions from vehicles and industries but also improving urban governance and public services. Institutionally, too, the approach marks a recognition of urbanisation’s changing needs by earmarking a larger share of grants to urban local bodies (ULBs): From 30% in the previous year to 37.5% in 2020-21, and making a distinction between million-plus urban agglomerates and smaller towns. Finally, by setting aside funds upfront for capacity-building, the FC acknowledges that if MCs are expected to deal with air quality-related issues, their human and fiscal resources must be strengthened. A review of 23 cities by Janagraaha in 2017 had found that most cities lack urban planners, and more than half of the cities did not generate enough revenue to meet even their salary costs. To be sure, while these grants are necessary, they are not enough to improve air quality. Much depends on the final design of the performance framework. City-level measures by the MCs need to be complemented with actions on sources of air pollution outside their jurisdiction – be it within or outside the city, in the larger regional “airshed”. To do this, the grants framework should be integrated with NCAP action plans and institutions, with aggressive but achievable timelines for implementing prioritised measures, and a comprehensive cross-agency strategy for resource allocation. Further, it needs a sustained effort to improve the air quality, necessitating, at a minimum, the continuation of the grants for the next five years.The emergence of different city models of Covid-19 response – from Bhilwara to Agra – shows why having a decentralised form of governance, capable of responding to city-specific needs, matters. While the budget priority in the immediate term is rightly given to health and social protection, we must not lose momentum on the strides made in tackling air pollution. Proactively channelling resources to mitigate a critical risk factor today is a crucial investment for tomorrow’s public health.Avani Kapur is director of the Accountability Initiative, and fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).

22-04-2020||City||Coronavirus lockdown: Journalist, doctor and lawyer step-up to help woman with rare blood group near Mumbai||Twenty-two-year-old Rashida Khatoon, a resident of Manor, Palghar, was in severe distress after delivering a baby girl, as she had lost a lot of blood during the delivery and neither of the two hospitals where she was admitted, could not arrange for the O ‘-ve’ blood for the woman. Her life was saved after a local journalist, a gynaecologist and a lawyer stepped up to help her. On Sunday, Rashida was admitted to the government hospital in Manor, where she delivered the baby. As she had lost a lot of blood and the hospital could not arrange for the rare O ‘-ve’ blood, she was shifted to Thane Civil Hospital.However, the Thane hospital could not arrange for the blood either and Rashida was discharged without any transfusion.Owing to the lockdown, Rashida and her husband Saddam Hussain, 25, could not find a vehicle to ferry them to their village, which is around 60km from Thane. So they carried their child and began walking, but were stopped by the police after they covered 4km. After the couple revealed that they were walking towards their village from the hospital as they could not find a vehicle, the police arranged for an autorickshaw and asked the driver to drop the three to Manor.The driver however, dropped them at Mastan Naka on the highway, which was 3km away from their village in Tamsai. So the couple began walking again in the scorching heat, until they were spotted by a local journalist Sumit Patil.“I was shocked to that the woman was unable to find blood. So I called Dr Rajendra Chauhan, a reputed gynaecologist from Palghar, who agreed to help and then arranged for a car to take Rashida to Kanta Hospital, which is owned by him,” said Patil.Dr Chauhan then took to social media and appealed citizens to donate blood. “The woman had lost a lot of blood but because her blood group was rare, it was not easily available in Palghar. So I made an appeal on social media, after which some donors came forward. We then administered three bottles of blood, and after the patient’s haemoglobin count increased, we discharged her on Tuesday afternoon,” said Dr Chauhan.Dr Chauhan then called his lawyer friend Sudhir Gupta, who took the family to their village in his car. Dr Chauhan learnt that the couple hailed from Uttar Pradesh and worked as daily wage labourers. They had lost their jobs owing to the lockdown. He then asked his friend to help the couple. “I found that the couple was living in extreme poverty and could not pay for medicines. So I bought medicines that would last for a month and Sudhir provided them with groceries and other essentials.”Rashida is recovering well at her home, said Dr Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-journalist-doctor-and-lawyer-step-up-to-help-woman-with-rare-blood-group-near-mumbai/story-OMJTXzqirGkd8Hhi6lvg3J.html

This is expected to help address the shortage of isolation beds with ventilators in the city. Anaesthesia machines will only be used for short durations on suspected or infected patients who have minor breathing problems.With 3,683 cases and a mortality rate of 4.37%reported in Mumbai so far, the most vulnerable to Covid-19 are in the age group of 61-90 years as well as people with pre-existing health issues, like respiratory illnesses and diabetes. These patients often require ventilators and oxygen therapy to aid breathing. However, there is a shortage of ventilators and isolation beds that can provide oxygen therapy. To address this issue, BMC has procured 50 ventilators and is in the process of converting anaesthesia machines into oxygen outlets since these devices have inbuilt ventilators.  “We have sought expertise from the heads of anaesthesia departments. They will submit the report today [Wednesday] along with their recommendations before we approach our technical team for the conversion,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC. “These converted machines will be used for minor, suspected or confirmed asymptomatic patients, not for serious patients with collapsed breathing systems,” he added.The Indian Society of Anaesthesiologist (IAS) approved of the BMC’s plan, but said the converted machines should be a last resort. “Many anaesthesia machines are lying useless which can be converted into oxygen supplying outlets. Bio-technicians can switch off the anaesthesia chamber and help with the minor changes required,” said Dr Naveen Malhotra, secretary, IAS. However, he emphasised that it was important to ensure only anaesthesiologists operated the machines. “Doctors from other specialities will not be able to monitor it, so it needs the expertise of anaesthesiologists,” said Dr Malhotra.In March, hospitals in New York City started repurposing anaesthesia machines when faced with a shortage of medical equipment to treat Covid-19 patients. Anaesthesia machines have an inbuilt oxygen providing system which can be modified to provide oxygen to patients. However, some doctors have advised caution, pointing out that the machines aren’t designed for this purpose.“Anaesthesia machines are used to give relaxants, which are in our hands to control. But in Covid patients, their respiration will be active and we will not have the feature to change the mode of ventilation. These machines aren’t meant to regulate the patient with respiratory problems,” said Dr Manjula Sarkar, anaesthesiologist at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anaesthesia-machines-will-be-turned-into-oxygen-supply-aids-in-mumbai/story-lf9HX3WDxRrnZ35qasL9LK.html

Some videos from the Bhayandar Pada quarantine centre has gone viral, showing the residents complain that the food is not provided on time, garbage is not collected and the centre is not cleaned regularly. The residents alleged that they are not examined for symptoms regularly.The high-risk contacts of Covid positive people in Thane are sent to different quarantine centres set up by the TMC. The municipal corporation has 1,015 quarantine units at its four centres, including BSUP Kasarwadavli centres, Lodha in Bhayandar pada, Tata Amantra in Kalyan and Dosti in Shilphata.The video which went viral shows people roaming freely in the lobby and common spaces at the centre without following social distancing norm.A resident admitted at the centre said, “The centre is not cleaned regularly and garbage is not picked up. We are not given lunch till 3pm. Children are hungry by then.”Another family at Ghodbunder centre said they have written a letter to the state, demanding better facilities. A woman from the family said, “My brother and I have fever for the past few days, but no one has come to check us.”TMC claimed that there is no shortage of food and medical facilities at the quarantine centres.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of Thane, said, “We had a meeting to discuss the complaints. Civic commissioner Vijay Singhal has given directives to the officials to communicate with the people and solve their problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-in-tmc-quarantine-centres-complain-of-poor-facilities/story-OGkO5pgeD0pBqxSN0s630N.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||Separate houses for cops for safety of family members||After a number of Mumbai Police personnel have requested for arrangement to send their families to their hometowns to ensure safety of their family in case the personnel contract Covid-19 while discharging their duties, Mumbai Police has denied them any permission. However, top Mumbai police officers have asked all five additional commissioners of police to arrange accommodation for police personnel who do not want to go home. More than 1,700 accommodations at hotels, guest houses and lodges have been arranged for police personnel to stay. The request by police personnel to send their families away comes after 64 police personnel, including 12 officers and 52 men, tested positive. Of them, 34 are Mumbai Police personnel.“With the lockdown being extended till May 3, a lot of people from the force are circulating messages on messaging groups where talks of sending their families to native villages are being suggested. It is also because there is no clarity yet if the lockdown will continue after May 3,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity. However, deputy commissioner of police (Operations) and Mumbai Police spokesperson Pranaya Ashok dismissed any such permission being granted. “We are not giving any such permission. The rules are the same for general public and for the police department. We are taking all possible measures to ensure safety and security of our personnel from the pandemic,” he said. Ashok added that most police personnel who have tested positive are asymptomatic.Vinoy Kumar Choubey, additional director general of police (law and order) confirmed the development about accommodation for personnel. “We have asked officers to arrange alternate accommodation for men who do not want to go home till the lockdown ends.” In Mumbai’s western region (Bandra to Andheri, and to Powai), seven vanity vans have been deployed at checkpoints for women officers and staff, said additional commissioner of police (West region) Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma.Man from sealed building tweets to police, gets helpA Goregaon (East) resident, who along with 200 other families were living in a building which was sealed following Covid-19 cases, tweeted to police on Wednesday asking help for food supply to all residents. Mumbai Police promptly responded to the tweet and provided contact numbers of online delivery suppliers for essential services and urged him to share it with other residents. The user thanked the police for their help. Two TikTok users arrested, minor caught for making videoA TikTok user and his aides, including a minor, were caught for making a 16-second video passing derogatory comments on Mumbai Police for cracking down on lockdown violators. After the video went viral, netizens brought it to the notice of Mumbai Police on their Twitter handle and got them arrested. The accused are Sahil Sardar,19, and Raj Nirman,18. The third is a 17-year-old minor whose parents have been warned. So far 10 TikTok users have been arrested for making such videos. Burglar digs tunnel, steals 1kg silver A burglar, taking advantage of the lockdown, entered a jewellery shop in Andheri (East) by digging a tunnel into the shop and stole more than 1kg silver early on Tuesday. Jagdish Shinde, senior inspector. MIDC police station, said, “The owner of Mahavir jewellers came to know about the incident on Wednesday and informed us, following which we registered an FIR against an unknown person and started investigation.” Mumbai Police now on Instagram After Twitter, the Mumbai Police have opened an official account on Instagram. However, they have urged people to reach out to them on Twitter on their helpline 100 for real time support and guidance. 324 violators booked in 165 FIRs on Tuesday On Tuesday, 324 people were booked in 165 FIRs for violation of lockdown orders, across the city. 186 violators have been arrested. A majority of FIRs were from central (61 FIRs) and western region (52 FIRs). Of the total cases, 88 cases were for gathering in one place while 59 were for not wearing masks. The rest were against shops for operating without being part of essential services. Maharashtra police updates A total of 62,987 FIRs have been registered against lockdown violators across the state. Of these, 595 cases are against home quarantine violators. 477 people have been arrested in 134 cases of police assault, including a lynching incident in Palghar. Around 13,869 people have been arrested, 44,135 vehicles have been seized and ₹2.41 crore have been collected as fines.

22-04-2020||Mumbai||On Earth Day, Mumbai saw its cleanest air day of 2020: SAFAR||The air quality index (AQI) was ‘good’ for the first time this year on Wednesday, which also happened to be the 50th Earth Day. The last time the city recorded good air quality was in October 2019.According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the pollutant-measuring indicator AQI for PM 2.5 was 46, making it the cleanest air day so far this year and lowest pollution levels during lockdown. Prior to Wednesday, Mumbai had recorded its lowest air pollution levels with an AQI of 61 on Monday, 63 on Tuesday, and 65 on March 22 (Janta Curfew day), all falling under the ‘satisfactory’ category.SAFAR categorises AQI for pollutants in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Pollutant concentration for PM2.5 pollutant – breathable particulate matter (solid and liquid particles) 2.5 microns in size or smaller – was 32 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) on Wednesday against the safe limit of 60 μg/m³ for 24 hours. Similarly, PM10 (larger coarser particles) was 55 μg/m³, almost half its safe limit of 100 μg/m³ for 24 hours. Eight of 10 locations in Mumbai, where SAFAR monitors air quality, recorded ‘good’ AQI levels. While Mazagaon had the cleanest air with an AQI of 18 followed by Colaba 32, Navi Mumbai had comparatively poor air at 75 followed by Malad 58, both ‘satisfactory’ levels. SAFAR said they observed a 10% increase in residential emissions (biofuel burning from residential areas for cooking purposes) mainly emitting carbon dioxide while on the other hand a 90% reduction was witnessed for other pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and oxides of nitrogen due to lesser vehicular and industrial emission sources. “The lockdown should be called off in a phased manner or else it will lead to sharp spike in overall air pollution,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. Researchers said changing weather factors were responsible for improvement in air quality. “Wednesday’s AQI is the optimal air quality Mumbai should be recording during lockdown when external emissions are minimal. However, over the past three weeks, we observed that owing to rising temperatures or late setting in of sea breeze, the wind pattern allowed dust and other pollutant particles to settle close to the surface,” said Beig.The day temperature over Mumbai witnessed a sharp drop from Monday’s high of 37.8 degrees Celsius to 34.3 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, and even the minimum temperature on Wednesday was close to the normal mark. Humidity levels were high with 92% in south Mumbai and 74% in the suburbs. “The drop in temperature, high moisture content and early setting in of sea breeze allowed pollutant concentration to reduce significantly on Wednesday. The drop in pollution maybe temporary due to fluctuating weather and rising temperatures.” An AQI of 75 (satisfactory) has been predicted for Thursday while PM2.5 and PM10 concentration is likely to rise to 46μg/m³ and 61μg/m³ by Friday from current levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/on-earth-day-mumbai-saw-its-cleanest-air-day-of-2020-safar/story-xzKyTNDdNszgJwi2uMfEfI.html

The central agencies have sought custody of the brothers after they were detained by Satara police for violating lockdown restrictions two weeks ago.In his Facebook live address on Wednesday morning, Deshmukh said the 14-day quarantine of the businessmen brothers would end on April 22, after which their custody can be sought by the central agencies. “We have written to both the central agencies that they can take custody on Wednesday afternoon. They [Wadhawans] are at a school in Panchgani [in Satara district] completing their mandatory quarantine,” he said.The Wadhawan brothers and 21 other family members were detained by Satara police on March 7 after they illegally travelled to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala during the lockdown. To cross the district borders, they had provided a letter issued by Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary (special) in the home department, who is now facing an inquiry. The Wadhawans and family members have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Disaster Management Act 2005. The CBI had obtained non-bailable warrants against the two on March 17. In a letter, dated April 17, the deputy inspector general of CBI and the assistant director of ED were requested by the Satara superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute to take necessary action by April 22. Meanwhile, the brothers have obtained interim protection from arrest till May 5 from the special CBI court. The court has granted them protection considering their arrest is not possible during the Covid-19 lockdown. “We have written to the central agencies to take over custody anytime from now. It is up to them to decide when to act on our request,” a home department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cbi-ed-can-take-wadhawans-custody-home-minister/story-qo4p6qpSqctFXozswwDixN.html
22-04-2020||Pune||Woman, 92, grandchild, 3, recover of Covid-19 in Pune||April 22 was a special day for Pune doctors treating Covid-19 patients. The city, which is one of the designated red zones in Maharashtra, with at least 753 cases saw the recovery of a pair of related patients: a three-year-old toddler and her 92-year-old great grandmother. Muralidhar Mohol, the mayor of Pune tweeted in Marathi about them on Monday, “We thank hospital authorities for their efforts. Both the patients have recovered and gone back home safely.”Maisarah Shaikh (3) and her 92-year-old wheelchair-bound great grandmother, Fatima Shaikh, were discharged from Symbiosis Hospital and Research Centre after their second Covid-19 test came negative. Both have completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine period. The nonagenarian, who had suffered a stroke seven months ago, is paralysed and unable to recognise many of her family members. According to doctors at Symbiosis hospital, the recovery of a 92-year-old indicated that even senior citizens with pre-existing ailments — the population most at risk of dying due to Sars-Cov-2 — could recover from the Covid-19 threat.“The old woman did not have any symptoms although she recently had a stroke and her body was paralysed. However, during her stay at hospital, all her health parameters were all right which actually helped our staff to treat her,” said chief executive officer of Symbiosis Hospital Dr Vijay Natarajan.The two residents of Kondhwa were among 15 people, including six from the same family who had tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this month. Their swabs were taken after one of their relatives died at Sassoon General Hospital on April 8. The other nine were indirectly related to the family: acquaintances whom the members had come into contact with prior to the lockdown.“It was a twin tragedy. There was death among the family because of the viral infection, and six of us also tested Covid-19 positive. However, the hospital authorities took good care of us,” said 55-year-old Aslam Shaikh, grandfather to Maisarah, and owner of a tailoring shop in Kondhwa.There are eight members in Shaikh’s family; six tested positive for Covid-19, including the toddler, her father (Shaikh’s son), Shaikh’s mother and Shaikh himself. However, none but the last, exhibited any symptoms.“All of us including my old mother were all fine, only my son had a mild cough. Since my mother is paralytic, we were more worried about her. However, the doctors gave her extra attention and she recovered,” said Shaikh, who was discharged from quarantine on Monday.Also admitted with the toddler and the nonagenarian was Maisarah’s 66-year-old aunt, who is affected with polio. Maisarah’s mother, Noorjaha, despite being tested negative, was allowed to stay at hospital to take care of her daughter and mother-in-law. Now back, all members of the family are attempting to keep social distance from each other and their neighbours in their six-room home. Though business is down, Shaikh said that he is happy: his family is safe and together again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/woman-92-grandchild-3-recover-of-covid-19-in-pune/story-EBaxB1e81RuKBrGWFJXNfL.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||5 intubation boxes to help docs avoid contact while handling patients||In a first, intubation boxes for patients infected by coronavirus have been manufactured by the Western Railway.Five intubation boxes have been manufactured at the zonal railways’s Lower Parel workshop. Intubation is the process of inserting an artificial ventilation tube into a patient’s body to ease breathing.The box can be placed on the patient while the doctors are in the process of intubating a coronavirus patient and it helps medical staff to avoid direct contact or proximity with the patient, thus reducing the exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19. There is a curved side that allows the box to be placed on the patient along with two holes. The holes placed above the head of the patient are to be used by the doctors for intubation. A Western Railway confirmed the developments and said, “The boxes are manufactured with transparent acrylic sheets and are light-weight. They will avoid direct contact with the patient and reduce the chances of the virus spreading. More boxes are being manufactured.”The five boxes have been presently allocated to the railway-operated Jagjivan Ram hospital in Mumbai Central that has been declared as a dedicated Covid-19 hospital by the Union railway ministry. Boxes are also being manufactured for other hospitals in the city.Further, the railway ministry has also manufactured contactless diagnostic cubicles for coronavirus testing in its workshops across the country.Earlier, both the Central and Western railway had converted coaches of their outstation trains into isolation wards. Of the 942 outstation coaches that were converted into isolation wards, 652 will be available for Maharashtra.The coaches were converted into isolation wards in Matunga and Lower Parel workshop, Wadi Bunder, Bandra Terminus and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus(LTT) railway depots one the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/5-intubation-boxes-to-help-docs-avoid-contact-while-handling-patients/story-0RKcNmbKYtzDOvVhZMpRCK.html

22-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown will be effective only with more testing: IIT-Bombay study||Lockdown, as a measure to curb the Covid-19 spread, will be effective only if it is implemented along with an increased rate of testing, tracing and isolation, a multi-model analysis of infectious diseases by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) has revealed. The models also suggested that the number of coronavirus cases will soar after the lockdown is lifted.“Once the lockdown is lifted, the numbers are bound to increase, according to our models. However, the models also showed that lockdown alone will not help in curbing the infection. We need to test aggressively and isolate those infected, especially because there are many asymptomatic cases,” said one of the researchers, professor Subimal Ghosh, from the civil engineering department.The analysis released on Wednesday is an IIT-Bombay-Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD), initiative in collaboration with IIT-Gandhinagar, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Visva-Bharati University in West Bengal.As a part of the analysis, the teams used three models for making epidemiological predictions for the number of incidences of the virus for different time periods under different circumstances. While the system dynamics model is a mathematical modelling of complex scenarios, the X-SEAIPR model is a technique to simplify the mathematical modelling of infectious disease and the statistical model makes assumptions to predict scenarios. While the first two models suggest a spike in the number of cases once the lockdown is lifted, the third model suggests a steady increase in the number of infections after lockdown.Further, a risk analysis of the existing cases shows that some parts of the country are at more risk than others. This means that though the number of cases are low in a state, the population could be more vulnerable based on the social indicators of the place. For instance, Kerala had the highest number of cases at one point, but due to better social conditions, the state could achieve the highest control over the number of infections among the other states.IIT-B’s finding corroborates the need for increased testing as stated earlier by the World Health Organization. Similar findings were released on Tuesday by the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19, a voluntary group of more than 400 scientists, who made the first India-specific epidemiological model. These scientists also recommended that extensive testing, quarantining and continued social distancing, and not a lockdown alone, are the most effective strategies to contain the outbreak in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-will-be-effective-only-with-more-testing-iit-bombay-study/story-U16KvXea0btaQktkodlnnJ.html
22-04-2020||Delhi||Trader’s death sparks fear at Capital’s food supply lifeline||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Wednesday began tracing the contacts of a 57-year-old vegetable vendor at Azadpur Mandi who died of Covid-19 on Tuesday, sparking worries among the traders and authorities about a major spread in what is considered the food supply lifeline of the national capital.There are 2,800 registered traders at Azadpur Mandi who employ 12,000-odd people as labourers, loaders-unloaders (palledars), porters, accountants, etc, according to Adil Khan, chairman of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, which runs the mandi.A government official said the business partner of the dead trader and 15 of his employees are in home quarantine. All of them will be tested for the contagious disease, even as mandi traders demanded stricter surveillance and scaling up of testing in the market, which is one of north India’s biggest food trading hubs.Though some of them said they were open to the idea of temporarily shifting parts of the market, which is spread over an area of more than 100 acres, to some other location in the vicinity, government officials said no such proposal was under consideration as yet.The case emergedafter the Delhi government announced on Monday that the market would be open round the clock to augment supplies after the experiment to run parts of the market in an odd-even formula to ensure social distancing had hit supplies to the city, which is under a lockdown.Under the guidelines issued by the central government, fruits and vegetables are essential commodities that can be sold and purchased during the national lockdown, which runs until May 3. Though some economic activity has been allowed in the second phase of the lockdown from April 20, the Delhi government has chosen to stick with strict curbs as the number of cases in the city continue to rise.By Wednesday evening, Delhi had 2,248 positive cases and 48 deaths.Delhi cabinet minister Gopal Rai’s office on Wednesday said that there was going to be no immediate change in the schedule to run the market, adding that 900 civil defence volunteers and 600 sanitation workers would be deployed at the mandi to ensure social distancing and safety.The dead trader’s shop is located in the D-Block of the market premises. On Tuesday night, the district administration sealed the lane in which the shop is located, which led to the closure of six more fruit and vegetable wholesale shops, said a government official. The person complained of flu-like symptoms, following which he was admitted to hospital on April 15. His samples were collected for testing on April 17. He tested positive on April 19, and, he died in the hospital on April 21, the official added.Concerns among traders amplified as Tuesday’s incident uncovered two more Covid-19 cases in the market.A tomato dealer who lives in Shalimar Bagh, and who tested positive under the jurisdiction of the north-west Delhi revenue district, turned out to be someone who frequented the Azadpur mandi. Similarly, a cauliflower seller from Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda district, a regular at the market, also tested positive. Both are admitted in isolation wards, said an official in the state health department.Senior officials said that, so far, they have come across no mutual contacts to suggest that the cases were interlinked. But they refrained from dismissing the possibility.Deepak Shinde, district magistrate (north), said the people employed by the Covid-19 victim have been put under strict watch. “If they test positive, they will be sent to an isolation ward as per protocol. We are now tracing contacts of the person. He used to reside at Majlis Park,” Shinde said. Shinde did not comment on the other two cases of traders associated with the market who have tested positive.Another senior government official said that the dead trader’s wife and children had gone to West Bengal for a wedding and could not return to Delhi because of the lockdown. His nephew is believed to be a close contact, with whose help the officials are trying to trace others. Fear and uncertaintyThe market continues to operate round the clock but there is fear among the traders. “He moved around and had transactions with hundreds of other traders and customers over the last many days. They all are at risk now and at least all shop owners in the block should be tested first, quarantined and more area should be sealed, if needed,” said Anil Malhotra, a trader and elected member of the market committee.Several other traders demanded strict measures and an assessment to check if parts of the market could be temporarily moved to other locations in vicinity.The Delhi administration did such relocation experiments earlier this month at vegetable and grain wholesale markets in Najafgarh and Mehrauli – but those markets are much smaller in size, a government official said.Azadpur, on the other hand, was subjected to an odd-even rule, allowing traders settled in odd- and even-numbered sheds to open their shops on alternate days. The arrangement led to a supply crisis in Delhi and within days, retail prices of several fruits and vegetables witnessed jump between 30% and 100%, several traders said.Supply has improved by 30% compared to the average of the previous week, said Adil Khan. “The concerns have been conveyed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Today, traders in the market were asked not to panic. They were explained how rapid tests are not operational now and RT-PCR tests in such large scale is impractical. So, they should protect themselves through hygiene measures, masks, social distancing and isolating themselves if they feel and flu-like symptoms. These are tough times,” said Khan.He added that any disruption at Azadpur could throw supplies and trade in food commodities off balance across north India. “Not just Delhi, but for the whole of north India, this is the biggest wholesale agriculture market. A large number of traders from almost all states come here to trade their goods. It is also a major transit point for imported fruits and vegetables,” said Khan.Why Azadpur is importantTo put in perspective the scale of operation in the market, on March 25, the first day of the ongoing nationwide lockdown, amid restrictions on movement of trucks, the market recorded arrival of around 350 tonne of tomatoes, 302 tonne of potatoes, 350 tonne of onions, 82 tonne of cauliflower and cabbage, 70 tonne of orange and 313 tonne of apple.At least 3,000 trucks of fruits and vegetables arrive at Azadpur every day, said Khan. The second largest wholesale mandi in terms of arrivals is in Ghazipur, which witnesses around one-tenth the quantity in terms of arrivals (300 trucks) as compared to Azadpur. Ghazipur is more popular as the chicken and meat lifeline of Delhi. Third biggest fruits and vegetables market in Delhi is in Oklha, which receives around half the quantum of arrivals (150 trucks) compared to Ghazipur, and 5% compared to Azadpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trader-s-death-sparks-fear-at-capital-s-food-supply-lifeline/story-AvePPuqyVbtRJosX2PdRVJ.html
22-04-2020||City||Doctors, staff in Mumbai’s Covid wards will now get certified PPE kits||With more than 250 doctors and nurses testing positive, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has come up with a new rule stating only certified personal protective equipment (PPE) will be used by medical staff in isolation wards for treatment of Covid-19 patients.HT had reported earlier that lack of certified PPE is one of the major reasons for spread of Sars-Cov-2 among staffers. Most of the PPE are procured through donation without quality checks and hence are unable to stop the transmission.The BMC will now accept PPE which has been certified by authorised agencies such as The South India Textile Research Association (SITRA). “According to the new rules, PPE needs to have Unique Certificate Code along with tamper-proof stickers in indelible inks with details of manufacturers. Only such PPE can be used in isolation wards for doctors,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. PPE without security features will be used in other departments where the chance of getting infected is lower. Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana group of hospitals, said owing to the rise in demand, several local traders have started to produce low-quality kits, in violation of safety rules. “Hope this new rule will help to save the frontliners,” he said. So far, at Wockhardt Hospital, 82 medical staff have contracted the infection, followed by Jaslok Hospital with 57 cases and Bhatia Hospital with 45. Three staff members, including one doctor, have contracted the infection at Sewri TB hospital. On Monday, civic-run ENT hospital reported 10 positive cases among employees.More than Covid wards, doctors and nurses are scared of working in non-Covid wards, where PPE is still not compulsory. Talking to HT, a doctor from Bombay Hospital Resident Doctor Association said the infection started to spread in the hospital from non-Covid doctors. “In the first week of April, a resident doctor (radiology) contracted the virus. He wasn’t responsible for taking care of Covid patients. As we used to eat in the same canteens and stayed in the same hostels, the infection started to spread,” said Dr Mehul Desai, President of Bombay Hospital Resident Doctors Association, where 22 staffers have tested positive.Asymptomatic patients are now the main concern. For this, doctors have raised the need for more number of fever clinics and separate entry-exits in hospitals. “Asymptomatic patients are like ticking time machines, who carry the virus inside without anyone’s knowledge. It is extremely important to segregate the functioning of Covid and non-Covid wards,” said Dr Surana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doctors-staff-in-mumbai-s-covid-wards-will-now-get-certified-ppe-kits/story-XM9iv1HkKYIV5DVbG22XoK.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||This mango season, traders in state are staring at 60% losses||The Covid-19 pandemic has broken the supply chain of the Alphonso mango trade of the coastal Konkan region, which is now facing losses worth crores of rupees. The trade has been severely hit due to unavailability of labour and export via aircraft called off due to the global lockdown. An estimate, drawn by mango farmers, wholesale and retail traders, pegs the losses of the industry at 50 to 60% of the normal annual income. Income from exports has also been reduced to 10 to 15% of the income every year, said traders.The Alphonso mango is cultivated along coastal Maharashtra and is most popular in Ratnagiri district, from where it is supplied to the rest of the country and also exported abroad. It grows only during the summer months between mid-April and June. It is sold, not only as a fruit, but also in a variety of packaged forms such as pickles, juices, ice-cream flavours, syrup, and forms an ingredient in many Maharashtrian sweets. All of this is manufactured during these few months, as mango is an easily perishable fruit.Moreover, as the mango industry is seasonal, the income received during these two and a half summer months is used by traders in this business all year round, for their sustenance, to grow the fruit for its next cycle, hire farm-hands to facilitate the cycle, and packaging and transport, until orders for the next year are made.Rajesh Pednekar who is a wholesaler and retailer at Suyog Mangoes in Ratnagiri city, said, “There are a lot of losses as rates have halved. We used to earn Rs 2,500 to Rs 4,000 per box, containing five to nine dozen mangoes, now we get barely Rs 1,700. There is a shortage due to unpredictable rains last year. Moreover, due to the lockdown, we are not supplying to the APMC market at Navi Mumbai. Mangoes are still being supplied to Mumbai and Pune with help of our supply chains and contacts with individual traders, but we do not have as many customers. My family has been in this business for over 60 to 70 years, but we have not seen this kind of uncertainty or losses before.”Another trader, Madhav Lele, of Lele Agro Exports said, “We are not sending mangoes to APMC markets’ agents and are selling directly to customers if there is a bulk order of 100 boxes. However, this is no match to the routine business every year. Exports are happening to Dubai and London by sea. Air exports have completely been suspended. Only 10 to 15% of exports are presently happening, and income from exports has also been reduced to 10 to 15% of the income every year.”To tackle the current trade slump, farmers and traders have come up with innovative ways to ensure continued supply and demand. Aditi Desai, of Desai Bandhu Ambewale traders in Pawas,said, “We have adapted to the situation and are directly delivering to the housing societies we receive bulk orders from. When people find out the supply is there, they order more. In cities like Mumbai and Pune, the demand never stops.”Desai, who also has a business of packaging durable mango products said, “Mangoes need to be immediately sent to the market every day as they are easily perishable. For packaging, the main problem is the availability of labour and their payment. Our income has reduced this year, but we are paying our staff the same amount of money.”Ganesh Khandilkar, who is a Sindhudurg-based mango cultivator, and a retailer for Mumbai, Pune, Sangli, Kolhapur and other cities in Maharashtra said, “Mumbai always has a demand. When you send mangoes to Mumbai APMC, it gets sold right away but that has now stopped. We have to rely now on other supply chains and our contacts with customers. This is resulting in unpredictable losses. Farmers are getting less than 40% of the money they get every year.” On the other hand, customers are unable to get their annual supply of mangoes. Suyash Dighe, a resident of Dadar said, “Every year I travel to Navi Mumbai and buy mangoes. However, this year I do not know where to source the mangoes from.

According to the BMC officials, she tested negative in her fourth report and was discharged on Tuesday evening. But, the report for the third test conducted earlier, came in after her discharge from the hospital. She had tested positive for Covid-19 in her third report. Hence, as a precautionary measure, the senior citizen was quarantined again in an isolation facility at Borivali, on Wednesday. BMC officials further claimed that there was no medical negligence on part of the hospital. Vidya Mane, medical superintendent of Jogeshwari Trauma Care Centre said, “There was no negligence. We discharged her because she tested negative in the fourth report. However, the report of the third test came in late. The patient has no symptoms.”However, local BJP corporator Pratibha Girkar said, “Why did BMC discharge the patient when the third report was awaited? Also, why did they test the patient for the fourth time, if the results of the third test were not out yet?”Further, after the senior citizen had tested positive for the virus two weeks ago, the society at Kandivli, in which she resided, was sealed for 14 days and declared as a containment zone. However, the BMC, on Wednesday, opened the seal of only two of the total three wings of the residential society. Several residents claimed their building was sealed for 14 days and now they are running out of essentials.“We were hoping that our seal will be opened on Wednesday. But now we are told that the same has been extended by another 14 days. This is sheer negligence on part of the BMC. Why did they discharge the patient when the third report was not out? This is irresponsible behaviour.”Meanwhile, deputy municipal commissioner of BMC, Vishwas Shankarwar said, “There is nothing to worry for the society. The society has so far cooperated with us, and we expect them to continue to do so. We are always there if they need to essentials like groceries or medicines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-quarantined-again-after-discharge/story-cv7zYyyhyertcbek9YnUkL.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||Palghar lynching: PIL seeks action against cops, compensation for victim||A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Bombay high court (HC) by a Delhi-based lawyer with regards to April 16 lynching incident at Palghar, wherein two seers and their driver were killed after being brutally beaten up by a mob of over 100 persons, including minors. The PIL seeks directions for an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or a special investigation team (SIT); trial by a fast-track court; disciplinary action, and a first information report (FIR) against the policemen who failed to protect the three victims. The PIL also seeks compensation of ₹1 crore to the driver’s family. According to the PIL filed by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastav, the brutal lynching of the two seers Sushil Giri Maharaj, 35, and Maharaj Kalpavrikshgiri, 70, along with their driver Nilesh Telgane, 35, has shocked the conscience of a large number of people across India.The petition further states that though police personnel was present during the lynching, they did little to save the victims and there have been allegations that an officer pushed one of the victims towards the mob when he approached the former for help.The petition had prayed that in the interest of justice, a free and fair investigation should be conducted in the case under the monitoring of the court. The petition has further prayed that as there are serious allegations of commission and omission on the part of the local police personnel, it would be in the interest of justice that the investigation is done by any independent agency, one that is not subservient to the state of Maharashtra.The PIL is expected to be mentioned before the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/palghar-lynching-pil-seeks-action-against-cops-compensation-for-victim/story-GU9ePAjPQNy9J5u0f6bf5N.html
22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Amid Covid-19 outbreak, Chandigarh authorities warn residents of impending dengue season||Already grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, UT health department has another reason to worry this season -- vector-borne diseases. Urging residents to take precautions, adviser Manoj Parida took to Twitter and wrote, “Dengue season is knocking on doors. Please clean up water tanks, dry up waterlogged corners, sanitise houses and relax...We don’t want 2 in 1. Dengue and corona both guests in city.”A health department official, who is not allowed to talk to media, said, “Its April, culex mosquito is there. We call it a ‘nuisance mosquito’ as it bites and leaves rashes. In least scenario, it will cause filariasis and Japanese encephalitis, but these diseases are not reported in this region.” “To deal with the adult mosquito, fogging has already been started and on request, spraying is also being done,” he said.The official also said that the next three months, May, June and July, are the season of malaria, then post monsoon (August to November) is the peak breeding season of aedes aegypti – the mosquito causing dengue and that is the time when dengue and chikungunya cases spike.PREVIOUS CASESIn 2018, 301 dengue cases were reported in the UT, while the count was 286 in 2019. The health official also said that he was not aware if any case has been reported this year so far.On being asked how challenging it would be to check the vector-borne diseases when the health staff is already dealing with the corona pandemic, the official said, “We are all geared up. The department’s energy is definitely diverted towards the deadly pandemic and we are not able to give all our attention towards the vector-borne diseases, but at the same time, we are keeping a watch on it and are vigilant.”A total of 140 mosquito breeding checkers, 56 multipurpose health workers and six inspectors are already on the job, he said, adding that the breeding checkers are accompanying the teams of health workers who are conducting door-to-door screening for the coronavirus. “They are there for the security purpose of the staff and also check the mosquito breeding outside houses in nearby parks,” the official said. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, checking of mosquito breeding sites inside houses has also been impacted. “Nobody is going to let us inside because of the fear of the pandemic, so, the health workers are at least checking the outer areas,” he said.30 CHALLANS ISSUED IN JANUARYLast year, over 21,000 people were issued notices besides 240 challans. This year before the outbreak of coronavirus, 30 challans were issued in January.Overburdened with dealing the global pandemic, the UT health department is taking the municipal corporation’s help. They have given the civic body a list of uncovered overhead tanks to be repaired before the season begins and a data of stagnant water spots has also been shared for spraying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-covid-19-outbreak-chandigarh-authorities-warn-residents-of-impending-dengue-season/story-TS35hjjgwIRwI6zWQkS1IK.html
22-04-2020||City||In pvt hospitals, patient has to bear cost, says Punjab govt||Patiala: The Punjab government has said that covid-19 patients can go to private hospitals, but they will have to bear the treatment cost. The government, however, has clarified that private hospitals are not allowed to charge more than the CGHS (Central Government Health Scheme) rates as prevalent in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR). The government said this was meant to ensure that the patient was not exploited. In government hospitals, the treatment is free. The state government added that this will help patients, who wish to be treated at private hospitals and have the capacity to pay. This will rope in the private sector in the fight against covid-19 and reduce the load on government sector, it adds.Anurag Agarwal, principal secretary health and family welfare, says in his order, “Covid-19 patients can go to private hospitals for their treatment, but they will bear the cost from their own pocket. However, no private hospital shall charge them exceeding CGHS rates valid in Delhi-NCR.” Indian Medical Association (IMA) Punjab president Dr Navjot Dahiya said, “At these CGHS rates, a day’s treatment for covid-19 at a private hospital will cost around Rs 6,000, including bed charges and ventilator. Additionally, the patient will have to bear the cost of PPE kits, medicines and other equipment.” He added, “If the patient has been given the choice to go to a private hospital, the doctor too has a choice on whether he wants to admit a patient or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-pvt-hospitals-patient-has-to-bear-cost-says-punjab-govt/story-YT6E5X75dT8722wvND0wCO.html

22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Record 50 trains enter Punjab in a day to transport grain||A record 50 freight trains chugged into Punjab on Wednesday to transport wheat and rice stored in the godowns to other states for supply under the Public Distribution System (PDS). With each train’s capacity up to 3,000 tonnes, at least 1.4 lakh tonne grain was moved out of the state. The fast movement of grain from Punjab is being attributed to the countrywide lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The central government has decided to give free ration under the PDS for three months under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana. The decision to double the grains to beneficiaries was taken on March 27.“More than 19 lakh tonne wheat and rice has been moved from Punjab in 759 specials since April 1,” said a senior officer in food and civil supplies department.“Never in the past has such movement taken place on a given day. The daily average of three years was 16 trains (48,000 tonnes) and in the past six months it came down to 12 (36,000 tonnes),” said Food Corporation of India (FCI)’s regional head Arshdeep Thind. Besides, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, other states which received grains from Punjab through special trains are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/record-50-trains-enter-punjab-in-a-day-to-transport-grain/story-EtGeChkg9NwLmf52aXmRcJ.html

22-04-2020||City||NHAI wants DC to intervene for work to start in the city||Gurugram: With a host of construction projects in limbo owing to the nationwide lockdown, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Tuesday asked that the district administration expedite permissions to allow contractors to resume pending work.In a letter to Gurugram deputy commissioner (DC) Amit Khatri, NHAI Gurugram project director Ashok Sharma asked that applications by contractors made on the state’s Saral portal be accepted at the earliest. A senior highways authority official said contractors have made applications for work passes on the Saral portal over the last two days, but are still awaiting their arrival.“Government of Haryana, revenue and disaster management department has also directed construction projects be allowed with ministry of home affairs guidelines, operations shall be allowed with 50% of the total work force,” the letter read.Among the projects pending are the Ambience Mall underpass, Shankar Chowk elevated U-turn, Khandsa foot-overbridge, Badshahpur-Sohna road.On April 20, Haryana’s chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora had said that some industries not in containment zones can resume operations while following the guidelines issued by the Centre. She said owners of industries and factories will have to get permission to operate from the government through the Saral portal, only after which would passes be issued to labourers and other employees working there.So far, the district administration has identified six containment zones in Gurugram. The city has seen 41 cases of Covid-19, and no deaths till now.HT had earlier reported that at least 25 industrial units and companies in the district would be allowed to resume operations this week, and were likely to get approvals for the same by Wednesday morning.The development after the Haryana government on Sunday released a standard operating procedure (SOP) for reopening industrial units amid the nationwide lockdown, in a bid to allow economic activities to return to normal. No NHAI contractor has been allowed to start work till yet.A few NHAI contractors had been stopped by Gurugram police when they resumed work at Sohna road on Monday, as officers said the contractors didn’t have permission to work during the lockdown. In the letter, Sharma wrote that contractors and concessionaires complained that local law enforcement did not allow them construction work in the city. “They have reported that the requisite permission has been applied, which needs to be expedited. Some of the staff of our independent engineer have also reported that permission for their movement pass has been rejected by the Gurgaon administration. For want of permission from the Gurgaon administration none of the projects of NHAI could resume till date ,” read the letter, a copy of which is with HT.When asked about the matter, Khatri said all applications sent by NHAI contractors are being scrutinised. “I cannot comment on when they will be issued, but we are processing them as per their necessity,” he said. Administration officials said because most NHAI contractors have made provisions for labourers to live near construction sites, the issuance of work passes should not be an issue.In a letter written to the DC earlier this month, an NHAI contractor — Oriental Structural Engineers Pvt Ltd, which is constructing a five-kilometre elevated stretch on the Badshahpur-Sohna Road said the pause in construction could put commuters in danger. The contractor in its letter to the DC said that a span (girder on the pillar) is hanging and needs to be lowered immediately. The contractor is still waiting for the construction pass to be given for this pillar to be fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nhai-wants-dc-to-intervene-for-work-to-start-in-the-city/story-En5jZme99ZqKT1he02pcBK.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||No Muslim involved in Palghar lynching: State home minister||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said that there was no communal angle to the Palghar lynching incident on April 16 and that none of the 101 accused arrested by the police were Muslim. Deshmukh said that the attack was a fall-out of rumours triggered by social media posts about child abductors in the area.“Not even a single member of the Muslim community was among the attackers. Altogether, 101 have been arrested on charges of lynching. Police acted swiftly and arrested all accused in eight hours by finding some of them from the jungle and mountains. The state-run Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has started the probe headed by a special inspector general-rank officer,” Deshmukh said. He later released a list of the names of the 101 arrested in the case.Stopping short of naming the main Opposition, the home minister alleged that a few politicians were trying to give a communal angle to the “unfortunate incident” in the hopes of coming back to power. The BJP has attacked the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government for its failure to maintain law and order and has demanded Deshmukh’s resignation. The government has already suspended two policemen for alleged dereliction of duty.On April 16, two seers Kalpavriksha Giri, 70, and Sushil Giri, 35, and their driver Nilesh Telgade, 30, were dragged out of their vehicle near Gadhchinchale village and beaten to death by a mob, on suspicion that they were child abductors. The victims were travelling from Mumbai to Surat to attend a funeral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-muslim-involved-in-palghar-lynching-state-home-minister/story-4xfyt8tz9ZePn0rx5d4mAL.html

The suspects have been identified as Ird Khan alias Pappu, Shekhawat, Hafiz, Jalalu and Nafis. All the suspects are neighbours, police said.A case was registered under sections 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), at Adarsh Nagar police station. The suspects were produced before a district magistrate on Tuesday evening and sent to jail in judicial custody for 14 days.The victim was identified as Rekha Sharma, a resident of Sector 65 in Faridabad, who has been working as an ASHA worker in Ballabhgarh for the past six years. On Tuesday, she said, she reached Ashiyana society around 1pm for conducting a surveillance. “I had to take details from each house during the door-to-door survey. When I asked one of the families to share the details of the number of members and if anyone had shown any kind of symptoms related to Covid, they refused to cooperate. I am also supposed to ask if anyone, who might have attended Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, had visited their house or met them. But they got furious after ia sked them that and started abusing me,” she said.Sharma immediately informed her senior medical officers, who were near the spot. They in turn informed the police control room and the nearest police station. “The group started using vulgar language and abused the administration. They fished out wooden sticks and iron rods from inside their home and threatened to take us hostage. Within 10 minutes, a police team from Adarsh Nagar arrived and tried to intervene but they attacked all of us with sticks and rods ,” she said. Kailash Chander, station house officer of Adarsh Police station, said that a team of 10 policemen had reached the spot and they had tried to pacify the residents. But some of them turned violent. “We called for backup to control the situation, as the suspects had called their neighbours and more than 20 people had gathered at the spot,” he said.Sharma and two police personnel sustained injuries on their head, arms, shoulders, and legs in the incident, and were taken to a private hospital.ASHA workers have been deployed by the district administration to conduct door-to-door survey in all the residential areas and collect data on people having cough, cold and fever symptoms. They act as a bridge between the community and the public healthcare system in India and since mid-March, they have been conducting surveys to gather information about those who are likely to be affected by Covid-19 in the state.KK Rao, Faridabad’s commissioner of police, said that they often receive complaints from these ASHA workers. “We have informed all station house officers to take strict action against those who misbehave with ASHA workers or medical teams,” he said.Faridabad deputy commissioner Yashpal Yadav also said that the health department and ASHA workers are facing regular harassment during these surveys. “We have requested police commissioner to act against anyone found abusing these workers or refusing to cooperate with them,” he said.[TRYING TO GET A QUOTE FROM THE RESIDENTS]||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/five-arrested-for-attacking-asha-workers-policemen-during-survey-in-faridabad/story-C2h5OZIXm90RyPoE2R5RxM.html
22-04-2020||Gurugram||Maruti among 10 industries allowed to reopen in Gurugram||The Haryana government on Wednesday granted permission to auto major Maruti Suzuki India to resume operations at its Manesar plant. It also allowed nine other industries to reopen after their applications were approved by a district-level committee amid the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. Though the production at the Maruti plant is still on hold, the district administration has allowed the company to resume maintenance at the Manesar plant on a single-shift basis. It has granted permission for only 600 employees and 50 vehicles to operate. The company, however, was not granted permission to resume operation at its other plants located in Gurugram and Manesar, the labour department said. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said, “The company will not start production, as permission has been granted for limited persons and the maintenance of the Manesar plant.”The auto giant, which manufactures about 15.5 lakh cars of 16 different models every year, had shut its plants at Udyog Vihar and Manesar on March 22. In Gurugram district, the company has at least nine dealers but they will continue to remain shut due to ongoing lockdown.RC Bhargava, the chairman of the company, said, “The government has issued permission as per the guidelines of the ministry of home affairs. But to start the production of cars, we need a continuous supply of parts and then a channel to sell cars. The production can’t start till these things are sorted out. We can’t say when will that be because the situation changes every day.”A senior executive of the company, who did not wish to be named, said that in March 2019, the company had sold 1.58 lakh cars. Last month till March 22, 84,000 cars had been sold and there were no sales in April. At the Gurugram and Manesar plants, there are over 20,000 workers and they work in two shifts of 10,000 to 11,000 each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/maruti-among-10-industries-allowed-to-reopen-in-gurugram/story-OgzP9r8Xsh4mZMWUFAu2yK.html

22-04-2020||City||Gurugram: District admin prescribes strict regime for units resuming operations||Gurugram: To prevent the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease among industrial workers and office staff when commercial activities resume in Gurugram, the district administration and the labour department on Wednesday issued a detailed advisory for business units reopening while the lockdown is still in place. The labour department said that since the city has a unique mix of industrial and office workforce, owing to closeness with Delhi and other national Capital region cities, it has been decided to apply more stringent measures in a few domains to prevent the spread of this disease.Till Wednesday evening, a total of 10 business units had been permitted to operate by the district administration, including auto major Maruti, said Munish Sharma, additional labour commissioner of NCR, Haryana. “All organisations are expected to align their operations to these guidelines to ensure safe working conditions. In case the companies don’t comply with the standard operating procedures (SOP), their permissions will be withdrawn and criminal proceedings would be initiated against them,” he said.Sharma said before commencing operations, the firms have to submit detailed plans for housing and safe transport for workers, staggering of shift timings, screening at gates, social distancing on the work floor, provision of food and water, provision of safety equipment and loading and unloading of goods.Industrialists based in the city, however, were not very enthused by the stringent guidelines prescribed, saying the advisory was one of the reasons many units were not interested in resuming operations. “The government must understand that such strict conditions cannot be implemented in factories. There is a need for flexibility in shaping these rules and no one wants penal action to be initiated against them. We also have opposed the condition of mandatory health insurance as it would be difficult to follow, particularly for smaller units,” said Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries of Udyog Vihar. Units based in the industrial township of Manesar were also wary of the advisory, stating that it would be impossible to implement the guidelines under present conditions. “The government needs to be flexible and work with business owners instead of deciding these terms. These aren’t normal times and we must work jointly to ensure safe working conditions. It would be very difficult to resume production with the measures decided by the government,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries’ Welfare Association. The guidelines to be followed by these companies are:CCTVs and surprise auditsThe district administration should have access to CCTV footage of the work-floor. If there is no sufficient coverage, the firms have to ensure there is before reinitiating operations. Ideally a web-enabled CCTV system will be preferred, but even legacy CCTV systems will be allowed.Police, administration and labour teams will make surprise checks and audits to check compliance. Any deviation will result in summary stoppage of work and initiation of criminal proceedings.TransportIdeally, the employees must be housed within the unit premises. In cases where it is not possible, employees should be made to stay in a nearby accommodation. Between the workplace and the place of lodging, there can be a company-owned transport mode with mandatory nod to social distancing (hence, one employee per row).Employees can even travel on foot or by their own vehicles (one person per vehicle). In rare circumstances, a driver may be permitted for a car, provided there is an impermeable barrier between the driver and the passenger and the AC is not switched on. Inter-state or inter-district travel of employees is not allowed (except for essential services, where also it is rationed).Reconfiguration of human resource policies There must be health cover for all employees before commencing operations.The district administration has stipulated that employees’ non-adherence with social distancing and hygiene practices should reflect on their annual appraisals; repeated indiscipline, substantiated by the evidence of other employees, must result in their summary removal from the job, in spite of their capability and performance.Employee mixThe document also recommends that employees with comorbidities such as pulmonary, cardiac or renal issues, diabetes, hypertension or obesity don’t attend work. Also, units should consider allowing parents with children below five years of age to work from home, the advisory adds.SanitationThe firms are also expected to ensure all common areas and work areas are sanitised and disinfected in every shift using government-approved chemicals. Roster for maintenance and record of purchase order of chemicals/materials must be maintained.Posters, helpline and trainingPosters with approved guidelines and messages must be displayed. Regular drill and training of employees must be conducted maintaining six feet of distance. Frequent announcements must be made on the floor to remind workers to be mindful of their actions. Contact numbers of government helplines must be displayed.No overlap of shiftsThere should be no overlap of shifts. A minimum time of an hour should be there between two shifts for cleaning to take place.Doing away with social distancing disruptorsBiometric attendance systems should not be used. The floor of the office should be clearly marked with coloured tape (squares or circles) at every six feet. Employees should be allowed to walk strictly in those squares or circles. There must be a fixed seating plan and workers should not be allowed to roam around. Common resources such as gates, lifts, sanitizers, etc., could be handled by dedicated people.Stairs should be preferred and with only a minimum number of people at a time. Door knobs and handles should either be removed or handled by dedicated staff. Self-serving should be done away with in cafeterias. Ideally, cafeterias should be discontinued and packed lunches should be made available or employees should be encouraged to carry their own food.Life at and beyond the workplace, Aarogya Setu appDaily temperature scans at the workplace must be made. Employees must check their temperature at home, too, and should not turn up for work in case of fever or any other symptoms of flu. Don’t dismiss mild rise in temperature of any employee. Seek professional advice. Ask your employees not to self-medicate, even with over-the-counter drugs such as paracetamol.It is also mandatory for everyone to use Aarogya Setu appUse of face mask/hand washingThe use of masks is compulsory and the employees won’t be allowed to remove it in any case. It would augur well if an organisation provides face masks to its employees.

Officials said the situation is grave in 21 grains markets of the Goniana block and one in Bathinda city.District mandi officer Preet Kanwar Brar said, “We are planning to build rakes of wheat sacks at the grains markets to create more space. Of the 10 lakh metric tonnes of wheat expected in the district this season, 1.72 lakh metric tonne arrived till Tuesday.” Navdeep Singh Jeeda, district president of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said the slow lifting of grain has exposed the state government’s claims of ensuring smooth procurement of the crop. “The farmers are suffering,” he added.Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said, “It (glut-like situation) happens every year when crop arrival gains pace. These mandis will be cleared of wheat stock in the next couple of days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/grain-glut-in-bathinda-mandis-due-to-tardy-lifting/story-CSfBOBymDarQRrtgj428bP.html

Those daily wage earners who don’t have ration cards but are entitled to will be provided with the cards. Other needy people who are not entitled to get the cards will also be provided essential items under disaster relief,” said a statement from the district administration. However, people from the economically weaker section are having trouble in getting the most of these benefits. Yogender Yadav, a resident of Chajarsi village who used to work as a helper in the assembly line of an export house, is now trying to make ends meet for his family.“We are a family of five people and we had been starving for a few days due to the lockdown. I went to a ration shop last week. But I was asked to leave as I did not have a ration card. Today, with the help of a media person, I got 24 kg dry ration from a social organization. These people told me that I can get a ration card as the government is taking measures to help people like us. I will now apply for the same,” said Yadav.The family is one of the many who have been often turned away from ration shops due to lack of valid cards.“My eldest daughter and I had gone to a government ration shop on April 15, but were turned away because we didn’t have a card. We went back again the next day and filled up a form to apply for a ration card. But so far nothing has happened. For some essential items, we even tried some helpline numbers but no help came. Finally, we received 10 kg ration from a police post today,” said Sarita, a native of Bihar who used to run a tea stall in Sector 18 market and lives in the Atta market area.In the absence of help from the administration, most of the daily wage earners turn to nearby residential areas for help.“Several workers come to us for help every day. For a few days, we distributed ration among them. We even engaged the MLA office and helped out people. But to do it on a daily basis is beyond our resources. We often ask such people to contact the helplines or the local government shops. But most of these workers don’t have valid identity cards and are often denied help,” said Kanhaiya Lal Awana, president, residents’ welfare association, Sector 27.According to the officials of the district supplies department, the district currently has 1,84,925 active ration card holders under the public distribution system. According to the guidelines, the officials will issue ration cards of people eligible for them and identify those who are in need of services. Such people will then be provided a food packet of nine essential items from the relief fund, the officials said.“Since April 1, 3,500 new ration cards have been issued, while 10,279 requests have come in. All the applications for ration cards are under process. More than 15,000 people have also been identified who will be provided food from the ‘rahat kosh’,” said an officer of the district supplies department, on the condition of anonymity.For issuing new cards, a survey is being conducted by officers, the officer said.Despite repeated attempts, district magistrate Suhas LY could not be contacted for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-nagar-admin-working-to-issue-ration-cards-on-priority-daily-wagers-fail-to-get-cards-due-to-lack-of-info/story-YJbPtPRSBEujnRRUm6jG6K.html

The officer said 12 people from Dharavi have succumbed to the coronavirus so far.Considering the death rate due to coronavirus is the highest among senior citizens, the civic body has now decided to screen the elderly, especially in slum areas, and identify those with co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes, as they fall in the high-risk category. Of the 152 coronavirus-related deaths recorded in Mumbai, at least 71 were above 61 years.In a circular issued by the BMC, a special team of doctors, community health workers and Asha workers will be appointed in all wards for door-to-door screening of senior citizens. If necessary, the team will refer them to a nearby dispensary for treatment. Covid-19 negative senior citizens will be moved to non-Covid hospitals to monitor their health conditions.According to the BMC, so far, 67 patients from G-South ward have recovered and have been discharged, followed by 38 from K-East (Andheri East) and 31 each from E (Byculla) and K-West (Andheri W) ward, respectively. Of the positive cases, more than 80% have been reported from slums such as Worli-Koliwada and Jijamata Nagar. According to the BMC records, over 3,800 persons from this ward have been quarantined. The fishermen’s colony in Koliwada was the city’s first containment zone.After a BMC sweeper from Worli-Koliwada tested positive on April 2, civic health staffers have screened more than 80,000 people, said BMC officials. “The number of cases in this area is increasing. So our teams were tracking all high- as well as low-risk contacts to quarantine them separately,” said a senior officer from the civic health department.The civic body has identified 813 containment zones and sealed them. Of these, 124 were from G-South ward and 61 from E ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/100-patients-in-3-days-prabhadevi-ward-all-set-to-cross-500-case-mark/story-zenGZitr2JfghwXbWaTk2H.html

22-04-2020||Lucknow||Lockdown brings ‘cleanest air of century’ to Uttar Pradesh||With negligible vehicular movement, most industries closed and construction work largely halted due to the lockdown, the state is experiencing the cleanest air of this century, according to an environmentalist.The average Air Quality Index (AQI) of Lucknow and other major cities of the state in April hovered around 100, according to data available with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This level is considered satisfactory with minimal adverse impact on human health, according to CPCB norms.On Tuesday, AQI of Lucknow was recorded at 78, which falls in the moderate category, CPCB data indicated.“The current AQI is many times better compared to the AQI of 300 and 400 which the city records in usual months. Even in March, the average AQI of Lucknow was around 320, which is categorised as very poor air,” said senior environmentalist Pramod Kamble. “We are experiencing the phase with the best air quality of the century,” he added.The impact of improved AQI is reflected in the improved visibility of the city’s skyline. One can now see high-rise complexes in Gomti Nagar Extension and Aliganj from Hazratganj. The iconic Hussainabad Clock Tower in Old Lucknow is also visible from almost five kilometres away.“The air outside feels light and clean. Breathing the clean air makes one more lively,” said Dharampal Singh, a retired armyman who goes for a morning walk while following proper precautions of social distancing.Alfred Lawrence, a city-based environmentalist and faculty at Isabella Thoburn College, Lucknow, said the lockdown was a ‘blessing for Mother Earth and also for us.’“The spread of the virus is also affected by air quality according to studies which show that the spread of virus is less in areas with clean air,” Lawrence said.The improvement in air quality is directly linked to reduction in human activities. The lockdown was put into effect from March 25 in order to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection. It was extended till May 3 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The lockdown has stopped vehicular movement and most construction work, two major contributors of air pollution in Lucknow.According to the annual report by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), there are 21,94,261 vehicles in Lucknow, a fraction of which plies on the roads during the lockdown.The demand for fuel has also dipped. Lucknow Petrol Dealers’ Association president Ranjit Singh Gaur said, “The sale of petrol is less than 25% of the average these days..Before March 21, the consumption of petrol in Lucknow was around 3.5 lakh litres daily , while 2 lakh litres of diesel used to be sold. Nowadays, the sale of petrol is around 80,000 to 90,000 litres per day while ,sale of diesel is reduced to between 20,000 and 25000 litres per day. There are around 140 petrol pumps in Lucknow district.”Experts say AQI will improve further in the coming days, providing relief to people with respiratory problems, the elderly and children.Besides air, the pollution level in rivers like the Ganga, the Yamuna and the Gomti has also dropped, because the rivers are getting very little industrial waste discharge as compared to the usual days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lockdown-brings-cleanest-air-of-century-to-uttar-pradesh/story-qipLMT2VgkXeeWVTN6PkiN.html

22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Uklana arhtiyas protest against govt for allowing sarpanches to procure crop||Arhtiyas (commission agents) of Uklana on Wednesday registered their protest at the local grain market against the government for authorising sarpanches to buy wheat and mustard from farmers.The protesters demanded to adopt the old method of purchasing, where farmers would bring their produce to commission agents and the latter used to sell the crop to purchasing agencies.Dhoop Singh, head of the arthiyas, said, “We are holding a shirtless protest because the same would happen to us quite soon if farmers do not approach us to sell their crop.”He claimed that farmers were willing to bring their crop to commission agents, but the government was introducing new rules daily. “A commission agent always helps a farmer by buying his produce. He earns a little by selling the crop further. But now, the government has decided that sarpanches would start purchasing foodgrain. Does a sarpanch really know what kind of crop he should buy and would he be able to pay the farmers on time? Dhoop Singh asked.A farmer from Bithmara village, Bhale Singh, said their condition was also not good. “Where would a farmer go? After harvesting, what a farmer needs is money, so that he can prepare his land for the next cycle of crop. We do not have enough space to store our produce. On top of that, we are only allowed to visit purchasing centres if we get the SMS,” he added.The Uklana grain market wore a deserted look with many arhtiyas closing their shops in protest.Agitation lifted in KarnalKarnal: Protesting arhtiyas in Karnal district on Wednesday ended their strike and joined the procurement operations. On Tuesday evening, the commission agents had declared an indefinite strike alleging that farmers were not being allowed to bring their produce to the mandis. The protest was lifted following an assurance by Karnal SDM Narender Pal Malik. There also were some reports of technical issues being faced while accessing ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal. The agents claimed that the portal was not showing names of all registered farmers, especially those having joint land holdings.“We have ended our strike and decided to support the procurement operations as the government has rectified the portal and now, farmers associated with all commission agents would be able to sell their produce,” said Rajnish Chaudhary, president of Karnal Commission Agents’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/uklana-arhtiyas-protest-against-govt-for-allowing-sarpanches-to-procure-crop/story-IXQ1CqMk301Fr8zaYxoM4K.html

We will soon start screening to identify those who would need long-term care and rehabilitation. We are exploring all options where these people can be shifted for better care,” said the official requesting anonymity.

It’s been decided to allow the schools and special centres to hold semester examinations via their preferred mode keeping in mind the difficulties following the normal academic calendar and the mode of conducting exams amid the lockdown,” he said.“The schools and centres can consult their students and conduct online exams during the lockdown as well. Offline exams can only be held post lockdown,” he added. As per the submitted recommendations, only five of 13 schools and one of the five special centres have decided to conduct examinations online. Among the schools that approved the online mode of examinations are School of Environmental Sciences, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, School of Physical Sciences, School of Engineering and School of Management and Entrepreneurship. Besides, the Special Center for the Study of North-East India has also decided to hold online exams.Meanwhile, the largest schools in the University, including the School of Social Sciences, School of International Studies, School of Language Literature and Cultural Studies and School of Arts and Aesthetics, have recommended the extension of the semester and holding classes after the lockdown is lifted. “Four to six weeks of teaching and personal engagement is essential to conclude the semester, whenever the lockdown ends. Examinations will be held at the end of that period,” School of Arts and Aesthetics said in its recommendations.The School of International Studies said that it would decide the mode only after May. “This matter may be deferred until May and depending on the situation, the school may either opt for the regular mode of examinations or online examinations. In the case of online examinations, course teachers may opt for open-book examinations or additional home assignments or provide a set of questions with the choice of attempting two or three. And in case of the regular mode of examinations, the evaluation process may be completed by the first week of August,” it said in the submitted recommendations.The JNU Teacher’s Association (JNUTA), meanwhile, rejected the move, saying that the administration had not followed the due process to get it approved from the Academic Council. “Not all members of the AC received this mail and neither did the JNUTA President or Secretary (it may be recalled that the University had not invited the JNUTA even for the previous meeting of the AC held on 6 February 2020). Further, instead of any opportunity for deliberation, AC members were only given the option of approving the agenda and that too in just a day,” the teachers’ body said.JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) vice president Saket Moon said that they reject the decision and said that the union members had not been asked for approval either.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/schools-centres-free-to-choose-their-own-mode-of-exams-jnu/story-W6SxpnSwIB2zIrUes4utIN.html

Currently, the basis for allotment is 2011 census.Gehlot said Centre allots 232,631 MT wheat for 44.6 million people limiting the allotment to 53% people in urban areas and 69% in rural areas. This ceiling is based on the 2011 census of 68.6 million, he said.The chief minister said state’s population in 2019 was about 77.4 million, out of which the rural population is 58.2 million.“According to the current population, 50.4 million people should be covered under this important scheme of social security,” Gehlot said.He said due to the natiowide economic crisis born out of Covid-19 pandemic, the unemployed poor, artisans and daily wage labourers are facing a challenge to their livelihood.“Taking a sympathetic view of this, the Centre should make additional allotment of wheat to the state on the basis of the current population so that the needy could benefit from this scheme according to the Act’s spirit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-cm-gehlot-writes-to-pm-modi-for-additional-wheat-allotment/story-c9m50PybhTc3S1pECIRn6H.html
22-04-2020||Delhi||DU teachers against online tests, propose rescheduling of exams after lockdown is lifted||Several Delhi University teachers’ outfits on Wednesday proposed the rescheduling of papers till after the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are lifted from the city.The teachers cited concerns of accessibility over the possibility of the examinations being held online, one of the several methods that Delhi University was considering to tide over the ongoing academic crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic in the city. Delhi University has been shut since March 19, when Covid-19 cases started to surge in the city. Delhi so far has seen 2,248 cases of the virus and 48 deaths.In a letter to the vice-chancellor on Wednesday, Sachin Maheshwari, Dean of Faculty of Technology, said that the need of the hour was to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. “Almost all the IITs have advanced their summer vacations rather than hastily pushing for online semester evaluation/examination for their students, especially, when, the student is sitting at home,” he pointed out.Citing a 2017 Supreme Court order, Maheshwari also said, “Earning credits through distance mode, especially for engineering-related courses, may have its own legal implications, besides many quality-related considerations.”One of teachers’ group — Academics for Action and Development (AAD) — in its letter to the vice chancellor, also pointed out that the varsity’s statutory bodies — like executive council and academic council — should be approached before taking decisions on how to conduct the examination.“The university should wait for students to come back to Delhi after the lockdown has been lifted, give them a few days of actual teaching, before commencing the examination process,” they said in a statement on Wednesday. “In the prevailing worldwide pandemic circumstances, mental and physical health is paramount and academic calendar must be contingent on the evolving scenario of humanity’s fight against Covid-19.”The group also raised concerns over cybersecurity issues after several instances of inappropriate behaviour and hacking cropped up during the online classes conducted via videoconferencing.Another teachers’ group — National Democratic Teachers’ Front — has also objected to online exams citing the digital divide and poor connectivity in different parts of the country. “In such conditions, even dreaming about online examinations will be disastrous,” the group said in a statement asking the administration to provide “honest feedback” to University Grants (UGC) Commission. The UGC has constituted a panel to look into ways to mitigate academic loss during the Covid-19 lockdown. The committee is expected to submit its report soon.Last week, the Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) had also written to the V-C on the matter. They too recommended conducting exams only after the university reopens, with a priority given to final year students.DU vice chancellor Yogesh Tyagi did not respond to requests for a comment on the matter.“For a large university, such as DU, an online examination system is not viable. The university neither has the infrastructure nor the capability of providing/ensuring a level playing field in terms of accessibility and ease to the diverse student population it caters to,” DUTA president Rajib Ray had said then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-teachers-against-online-tests-propose-rescheduling-of-exams-after-lockdown-is-lifted/story-WslUYHv4ooRTm4iCOT0YvI.html
22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Capt writes to PM, seeks fiscal package for power sector||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday asked PM Narendra Modi for a financial package for the power sector, while suggesting measures to rescue the PSPCL and other firms from the current crisis and ensure that consumers are not harassed or hassled in difficult times.In a letter written to the PM, Captain said the Power Finance Corporation (PFC), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) Limited and other financial institutions should provide loans to power sector at 6% per annum for bridging the revenue gap.He even sought an extension of the RBI moratorium on repayment of outstanding loans and interest from the current three to at least six months. In addition, the applicable interest rate on deferred payment should be considered at a concessional rate, he said.The CM demanded that the advice issued by the Union ministry of power to CPSUs/Gencos/Transcos not to use coercive measures to recover dues and continue supply/transmission of electricity being an essential service should be extended to at least six months.He demanded reduction in coal prices, waiver of GST on coal and railway freight for FY 2020-21, waiver of capacity/fixed charges payable on account of capacity not scheduled due to load crash as well as 50% reduction in inter-state transmission charges for FY 2020-21 or at least six months.He further called for maximum limit of 6% per annum on late payment surcharge on delayed payments to generators and transmission licensees for the year 2020-21.In a letter to the PM, the CM also sought reduction in renewable purchase obligation (RPO) for the previous and current fiscal, and withdrawal of must run status for renewable energy power projects for FY 2020-21, or at least the next six months so that low cost power from alternate sources can be supplied.“Alternatively all renewable energy power generators may be given option to supply power at weighted average variable cost of power purchased from conventional sources of power during the month,” he added.Asserting that his government is committed to providing uninterrupted power supply to people of Punjab, Captain said the entire workforce of power sector is currently mobilised round-the-clock. However, due to lockdown, communities, business and consumers are facing economic hardship and are unable to pay their dues to the PSPCL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-writes-to-pm-seeks-fiscal-package-for-power-sector/story-tlCN1Z0OcPkPxaVjxAukTN.html

22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Labourers using Mughal Road to sneak out of Kashmir quarantined||Tip-toeing out of Kashmir, labourers hailing from Poonch and Rajouri districts have started using the Mughal Road route to reach their homes amid the lockdown.Earlier on April 12, a prominent hotelier from Kashmir along with an influential person escaped a red zone in Jammu to reach Srinagar in their official car, covering a distance of around 270km.“These labourers belong to the remote villages of Rajouri and Poonch districts. They come to the valley in search of temporary jobs and most of them end up working in the north Kashmir area. Ever since the lockdown was imposed, they have been desperate to go home as there is no work left to do. So, they are now sneaking out of Kashmir through the old highway – Mughal Road – to get home,” said a deputy commissioner from Kashmir requesting anonymity.He informed that these labourers skip at least six check posts by using the Mughal Road.“But the seventh check post near Pir Ki Gali is indispensable and they are caught there. The other day, 26 such labourers had escaped from Kashmir, used the Chor Ki Gali route, but were quarantined in Poonch. On Wednesday, nine traversing the Mughal Road were quarantined in Rajouri,” he said.Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said nine casual labourers travelling from Srinagar through Mughal Road were stranded near Thanamandi and later rescued by the army.“After carrying out identification, their preliminary medical screening was done in association with the civil administration. These individuals were also provided with basic amenities and later shifted to a quarantine facility,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/labourers-using-mughal-road-to-sneak-out-of-kashmir-quarantined/story-GYhfZbmspZ3hWaCdZyMyxN.html

State public health minister Rajesh Tope, accompanied the team headed by Manoj Joshi, additional secretary, Union ministry of food processing industries, to Dharavi.Tope said that the central team had advised increasing both testing and quarantine facilities in the congested slums. “I have personally told [BMC] commissioner Praveen Pardeshi that quarantine facilities in the area should be increased. We will increase the facility to 2,000 beds. We’ll put up tents, if required, to quarantine people,” Tope said.Dharavi on Wednesday recorded nine more Covid-19 cases taking the tally in the area to 189 positive cases. The area has recorded 12 deaths so far. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities said that around 40,000 people from the congested slums have been screened in the last seven days. The area has been divided into five containment zones. Tope added that the containment strategy has been “mostly successful” and the cases are not increasing in the area.Rahul Shewale, Shiv Sena MP from the area, said, the team also advised setting up an independent testing facility for Dharavi. However, the BMC has not decided on having a separate testing facility.Tope, however, said that the BMC would start the stricter implementation of protocols. “Testing will also be increased in the area,” he said.The central team lauded the measures adopted by the state government in Dharavi, but expressed concern over an imminent spike in the number of cases, said a senior BMC official. “The team expects that the spike in the number of new cases could occur anytime soon,” the senior official added. The officer said that the team suggested that there should be 10 quarantine beds for every 1,000 people in Dharavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-team-visits-dharavi-advises-to-improve-testing-add-quarantine-facilities/story-I1lIIlIiBuzwlOUtta2XVJ.html

At this time, all money lenders and financers are also facing a crisis. I, along with my family members, have been in quarantine and don’t know what condition my mother is in. I wish the hospital releases her soon,” he said.He said his mother had developed symptoms of Covid-19 on March 18 and he had taken her to a local government facility. “She was unable to breath and had cough and fever but as she did not have a travel history, the doctors said she could not be suffering from Covid-19,” he said, adding that the hospital then referred her to a private hospital. Naresh said that he then took her to Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H), where she tested positive for the virus.CMCH, meanwhile, maintained that the hospital has discharged the woman as she has fully recovered. DC FIXES RATESLater in the evening, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal issued a statement that as per Union government directions, no private health facility can charge more than the rates of specified under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). He warned of strict action against those hospitals violating these directions.Dr Vineeth Jaison, in-charge of the Covid-19 facility at CMCH, stated that they had received the direction from the government following which they revised the bill. “The revised bill now stands at Rs 3.62 lakh.

Kinnaur deputy commissioner Gopal Chand had issued emergency services interstate curfew pass to Sakshi Rana and Sahil Rana on April 13 which was valid up to April 14.“As per the SP, his cousin was murdered in Parwanoo, so his children were brought from Delhi on emergency pass (on condition of death of close relative) on April 13 and they were residing in Karol Bagh in Delhi, which is not a red zone,” said Shimla SP Kushal Chand Sharma, who is the spokesperson for the police headquarters.Apparently, the permission was granted to the Kinnaur SP a month after the said relative was murdered on March 18 in Parwanoo. Sharma added that the director general of police (DGP) has sought a detailed report from SP Rana. “His two children and both the driver and gunman who were travelling along with them, have been quarantined,” he said.The Kinnaur SP’s action has drawn flak from opposition parties and leaders.“It has been learnt that the SP’s cousin had died on March 18 and his last rites were performed at Sarkaghat, Mandi, so the reasons ascribed by him are not valid,” alleged Umesh Negi, block president of Kinnaur Congress committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-dgp-seeks-clarification-from-kinnaur-sp-over-family-s-travel-amid-lockdown/story-47mXvKClJAx5q3GU06B5KO.html

Of these, nearly 400 students are from Arunachal Pradesh.Subdivisional magistrate of Dera Bassi Kuldeep Bawa said there are around 52 students from Arunachal Pradesh stranded in our subdivision. “On Tuesday evening, we roped in Domino’s and distributed pizzas among all 52 students from the state. We are regularly providing them with essential items at their doorsteps.”Ringu Mama, a student from Arunachal Pradesh studying in a Kharar college, said, “We are a group of 21 from the same state. The district administration is helping us regularly with dry ration and whenever we are in need of something, we call them and within no time, we get all the essential things.”Another student from Arunachal Pradesh, Jangala Yangga, studying in a college near Banur, said, “The administration and college authorities are providing us all help and we are really feeling at home.”Meanwhile, Kharar SDM Himanshu Jain said, “Whenever we get requests from Northeast students, we provide them with essential goods.

22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Amid curfew, testing times for Chandigarh’s coaching centres||Often compared to Rajasthan’s Kota, Chandigarh with its 70-odd coaching institutes is catering to the dreams and aspirations of over 20,000 students flocking here from all across the region to train for competitive exams. But, within one month of the nationwide lockdown amid the coronavirus outbreak, the coaching institutes are finding it hard to sustain themselves.“If the lockdown is prolonged, there will be no classroom admissions this year. This will impact our revenue greatly and it will be difficult to maintain infrastructure and salary of the employees,” said Arvind Goyal, a NEET trainer based in the city, adding that at this time of the year, new batches are finalised and classes are running in full swing.Apart from Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering and architecture colleges, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical colleges, Chandigarh also offers training in exams for banking, civil services, Combined Defence Services (CDS), National Defence Academy (NDA) and Services Selection Board (all three for the armed forces), Combined Admission Test (CAT) for graduate management programmes, Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) for science and engineering courses, International English Language Testing System (IELTS) for international studies, work or migration, and Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) for admission in English-speaking institutes abroad.Vinay Makin of Allen Career Institute, Sector 34, said, “Although the landlords have given us relaxation in rent payment, which is ₹45 lakh per month for our Sector 34 centre, most coaching institutes still have to pay the full rent, which is ostensibly a Herculean task.”While there are fewer enrolments due to the lockdown, Makin said they had offered students the option to pay fees in more instalments. “Normally, students pay their fees on a quarterly basis, but now we have broken it down further,” he added.STAFF SALARIES SLASHED, DELAYEDThe economic impact of the coaching institutes’ closure has also trickled down to the tutors.“For March, I was paid ₹34,000 against my salary of ₹50,000. I am told, the arrears will be cleared when the lockdown is over,” said a tutor, requesting anonymity.She said as a permanent employee, she was fortunate to be still receiving her salary, while the contractual and third-party staff were not being paid at all.“Our hands are tied in the absence of students’ fee,” said Kuldeep Singh of Zetta Career Institute, Sector 34, while accepting they had problems paying salaries even in March. LIVELIHOOD OF MANY AT STAKE Not just teachers, several others dependent on coaching institutes to make a living have also been left in the lurch. In Sector 34, numerous booksellers, stationery shops, fast food joints and paying guest accommodations thrive on coaching institutes year long. Sumant Kumar, who has been running a food stall in Sector 34 for a decade, said, “These are unprecedented times. Our shops have been closed for over a month. How will my family survive if the lockdown continues?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-curfew-testing-times-for-chandigarh-s-coaching-centres/story-2W6i360NsbsPkucymFZKsJ.html

It is not like as soon as shops open, we will start earning.”“We have to cater to the need of our employees and their families too and ensure that they do not go without food. It is our moral responsibility in this hour of need,” says Kuldeep Singh, who runs a stationery shop in the city, adding that traders are helping their staff by paying them money as well as providing ration.“We are not getting any help and our earnings are zero, but still we are paying our employees. The monthly instalments are being deducted and we have to pay the bills as well. The survival will become difficult for traders as well as their employees if the government does not give us some concessions,” says Rajpal Chaudhary, who is into the sport goods business.To safeguard interests of the business community, the Mohali Beopar Mandal, which has 500 members, has submitted a representation seeking tax waivers.“We request the government to waive property tax (on rent and individual) for all commercial properties this fiscal besides waiving electricity and water bills for the next three months to help the business community survive this tough period,” says Vineet Verma, president of the body, adding that in Mohali alone Rs 17 crore is collected as property tax from traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-traders-seek-waivers-to-tide-over-covid-19-lockdown/story-WesJJ09o6SWApnUTBWSYBM.html

22-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records cleanest air day for first time this year||The air quality index (AQI) was ‘good’ for the first time this year in Mumbai on Wednesday, which also happened to be the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the pollutant-measuring indicator AQI for PM 2.5 was 46, making it the cleanest air day so far this year and lowest pollution levels during lockdown. Prior to this, Mumbai had recorded its lowest air pollution levels with an AQI of 61 on Monday, 63 on Tuesday, and 65 on March 22 (Janta Curfew day), all falling under the ‘satisfactory’ category.SAFAR categorises AQI for pollutants in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.Eight of 10 locations in Mumbai, where SAFAR monitors air quality, recorded ‘good’ AQI levels. While Mazgaon had the cleanest air in the city with an AQI of 18 followed by Colaba 32, Navi Mumbai had comparatively worse air quality at 75 followed by Malad 58, both ‘satisfactory’ levels.Researchers said that the changing weather factors were responsible for the improvement in air quality. “Wednesday’s AQI is the optimal air quality Mumbai should be recording during lockdown when external emissions are minimal. However, over the past three weeks, we observed that owing to rising temperatures or late setting in of sea breeze, the wind pattern allowed dust and other pollutant particles to settle close to the surface,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.The day temperature over Mumbai witnessed a sharp drop from Monday’s high of 37.8 degrees Celsius to 34.3 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, and even the minimum temperature on Wednesday was close to the normal mark. Humidity levels were high with 92% in south Mumbai and 74% in the suburbs. “The drop in temperature, high moisture content and early setting in of sea breeze allowed pollutant concentration to reduce significantly on Wednesday,” said Beig. “The drop in pollution however maybe temporary due to fluctuating weather and rising temperatures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-cleanest-air-day-for-first-time-this-year/story-0RC4jZlrO46QIwHUsvjWOI.html

22-04-2020||Chandigarh||PSPCL’s decision to extend power bill payment date evokes mixed response||The decision of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to extend the date for paying power bills by domestic and commercial consumers without penalty up to May 10 has evoked a mixed response among Ludhiana residents.While some people have welcomed the decision, others said the department should have extended the date further.Navneet Singh, a fitness trainer, who runs a gym near Lodhi Club, said, “The announcement is only a partial relief for me in view of other bills, EMIs, monthly rent of the gym. The monthly electricity bill of my gym alone is Rs 1 lakh. But, I can afford to pay all the bills only after the lockdown ends and the gym becomes operational.”Chanchal Matta, a social worker, said, “The relaxation will help only those who can afford to pay the bills in spite of lockdown. Some people, especially those in the unorganised sector, are struggling to manage the three meals. How can the government expect the people to clear the bills right now? People can live without electricity, but not without food. The relaxation could have helped, had it been till June or July.”Lakhvir Kaur, a housewife in Model Town Extension, welcoming the relaxation, said, “My husband owns a small footwear shop, that has been shut for over a month. We are living on our savings these days. Even a smallest relaxation announced by the government at this time is a great relief.”However, industrialists in the city have different views on the relaxation.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), said, “Even after the lockdown, industry will take another month to be back on track and will not be able to pay the bills even without the surcharge by May 10.”“The PSPCL is sending average bills. But, we are yet to receive interest on advance consumption deposit (ACD) charges, that is due this month from the department. The government cannot expect the industries to get back on the track in just seven days after the lockdown is over. We need at least a month to restart all the operations and pay the due bills,” added Kular.THE RELAXATION CIRCULARIn the circular, issued on April 21, the PSPCL has extended the due date of electricity bills of domestic and commercial consumers with monthly or bimonthly bills up to Rs 1 lakh payable from March 20 to May 10 without surcharge.Further, 1% rebate has also been offered to all categories of consumers on the amount deposited by them through online digital modes between April 21 to 30. The rebate is also being offered to consumers who have made advance payment of their bills. The circular adds the decision has been taken in view of the hardships faced by the people on account of extension of curfew up to May 3 due to Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pspcl-s-decision-to-extend-power-bill-payment-date-evokes-mixed-response/story-43agy4koMP2XgiJzplQCGP.html

He said social distancing must be ensured while carrying out any activity, anywhere and added that food being cooked in community kitchens must be checked.The chief minister said private hospitals not following instructions for safety and spreading infection must be sealed. He said a state government medical officer should survey all private medical colleges and private hospitals and adequate precaution should be taken to check spread of infection there. Yogi said testing capacity of laboratories should be increased and a testing lab should be set up at all divisional headquarters. He said work for medical tests should be carried out at a faster pace and training should be imparted to technicians for the purpose.The chief minister said equipment for medical tests should be kept in good condition and arrangements for oxygen should be made at every bed. A ventilator should be made available for every 10 beds in a hospital, he said.He said 77 per cent of crop has been harvested and this was for the first time that no problem was there about availability of workers for harvesting.

22-04-2020||Mumbai||Policemen fighting COVID-19 need rewards, not salary cuts, says PIL challenging Maharashtra govt||Maharashtra government’s decision to defer the payment of salaries of state police personnel falling under class I, II and III of state employees, has been challenged in the Bombay High Court by a group of lawyers.The lawyers have filed a public interest litigation stating that the salaries of police officers, in the front line of battle against Covid-19 pandemic, should not be deferred and they should instead be rewarded with additional risk and hardship allowance for their services. The petition also says that the cops should be provided with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) like doctors and medical staff involved in Covid-19 duty.The PIL filed by advocates Tosif Shaikh, Kranti Sahane, Swapnil Girme, Satish Gaikwad, Kedar Milwala, Ganesh Gupta, Brajesh Kumar and Suraj Jadhav, challenges state government’s April 1 resolution, which proposes the deferment of 50 per cent salary for class I and II state government officers and 25 per cent salary for class III officers.The PIL questions the logic of withholding the pay of police officials engaged in fighting the pandemic when they should be rewarded as encouragement. The PIL states that the state police officers and constables should be provided risk and hardship allowances similar to what has been done abroad.The PIL states that many countries have implemented the payment of risk and hardship allowance to COVID warriors but the same is yet to be adopted in India.Shaikh said the policemen are risking their lives and working round the clock, just like the doctors and medical staff, and since they are the sole breadwinners in their families, deferred payment of salary will adversely impact them. Hence, the PIL argues, the ‘GR is arbitrary’ and should be set aside.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe PIL also seeks directions to the government to provide PPE kits, masks, gloves and sanitisers to police personnel as it will ensure their safety and also boost their morale.The PIL is expected to be mentioned on Thursday before the bench of justice S J Kathawalla. Maharashtra, along with several other states, had announced the deferment of salary for government staff citing a strain on government resources due to coronavirus containment efforts and drying up of revenue streams.

The father, a resident of Bandra, was arrested on February 3, on the complaint of his 13-year-old daughter for alleged sexual abuse by the Bandra police. The accused has been lodged in jail so far and recently sought bail pleading that he has been falsely implicated by his wife. The court refused to accept the defence that the case was lodged under the influence of the accused’s wife who left him.The father has pleaded that his wife was residing with another person. He claimed that the case was filed at the behest of her as he alleged that his wife wanted custody of their kids.Meanwhile, the prosecution claimed that the victim has been residing with the accused even after his wife left him. On February 3, the victim approached the police with the complaint of sexual abuse by the accused and was taken for medical examination.The public prosecutor Geeta Nayyer argued that the victim gave specific details of sexual abuse by the accused which also was supported by the medical report.Considering the circumstances, the court observed that, there are serious allegations of penetrative sexual assault on his daughter. “It would not be just and proper to release the accused on bail. Considering the relations between the accused, victim and the witnesses, the possibility of influencing them cannot be ruled out,” the court held while rejecting the bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pocso-court-refuses-bail-to-father-who-sexually-abused-daughter/story-K21SdvXuXZCpMyhru8RnEP.html

22-04-2020||Mumbai||Marriage certificate issued without rituals null and void: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday declared a certificate of registration of marriage obtained by a Thane resident and his partner as null and void, as it was obtained without performing any marriage rites. The Thane resident had moved HC after the family court in the district had rejected his petition on November 16, 2017, to declare the marriage as invalid. The man fell in love with one of his colleagues at a gymnasium where he worked. They wanted to get married but were apprehensive of their families not approving. To convince their families, they obtained a marriage certificate from a local mandal of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) on September 29, 2016, declaring that they married on July 18, 2016. But when the woman disclosed this to her parents, they forced her to lodge a police complaint, alleging that she was abducted by the Thane resident and her signatures were forcibly obtained on certain papers. She then lodged a complaint and on its basis, Rajaram police station in Ratnagiri registered an offence against the man and some others.The parties later settled the matter amicably.The Thane resident moved the family court and eventually approached HC after the family court refused to entertain his plea saying it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition. The family court stated that its jurisdiction can be invoked only if someone was married as per law.The HC, however, held that the family court was not justified in rejecting the petition.It said under section 7(1) of the Family Court’s Act a suit or proceeding for declaration as to validity of a marriage or as to matrimonial status of any person is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the family court. “The respondent woman (his purported wife) has not disputed these facts,” said the HC bench, adding, “She is not opposing the prayers made before the family court at all. The family court was not justified in dismissing the petition filed by the appellant on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.”The HC then declared the marriage as null and void.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/marriage-certificate-issued-without-rituals-null-and-void-hc/story-A5rv9IZa9v8yGSlCXej8OM.html

From identifying the best university and best-suited courses, taking tests online, filling up several college applications and applying for the visas, students feel disheartened as the effort and time devoted by them to the lengthy process has gone for a toss all of a sudden. A Delhi-resident and fashion enthusiast, Priya Goel, who had applied to several fashion and designs universities in Italy for her bachelor’s degree was looking forward to the new session from October, shares her plight and says, “I was always keen on studying at one of the premier fashion and design colleges and had applied to a couple of them in Italy. But now, I’m unsure of going overseas for my degree and don’t even think my family will agree now. I also have no clue yet about whether the money spent on the applications will be reversed or not, or whether we’ll be given a choice of opting for online classes but spending so much amount for a distance learning course will not make sense.”Italy being synonymous with rich art, design and culture and the hub of world’s greatest fashion labels is one of the preferred destinations by Indian students to pursue a career in fashion. Another student, Tripti Rughwani pursuing masters in fashion styling, photography and film in Italy decided to return to India before the situation got worse. She states, “In the last week of February, our school sent a mail stating classes have suspended and the school will not host any activities for a week. So we measured the situation and our parents decided us to call us back home.”For Rughwani, her third semester classes have begun online and will go on till June. She says, “A lot of students were agitated and requested university to not begin the third semester because our course is a very practical one and requires hands-on experience. But we have got a mail from college saying that they will compensate for the practical classes but nothing is confirmed. It’s just a ray of hope so that way we don’t lose out on the opportunities we paid for.” She also says, “Our student visas are valid till October because from June onwards, we were supposed to have an internship/job period but we [international students] haven’t been informed about visas yet.So, will the pandemic witness a dip in students applying at international universities due to no clear information by universities? Aradhana Khaitan Mahna, founder and managing director, Manya Education Pvt. Ltd., that offers study abroad services, says, “Right now, nobody is saying anything. There is certainly 20% of the students who are either dropping or deferring their plans to next year, another 10-15% are stating that they’re still confused but remaining say that they’re still on track. We have been talking to them regularly. On the other hand, universities are also saying that there’s nothing that has changed and they look forward to welcoming students for Fall in August/September. Of course, the summer sessions and intakes have moved online. But worst case we expect that depending on how things span out, may be the fall semester will move online but after that it should be back to normal. But right now, there’s no confirmed news.” However, some education consultants also state that the demand for international courses is still on the rise particularly due to lack courses choices and specialisation. A Delhi-based education consultant informs that although they’re still getting requests from students to study in Europe, “but some universities have postponed the admissions to next year 2021 because of the pandemic and also extended deadlines for application submissions to ease out the process for students”, he says.Interact with author/sanchita_kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/coronavirus-pandemic-forces-students-to-put-their-study-abroad-dreams-on-hold/story-C2ZgnSjUdxYCpbeVkl8cUM.html

With donations in cash and kind drying up and stocks rapidly depleting, the home, which is located in Jammu’s Channi Rama area, eyes the future uncertainly. Set up in 1975, Balgran had received a national award for child welfare in 1999. Today, it houses 122 children.Balgran president AK Khajuria says, “We have 122 children, of which 37 are girls. Most of them have been orphaned due to terrorism, natural calamities and other factors, while some have a single parent. They belong to the most disadvantaged sections of society.”“Being a charitable home, we largely run on local donations in cash and kind but due to lockdown people are not able to reach us. Therefore, our donations have reduced drastically and our stocks are depleting rapidly,” said Khajuria.The home provides free boarding, lodging, food and education to children aged 5 to 22 years till they become independent.“We have written to the social welfare department requesting them to help us in these trying times. The director of the social welfare department had visited us on Tuesday and brought two quintals of flour but we need cereals, pulses, edible oils, vegetables and other items to sustain ourselves during this lockdown. We use 25kg of flour everyday,” he said.While Balgran’s annual expenditure is ₹65 lakh, the government only provides it with ₹4 lakh per annum, an amount which was recently revised from ₹1.50- ₹2 lakh per year.“We provide these children with food, clothes, uniforms, books, medicines and conduct routine health check-ups. We also have to pay around ₹1.6 lakh per month to around 15 employees,” he said.The school has around 12 teachers while a few others work voluntarily.Balgran’s school ‘Bal Bharti’ teaches students till Class 10. They are then sent to government institutions for further education.“Balgran, also has ward mothers, who remain with the young students all the time to provide them with emotional support. The younger students need help to eat, change, bathe and get ready for school. The ward mothers ensure that the children get motherly care,” said Khajuria.Our first priority is to adopt orphaned children, who have nobody to look after them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-makes-life-difficult-for-122-destitute-children-at-balgran-in-jammu/story-sDbuZHSAKCn1iTJPngvJAL.html

Surprisingly, she tested positive. The source of the infection is not yet known,” Dr Kumar said. He said that the contact tracing of medics who attended to the patient in the past 13 days is being done. They will all be tested and have been quarantined.With this, a total of three cases of novel coronavirus have been reported from Kapurthala district, including a youngster from Kot Karaar Khan village who has been cured of the infection. Kapurthala civil surgeon Dr Jasmit Kaur Bawa said that the baby was admitted at civil hospital, Phagwara, with a heart problem and was referred to a private hospital in Ludhiana that further sent her to PGIMER, Chandigarh, where she tested positive.Doaba region of Punjab has reported 82 cases of Covid-19 so far, including two deaths. Jalandhar reported 53 coronavirus cases, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar 19 cases, seven in Hoshiarpur and three in Kapurthala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-month-old-girl-from-punjab-s-phagwara-with-congenital-heart-defect-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-beFA0IVaLTvPMbe7VyUmXL.html

As reported by HT, roughly two-thirds of all Covid-19 cases in 10 major states comprise people who did not show any symptoms at the time of testing, according to state government data.This has reinforced growing evidence that “silent spreaders” were possibly unknowingly infecting others, and underlined the need for extensive testing to isolate such patients.In Maharashtra, 62 per cent or 1,890 cases of the 3,054 Covid-19 positives as of April 20 10 pm were asymptomatic, according to state health department.Dr Ajit Kulkarni, pulmonologist with Sahyadri hospital said it is herculean task now for the authorities to detect the asymptomatic carriers since they may spread the infection to the less immune and susceptible patient.“Testing of not only close contacts but rampant and random testing of large samples in not only red zones but orange and green zones too should be done because once the lockdown is lifted or even during the lockdown one may infect others who are susceptible. Random testing will help in understanding the spread of the virus in that community,” he said.Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 in the district said, “There are flu clinics set up at PMC, PCMC and rural areas where anyone showing any flu like symptoms can come. “With regards to asymptomatic patients, only close contacts of a positive patient are tested. Maybe with the new Rapid testing kits we can go for sample testing and random testing of people in high risk areas will help determine the spread of the virus in the area,” said Nandapurkar. According to the district administration, health staff has been instructed to carry out random testing especially from high risk areas.“We are testing around 350-700 samples daily which involved random testing too. In our testing, most positive patients were found either through flu clinics or home surveillance. Only people with symptoms are reporting to the clinics or are tested currently but we are also doing screening of asymptomatic contacts in high risk areas. We are yet to get the guidelines for the rapid testing kits from the government and based on that we can take a call on mass random testing in large outbreak areas,” said district collector Naval Kishore Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/69-covid-19-positive-cases-in-pune-asymptomatic-health-authorities/story-FVqWSw9ldmMsceK2RBQesK.html

22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Kangra administration takes on Covid-19 with a dash of humour||The Kangra administration has gone about sensitising the masses about the spread of the novel coronavirus in a creative manner.The administration is using humorous posters using relatable tropes to underline the importance of social distancing amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.The hilarious posters posted on the official Facebook page of the Kangra deputy commissioner have drawn a lot of attention and have been widely circulated.The poster put up on Wednesday depicts a woman singing the Bollywood number “Mera piya ghar aaya o Ramji’ from the film Yaarana, upon seeing her husband return home.The message on it reads: “Agar aapke piya ke saath corona aa gaya to Ramji bhi aapko nahi bacha paynege. Janha hain vanhi rahein, sabhi ke jivan ka bachao karein.” (If Corona comes with your husband, even Lord Rama won’t be able to save you. Stay where you are and save everyone’s lives).Similarly, the poster shared on Tuesday depicts a marriage ceremony with a message reading: “Kundliyan milate-milate kanhi korana na mil jaye. Durghatna se dair bhali” (While matching your horoscopes you may get infected with Covid-19. It’s better late than never).Another poster, inspired by the iconic film Sholay movie asks “Kitne aadmi they?” to convey that a single infected person could easily spread the virus among the masses.Additional deputy commissioner Raghav Sharma, the brainchild behind the witty posters, said the posters were acting as a stress buster while underlining the gravity of the situation.“No one had ever seen a global lockdown and confinement to homes has increased anxiety and the feeling of alienation,” said Sharma.“Such messages may also have a greater recall value,”the ADC said, adding that the posters are based on things that are happening around us like some people solemnising marriages despite the pandemic and others sneaking into the state in an attempt to reach their homes despite curfew.“The ideas for the daily posters are the collective efforts of our team and a friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, has volunteered to design the artwork,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kangra-administration-takes-on-covid-19-with-a-dash-of-humour/story-QRL3vcyHbXS4dZ9o8W9azO.html
22-04-2020||Education||Jadavpur University students developing app to disseminate genuine info on Covid-19||To combat misinformation on novel coronavirus, students of the Jadavpur University here are in the process of developing a mobile application to disseminate genuine data related to COVID-19, an educator of the institute said on Wednesday.The ‘infobank’ will contain all verifiable and accurate information on the disease, the teacher associated with the university’s Innovation Council said.“A lot of misinformation on novel coronavirus is being spread, ranging from its origin to symptoms and means of transmission. This unnecessarily creates panic and confusion among the people. The infobank will dispel all wrong information,” the educator told PTI.The process of creating the infobank began at an all- India hackathon organised by the computer science department of the university wherein students had presented the concept at a time when the disease had just marked its footprint in India, he said.“As the concept generated enthusiasm among the organisers and participants of the event, we asked the students to work on it and later make a prototype,” the teacher said.However, work on the prototype got delayed as classes were suspended and hostels vacated in the wake of the lockdown, he said.Eight final year post-graduate students of the computer science department are currently working on the project from their homes under the supervision of teachers, the teacher said.“Once the classes resume and the laboratory reopens, we will be able to get more real-time data for the application from hospitals treating COVID-19 patients and laboratories testing samples of people suspected to be infected with the disease,” he said.Though the application will not detect fake news on COVID-19, it will help the user distinguish authentic information from misinformation as it will contain only genuine data, the educator said.“We will keep updating the application as there will be more research on the disease in future,” he said.The teacher said the application, in future, will also contain information on ways to cope with outbreaks of infectious diseases as well as natural calamities or man-made disasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/jadavpur-university-students-developing-app-to-disseminate-genuine-info-on-covid-19/story-m89QFLcmH9Vxp4XR3KpbEI.html

On April 6, 2018, Anushkha had given birth to three cubs but one of them had died after six months due to multiple organ failure. The cub had been named as Parwat and it was a melanistic tigress, which is also known as black tiger.Mallik and Anushka had been brought from Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad in March 2016.Anushka gave birth to three cubs on April 18. The all three cubs are in good health. “The tigress is showing normal maternal care patterns and the cubs are in good health,” said zoo veterinarian Dr Ajay Kumar.The zoo officials have been asked to avoid unnecessary chaos and provide good ambience to the newly born cubs. With births three new cubs, tiger population at the zoo has gone up to 10. With first successful breeding in 2018, the Birsa zoo authority set up a breeding cell attached with nursery, which was completed in 2019.Kumar said tiger breeding in captivity is critical, as the species do not want any interference in their ambience.The zoo is currently closed for the visitors due to lockdown. Even if zoo is reopened after lockdown, the cubs will not be available for public viewing for at least three months. A video display will be installed at the zoo for the visitors to view the cubs.Birsa zoo witnessed breeding of tigers for third time since its inception in 1994. In 2011, tigress Durga had given birth to three cubs. However, all three died within a week of their births.The zoo authority has taken extra precautionary measures to ensure healthy atmosphere for the cubs. “No one is allowed to enter the tigress’ cage. The cubs were kept in nursery and their health and activities are being monitored through CCTV cameras installed there,” Kumar said.Kumar said vaccination to the cubs would be started after three months. “The mother tigress is feeding well to all three cubs.

22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Haryana ramps up pool testing||Haryana has gone big on sample pooling, testing 2,348 samples in the last seven days, thus increasing the lab capacity to screen samples using molecular testing for Covid-19. The pool-tested samples account for more than 27% of the total samples tested in the last seven days.The virology lab of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak started pool sampling on April 14 with 229 samples. Since then, it has consistently tested pooled samples in the range of 220 to 494.According to Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), a pooled testing algorithm involves real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test (rRT-PCR) screening of a specimen pool comprising multiple individual patient specimens.If a pool sample tested negative, it means no individual testing and substantial cost savings. If only a pool sample is tested positive, then all the individual samples are to be tested separately.Nodal officer for Covid-19 at PGIMS, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, said with pool sampling and arrival of new testing machines, they would be able to scale up the testing up to 5,000 samples per day. The chief secretary has given us a target of testing 10,000 samples per day by enhancing our testing capability, he added. Professor Paramjeet Singh Gill, in-charge of virology lab at PGIMS, said the pool testing can be done only where incidence of infection is less than 2% in populations. “We are pooling three samples for testing, though the ICMR has recommended pooling five samples. But since we got good results by pooling three samples, we are continuing with it,” Prof Gill said.He said out of 2,348 pooled samples tested by the virology laboratory at PGIMS, only 17 have turned out to be positive for coronavirus.Senior health officials said the pool sampling will significantly enhance the capability to test more as is evident by the big surge in total sampling (individual as well as pool) from 6,163 on April 14 to 14,562 on April 21.As per health officials, pool sampling is recommended in the areas with low prevalence of infection. “In areas where 2 to 5% population is infected, sample pooling can be considered only in community survey or surveillance among asymptomatic individuals, strictly excluding pooling samples of individuals having known contact with confirmed cases and health workers in direct contact with care of coronavirus positive patients.

22-04-2020||Noida||Bedlam at Gzb border after closure, Noida also sealed to curb Covid-19 infections||Hundreds of people, including those involved in essential services, were stuck on the border with Delhi on Tuesday morning after the Ghaziabad district magistrate (DM) issued an order to seal all borders to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Gautam Budh Nagar too followed suit on Tuesday evening, and sealed its borders with the national capital, claiming that those who travel to and from Delhi were more susceptible to the virus. The order was issued under the National Disaster Act 2005 and came in force with immediate effects. “The order has been passed to contain the spread of Covid-19. People involved in essential services will be provided passes by the concerned officials,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.According to data released by the district’s health department on Tuesday, three Noida patients contracted the disease in Delhi, and are under treated there. The escalating situation on Tuesday forced Ghaziabad DM Ajay Shankar Pandey to go to the border, accompanied by police officers, on Tuesday afternoon.Pandey had issued the closure direction late on Monday, under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, prohibiting any travel between Ghaziabad and the national capital.The order came after at least six people in Ghaziabad, who health and district officials said had travelled to Delhi, tested positive for Covid-19.However, as a result of the directions on Monday night, hundreds of commuters were left stranded at the borders for hours on Tuesday.Doctors, transport workers and bankers were among those stuck on either sides of the border after the police refused to allow their entry or exit.“I was headed home to Raj Nagar Extension [in Ghaziabad] after night duty from my hospital. I was stuck up at UP Gate border as the police did not allow entries. From 8.30am to 11am, I was stuck, like hundreds of other people in their vehicles,” a doctor from a Delhi government hospital designated as Covid-19 facility, said.“The police did not allow me to enter, despite my producing my duty pass and ID card,” the doctor added.“I had to call up my contacts, who contacted the Ghaziabad police, after which I was allowed to leave. But all this took me about three hours to enter into Ghaziabad. The police even told me that I should stay in Delhi. I have more duties lined up on Wednesday and don’t know whether I will be able to attend to these or not,” the doctor said.Bishambhar Dayal, an employee of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) from Sanjay Nagar in Ghaziabad, had to report for duty at 12.30pm on Tuesday and was headed to a depot at Sukhdev Vihar.“I came to the Kaushambi border, but the police did not allow me to go to Delhi. I showed them my ID card and my duty pass, but they still refused,” Dayal said.“I moved to UP Gate but the cops there too denied me passage to Delhi. So, I have informed my officers and went back home,” Dayal said.A number of ambulances carrying patients also got delayed at the border.Pradeep Jain, a senior officer working with a central public sector enterprise and resident of Ramprastha Greens in Ghaziabad’s Vaishali, said he would prefer to work from home rather than attending office in Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, if conditions at the border remained as they were on Tuesday.“I had to wait for two hours and many vehicles carrying essential items were stuck at UP Gate border. Tuesday was the second day when a few employees were directed to attend office. With these conditions prevailing, however, I would prefer to work from home,” he added.This happened despite the order stating that “people involved in essential supplies or valid pass holders will be allowed to move.”Senior government officials of the national capital told HT that the UP government did not communicate the decision to the Delhi government on time. Later in the day, to resolve the gridlock, the Delhi government sent a team of officers — led by east Delhi district magistrate Arun Kumar Mishra, to meet his Ghaziabad counterpart.The Delhi Police also apprised Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief secretary Vijay Dev about the condition at the border. Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar on Tuesday said the “sudden” restriction by the Ghaziabad administration had led to the severe snarls at the borders.“Senior police officers from both Ghaziabad and Delhi came to the border. We are also in touch with the Uttar Pradesh administration to ease the situation as soon as possible,” Kumar said.A Delhi Police officer deployed at the border said they deployed eight companies (around 70 personnel) at the border.The Ghaziabad police, however, claimed no one working or involved in providing essential services was stopped.“People who are not attached to any essential services are not allowed to travel to Delhi. However, while there may have been some hiccups, those attached to essential services are not being stopped,” Anshu Jain, circle officer, Indirapuram, said.The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration also meanwhile said all workers involved in essential services would have to get passes issued from the authorities concerned, in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, to travel between the states. However, officials said the district chief medical officer will issue a list of medical professionals to the police, to ensure they are not stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bedlam-at-gzb-border-after-closure-noida-also-sealed-to-curb-infections/story-fOA4FdWutWP3lql5R2ZFzN.html

22-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai bus conductor runs 21 km to report to work||Devidas Jaisingh Rathod, 55, is an employee of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). He lives in Manor, 100 km north of Mumbai. He is a conductor on a bus that runs every day from Palghar, 21 km from his home, to the central Mumbai bus depot, Dadar. These days, he is in charge of a bus that has an important job -- ferrying 25 doctors and nurses to KEM Hospital. He usually hitches a ride on trucks ferrying essentials that pass by Manor. They drop him off at Palghar. On Sunday, though, there were no trucks. So, he ran. “I could not let them down as the doctors and nurses are treating Covid-19 patients and they are my daily passengers,” said Rathod.It helped that he loves running. He runs every morning before going to work and has taken part in several marathons — both full and half. “I did not wear my uniform and kept it in a bag. I told my wife, Usha, to give me extra water bottles mixed with glucose, just to keep me hydrated. Then, wearing shorts and vests, I began to run,” he said. Upon reaching Palghar depot, he quickly freshened up and the bus, with the medical personnel, set off for Dadar. Deputy manager of Palghar depot, Nitin Chavan, later honoured Rathod in a small ceremony. Rathod reports for duty at the Palghar bus depot at 6am, his new duty time following the lockdown. The bus he is a conductor on goes from Palghar to Dadar, where KEM Hospital is situated. At 3pm, Rathod’s bus leaves Dadar and reaches Palghar at 5pm, after which he again hitches a ride to Manor.The pandemic has disrupted his daily running schedule. “Due to my emergency duty, my running practice is not possible but I will continue once the lockdown is lifted.” A commerce graduate with a conductor’s licence, Rathod joined MSRTC in 2003 after spotting an advertisement for conductors. “Even the recruitment officer was shocked. My qualification is too high for a conductor’s job, he said,” recalled Rathod. In the past, Rathod has worked as a daily wager. He and his wife, Usha, who works as a tailor, have four children: Sachin, 29, Priyanka, 27, Archana, 25, and Deepak, 21. Sachin works as a security guard and Deepak is studying printing. But the health care workers Rathod’s bus ferries everyday are likely to remind him more of his daughters. Priyanka has a post graduate degree in medicine from Nagpur University and Archana is a nurse at a civic hospital in Vakola.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bus-conductor-runs-21-km-to-report-to-work/story-Yd1bhOAAAFp0oxn60EfBlJ.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Constable posted at Maha CM’s official residence tests positive||A police constable posted at Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s official residence has tested positive for coronavirus, reports PTI quoting a state official.The constable who has been found to be Covid-19 positive was posted at ‘Varsha’, the official residence allotted to Maharashtra Chief Minister, however, Uddhav stays at ‘Matoshree’, which is his family house in Bandra.“A woman constable has tested positive for Covid-19. We have hospitalised her while contact-tracing is going on,” said a senior IAS official quoted by PTI.The agency on Tuesday also reported that a male constable posted at the official residence of the leader of the opposition and former state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, too, has tested positive.The male police constable was deployed at `Sagar’, which is the designated official residence for the leader of the opposition in the state assembly, said a senior official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation or the BMC.“He showed some symptoms on April 12 and was admitted to a hospital since April 14. His test report has come out positive. We have removed all other police officials posted there and quarantined them,” the BMC official quoted by the agency said.Maharashtra currently has 5218 coronavirus positive patients after 552 new cases emerged on Tuesday. 251 people in the state have died so far to the disease including 19 on Wednesday. 12 of those who succumbed on Wednesday are from Mumbai, three from Pune, two from Thane, and one each in Sangli and Pimpri Chinchwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-constable-posted-at-maha-cm-s-official-residence-tests-positive/story-tB4r0wJr5ZdX5JtXXWx8dN.html
22-04-2020||City||Rajpura declared as containment zone in Punjab||A day after the number of coronavirus patients in Rajpura town of the district rose to 12 with five fresh cases, the administration on Tuesday declared the town as a containment zone. Patiala deputy commissioner (DC) Kumar Amit also ordered screening of the entire population (around 2.5 lakh) of Rajpura, which is 25km from the district headquarters.The tally of positive cases in the district is now 31, with 19 cases reported from Patiala city so far. The health department has collected as many as 70 samples of primary contacts of the fresh five cases in Rajpura.On Tuesday, the DC chaired a high-level meeting of senior police and civil officials to draw a strategy to stop spread of infection in Rajpura. “The screening of the entire population of the town will be completed in next three days. All the entry and exits points of the city have been sealed to restrict movement of people,” the DC said.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mandeep Singh Sidhu said security has been beefed up across the town and stringent action will be taken against curfew violators.Meanwhile, Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said the reports of 19 samples taken from Rajpura came around 11pm on Monday.“The five people who tested positive are all contacts of earlier positive cases in the town,” he said. Dr Malhotra said among the latest cases, one is daughter-in-law of a 60-year-old woman, who was the first Covid-19 patient of the town. “Another one is a private doctor who attended the woman before she tested positive. We are identifying the contacts of the fresh patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rajpura-declared-as-containment-zone-in-punjab/story-03rhOvdmvDLz1qp5JkE4XK.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||Virus cases cross 5K, Maharashtra brings back curbs||In a repeat of Sunday’s grim record high, Maharashtra on Tuesday reported 552 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, taking the state’s tally past 5,000 to 5,218. With the number of cases soaring in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), the Maharashtra government on Tuesday issued an order reversing the relaxation provided in both areas. Of the new cases, 419 were recorded in Mumbai, taking the city’s tally to 3,451. The state also recorded 19 deaths on Tuesday, of which, 12 were in Mumbai, three in Pune, two in Thane and one each in Sangli and Pimpri-Chinchawad. The state’s death toll is 251. Meanwhile, even after receiving 75,000 rapid diagnostic kits to detect Covid-19 antibodies, Maharashtra may have to wait longer. The India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has instructed states that are conducting the tests to wait for two days until the council issues its revised policy for running the tests. According to senior Mantralaya bureaucrats, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was upset over the reports of crowding and traffic jams after the lockdown was relaxed on Monday, which prompted the state to reverse its orders. Thackeray, during his address via Facebook Live on Sunday, had indicated that the relaxation could be rolled back if people do not adhere to social distancing norms.The order issued by the state disallows private building construction activities, the opening of farsan, sweet and confectionery shops, and opening up of IT companies with 50% staff. The relaxation provided by the government will be implemented elsewhere in the state. With the new order, private building construction in MMR and PMR will be halted again. Courier services, cold storage and warehousing services at ports and airports have been disallowed, take-away and home delivery of food from restaurants will not be allowed.Besides that, ongoing pre-monsoon work carried out by the civic bodies along with the construction work on infrastructure projects in the regions will also stop till further notice, state officials said. “The chief minister was upset after traffic jams were seen on Monday. Therefore, for now, all activities, including pre-monsoon work, construction of infrastructure projects have been stopped. We will take a review on it and decide in a day or two as we cannot delay pre-monsoon work,” a senior official said.The two regions — MMR and PMR — have the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the state. MMR recording 4,077 cases and 169 deaths, and PMR recording 754 cases and 59 deaths.The order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta stated, “In view of large number of people commuting because of relaxation issued vide order dated 17 April, 2020 and also imminent threat of further pandemic it is hereby directed that in MMR and PMR area the previous orders will not apply.” It also clarified that e-commerce companies, the vehicles used by e-commerce operators, will be allowed to ply with the necessary permission. E-commerce delivery of essential commodities, food, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment would be permitted.The state government, which had earlier curbed door-to-door delivery of newspapers, allowed it in the same order on Tuesday. However, the door-to-door delivery will not be allowed in MMR and PMR, the order state. Elsewhere, the delivery person will have to adhere to social distancing measures, wear a mask, use sanitiser.In a meeting held via video conferencing, Thackeray told the two inter-ministerial central teams that have been dispatched to Mumbai and Pune that Centre should take a call regarding sending the migrant labourers back to their home states. “The chief minister took up the issue of migrant labourers as the situation was getting difficult. There are around 6 lakh migrant labourers in Maharashtra, and on occasions, some have taken an aggressive stance at the relief camps. The CM has said that they should be taken to their home states in an organised manner and a decision should be taken at the earliest,” an official who was present in the meeting said.A statement from the CMO said, “If the Centre has a projection that there could be a spike in the spread of the coronavirus between April 30 and May 15, then the Centre should take a decision to arrange special trains to take the migrant labourers to their home state in the time available.” It added that guidelines should be formulated before the end of April. An official also said that the CM raised the issue regarding the rapid testing kits. Thackeray asked the team that the Centre should take quick decisions on providing testing kits to the state. The two teams met the officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) over their action and preparedness to tackle the rising number of cases in the two cities. The team led by Manoj Joshi, additional secretary ministry of food processing, visited Worli-Koliwada area on Tuesday for an on-spot inspection of the containment area. The BMC ward has the highest number of cases in the city with over 425 Covid-19 cases. Another team led by Sanjay Malhotra, additional secretary, ministry of power, visited PMC and held a meeting with the divisional commissioner and other senior district officials.A senior Mantralaya bureaucrat said that the team that visited Mumbai raised concern over the high mortality rate in the city. Mumbai has recorded 151 deaths. Besides, in the discussion, they raised a point about the high death rate in the city. They have also raised an issue that containment in certain areas such as Dharavi in the city has not been followed strictly,” the official said requesting anonymity. The team is expected to remain in the two cities for another day for a round of discussion and on-spot visits.Meanwhile, Maharashtra has conducted 83,111 coronavirus tests so far, of which 77,638 has tested negative, while 5,218 have tested positive. To date 722 people have recovered in the state. In Maharashtra, 99,569 are under home quarantine, while 7,808 are at institutional quarantine facilities.According to experts, cases will further rise in the state as we are in the middle of the epidemic curve and because of better surveillance, more asymptomatic patients are getting diagnosed.“The first case in the state was reported in the second week of March. The incubation period of the virus is 14 days. Thus, we are exactly at the blooming time of the virus when gradually the epidemic graph will rise to its highest,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare) and director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra. “Then will fall flat like a plateau and gradually deprecate. This is the nature of any outbreak,” he added.Officials also opined that owing to rising number of tests in the state, more patients are getting diagnosed. “We have narrowed down the testing procedures. Now, more number of high-risk people like cancer, tuberculosis or kidney patients, among others, are getting tested from containment zones. People might panick because of the rising number, but it is because of better surveillance,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.A similar trend was noticed in China, Italy and Iran, where in the second month of infection, highest number of Covid-19 cases were recorded.On Tuesday, BMC issued a circular where they have decided to do household surveillance to identify people above the age of 60 years with comorbid health issues. “We are being criticised for narrowing down the testing procedures, but with the same kits, we are able to run diagnoses on vulnerable group of people, which will add to the data of cases, but it will help curb spread,” added Kakani.With the inclusion of rapid and pool testing, the number of cases will rise further, warns an expert. “A surge in number of cases means detection rate is high. Almost 70% of these patients are asymptomatic, which means most of these are contact tracing. There is no need for panic,” said Dr Om Srivastava, a city epidemiologist and part of the task force of the state government.The state government was supposed to start rapid testing from Wednesday, but as per the new directives, will have to wait for two more days. “We will abide by the rules of ICMR,” said Yadav.The Indian government recently procured 5.5 lakh rapid diagnostic kits from China. Out of this, Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state, has got 75,000 kits. Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh are among states that have started using the tests.“We had got the green light from experts and we have already procured the kits. We will first test in Covid-19 hotspots to find out asymptomatic patients,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, The rapid testing kits, through which blood samples are tested, were aimed at speeding up screening and detection of suspected coronavirus patients as they take less time to show results in comparison to the swab-based tests carried out in pathology labs. When a person contracts Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, the body starts developing antibodies. In the first week, IgM antibodies [first antibodies produced in response to an antigenic challenge] are produced and gradually, IgG antibodies [the most abundant type of antibody] start growing, which remain in the body for almost a month. “So, depending on the types of antibodies and their concentration, we can estimate if the person is in the early stage of infection or in the stage of recovery,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital.But these rapid tests are not for diagnosis at an individual level and often provide false positive reports. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in some cases, antibodies are not produced in the bodies of patients carrying the Covid-19 pathogens when they get tested within the window period. Thus the world health body issued an advisory stating, “WHO doesn’t currently recommend the use of antigen-rapid diagnostic tests for patient care.”As HT reported on Monday, due to the same discrepancy in experts’ opinions about the efficiency of the diagnosis, the state health department was confused about its implementation in Maharashtra. As per experts, it helps in the initial level of the outbreak in segregating the infected patients from the non-Covid population. This is mostly useful in containment zones that are more heavily infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/virus-cases-cross-5k-maharashtra-brings-back-curbs/story-87HZlclFKqg71DbdMGgaHM.html
22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Captain Amarinder suggests PM Modi 3-pronged strategy to bail out states||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday suggested to the Centre a three-pronged strategy to bail out the states from the Covid-19 crisis, including a 3-month special financial package and extension to the 15th Finance Commission till October 2021 for submission of its final report.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amarinder urged him to ask the 15h Finance Commission to review its interim report for 2020-21 in the context of the much lower revenue share for the states compared with what was expected from the earlier projections which assumed 7% growth of GDP. Noting that a zero growth scenario in GDP for India was not unlikely, he said that some analysts were projecting even negative growth. Given the likelihood of very low growth, which was expected to cause the revenue shortfall to last for the whole year, he requested the PM to direct the Finance Commission to defer the submission of its full report to October, 2021 for a realistic assessment of the likely growth of the economy over the next five years. “Nothing would be worse than getting committed to a five year revenue sharing projection based on unrealistically high growth projections,” he warned.The CM further said with the states continuing to shoulder their committed liabilities and facing new demands on relief, health infrastructure expenditure etc., it was only fair and just that the Finance Commission should be requested to recommend a Special Covid-19 Revenue Grant for the year 2020-21. He also sought an immediate 3-month special financial assistance package to enable states to handle the additional health-related expenditure and basic relief expenditure, adding that the immediate 3-month package may be adjusted against the Special Covid-19 Revenue Grant.Further noting that this grant would increase the fiscal deficit of the central government, Amarinder suggested that the same should be financed through a special borrowing programme outside the ambit of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act provisions. He also proposed increasing the deficit to make up the revenue shortfall, as was being done by other nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-captain-amarinder-suggests-pm-modi-3-pronged-strategy-to-bail-out-states/story-QlnN51ZcVFM3WllHuVCxlK.html
22-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s most polluted spots saw cleaner air, SAFAR’s analysis of lockdown period||Areas in Mumbai, some of which were identified as pollution hotspots, have the cleanest air quality during the lockdown period, according to an analysis published by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Monday.Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Worli, Borivli, Bhandup, and Thane have recorded cleaner air as compared to the rest of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), according to a comparative map of air quality before and during the lockdown period published by SAFAR. The air quality index (AQI) in these areas have ranged between 28-55, falling under the ‘good’ to ‘satisfactory’ range during the lockdown.BKC and Worli, which were two of the most polluted sites before the lockdown, and generally witness heavy road traffic, witnessed the highest decline in transport pollution, SAFAR said, adding that presence of green cover across Borivli, Bhandup, and Thane further improved air quality along with a decrease in other human-induced sources.“The most striking factor from our analysis shows that areas that used to be air pollution hotspots in the MMR have become green zones (air pollution free) after the lockdown began,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune. SAFAR analysed pollutant concentration for PM2.5 pollutant – breathable particulate matter 2.5 microns in size or smaller; PM10 (larger coarser particles), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions from burning coal and oil.“When major anthropogenic emission sources reduced in Mumbai, our analysis showed a 60% decline in NO2 levels; 49% for PM10, and a 45% drop in PM2.5. With rising temperatures and dust settling closer to the surface, air pollution levels are mostly in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category during this time of the year, which is not the case during the lockdown,” said Beig.Prior to the lockdown, pollutant concentration was significantly above the safe limit across northwestern and central suburbs such as Malad, Madh and Andheri; isolated areas across central and south Mumbai such as BKC, Worli and Mazgaon, as well as Nerul, Navi Mumbai, and peripheral areas. AQI levels ranged between 181 and 243, falling under the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ categories. Before the lockdown, the AQI was above 300 (very poor) at Nerul, which witnesses high vehicular pollution and industrial production.On Monday, Mumbai recorded its cleanest air day so far this year, with an overall AQI of 61 (satisfactory). The AQI has been ranging between 62 and 65 between Friday and Sunday.

They also threatened to declare an indefinite strike. In Indri grain market too, commission agents launched an agitation, accusing the officials of adopting ‘pick and choose’ formula in calling farmers for bringing wheat to the mandis.However, there was no major impact on the procurement operations in the district.Officials involved in the procurement process said the commission agents were protesting against the transparency in procurement and steps such as e-kharid system.Karnal DC Nishant Yadav said, “Most of the issues raised by the commission agents have been sorted out, but we cannot allow the farmers of Uttar Pradesh to sell their produce in our mandis as procuring the produce of local farmers is our priority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wheat-lifting-picks-up-pace-in-haryana/story-O6w0rm317smv35MEm7WM5M.html
22-04-2020||Lucknow||Leopard rescued from Goverdhan area in Mathura||In a 10-hour long joint operation carried out by the Wildlife SOS and the UP forest department, an adult male leopard was rescued from Govardhan area in Mathura district. The leopard was later released in the Shivalik forest range in Saharanpur.On Monday morning, residents of Govardhan, Mathura, spotted a leopard roaming right in the middle of the town. They immediately reported the matter to the forest department and Agra based NGO Wildlife SOS. Equipped with safety nets, a trap cage and personal protective equipment ((PPE), to carry out the rescue mission, an eight-member team from Wildlife SOS reached the location accompanied by a team of forest officers and they approached the leopard by using food bait to lure it into a trap cage.Assistant director - Veterinary and Research, Wildlife SOS, Dr Yaduraj Khadpekar said, “We set up safety nets around the area and placed two trap cages on both ends of the culvert. Rescue operations involving leopards can be dangerous and need careful planning in order to ensure the safety of the animal as well as of the people. After a nearly ten hour long wait, the leopard finally walked into one of the cages.”The leopard was carefully transferred to Saharanpur by the forest department and Wildlife SOS team, where it was released in the Shivalik forest range on Tuesday.Co-founder and CEO Wildlife SOS, Kartick Satyanarayan said, “The depletion of the leopards natural prey base and habitat due to encroachment and deforestation is forcing them to seek out easily available prey such as poultry and livestock in human settlements. This often leads to human-wild animal conflicts which have violent and brutal consequences for both humans and wildlife. Wildlife SOS works closely with the dorest department to carry out various rescue operations across the state.”Raghunath Mishra, DFO, Mathura, said, “As soon as we received information about the leopard we deployed our team of forest officers for the location. We also requested Etawah Lion safari and Wildlife SOS teams to reach the spot along with their respective trap cages for the rescue operation. We are grateful to the Wildlife SOS team for their expert assistance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/leopard-rescued-from-goverdhan-area-in-mathura/story-aAigbGstBxOn08zLpq9joN.html

22-04-2020||Lucknow||Rain adds to woes of Rabi harvesters||Even as welcome showers in the last 24 hours brought down temperatures in more than half the districts of the state, UP farmers were faced by another challenge: how to protect their Rabi crop.Farmers, now harvesting wheat, mustard and pulses, are facing labour shortage and absence of transport facilities due to the nation-wide lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.“My wheat harvest on two-acre land was drenched in the rain last night. This has delayed wheat husking (removing the wheat grain from the husk). The process requires wheat to be dry. If it rains in the next two days, I will be in big trouble,” said Surat Ram Verma, a farmer in Malihabad, Lucknow.Manoj Yadav, a farmer in Rae Bareli district fears the loss of his mustard harvest due to the rain. “The mustard seeds fell from the pod and got mixed with soil. This has made it impossible to recover them. I have lost around half my produce,” Yadav said.According to experts, rain at this time of the year is not a new phenomenon and occurs almost every year but the delay in harvest caused by the lockdown has made the rain this year doubly painful for farmers. “Farmers had to delay harvesting by an average of eight days due to the lockdown. This left them very little time to finish harvesting before the rain hit them,” said Surendra Khetrapal, a Lucknow-based agriculture expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rain-adds-to-woes-of-rabi-harvesters/story-uoJOkOMgcqbfyM1uojim6L.html
22-04-2020||Lucknow||UP Board evaluation process could take more than 10 days||With stress on maintaining social distancing in all walks of life to keep COVID-19 spread in check, the UP Board’s evaluation process is expected to extend well beyond the earlier fixed 10 days.Board officials believe that undertaking the evaluation process— that could well start from April 25 if the government gives its go ahead —by ensuring 2 metre distance between evaluators at all evaluation centers, the process could take anywhere between 15 to 20 days.Though tightlipped on any matter related to evaluation process as they await instructions from the state government, the officials said preparations were in place to start off the evaluation process from April 25 if the green signal comes from the state government.From April 20, the UP Board headquarters and regional offices witnessed one third of the staff and officials reporting for work after a long gap.“At the moment all I can say is that we have made our offices functional with limited staff as per norm,” said UP Board secretary Neena Srivastava.The answer-sheets of class 10 and class 12 board exams held earlier this year and been sent to different districts are stored in strong rooms. In all 275 evaluation centres spread across the state have been made.“To ensure social distancing, we may be able to call lesser number of evaluators in a shift,” said a senior UP Board official. But we still hope to declare the results by June second week, he added.Another challenge in the evaluation process staring the board officials in the face is the fact that in many of the districts where the evaluation is to be held has been hit hard by COVID-19. As a result before ordering the start of the evaluation process, state of affairs in districts like Agra, Lucknow, Noida, Saharanpur and Moradabad etc would need to be done, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-board-evaluation-process-could-take-more-than-10-days/story-CepNNMlwIwPe5O9CcC8H2H.html
22-04-2020||Lucknow||UP, others urged to allow work for smooth electricity flow||The union power ministry has urged states, including UP, to give permission for carrying out activities to lay/erect transmission lines during the lockdown so that inter-state and intra-state flow of electricity continued uninterrupted.A letter written by joint secretary Tanmay Kumar to all state power secretaries, district magistrates, district police chiefs and municipal commissioners in this regard on Monday, mentions that electricity is an essential service.“Construction activities being carried out by the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) and other inter-state transmission utilities during the nation-wide lockdown must continue to ensure operation and maintenance of inter-state transmission network on 24x7 basis,” the letter says. Kumar has also referred to the union minister’s notification under which carrying out power maintenance work had been exempted from the knockdown rules.UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) sources said work on the under-construction power projects like setting up new sub-stations and laying lines was stopped in the state following the national lockdown on March 24.“But delay in the work could affect power supply in the time to come that is why the power ministry has urged all states to allow carrying out of activities related to construction and laying of lines etc,” they said, adding, “At a meeting last week, UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma also felt that there was a need to restart constriction activities in the department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-others-urged-to-allow-work-for-smooth-electricity-flow/story-kbtaS7LetS8PidajLsOMeJ.html
22-04-2020||Delhi||Customers call delivery agent who tested positive: ‘Be strong, reach out for any help’||A food delivery rider from south Delhi who tested positive for Covid-19 said on Tuesday that he has got calls from at least 15 of his customers in the eight days he has spent in quarantine so far. “Almost every one of them spoke with warmth -- some told me to be brave, others told him not to hesitate to call them, if needed,” he said.They had got his number from their bills. Only one of them, he added, rudely accused him of “lying about test results”, said the 19-year-old who is in quarantine in a police colony in Mandawali. A food delivery rider with Box 8 and MOJO pizza -- both of which operate out of the same kitchen in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar -- said he was initially feeling extremely guilty that he was have infected others.”But when I saw the news on my phone on Monday afternoon, I smiled,” he said. That news he was talking about was that all 16 “high-risk” people who had come in contact with him tested negative, and people from 72 households where he had delivered food over the past month were not showing any flu-like symptoms. He said that on April 13, when his coronavirus test result was positive, he was petrified.“The ground under my feet sank. I hadn’t expected it. I thought I would die. I am the youngest of three siblings, and I hadn’t even seen the world yet,” he said. He first called his manager, and then his elder brother in UP’s Ballia. His father is a farmer and his mother a homemaker. “I had moved to Delhi for some work this year. A cousin helped me get this job, and my employer provided me with a room in Savitri Nagar,” said the man, who earned a monthly salary of about ₹8,500.Sometime between March 20 and 25, he got drenched in the rain while out on delivery. He caught a cold, visited a hospital for a check-up, and was given some pills. When his condition didn’t improve, he decided to go to Safdarjung Hospital but did not get diagnosed with Covid-19.By the end of the month, he had developed a high fever. When his condition still didn’t improve, he went back to Safdarjung Hospital on April 2, but it was only during another visit on April 10, when he told the doctors he had a bad cough, was he told to go to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for a Covid-19 test. He was first admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Dilshad Garden, and on Monday, moved to a three-room set in a police colony in Mandawali, where three patients are allotted one room each. He still coughs occasionally but says he is fine. I’ll try to go back to my village to my family once I am discharged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/customers-call-delivery-agent-who-tested-positive-be-strong-reach-out-for-any-help/story-iMIXcBa1xSF8XSxk4yyYrJ.html
22-04-2020||Delhi||5-star hotels for docs only: Govt revises rules for Covid warriors||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Tuesday issued an order saying accommodation will be provided for all doctors, nurses and paramedics treating Covid-19 patients in the national capital, but in what appeared to be a clarification of a similar order last month, gave a classification of what facilities would be provided to whom.In Tuesday’s order, the government said that doctors will be put up in premium hotels, nurses and paramedics in other hotels, and support staff in dharamshalas.“Doctors will be provided four and five-star accommodations, nurses and paramedics are entitled to hotel accommodations, while supporting staff will be put up in dharamshalas,” read the order, signed by Delhi’s health secretary Padmini Singla. They are meant to be put up during a 14-day duty period, followed by a 14-day quarantine period so that they don’t pose a risk to their family members and other they might interact with.The entitlement classification comes days after at least 15 nurses and lab technicians who were in quarantine after treating Covid-19 patients for two weeks, were asked by the staff of a five-star hotel at 11.30pm to vacate their rooms on the grounds that the facility was “only for doctors”.They were staying at the Leela Ambience Convention Hotel in East Delhi during their 14-day duty period starting on April 1. This was to be followed by a 14-day quarantine at the hotel starting on April 15, but on April 18, were asked to move out and go to a guest house in Mayur Vihar. The original government order, dated March 29, said that accommodation will be provided to all doctors, nurses and paramedics treating Covid-19 patients. For this purpose, two five star hotels in Delhi were roped in. The initial order did not make any distinction on who would qualify for five-star facilities. “The hotel has formed a team of essential staff members who will follow strict protocol and take all safety precautions while fulfilling guest services. The hotel will continue to work in close coordination with the ministry of health and local government authorities, to support the extraordinary humanitarian effort of India’s health care professionals in these challenging times,” Leela Ambience Convention Hotel said in a statement on Tuesday, when asked about the incident.Friday’s incident led to at least two health care unions — representing the nurses of Guru Tegh Bahadur hospital and the Indian Medical Laboratory Technologist Federation (IMLTF) — writing to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain to complain about how front-line health care workers were treated at a time when they were meant to be in isolation.This was followed by a second order, on Saturday, that said accommodation would be given only to those people who were treating “severely infected” patients.The order was criticised by health care teams working in coronavirus hospitals, who said that close proximity with patients puts them at higher risk and alternative lodging facility was necessary so that they do not carry the infection back to their families. It was withdrawn, and replaced with Tuesday’s order.“It is a relief that the hospitals will provide accommodation. Since we are exposed to patients who have the disease, there is a risk of carrying the virus home to families. My batch will start our 14-day duty from Wednesday,” said a nursing officer at a Delhi government hospital who did not wish to be identified.But some health care workers’ unions objected to new lodging facilities as “discriminatory”.“It is the nurses and supporting staff who are with the patient for 14-17 hours every day. But when it comes to providing decent accommodation to them, you will discriminate and provide five-star rooms only to doctors. We are not undermining anyone’s contribution in a patient’s treatment, but this bias is unacceptable,” said Jai Veer Singh, president of the Joint Federation of Nurses, a nursing staff union in Delhi-NCR.He also said the government has been issuing a different order every day, the brunt of which has to borne by health care workers.“When it started, the government announced that all doctors, nurses and paramedics will be given five-star accommodation. But when we need alternative accommodation more than anything, the government has been releasing caveats,” Singh said.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain did not respond to several calls and text messages requesting comment.Dr Chhavi Gupta, who is in charge of accommodation of medical teams at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital for Covid-19 treatment, said they have roped in guest houses and a dharamshala in the area, where middle- and lower-level medical staff will now be housed.“Doctors, nurses and paramedical staff will get accommodation facilities according to their entitlement. Initially, when the order was announced to provide alternative lodging for hospital staff, we had checked them into five-star hotels, but that was a stopgap arrangement. Now we have managed to get guest houses to come on board,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/5-star-hotels-for-docs-only-govt-revises-rules-for-covid-warriors/story-UxUWUeoKOKfl2ekVb8TYiN.html

22-04-2020||Delhi||HC writes to district courts to have plan on place for when lockdown is lifted||The Delhi high court has written to the district courts listing steps that should be taken under its “phased/graded restoration to normalcy plan”, once the lockdown is lifted, including the categorisation of urgent cases for hearing.The registrar general of the high court, Manoj Jain, on the instructions of chief justice DN Patel, has also written to the Delhi high court bar association and the bar council of Delhi chairman KC Mittal. ustice DN Patel has also constituted a committee to look into the matter.He said post the lockdown, there would be a deluge of cases, the handling of which would pose a big challenge to the justice system. Jain said it may not be practical to open the courts to everyone immediately once the lockdown is lifted.“There are more than 8 lakh cases pending in district courts and another 80,000 in the high court. Since the said number is huge, the footfall in courts would be evidently enormous, once the lockdown is lifted, partially or otherwise. Moreover, because of the suspended functioning of courts, most matters could not be filed by many advocates and litigants. Therefore the moment the courts are thrown open, it would be difficult to control the rush for the purposes of ensuring social distancing. Obviously, courts cannot be converted into hot spots,” the letter said said.Highlighting that normalcy cannot be achieved overnight, Jain said gradual expansion would be key, by listing out well-defined categories of priority cases. It should be ensured that proportionate court infrastructure is available during all these phases till restoration of complete normalcy. Jain said guidelines should be made for restricting the entry into courts and social distancing norms should be followed by all, including judges, lawyers, court staff and litigants.Guidelines should be prepared by all district courts for restricting entry into lawyers’ chambers while also ensuring that infrared thermometers, masks, gloves, sanitisers etc are available for everyone.Jain said permanent video conferencing court rooms should be prepared for holding hearings with an emphasis on e-filing, e-issuance and e-service of court notices||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-writes-to-district-courts-to-have-plan-on-place-for-when-lockdown-is-lifted/story-wXs3Rtrr7WZixCDsHmCQTJ.html

22-04-2020||Gurugram||Man arrested from Kanpur for killing wife||Three days after a 25-year-old man allegedly killed his wife after a heated argument, the police on Monday arrested him from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. According to the police, he was allegedly trying to return to his village in West Bengal amid the lockdown in the wake of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The man allegedly went to Delhi, Noida, and Bulandshahr, before reaching Kanpur where he was nabbed by officials.The arrested man was identified as Shantanu Mohammed alias Raju from Uttar Dinajpur, West Bengal. The police said that he and his wife, Shahnaz, were living and working as cooks at a paying guesthouse in Rajiv Nagar. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Shahnaz, the victim, was the man’s second wife. He had earlier gotten married in 2013 and had three children who stayed in West Bengal. He was working at a paying guest house as a cook in Rajiv Nagar. The man met Shahnaz in November 2019 through a friend and they soon started to work as cooks at the paying guest house together. In January 2020, they got married.”During the interrogation, the man informed them that soon after the wedding, they shifted to another paying guest house in Rajiv Nagar and began working there. Subsequently, he got to know that Shahnaz was already married to another man.“The couple began fighting. He repeatedly asked her to not talk to her first husband but she refused. On Friday, after another argument, he hit her on the head with a cricket bat. When the woman refused to stop talking to the first husband, the man picked up another bat and hit her several times. He then tied her body and hid her in a bed box and fled the spot after locking the room,” Boken added. According to the police, the man allegedly took a lift from a motorcycle rider and reached DLF Colony near Sector 14. Then he allegedly took a taxi and told the driver to drop him at Safdarjang Hospital, Delhi. The man allegedly roamed around for some time and then decided to go to Noida to meet some acquaintances. “He took some money from his acquaintances and a bicycle and then began travelling towards his village in West Bengal.

22-04-2020||Gurugram||Parents write to CM over school fee||Over 1000 parents of students in the city’s schools wrote to the chief minister with a charger of 10 demands regarding fee, which, they say, were unreasonable during the lockdown imposed to contain Covid-19.The letter, also addressed to Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri sought a waiver of “unreasonable fee” being charged by schools under various budget heads. Parents want the government to ensure that only essential component of the tuition fee is charged and parents are not pressured to pay a fee hike and additional charges.“Even in the current situation, private schools have not hesitated to increase the fee. Fee revision is between 7-10%. Many parents have written to the schools but schools have been reluctant to respond,” stated the mail.The demands include no hike in fee in the current financial year, waiver of bus fee, extra activity fees, AC fees, light fees, and fee for services that are not being used with schools remaining closed during the lockdown. Further, parents have requested that schools may be allowed to charge only essential components of the monthly tuition fee. If schools have already collected an additional fee from parents, they must adjust the same in the tuition fee in the coming session, they demanded.Himanshu Sharma, a parent, said that parents were not insisting that schools do not charge at all, but that they should justify the fee being charged and offer concession in light of the lockdown. “Schools can collect tuition fee to pay for the salaries of teachers, but other fee components towards electricity or building funds shouldn’t be charged right now since students are not utilising these services and studying from home. Many parents are going through financial distress and are not in a situation to pay the increased fee or additional charges,” said Sharma.Last week, the district administration had said that private schools in the district could neither force parents to pay school fee nor hike fees during the lockdown. Prior to that, the state education department had said that private schools in the state could collect a monthly fee from parents, only if their financial condition allowed them. The department had also said that parents facing financial distress due to the lockdown could not be forced to pay the monthly fee and could seek relaxation from schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/parents-write-to-cm-over-school-fee/story-sHBWyUHrRZrJGHps4xqIXJ.html
22-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram hotel raid: Police appoint cyber expert to retrieve data||Three days after the police raided a luxury hotel in Udyog Vihar for allegedly allowing a call-centre company to run its operations from its premises, a cyber expert was appointed to retrieve data from the devices seized from the rooms, said police officials privy to the investigation on Tuesday. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police(ACP), DLF, said, “A Delhi-based cyber expert has been appointed and is scanning the data in the nine devices that were seized from the rooms of Radisson hotel. He is also scanning all the five mobile phones seized to check if the company was involved in any possible scams. We are yet to confirm whether the company was involved in any kind of illegal activity,” he said.Goel said a letter was sent to the department of telecommunications (DoT) on Tuesday, asking for the cancellation of the licence of the company, Saburi TLC World Wide Service Pvt Ltd, which originally operated from Sohna Road. “They had not taken permission to operate from a different location or, for that matter, a hotel. This is illegal,” he said.Four employees of the business process outsourcing (BPO) firm and its director, along with the hotel’s director of rooms and the general manager, were arrested late on Friday night. Several others were booked after the police raided the hotel. The firm has an office in Spaze IT building on Sohna Road, but shut it down after the lockdown was announced. It had booked 35 rooms in the Radisson hotel and had shifted their operations to the hotel, said the police.Goel said they have retrieved a few emails exchanged between the hotel and the company. “Despite knowing that the company was planning to run operations illegally, the hotel allowed them to operate from the rooms and did not inform the authorities,” he said.The hotel had provided LAN cables to the rooms for the workstations of the employees and their laptops, said the police. The police had arrested seven people on Saturday including two senior executives of the hotel for allowing the call-centre company to run its call centre from the hotel despite the ongoing nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The police team raided the hotel in the early hours of Saturday following a tip-off. At that time, over 20 employees were found working in the rooms. The company director could not provide any licence to run the call centre from the hotel, the police said.Also, two women executive of the call centre recorded their statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) before the magistrate in the district and sessions court on late Monday evening and alleged sexual and mental harassment by their seniors, the police said.The victims alleged that there was no internal complaints committee (ICC) for redressal of complaints of the employees despite being a multinational company. Rakesh Sharma, executive director of Radisson hotel said that they had shut down the Wi-Fi connection provided to the BPO employees in all 35 rooms. “They do not have access to the internet; all the LAN connections have been disabled. On Tuesday, they have checked out of 15 rooms and rest will check out on Wednesday. The people living in the hotel now are placed under quarantine,” he said. Despite repeated calls and messages to Anuj Jain, director of Saburi TLC World Wide Service Pvt Ltd , he did not respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-hotel-raid-police-appoint-cyber-expert-to-retrieve-data/story-4pBJLUCrtQgmu7mJlrqnbK.html
22-04-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Migrants in Gurugram make do with one meal a day during lockdown||As the clock strikes 2pm, a crowd starts gathering near a tent in a slum cluster in Saraswati Kunj, Sector 53. People, mostly migrant workers, rendered unemployed due to the nationwide lockdown, call out to their children and rush from their shanties, lining up to collect a meal of pooris and sabzi. Adults take their plates—four pooris with sabzi—while children are given two pooris each. A woman pleads for a second helping but is rebuked by the relief volunteer handing out food at the bhandara. For a majority of slum residents, this is perhaps the only meal they will eat this day.Almost a week ago, about a kilometre from here, a migrant from Bihar who worked as a painter had killed himself as he was unable to feed his family of seven. A few hours before his death, he had sold his mobile phone for ₹2,500 to purchase some ration and a portable fan. Struggling to find work, he had hanged himself in his shanty.To many others living in slum clusters across the city, the ongoing national lockdown has dealt a severe blow. Most people are going through food distress that has been exacerbated by the drying up of wages. Hindustan Times visited three areas across the city—Saraswati Kunj in Sector 53, Nathupur near DLF phase 3 and Chakkarpur near MG Road— where the migrant population from Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal is staying and found that most people were surviving on the bare minimum. While some residents say that they have not received any food or ration from the administration since the lockdown started, others are surviving on one meal a day served by volunteers from the village or NGOs.Saraswati Kunj clustersTabrej Alam, a labourer from Bihar’s Supaul district, has been surviving on one meal a day distributed by volunteers in Saraswati Kunj, where he lives. Alam says that he, like many others in the cluster, have not received any help from the government. “When the lockdown started, we could no longer work and earn. We spent whatever little ₹100-200 that we had on food in the initial days. Once our savings dried up, we could no longer sustain ourselves. Since then, we have been surviving on the food (pooris) that we are served once a day,” Alam says.He says that most workers living in the slums are migrants from various districts of Bihar, such as Supaul, Siwan, Araria and Purnia. They are stuck due to the lockdown restrictions and lack of transport. According to him, people cannot even go to vegetable shops within a kilometre.The closest food disbursal point for the residents of Saraswati Kunj is the Community Centre in Sector 56. Jarul Shaikh from West Bengal’s Nadia district, who lives in one of the clusters in Saraswati Kunj, says that on multiple occasions, he and others have been turned away from the district administration’s food disbursal facility in Sector 56 after waiting in the queue for hours. “One time, we waited for two hours in the queue. Before our turn could come, the distributors announced that there was no more rice and asked us to come back after two days. When we returned after two days, we waited for two hours and again had to return empty-handed,” Shaikh, who stopped going to the facility after being turned away repeatedly, and has been surviving on meals that good Samaritans provide occasionally, says.Some metres away from Shaikh’s cluster, a group of five people sit on the ground and talk among themselves. The shortage of food figures prominently in the conversation with most of the group expressing its disdain over the dysfunctional system. “We don’t get any food here. It has been over a month now but no tangible help has been provided to us. People come to enquire about the food but it never reaches us,” Vinod Kumar says.Shamshida Khatoon, from Bihar’s Supaul district, adds that the quantity of food that is distributed is insufficient and hardly enough to satiate a day’s hunger. “Children are given two pooris while adults receive four. If one tries and takes more, food is snatched from them and given to others. People fight to get some food before it is taken,” Khatoon says, adding that she has not received any dry ration till date.NathupurAt Nathupur village, around 4pm, scores of people throng a table where packets of daal and rice are being distributed by a volunteer. A woman requests for a second helping for her child, but is harshly asked to return as she has already collected her meal. Binoy Sarkar from West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas, says that chances of survival look bleak if the lockdown is extended again. “We will not survive if the lockdown is extended. There is no assistance from the government. We are living at the mercy of citizens who distribute packets of khichdi once a day,” Sarkar says. He adds that a school headmaster had distributed ration (5 kg flour, 1-litre oil, and 1 kg potato) to each of them in the first week of the lockdown, but with the supplies running low, survival has become a challenge.Hassan Vishwas, another resident at the same shelter, says that he had no food or money and was worried about the days ahead. “My wife used to work as a domestic help but was asked not to come. Both of us don’t have any work now. A school headmaster has been helping us with a one-time meal of khichdi,” says Vishwas. He says that he was hoping that someone from his home state might have written to the administration here for help. “We had heard this on TV, but so far, no help has reached us,” he added.ChakkarpurResidents of Chakkarpur say that ration delivery has been minimal and inconsistent. Rubina (who goes by her first name) from West Bengal’s Malda district, says that she has received ration twice in 25 days—it has not been enough. “They keep noting down our names on various lists but ration doesn’t reach us. Last week, when they came to distribute ration, the crowd became difficult to control and food was over in a matter of minutes,” Rubina says. She adds that on two occasions, cooked food packets distributed by individuals had turned stale because of the weather. “Food turns bad in this weather. Dry ration could help us but it is hardly distributed,” she says, adding that she has borrowed money from relatives to purchase ration for a few days.Hamida, another woman, says that for migrants like her, there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. “We are poor labourers. Neither can we go back to our villages nor can we work here. Along with our children, we are surviving on one meal a day, for which we have to beg. The government has not helped us in any way. We roam within a periphery of half a kilometre, surviving on water,” she says.Government response Varinder Singh Kundu, the additional chief secretary of Haryana and CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, says that the administration is coordinating the efforts of large groups working towards alleviating hunger among the needy. “In all distribution centres, meals are provided twice a day and there is a constant effort to match the requirements with the supply. We try to send an adequate supply to all centres,” Kundu says.As per a list shared by the district administration on April 10 there are 69 relief centres in the district where food is being provided. These include the MCG’s community centres and government schools. The nodal officer for food distribution in the city, Vivek Kalia, says that 35 teams have been formed to handle food distribution across the city, adding that the government is working in tandem with private organisations/initiatives such as Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch and Janta Rasoi, who are handling certain areas, and the administration is avoiding duplication in the same areas. “Besides government officials, each ward has volunteers involved in food distribution. We are sourcing around 1.2 lakh meals a day from 15 private firms and individuals,” Kalia says.He adds that while it is easier to identify slum clusters, it is crucial to identify lower-income families living in various colonies, who are hesitant to seek help. “These are unprecedented times and we have to fight as one collective unit. Residents should also help us in reaching those in distress,” Kalia says.Kundu says that some NGOs have exhausted their resources and the government is supplying ration to these NGOs to cook and distribute among the poor. He says that the administration is cognizant of the fact that people need to be taken care of till the lockdown is lifted, and it is working on implementing a system that works in the long run. “We are making the effort of covering the maximum number of people possible through distribution centres. Besides that, we are also responding to requests that we receive on the helpline or via social media channels. In a city with such a large workforce scattered in different areas, 100% coverage is not easy,” Kundu says.He adds that the government is working towards distributing dry ration to families through PDS shops and other points against their Aadhar cards. “There will be a record of the families that receive monthly ration through this system and we will be able to avoid duplication. The survey began on Sunday, and once we have the details, we will be able to issue dry ration tokens. People will be able to collect ration against the tokens,” Kundu says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-migrants-make-do-with-one-meal-a-day/story-SwUYXJYL0xHlbof0liNDDO.html
22-04-2020||Noida||Covid-19: Delhi-Gautam Budh Nagar borders sealed to curb coronavirus spread||The district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar has passed an order to seal the Delhi-GB Nagar borders as a precautionary measure to control the spread of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the district. The order, which states said that the source of infection for many Covid-19 patients in the district was their link with Delhi, comes a day after Ghaziabad sealed all its borders with the national Capital for the same reason. The order was issued under the National Disaster Act 2005 and came in force with immediate effect. The decision was taken based on a report submitted by the health department which suggested that people going and coming back from Delhi increases the chances of spreading the infection in the district.According to the data released by the health department on Tuesday, three Noida patients had contracted the disease in Delhi and were being treated there. Light and heavy vehicles carrying essential goods will be allowed to enter, but anybody trying to smuggle people inside UP from Delhi will face strict legal action. Ambulance services will not be stopped at any point, the order stated. GB Nagar chief medical officer will provide to the police a list of medical experts so they can be allowed to cross the borders without any hassle.The district magistrate said officers who are directly involved in Covid containment measures will have to get passes made by authorities concerned in Delhi and UP governments. Officials attached with the Central government will have to show permission passes granted by the Home ministry; media persons will get passes from the district administration or Noida police for movement between Delhi and Noida.“The order was passed to contain the spread of Covid-19. People involved in essential services will be provided passes by the officials concerned,” district magistrate Suhas LY said. On Tuesday, GB Nagar chief medical officer had also passed an order for all private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics stating that if any of their patients tests Covid positive during the treatment then they have to treat them. The order, however, was withheld after Indian Medical Association, Noida president, Dr NK Sharma raised concern. A new order would soon be passed with amendments. “All the hospital can’t cater to COVID-19 patients because it will worsen the situation in GB Nagar like it happened in Italy and other places where the outbreak has been massive. All the hospitals can’t be infected because it will hamper the whole health facility system. It will also harm adversely other regular patients undergoing treatment. The DM and CMO have assured that the order will be amended keeping our suggestion in mind and it has been put on hold,” Dr Sharma said. A recent assessment by the state government had said the lockdown results were “unsatisfactory” in 40 of the 75 districts and called for stricter enforcement of restrictions.The “unsatisfactory” category included capital Lucknow, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Allahabad, Varanasi and Kanpur. The 35 districts falling under satisfactory category included Aligarh, Etah, Hathras, Kasganj, Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur and Hardoi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-gb-nagar-borders-sealed/story-GCKONrLS8u7zLLu0ciBdXO.html
22-04-2020||Chandigarh||Utility, repair services allowed in Chandigarh||No fresh case of Covid-19 was reported in Chandigarh on Tuesday even as the administration, facing flak for declaring the entire city a containment zone, loosened some restrictions to allow electricians, plumbers and air-conditioner (AC) mechanics to visit clients’ homes. The Covid-19 count in the city stands at 27 with 13 active cases as 14 patients have recovered and no fatalities have been reported.Allowing utility services will come as a big relief to residents under curfew for about a month. To this end, a list of electricians and plumbers, AC mechanics authorised to work across the city is available at the administration websites, www.chandigarh.gov.in and www.chdcovid19.in.The entire city has been divided into six zones with service providers selected for each.A spokesperson of the administration clarified that this was paid, private service with charges to be mutually settled.SERVICE PROVIDERS NOT TO BE TESTEDThis is for the first time in more than a month since the curfew was imposed that outsiders were being allowed to enter residents’ homes.Stating that the service providers would not be tested, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said, “Sanitisation and screening of these people will be done.”As per testing protocol, however, people with symptoms or those who have come in contact with patients can be tested, he added.The administration has directed all the technicians to use facemasks, hand sanitisers and gloves, and strictly adhere to social distancing norms while attending the complaints.BADNORE: INVOLVE VOLUNTEERSMeanwhile in his daily review meeting, Punjab governor and UT Administrator VPS Badnore directed the UT adviser to involve representatives and volunteers to effectively oversee sealing of colonies and other areas and enforce social distancing.Badnore stated that the guidelines regarding volunteer training and utilisation, as given by the Central Government in igot.gov.in, should be circulated.The administrator said areas being specifically sealed due to the Covid-19 outbreak should be provided with doorstep delivery of vegetables and ration.About 1,700 families are living in two sealed pockets, Dhanas Kachi Colony and Sector 30B, which were sealed after four positive cases were reported last week. Only single entry-exit points are allowed in these areas, and all movement is prohibited except for essential commodities.The administration is providing door-to-door essential services here. On Tuesday, ration was distributed in Kachi colony.The health department is also undertaking intensive door-to-door screening in these areas.BOX50% BANK BRANCHES TO OPEN ON ALTERNATIVE DAYSThe administration on Tuesday also allowed banks to open branches for public dealing on alternative days with 50% staff present. ATM operations will be operational and bank correspondents (authorised representatives) available daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/utility-repair-services-allowed-in-chandigarh/story-FVc7Q0P6y9Tvqb9bmQ2TTK.html
22-04-2020||Chandigarh||How timely action, strict vigil helped these 3 Haryana districts in keeping virus at bay||Strict vigil and extra caution seem to have so far helped three districts of Haryana — Jhajjar, Rewari and Mahendergarh — in steering clear of Covid-19, despite their proximity to coronavirus hotspots in Delhi and Rajasthan. It was in the second week of March, even before the virus began to spread its tentacles in Haryana, when the local administrations and residents started gearing up and joined hands to seal borders, implement ‘thikri pehra’ (patrolling by people) in rural and urban areas, restrict movement of people and focus on social distancing. The result: These three districts managed to remain Covid-free so far. Situated right on the border of Delhi, Haryana’s Jhajjar faced the immediate threat from the national capital as well as Gurugram. “We not only sealed all borders with Delhi, but also secured interstate perimeters. There, our police and health teams — equipped with thermal scanners — kept tabs on each and every person’s entry and exit, noting down their details. We took prompt actions and kept track of Jhajjar residents’ visits to any place (such as Delhi) from where positive cases were being reported,” Jhajjar deputy commissioner (DC) Jitender Singh said.The district also had 52 people with Tablighi links, who were immediately quarantined and tested. “Nobody was found infected,” he added. The administration, with the help of industrial houses, wholesalers and milk suppliers, formed groups and ensured minimum movement of people as well as provision of food, shelter and other essentials to about 65,000 industrial and 56,000 brick-kiln workers in the district. Rewari, too, faced a direct threat of virus spread as its borders touch Gurugram as well as Rajasthan, both Covid-19 hotspots. “Rewari of Haryana and Bhiwadi of Rajasthan have several villages which share their boundaries with each other,” Rewari DC Yashendra Singh said, adding that it was also interesting to note that some of the positive cases from neighbouring district Bhiwadi came to Rewari’s village health centres for treatment. We declared those areas containment zones and also tested all health staffers, he added. Quick quiz on corona came in handyApart from round-the-clock screening on 21 entry and exit points, the Rewari administration focused on awareness and ‘thikri pehras’ in urban and rural areas. The DC said though uncertainty loomed large over exams, all private and government schools were asked to advise their students to come prepared for questions on ‘Covid-19 – Causes, Symptoms and Prevention’. “This exercise acted as an awareness drive, which worked well for students as well as their parents,” he added. Several officials and residents of Mahendergarh with whom HT spoke to also cited constant fear they faced due to their proximity with Rajasthan. It was, thus, imperative to effectively seal all three borders the district shared with the neighbouring state before it was too late, they said. Mahendergarh DC Jagdish Sharma explained how they decongested the crowded areas, shifted main grain markets of Nangal Chaudhary, Mahendergarh and Narnaul out of the city limits and even scattered a few others. “There also were 82 people who had returned from abroad. All of them as well as their contacts were quarantined well in time,” he said, while appreciating the ‘exemplary’ cooperation of locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/how-timely-action-strict-vigil-helped-these-3-haryana-districts-in-keeping-virus-at-bay/story-QRPIo6OR4V5CFCqZuXkO1M.html
22-04-2020||City||Netizens protest FIRs against journalists in Kashmir||A day after three journalists working in Kashmir were booked for reportedly posting ‘anti-national’ content on their social media and publishing a fake news story, support poured in from netizens.A Srinagar-based freelance photojournalist was booked by the cyber cell of the J&K Police under Section 13 of the UA (P) Act and 505 of the IPC at Cyber police station in Srinagar for allegedly uploading “anti-national posts with criminal intention to induce the youth and promote offences against tranquillity.”In another case, senior journalist was booked for allegedly publishing fake news. In the third case, a freelance journalist-cum-author was booked for alleged misuse of his social media and indulging in ‘unlawful activities’ through his posts and writings. “The details quoted in the news item were factually incorrect and could cause fear or alarm in the minds of public. The news was published without seeking confirmation from the district authorities,” a J&K police release read.After the news was out, the social media was abuzz with pictures and statements demanding withdrawal of FIRs against the journalists and stopping their harassment. Netizens have also started hashtags for the cause.A veteran journalist tweeted, “Appalled to know that the photojournalist has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.”“Muzzling the press is the norm now. Even politicians and leaders, who were among the first to retweet her pictures are silent today,” wrote another journalist working for a Hindi TV channel.“The photojournalist has honestly told stories of Kashmir. Invoking UAPA is outrageous. In solidarity with our colleague, we demand the FIR to be withdrawn. Journalism isn’t crime. Intimidation/censorship won’t silence Kashmir’s journalists,” posted a Kashmir-based journalist on his Facebook page.CPI (M) leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami has opposed registering of the FIRs, saying that it is an unwarranted act intended to suppress freedom of press.The Kashmir Press Club said that the J&K government and the police need to understand the difference between journalism and cyber crime.“While government has every right to rebut a story of a journalist and allow them to respond, cases against journalists are unwarranted and outright illegal,” they stated.IGP Kashmir has appealed to the media to not publish fake or fabricated news as it can have a bearing on national security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/netizens-protest-firs-against-journalists-in-kashmir/story-WY9L5GTEUtEP3UxyuMbcQP.html
22-04-2020||Delhi||Some cheer: Delhi’s coronavirus recovery count 500+||The number of people who beat the Covid-19 infection in the city crossed the 500-mark on Tuesday, with 180 people in Delhi recovering on Tuesday, as per the daily health bulletin. As many as 611 of the total 2,156 infected in the city have recovered so far, according to the Delhi government data.The number of people who recovered on Tuesday was more than double — 75 — the number of people who were diagnosed with Covid-19.For the first time in around two weeks, zero deaths were recorded in Delhi. So far, 47 people have died of the infection in the city. Most of them — 53.2% — are 60 years of age or older. Almost 83% of those who died had comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart or kidney disease.For two days now, Delhi has recorded fewer than 80 cases. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the city is ready to treat up to 30,000 active cases at a go. On Tuesday, many of the patients admitted to the two dedicated Covid-19 hospitals — Lok Nayak and Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospitals — were moved to ‘Covid Care Centres’ as they either had very mild or no symptoms. Around 772 are admitted to these centres.Of the 513 still admitted to hospitals, 27 were in the intensive care unit, with five on ventilator support.Designated as Covid Health Centre, Delhi government has involved the Ayurvedic hospital Chaudhary Brahma Prakash to take care of 31 patients with mild symptoms.The dedicated hospitals, care centres and health centres form the three-tier system established by the government for treating the Covid-19 patients in the city.The sample collection saw a slowdown in the city, with only 727 samples being collected on Tuesday, against roughly 2,000 samples that are usually collected daily. The data shows that 2,354 samples are yet to be processed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/75-new-cases-180-recover-as-delhi-sees-zero-deaths/story-WYfN1bGAkVeBKQcIikCwdN.html

22-04-2020||City||Ludhiana: Row erupts after hospital seizes late ACP wife’s phone||A row has erupted after hospital authorities seized the mobile phone of wife of assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kohli, who died of coronavirus on Thursday. Palak Kohli, wife of the late ACP, is admitted in the isolation ward of Fortis hospital here. Palak has not developed any symptom for Covid-19 but has been put under observation after the death of her husband.The matter came to the fore after a family friend of Kohli raised the issue on social media. The police and hospital authorities have started passing the buck and blaming each other since the matter was raised.Meanwhile, commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal made a call to Kohli’s son and assured him that his mother will get her mobile phone back.Shehbaz Singh Nagra, Kohli’s friend, said that mobile phone was the only medium through which she was in contact with her two sons, including the one who lives in Canada, and other family members.Nagra said that he learnt about it on Monday and when he talked to the hospital authorities, they started making excuses. The authorities claimed that they had taken the phone for sanitising it, however, later they said that they had taken the phone at the behest of the police.Nagra claimed that when he talked to the police officials, they claimed that they had not issued any such direction to hospital staff. He also alleged that the hospital staff has been pressuring the family for depositing money for treatment.CP Rakesh Agrawal could not be reached out for his comments.Meanwhile, the hospital staff has shifted district mandi officer Jasbir Kaur in the same isolation ward, where Palak Kohli has been isolated.Covid-19 positive ASI alleges ill-treatment at MCHAn assistant sub-inspector has been shifted from Mother Child Hospital to SPS hospital after he alleged that he was not getting proper treatment at the isolation ward of the former hospital.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Sukhdev Singh, driver of sub-Inspector Arshpreet Kaur, SHO at police station Basti Jodhewal, claimed that neither any medic was attending him nor he was given food, despite being diabetic.He said that he had to make a call to police station Division number 7 for arranging food for him.He said that he was admitted to the civil hospital on Monday even though the hospital lacks facilities to treat Covid-19 patients.The ASI has also filed a written complaint to senior officers in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-row-erupts-after-hospital-seizes-late-acp-wife-s-phone/story-htD2d24lnyFmblPMVEvsxK.html

22-04-2020||Delhi||Two walk 12km in scorching heat to collect salaries, robbers leave them poorer||Rajendra Singh and Chandan Paswan walked 12 kilometres from east Delhi’s Kailash Nagar to north Delhi’s Model Town on Sunday. It took them a little over three hours in the scorching heat to complete the torturous journey, but considering that they got their monthly salary at the end of it, it was well worth the effort.Their joy was, however, short-lived; with barely 2km left to reach back home, they fell prey to three robbers wielding knives, who assaulted them and made off with their phones and the money.“We had briefly halted at a traffic junction in Shastri Park, about 2km from our home, to rest our tired legs. That’s when three men pounced on us. They choked us and punched us before running away with our money and mobile phones,” Singh, 32, one of the two men, said.For Singh, it was sheer desperation that forced him to make the arduous walk. He works at a cosmetics shop in Sadar Bazaar and was left with just about ₹5,000 when the lockdown was announced on March 24. By the beginning of April, most of that money was exhausted. “My two sons are five years and 18 months old. Buying milk and daily grocery finished off whatever little I had,” Singh, who lives in a rented home in Kailash Nagar, said. By Saturday, he had just ₹150 in his pocket. “We didn’t have money for my children’s milk. It was then that I decided to call my employer for help,” he said. His employer, who lives in Model Town, agreed to help, but said he would not be able to transfer the money to his bank account or e-wallet. “I told him I would walk to his home on Sunday,” Singh said. On Sunday, Singh asked his colleague Chandan Paswan, who lives with his uncle in nearby Usmanpur, if he would like to accompany him and he agreed. “We just had tea and set out at 9am with the ₹150 in my pocket and our phones. We carried a bottle of water each, but finished that within minutes of our walk,” Singh said. The cash in their pocket didn’t come handy as they found no shop open on the way.They reached their employer’s home around 12.30pm. “We waited outside for 15-20 minutes while our employer had his lunch. He finally gave ₹6,000 to me and ₹5,000 to Paswan. But no one offered us water or food,” Singh said. As they walked back, they were fortunate to find a shop from where Singh spent his loose change to buy two water bottles and some snacks. “Our legs had blisters, but we continued to walk --- at least our money problems were sorted for next few weeks,” he said. And then they reached the traffic junction in Shastri Park around 3.30pm. “Suddenly, three men carrying knives jumped us and asked us to hand over our cash. We lied to them and said we were daily wage earners, but they choked both of us and searched our pockets,” Singh said.The robbers took it all --- the salaries totalling ₹11,000, the phones and ₹100 in loose change that Singh had on him. “They fled into a forested area nearby. They even punched me and injured me in my eye,” Singh said. With no phone to even call the police, the men walked to Paswan’s home which was closer. “We used his uncle’s phone to call the police. The police took us to Shastri Park police station and kept us there till 9pm without offering us even water. Instead, they scolded us for walking and not calling the police control room number if we were short of food,” Singh said. “Would the police have given me cash or brought me milk for the children if I had called them?” Singh said. The police have registered a case of robbery and efforts are on to arrest the suspects and recover the stolen cash and phones, DK Gupta, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said. “We’ll ensure that both families are cared for,” the DCP said when asked about the treatment they received at the police station. Singh, meanwhile, has been forced to borrow ₹500 from his neighbour to sustain his family for a few days. “I don’t know what I’ll do after that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-walk-12km-in-scorching-heat-to-collect-their-salaries-robbers-leave-them-poorer/story-kfd5sQw8Npr3aZvRdV7WxL.html

Head by Sanjay Malhotra, additional secretary, ministry of power, the team included Dr PK Sen, additional director general, directorate general of health services (Dte GHS); Dr Pawan Kumar Singh, joint advisor, national disaster management authority (NDMA); Dr Ashish V Gawai, deputy secretary, ministry of health and family welfare and Karmvir Singh, director, department of food and public distribution. Tasked with undertaking an assessment of ‘compliance and implementation’ of lockdown measures as per guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the team took a comprehensive review of the district administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in the city. The team which arrived on a two-day visit on Monday took a review meeting with the Pune district administration and other governing agencies and visited the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) besides some of the high stress containment areas such as Bhawani Peth. Pune, as of April 21, has had 53 Covid-19 related deaths and is the second biggest hotspot in Maharashtra next to Mumbai. Pune district Collector Naval Kishore Ram said the team has extended support, given numerous suggestions with regards to testing and outreach and checked the monitoring and surveillance system in Pune district. “They are doing a detailed study of Pune district in terms of all the arrangements, surveillance systems and other agencies working against the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 disease. Today (Monday) they visited one of the hotspots-- the Bhavani peth area-- and on Wednesday they will be going to Baramati,” added Ram. Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said the team checked various civic facilities such as flu centres, swab centres, shelter homes and the smart control room which is monitoring the overall work. “The team was with us from 10am to 3pm. Their main aim was to check the ground reality; especially home survey,” he said. At Bhavani peth, the team interacted with the residents there, asking them about how this survey was being conducted and what forms were being filled by them. Micro details like first visit results, second visit details and how the virus spread in the area was discussed, said Gaikwad. The team visited the hospitals where positive patients were quarantined and an isolation centre at Sinhgad College. Shelter homes at civic schools where migrant workers and homeless people have been lodged were examined and the people there spoken to. The team visited mobile clinics and asked about the medicines that were being given and the number of patients who were visiting. After their Pune visit, the team proceeded to Pimpri-Chinchwad. According to the order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the IMCT’s scope of assessment includes supply of essential commodities, social distancing measures, preparedness of health infrastructure, hospital facilities and sample statistics in the districts, safety of health professionals and availability of test kits, personal protective equipment kits, and condition of relief camps for labour and poor people. Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar briefed the central team during his review meeting on Monday and provided an overview of the steps taken by the administration to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic in Pune.Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham also briefed the team about initiatives and action by the police during the lockdown and measures taken to create awareness among the residents.Details about the police presence in the Pimpri Chinchwad industrial township and the situation of industries and IT companies during the lockdown were provided by Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissioner Sandeep Bishnoi.The Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioners, Shekhar Gaikwad and Shrawan Hardikar respectively, were also present at this meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/central-team-visits-hotspot-in-pune-takes-review-of-city-s-response-to-covid-19/story-gpFT897UBd1Aopat8T7EhI.html

They are undergoing treatment in isolation wards at their respective hospitals, civic health authorities said on Tuesday.Of these 38 patients, 27 are from Ruby Hall Clinic, which includes 24 nurses and three clinical staff. Also four from Sassoon General hospital (three nurses, one doctor); two nurses from Pune Adventist Hospital; two doctors from Sahyadri Super Speciality Hospital, Deccan Gymkhana; two doctors from the King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital; and one nurse from Naidu Hospital, have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the PMC health department.Dr Sanjay Pathare, director of medical services, Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “There are three clinical assistants and 24 nurses who have tested positive. The first nurse lives in Kasarwadi which is a red zone. She never worked in the isolation ward but she did come in touch with nurses who were working there. So we assume that nurse was probably infected from outside. When she returned to work after a week we noticed she has some symptoms and so we proactively tested her and found that she tested positive. We then tested all our staff and found that 27 of them are positive. We conducted mass testing of 1,000 people from our staff. All of them are asymptomatic and are in a stable condition.” All the staff members who have tested positive for Covid-19 have been quarantined at an isolation facility and all their primary contacts have been traced and tested, added Pathare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/38-medical-staffers-from-six-hospitals-test-ve-for-covid-19/story-l98xwvkjOHKRBBVG6a8F7L.html

The state government’s latest protocol also calls for a fourth drug- Lopinavir–Ritonavir - which is primarily used for HIV infections. This drug is only used if the patient has pneumonia (LRTI) without respiratory failure. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health chief, PMC said, “We are using anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs for the positive patients whereas for those who are showing symptoms like fever we are using anti-bacterial drugs like Azithromycin and Amoxicillin Clavulanate. We have not yet used any HIV drugs on any patient in the PMC hospital.”“The anti-malarial drug- Tab Hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral drug Cap Oseltamivir - was mainly used during the swine flu pandemic,” said Wavare.Dr Anand Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 in the district said, “Currently the drug protocol by the state government is that a schedule combination of the Cap Oseltamivir, Tab Hydroxychloroquine and if required Azithromycin and Amoxicillin Clavulanate. Also HIV drugs are being used on patients in Sassoon hospital where most critical patients are admitted. Those on ventilators have been given HIV drugs. “ In a revised protocol released on April 15 for treatment on Covid-19 patients with co-morbid conditions, the state government stated that supplements of Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin D and Magnesium Sulphate can be used to improve immunity and possibly reduce viral replication.PMC stock as of April 19Item QuantityCap Oseltamivir 75 mg- 8,800Tab Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg - 2,07,650 N 95 mask- 2,009PPE kits- 692Hand sanitisers (500 ml) - 818Hand sanitisers (90 ml) - 1,000Non-sterile gloves - 1,275Sodium hypochloride solution - 630 litresVTM kit - 1,200 testsTriple-layer surgical mask - 2,770||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/city-docs-using-three-drug-combination-to-treat-covid-19-patients/story-13BzyZqHzWSd7kdH3vc7vN.html

This move also marks the end of the crushing season for sugarcane in Maharashtra.According to Saurabh Rao, state sugar commissioner, labourers started returning to their hometowns, most to Ahmednagar, Beed and the adjoining areas of Marathwada. With these workers returning home, at least 130 sugar mills have stopped crushing.“We have given permissions to sugar factories who have proposed to send their cane-cutters home and have also made the necessary arrangements like food and transport for the labourers. As of Tuesday, around 12,000 labourers reached their native place. Before leaving, the cane cutters underwent thorough screening to assess any possibility of Covid-19 infection,” said Rao.Rao said that around 80,000 labourers were stranded in various sugar factories due to the lockdown.Mahrashtra sugar director Uttam Indalkar said, “Labourers from all the key sugarcane factories namely Bhimashanakar, Jawarhar, Kisan Veer, Rajaram Bapu, Indapur and Datta Shirol, departed for their homes. A total of 25,000 labourers left from factories between Monday morning and Tuesday evening. Rest of the labourers will reach their native places in two-three days after getting the requisite permission.”“After reaching the villages, the factory representative is taking the sarpanch’s signature,” Indalkar added.Balasaheb Bende, chairman, Bhimashankar sugar factory said, “We made arrangements for 5,000 labourers. Though the labourers will have no work at their native place, they are comfortable at their respective homes.

22-04-2020||Pune||Life without maids, helpers is tough for senior citizens during the lockdown in Pune||Living without maids and helpers to do daily household chores and help them around with errands is among the biggest woes for senior citizens in Pune, once famed as a pensioner’s paradise. Most senior citizens, especially those who do not have younger members in the family, or live alone, have been facing numerous problems like cooking food, obtaining groceries and medicines, ordering gas cylinders, cleaning and mopping the house, washing clothes and getting their medicines. Samad Shaikh (69), who stays in Laxmi Housing Society, Katraj said that ever since the closure delivery of gas cylinders has become an issue in his township.He stays with his wife who handles cooking and cleaning. “I have to carry the cylinder for 500 metres and more till the gate. None of the neighbours cooperate as they are afraid of the contagion. Neither do the security guards turn to help for the same. The task has become difficult and services to the senior citizens must be delivered right to their flats ,” he said.Celine D Souza (70), a senior citizen who resides in Camp, said, “Fetching medicines has become an uphill task as none of my helpers or maids are turning up for duty during the lockdown. Since my children stay abroad, the maids and helpers are there to assist me and prepare food. Now they are not there which has made the task difficult. I am not used to going out in the market and cooking due to old age. I wish the lockdown ends early and virus threat gets diminished at the earliest so that our routine comes back to normal.” She stays alone and social workers deliver food for her who now cater to her needs.Amardeep Singh, another senior citizen who stays in Salunke Vihar said that life has become harsh since the lockdown. “ All my daily needs were taken care by the maids and assistants, but now the situation is difficult. I am waiting for normalcy to return ,” he said. He stays with his wife who handles the chores currently. He did not know about the helpline for seniors.International Longevity Centre chairman Jayant Umranikar said that the immediate family members, relatives and society members where the senior citizens reside must come forward to assist them during this crisis. “There is no question to give any concession during this crisis. The Union government has given clear guidelines regarding the senior citizens and they must be followed as all the steps have been given. Social distancing is very important. Probably going for automation is important like having washing machines and other electronic equipment which bring about comfort,” he said.Social activist Vaishali Patkar, who has been working for the welfare for senior citizens, said, “They need care and attention at this juncture. Society residents need to have empathy and be sympathetic towards the senior citizens. Though people are doing their contributions for their cause, but the strong human connect is missing which definitely is a cause of concern. Citizens must voluntarily inquire about their well being, step out for buying ration for them, including medicine and treat them like their own.”The senior citizen helpline can be dialled anytime for help and is aimed at safety and security of elderly persons. The helpline alerts the respective police station officials from where they receive call for help and get the work done. At the same time the Social Security Cell (SSC) persons also work hard towards resolution of the problems faced by senior citizens for needs like gas cylinders, medicines and other social needs. In the lockdown, the helpline assistants help the senior citizens in providing LPG cylinders, food grains, medicines and milk. The SSC has a ready list of phone numbers of the medical shop owners , dairy owners and social workers through which it assists the elderly.Police inspector Vaishali Chandgunde, incharge of Social Security Cell (SSC) , said, “We are working with the Senior Citizens Forum to solve their problems. We are constantly answering their calls on the senior citizens’ helpline. A majority of calls were related to ration, gas cylinders, medicine and their wish to meet their relatives. We have helped 145 senior citizens for their different tasks wherein they have expressed their satisfaction for the efforts taken by the police department.” There are currently 18,000 senior citizens on police records and the data is available with the SSC.HELPLINE NUMBERS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS Police helpline 1090SSC Incharge Vaishali Chandgude 9011778787||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/life-without-maids-helpers-is-tough-for-senior-citizens-during-the-lockdown-in-pune/story-wLIy2XYXv6P2MyUMTlO6FJ.html

As far as the standard protocol is concerned, the government should send SMSs to the farmers on maintaining social distance,” Abhay said.The INLD leader added that by setting so many rules and complicating the procurement chain and process, the government was distancing the farmers from arhtiyas. “There is a lockdown in the country and shut grain markets are not good for the farmers,” he said.Haryana deputy speaker Ranbir Singh Gangwa, meanwhile, visited Mangali village to take stock of situation at two different purchasing centres. He directed the officials concerned at the grain market that only those farmers who are receiving messages must come to the grain market to sell their produce and facilities like clean water, hand sanitisers and masks should be provided to them.Congress leader Bajrang Dass Garg met farmers at the grain market here and directed officials to cover the grain properly during showers. He said, “By setting up multiple purchasing agencies, the state government is trying to push the farmers away from the commission agents. The farmers are ready to sell their crop to arhtiyas. Even commission agents always also help farmers whenever they are in need,” Bajrang Dass Garg added.‘Obey the roster plan’Hisar deputy commissioner (DC) Priyanka Soni directed the officials involved in purchasing of wheat and mustard to obey the roster plan and only allow those farmers in the purchasing centres who have received the SMS. In Sirsa, purchasing of wheat started at more than 35 out of 66 centres. Sirsa DC Ramesh Chander Bidhan visited some purchasing centres and checked the condition. LIGHT SHOWERS, STRONG WINDS LIKELY AHEADWith 0.8mm rainfall last night, the weather conditions have changed completely in many places in the state. The agriculture and meteorology department of Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University has predicted cloudy weather till April 25. Department head M L Khichar said, “The weather in the state will be variable till April 25, with partly cloudy and moderate winds, but there is a possibility of light to moderate rain with strong winds from till April 24.”Khichar advised the farmers to keep an eye on the changing weather conditions during the reaping of their crop. “The farmers must bundle up their produce so that it is laid to waste by the expected high-speed winds. They must also cover the crop while bringing it to grain markets for sale,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-crop-purchase-inld-leader-abhay-chautala-says-arhtiyas-like-atms-and-banks-for-farmers/story-iwg8FJ0ZEeUGmRZjwsp9hK.html
22-04-2020||World||Make no mistake, coronavirus will be with us for a long time: WHO chief||Covid-19 will stalk the planet for a long time to come, the World Health Organization said Wednesday, warning that most countries were still in the early stages of tackling the pandemic.WHO boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said some countries that thought they had the new coronavirus under control were witnessing a resurgence in cases, while there were troubling upward trends in Africa and the Americas.He also insisted that the UN health agency had declared a global emergency in good time on January 30 for countries to prepare and plan their response.The body has been heavily criticised by the United States for its handling of the pandemic but Tedros brushed off calls for him to resign.“Most of the epidemics in western Europe appear to be stable or declining,” Tedros told a virtual press conference in Geneva.“Although numbers are low, we see worrying upward trends in Africa, Central and South America, and eastern Europe.“Most countries are still in the early stages of their epidemics. And some that were affected early in the pandemic are now starting to see a resurgence in cases.“Make no mistake: we have a long way to go. This virus will be with us for a long time.”The global death toll has passed 175,000, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP, while more than 2.5 million declared cases have been registered since the epidemic first emerged in China in December.Tedros was pressed on whether the WHO had acted swiftly enough.“Looking back, I think we declared the emergency at the right time” on January 30, he said, adding that the world “had enough time to respond”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/make-no-mistake-coronavirus-will-be-with-us-for-a-long-time-who-chief/story-qyXNtZiIVQfWUXr5wbFdbK.html
22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump says US will destroy Iranian gunboats harassing US ships||US President Donald Trump said Wednesday he has ordered the US military to attack and destroy any Iranian vessel that harasses US Navy ships.“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump said on Twitter.The order came one week after 11 small armed Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps speedboats swarmed around six US Navy and Coast Guard ships in international waters in the northern Gulf.US Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist called Trump’s tweet “an important warning to the Iranians,” while not saying whether the US has altered its formal rules of engagement in the Gulf.“What he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense,” Norquist told reporters in a briefing.“What the president says sends a great message to Iran,” said General John Hyten, vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.“We know how to translate that into our rules of engagement ... They are based on the inherent right of self-defense, they are based on hostile intent and hostile act. That’s all we need in order to take the right action.”“Nobody should doubt that the commanders have the authority right now to respond to any hostile act or hostile intent,” Hyten said.Trump was referring to an incident that took place on April 15 while US Navy vessels were engaged in exercises as part of their patrols in the region.No shots were fired, but the Pentagon said the Iranians engaged in “dangerous and provocative actions” that risked collision or worse.The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps boats “repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of the US vessels at extremely close range and high speeds,” coming at one point within 10 yards (nine meters) of the bow of one ship.The much smaller IRGC Navy vessels ignored warnings from the US ships for about an hour before finally responding to radio communications and then leaving, the US side said.On Sunday, the Revolutionary Guards accused the US Navy of “unprofessional and provocative behavior” that had interfered with their own exercises, according to Mehr News Agency.Asked if Trump’s order specifically would mean that US ships could fire on Iranian fast boats doing exactly what they did on April 15, Hyten said it is up to the captain of the US vessel.“It depends on the situation, what the captain sees,” he said.“You can’t let a fast boat get in a position where they can threaten your ship.“If you come across and you’re in a safe distance and you’re waving, that’s one thing,” he said.“If you have a gun and you point it at me, that’s another thing ... So if you cross that line, we know what the line is and we will respond.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-will-destroy-iranian-gunboats-harassing-us-ships/story-ee6mn7VsOVFB9wMLWu0QsI.html
22-04-2020||World||Bangladesh virus hospitals accused of rejecting slum dwellers||Two Bangladesh hospitals dedicated to fighting the coronavirus are refusing to treat patients from one of the country’s worst slums, an activist said Wednesday.Members of the Bihari community -- descendants of refugees who fled to Bangladesh after the partition of India in 1947 -- say the pandemic has highlighted the discrimination they have endured for decades.Some 32,000 Bihari live in Geneva Camp -- one of the most desperate slums in the country -- where rights lawyer Khalid Hussain and police say two residents tested positive for coronavirus.Hussain said a state-run hospital meant specifically for COVID-19 patients had refused to admit the two, declaring their condition “not critical”.Now Geneva Camp residents were being rejected by another local hospital no matter what their health issue is, Hussain said, as staff fear they may catch the virus.The Biharis have faced discrimination for years, as the community is accused of backing Pakistan during Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence.About 500,000 live in 116 settlements across the country of 168 million.Bihari community leader Sadakat Khan Fakku said a man infected with coronavirus from another camp had also been turned away by a local hospital, and he was now self-quarantined in a one-room home with his family. None of the hospitals approached by AFP would comment on the allegations, but Nasima Sultana, deputy head of Bangladesh’s health department, denied discrimination.“There are 10 million slum people in Dhaka,” she told AFP.“We don’t have enough beds,” she added, saying people with mild symptoms should treat themselves at home.Advocate Hussain said the two infected men from Geneva camp had been isolated with 20 families, but that social distancing was almost impossible in so crowded a place.He said at least six people in the slum have died in recent weeks with coronavirus-type symptoms such as viral fever and respiratory problems.“None of them were tested, so we don’t know whether they had coronavirus,” he said.Bangladesh has officially said 120 people have died and 3,800 others been infected with coronavirus, but experts say more testing would reveal far higher figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-virus-hospitals-accused-of-rejecting-slum-dwellers/story-03LxQiANx3gnomOltJKKKK.html

Doctors also note the health benefits of outdoor physical exercise in boosting people’s immune systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-berlin-gets-pop-up-bike-lanes-to-boost-cycling-in-pandemic/story-4JXniei8HhyuSynE9rpJpL.html

The 100,000 figure was actually at the low end of a range topping out at 240,000 put forth by the White House coronavirus task force at the end of March. Earlier this month, the administration revised its estimates for deaths from the coronavirus to around 60,000.With 4% of world’s population but 21% of its prisoners, “the U.S. faces a unique challenge in mitigating the spread of Covid-19 and is likely facing a much higher death count than models based on data from other countries predict,” the ACLU said.The civil rights organization, which has filed dozens of lawsuits to get non-violent inmates released from jails, said it used data from more than 1,200 facilities around the U.S. and found that keeping more people out of jails would ultimately save lives, including in the surrounding communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prisoners-could-add-100-000-deaths-to-us-covid-19-toll-aclu-says/story-2wBOEAHyeNbmm0UF5iuWCI.html

In other words, those receiving green cards -- a big factor -- it will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis.”Short-term visas include H-1B, though he did not say, and tourism. They are exempted are some other categories, which he indicated, will be detailed in a subsequent order, which could include exemptions for humanitarian grounds in regards to the suspension of Green Cards.The president also indicated he could consider “what additional immigration-related measures should be put in place to protect US workers” but did not expand.People from India are the largest recipients of the these Green Cards. More than 1 million new immigrants are admitted to the United states every year, and India accounted for most with 126,000 in 2017, the latest such count available from a Pew research center study. It was followed by Mexico (124,000), China (121,000) and Cuba (41,000). Overall, people from Mexico comprise the largest group of foreign-born US national in 2018 at 25%, followed by India and China, with 6% each, according to the same reportThe president said he will review economic conditions at the end of the 60-day period to determine if he wants to extend the suspension or terminate it.Nearly 22 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits over the last four weeks and many more layoffs are feared as the economy teeters on the edge of the worst slowdown in US history, a situation compared by many economists to the Great Depression of 1929.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-sign-order-pausing-green-cards-today-indians-likely-to-be-hit-hardest/story-qiRYOpHy6iYuPhWYZQhtiO.html
22-04-2020||World||US Covid-19 fatalities started much earlier than previously known||The first US fatalities from the novel coronavirus took place weeks before previously known, according to autopsy results released Tuesday of two individuals in Santa Clara, California who had died on February 6 and February 17, way ahead of the February 29 death in Washington state considered the first .“Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown size,” Sara Cody, the chief medical officer of Santa Clara county, told the New York Times. “It feels quite significant.”These new fatalities change the US timeline by a quite a bit, specially as President Donald Trump has come under mounting for not doing enough in the month of February after restricting the entry of travelers from China, which he has tended to portray as the high-point of his administration’s response.The deadly pathogen would tear through the United States shortly and catapult it to the top of the casualty list for infections and fatalities. The toll went up by 2,751 in the last 24 hours to 45,075 and by 39,460 is to 825,306 confirmed cases. Deaths in New York state, the American epicenter of the epidemic, were up to 19,118 and 14,887 in New York city.These number may not reflect it, but the country is past the peak in terms of new cases, and some states have begun spooling back the restrictions alarming critics, but not the White House which has looked on indulgently, in line with the president’s backing of lockdown protestors.The president has also stoked anger against China with increasing attack on its role, alleging it may have misled the world on the origins of the epidemic, which Americans are saying could have started from a virology lab in Wuhan, the city that became the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak; and the then the exact magnitude of its crisis.Missouri state on Tuesday filed a lawsuit in a federal court alleged gross mismanagement of the crisis by China and sought damages. “Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment—thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable,” said the first of its kind lawsuit filed by the state’s Republican attorney general Eric Schmitt.Beijing dismissed the lawsuit as “malicious”. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters., “These so-called lawsuits are purely malicious abuses.”“Such abuses are not conducive to epidemic prevention and control in the United States, and also run counter to the current international anti-epidemic cooperation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-fatalities-started-much-earlier-than-previously-known/story-C6t8Lg6aMcdqoS09LFr2VO.html
22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump tells Navy to destroy any Iranian Gunboats harassing US||President Donald Trump said he’s ordered the U.S. Navy to destroy any Iranian gun boats that harass American ships at sea.Trump issued the warning “to shoot down and destroy” the ships in a tweet sent from his iPhone Wednesday morning. It comes after 11 gunboats from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps crossed the bows and sterns of American ships at close range last week.U.S. Central Command called the Iranian maneuvers “dangerous and provocative actions” in a statement, and said at the time that that American commanders on the scene “retain the inherent right to act in self-defense.”The U.S. military vessels were conducting joint integration operations in the international waters of the Persian Gulf when the Iranian ships harassed them, Central Command said in the statement.The Iranian ships came within a 50-yard point of approach with the USS Lewis B. Puller and within 10 yards of the bow of the Coast Guard cutter Maui, according to the statement. Iran has disrupted shipping routes in the Gulf and used asymmetrical warfare to undermine American interests across the Middle East, though rarely does it target U.S. ships directly.Trump’s comments could mark another flare up of tensions between the U.S. and Tehran.Going back to the Obama administration, Revolutionary Guard members in small but agile speedboats have harassed U.S. ships, but the encounters usually have ended with warnings from the Americans to back off. In 2017, a U.S. Navy guided-missile naval destroyer fired warning shots at four Iranian rapid-attack craft in the Strait of Hormuz.An Iranian surface-to-air missile system shot down a U.S. Navy surveillance drone last June while it was operating in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the drone was over its territory. The attack escalated regional tensions.Early this year, the U.S. killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. An Iranian counter attack on a U.S. base in Iraq didn’t kill anyone, but left American soldiers with head injuries, which Trump downplayed the severity of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tells-navy-to-destroy-any-iranian-gunboats-harassing-us/story-vq6UbT6hQ8i7mwk76DJTWP.html

Ramazan begins on the next day of the sighting of the new moon or the crescent. This year, Ramazan is likely to begin on Friday (April 24) depending on the moon-sighting on Thursday, April 23.The UAE’s moon-sighting committee will meet on Thursday and look for the crescent to formally announce the beginning of Ramazan from April 24. The first roza or fast will be kept on April 24 if the new moon on April 23.This year, the holy month is sure to begin on Friday, April 24, as April 23 is the last day of the month before Ramazan. The month before Ramazan is known as Sha’ban and consists of not more than 30 days.Since April 23 will be the 30th of the month of Sha’ban, Ramazan will most likely begin from Friday, April 24. The UAE moon-sighting committee will formally make the announcement after the maghrib (evening) prayer on April 23.The month-long fasting or Sawm (fasting from dawn till dusk) is one of the five pillars of Islam and is observed by Muslims across the world during Ramazan to inculcate a sense of self-restraint and patience. It is a period of devotion, forgiveness, repentance and self-reflection.The day starts with partaking a meal at the crack of dawn and ends by breaking the fast after sunset and saying the evening prayer. The month-long phase of fasting culminates into the day of feasting after the moon is sighted and Eid is celebrated to round off the holy month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/muslims-to-look-for-ramazan-moon-on-thursday-details-here/story-aKfWguOeo2gBTizR2RtusL.html

Harbin, the city of around 10 million is the capital of Heilongjiang province, which is close to the Russian border and has become the hardest coronavirus-hit region in China.“The gates of all communities and villages (of Harbin) will be guarded, residents who enter and exit must hold a health code, wear masks and show normal body temperatures, while no other people and vehicles will be allowed to enter,” new measures adopted by the Harbin government on Wednesday said. “Visits and gatherings between families and friends have also been prohibited. Weddings and funerals are also banned under the new anti-epidemic policy, and all public events including performances, forums and exhibitions have been suspended,” a state media report said.The city had reported 52 active confirmed cases and 23 asymptomatic infections as of Tuesday midnight.According to the tabloid Global Times, the chain of infection started from a Chinese student surnamed Han who had returned from New York.Han then passed the virus on to her neighbor, triggering a chain infections involving two hospitals after one among the infected – Chen, mentioned earlier -- was admitted to one hospital for a separate ailment.The national health commission (NHC) said it received reports of 30 new Covid-19 cases on the mainland on Tuesday, 23 of which were imported. The remaining seven were domestically transmitted, the NHC said, adding that all were reported in Heilongjiang.The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 82,788 by Tuesday, including 1,005 patients who were still being treated and 77,151 people who had been discharged after recovery, the NHC said.Altogether 4,632 people had died of the disease in China, it said.Heilongjiang has been on the frontline of China’s latest efforts to identify infected citizens arriving from Russia, with which it shares a border, so as to halt the virus. Earlier this month, Harbin authorities made 28 days of quarantine for all arrivals from abroad mandatory, with two nucleic acid tests and an antibody test for each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/near-lockdown-in-chinese-city-after-2-trigger-dozens-of-chain-infections/story-orw6Hri4NxlSau2wTPDMJO.html

A British charity believes so, and has begun training canines to sniff out the coronavirus following previous screening success with various illnesses.Medical Detection Dogs, set up in 2008 to harness dogs’ sharp sense of smell to detect human diseases, started working on the project late last month.In its training room in Milton Keynes, in central England, the dogs are being intensively trained to sniff out samples of the virus, and indicate when they have found it to receive a treat.The approach is based on a belief that each disease triggers a distinct odour, which canines are uniquely well-placed to smell.The charity has previously worked with its dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson’s disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from patients.“We believe dogs can detect COVID-19 and will be able to screen hundreds of people very, very rapidly so we know who needs to be tested and isolated,” Claire Guest, founder and chief executive of Medical Detection Dogs, told AFP.“We have evidence that dogs can detect bacterias and other diseases, so we believe that taking this project forward will make a huge difference to the ability to control COVID-19 spread.” Guest is working with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Durham University in northeast England -- the same team that recently collaborated to show dogs can be trained to detect malaria.James Logan, head of the LSHTM’s disease control department, said that project demonstrated dogs can smell odours from humans with “extremely high accuracy”.He added there was “a very high chance” that they would be able to detect COVID-19 in a similar way and potentially “revolutionise our response” to the disease.The team is aiming to train the dogs over a six-week period to help provide the “rapid, non-invasive diagnosis” tool.Canines can also detect subtle changes in skin temperature, potentially making them useful in determining if a person has a fever.If successful, the four-legged detection devices could be deployed at airports to identify people carrying the virus, according to Steve Lindsay from Durham University.The number of coronavirus cases around the world has now soared to 1,246,840, according to the latest figures Wednesday compiled by AFP from official sources.The number of actual infections is believed to be higher since many countries are only testing severe cases or patients requiring hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-dogs-detect-covid-19-canines-in-training-to-sniff-out-virus/story-kzBXuaOVdI0yzn9xqU6SaI.html

As a ventilated patient, Royal Papworth was incredibly important to my father and helped him through some very difficult times”.“We realised that it would be at the forefront of the Covid-19 epidemic and got in touch with some of our old friends there to ask if we could help,” she added.The 330 Chinese graduates of UK universities made personal donations of £38,000 to buy two ventilators for the National Health Service. The vital equipment was transported on a flight from Shanghai to London.The former students were part of the government’s Chevening programme which enables future global leaders to study in the UK. Minister of state for Asia Nigel Adams thanked them for the gesture.In an open letter, the alumni said from China: “We wish to show our support and care by standing with British people in fighting with the pandemic. We have good faith and wish a full and swift success in our joint effort”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stephen-hawking-s-family-chinese-alumni-donate-ventilators-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-kxi3eN274Ms81oXCCc7zXJ.html
22-04-2020||World||‘Nothing short of absurdity’: China on US lawsuit against it on Covid-19||China on Wednesday dismissed as “nothing short of absurdity” and violation of sovereignty the lawsuit filed by the US state of Missouri which alleges that Beijing suppressed COVID-19 information, arrested whistle-blowers and denied its contagious nature, leading to the loss of life and causing “irreparable damage” to the world.Filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, the lawsuit was submitted by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt against the Chinese government, the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), and other Chinese officials and institutions.It alleges that during the critical weeks of the initial outbreak, the Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistle-blowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.The lawsuit seeks relief on one count of public nuisance, one count of abnormally dangerous activities, and two counts of breach of duty.Remedies could include civil penalties and restitution, abatement of the public nuisance, cessation of abnormally dangerous activities, punitive damages and more, it said.Reacting to the lawsuit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: “this so-called accusation has no factual and legal basis. It is nothing short of absurdity”.He reiterated that since the outbreak, the Chinese government has been acting in open, transparent and responsible manner to report the information to the US and other countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) besides issuing general sequence of the virus.Geng said China is in communication with the US on this issue since January 3, ensuring updates.“This is part of China’s important contribution and recognised by the international community. This so-called litigation is a malicious abuse of litigation. It violates the basic law and principle of equal sovereignty in international law.“The Chinese government’s response in the pandemic is not under the jurisdiction of US courts,” he said.Geng said that such abuse of ligation is not conducive to epidemic response at home in the US and also runs counter to international cooperation.“What the US should do is to refute and reject such abuse of litigation,” he said.Besides the lawsuit, China faced stringent criticism from US President Donald Trump and its top politicians and officials including allegations of cover-up and underreporting of coronavirus casualties.While China has reported 82,788 novel coronavirus cases, including 4,632 fatalities, the US registered over 824,600 cases and more than 45,290 deaths -- the highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nothing-short-of-absurdity-china-on-us-lawsuit-against-it-on-covid-19/story-aGxrV1hrlNAB5VfLg5qRYM.html

While including some exemptions, the ban could be renewed for another 60 days or longer, he said, and a second order was also being considered.Some questions remained over the details of the order, the latest in a series of steps the Republican president has taken to clamp down on immigration, a signature election campaign issue that helped propel him to the White House in 2016.The move could face obstacles, with some legal experts saying a broad, worldwide order curbing legal immigration would likely be challenged in court.Critics have also said they view Trump’s new policy as an effort to distract from his response to the coronavirus pandemic as he seeks re-election in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-will-sign-order-prohibiting-immigration-wednesday/story-W4BgibUwQt5eOENAPyIlfJ.html

But the coronavirus pandemic has forced parliament to move ‘hybrid’ sessions.Under the new arrangement, of the 650 MPs, a maximum of 50 are allowed to be physically present in the chamber, with 120 others joining from their homes via video-link. House authorities release a ‘call list’ of members chosen to ask questions during the day.David Mundell, secretary for Scotland, was listed on Wednesday, but could not connect through the video-link. The home-based MPs appear on several screens installed inside the chamber.Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fielded probing questions from the newly-elected Labour leader, Keir Starmer, in person, while Ian Blackford, leader of the third-largest party, the Scottish National Party, used his time from home.Starmer thanks speaker Lindsay Hoyle to allow the House to resume under the new arrangement so that the government could be held to account, particularly given the growing concerns over gaps in testing and personal protection equipment.Raab revealed that 69 medical staff died after being infected by the virus, including Manjeet Singh Riyat, 52, who was an accident and emergency consultant in Derbyshire. He faced repeated questions over the promise to test 100,000 people every day by the end of April.Raab said Johnson is making a “good recovery” while recuperating in the prime minister’s country residence of Chequers in Buckinghamshire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sans-sound-and-fury-uk-s-virtual-parliament-session-begins/story-qGvJypoKfv1BH6ZCly9cwN.html

22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s ‘game changer’ Hydroxychloroquine not effective against Covid-19: Study||Hydrochloroquine, the anti-malaria drug which US President Donald Trump called a “game changer” against COVID-19, is not effective against the disease, according to a study which raises concerns about the drug’s widespread usage by many governments across the world in fighting the pandemic. The yet to be peer-reviewed study, published in the preprint server medRxiv, made a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in all the Veterans Health Administration medical centers across the US. The scientists, including those from the University of South Carolina in the US, analysed the associations between the use of drugs hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and corresponding clinical outcomes. According to the researchers, hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in COVID-19 therapy based on anecdotal evidence. In the study, the scientists assessed data on patients hospitalised with confirmed infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11. They categorised 368 patients based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone, or with azithromycin, in addition to standard supportive management for COVID-19. The two primary outcomes noted in the study were death, and the need for mechanical ventilation. Based on the findings, the scientists said there is no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The scientists said they took into account the variation in the baseline characteristics of the patients across the three groups. “Hydroxychloroquine use with or without co-administration of azithromycin did not improve mortality or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients,” the scientists wrote in the study. On the contrary, they said, hydroxychloroquine use alone was associated with an increased risk of death compared to standard care alone. “Although ongoing randomized, controlled studies are expected to provide more informative evidence about hydroxychloroquine in the coming months, the outcomes observed in our study represent the best available data,” the researchers wrote in the study. Some limitations of the research, mentioned by the scientists, include the possibility of selection bias of study participants. They said the study comprised only men whose median age was over 65 years, adding that the results may not necessarily reflect outcomes in women or in younger hospitalized populations. “The findings from this retrospective study suggest caution in using hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized Covid-19 patients, particularly when not combined with azithromycin,” the researchers concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-game-changer-hydrochloroquine-not-effective-against-covid-19-study/story-4V1DoPbS1SGy8xF5avO8WP.html

He had first joined Al Qaeda before moving to Daesh (the Arabic acronym for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) in Afghanistan as a fighter. Then, he moved up the ladder.By the time he was arrested by the National Directorate of Security along with his boss ISKP chief Aslam Farooqui on April 4, Munib Mohammad had become a member of the Central Council of Khurasan branch of Daesh.When the ISKP set up its coordination centre, Munib Mohammed was put as the man in charge of “coordinating with terrorist groups and intelligence agencies of the region”, a NDS statement said.The pointed reference to “intelligence agencies of the region” in the official statement is an euphemistic reference to Pakistan’s ISI.Besides, the statement said Munib’s job description at the ISKP also involved coordinating with other terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taib, Haqqani network, Sipah-e-Sahaba, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam related to Maulvi Fazal-ul-Rehman and Taliban Peshawar Shura.This is the first time that the NDS, after its spectacular operation on April 4 that netted the ISKP chief Aslam Farooqui aka Mawlawi Abudullah, has spoken about Munib Mohammad’s arrest.The massive security operation, backed with pin-pointed intelligence, is believed to have decimated the top leadership of the Pakistan-sponsored module of the ISKP.Also Read: Pakistan proxies in fight to the finish in Afghanistan, but India too needs to prepThe arrests came days after Farooqi’s ISKP claimed responsibility for the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed 27 people, including an Indian national. Among those arrested was also a Kashmiri, Aijaz Ahmad Ahangar, who had disappeared 25 years ago and was the chief recruiter for the IS in Jammu and Kashmir.Aslam Farooqui on the instructions of Haqqani Network and LeT used Kerala resident Muhsin Tikaripur along with three other Urdu-Punjabi speaking attackers to massacre 27 innocent Sikh men and women in Shor Bazaar, Kabul, a counter-terror operative in Delhi said.Aslam Farooqui, a Pakistani national with long-standing ties to the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, had also detailed some aspects of his group’s collusion with the ISI.It was a development that had been anticipated in Islamabad, which promptly called in Afghan ambassador Atif Mashal to seek custody of Aslam Farooqui. An official statement by Pakistan’s Foreign Office later insisted that Farooqui “was involved in anti-Pakistan activities in Afghanistan”.The request was firmly rejected by Afghanistan in less than 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iskp-commander-who-was-its-bridge-with-pak-s-isi-lashkar-arrested/story-WMZW0v2NkXMm1fk18C110L.html

So that is for exercise in the water,” she told reporters in Sydney.“The sand is closed: which means no running, no walking, no gathering, no bringing your kids down to play in the sand and have a paddle in the water.”Bondi and nearby beaches were closed in late March after photos circulated online showing mostly young beachgoers packed together on the sands in defiance of a ban on large outdoor gatherings.The area was also designated a COVID-19 “hotspot” after more than 180 cases were detected among backpackers and residents, prompting health authorities to establish a pop-up testing clinic.Masselos urged non-residents not to visit Bondi, saying the beach corridors would close if demand was too high.“We want to make sure it operates within the social distancing and public health order rules,” she said.“And if people are not going to respect that and if the numbers are too great, regrettably we will have to close those.”Other Sydney beaches, including Coogee and Maroubra, reopened Monday to the sound of loudspeaker announcements warning swimmers to abide by social distancing rules.Australia has recorded more than 6,600 cases of COVID-19, and 74 deaths from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-bondi-beach-to-reopen-for-surfing-as-virus-cases-slow/story-AT884esYdBSt3U4dju1P3N.html

Instead they are destined for the needy, hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The sign on the mosque’s window asks anyone who can to leave something, and says those in need can take something.Abdulsamet Cakir, 33, imam of the Dedeman mosque in the Sariyer district, came up with this idea of reaching out to the poor via the place of worship after Turkey suspended mass prayers in mosques until the risk of outbreak passes.Turkey’s official death toll from the virus now stands at 2,259 after 119 more deaths were reported on Tuesday, and major cities including Istanbul will be under lockdown for four days from Thursday.“After the suspension of mass prayers, I had an idea to revive our mosque by bringing together well-off people with the people in need,” Cakir told AFP inside the mosque, where bags of food and cleaning products were piled up on the floor.The young imam, who takes the products from the floor and places them on the shelves at the entrance, said he was inspired by a donation culture in the Ottoman period called “charity stone” -- a small pillar stone erected at certain locations of the city to connect rich people with the poor.‘Tough situation’In this Ottoman system aimed at giving charity in a dignified manner without offending the needy, people with means would leave whatever amount they wanted in a cavity on the top of the charity stone.Those who were in need would then take the amount they needed and leave the rest for others.“After the coronavirus pandemic, we have thought about what we can do to help our brothers in need,” said Cakir, who would already help the poor in his neighbourhood before the outbreak.“With the inspiration from our ancestors’ ‘charity stone’ culture, we decided to fill the racks in our mosque with the help from our brothers with means,” he added.Cakir hangs a list on the wall of the mosque where citizens who need help write their names and telephone numbers.The imam later sends the list to local authorities who check whether the names are really in need and his team then sends a message that they can visit the mosque and receive whatever they need: eight items at maximum.“I am really in dire need. My husband doesn’t work. I used to clean houses but since the virus, they no longer call,” Guleser Ocak, 50, told AFP.“I wrote my name on the list before. I received a message today to pick up aid,” she said. “We are in a tough situation.”‘No cash’The mosque has been providing services for two weeks and reaches out to 120 people in need per day. And the list includes over 900 people.A maximum of two people wearing masks and gloves enter the mosque and take what they need, while others wait outside, standing a few paces from each other.“We spread the services through the day. We call 15 people for each half an hour, so that we respect social distancing and do not cause big queues,” the imam said.“We are doing our best to help our sisters and brothers in the best possible way without offending them,” he added.The mosque does not accept cash donations and instead receives aid packages.“Producers also donate. A miller brings in flour, a baker brings in bread, a water distributor brings in water,” Cakir said.The mosque’s shelves are full of products sent from all over Turkey and even abroad.“Everyone does whatever they can to help people in need. For example, a brother who lives in France did online shopping and directed the aid to our mosque,” he said.“What the mosque is doing is really, really good for us. Ramadan is coming,” said Duygu Kesimoglu, 29, referring to the Muslim fasting month beginning this week.“I am unfortunately jobless, they don’t employ us because of the coronavirus. No job, no money. This help is very, very good,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-mosque-turned-into-temporary-supermarket-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/story-QfEBt4cS1GFBF60f3TAwQO.html

A maximum of 50 MPs will be able to be present in the Chamber at any one time to comply with social distancing guidelines.A maximum of 120 MPs will be able to take part remotely over the course of any ‘hybrid proceedings’, which will constitute the first two hours of each sitting. Under the terms of the motion, the House will continue to meet at its usual sitting times, but only on Mondays (from 2.30pm), Tuesdays and Wednesdays (both from 11.30am).Foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson recuperating from cornavirus infection, will face Keir Starmer, the newly-elected Labour leader, during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday.Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said: “By initiating a hybrid solution, with steps towards an entirely virtual Parliament, we are enabling Members to stay close to their communities, while continuing their important work scrutinising the Government.”“I do not want Members and House staff putting themselves at risk. By working virtually, this is our contribution to the guidance of stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-house-of-commons-goes-virtual-from-wednesday-120-mps-to-join-remotely/story-ofIRnB2SVqxfggNkoxMwAO.html

Both Edhi and the prime minister as well as the two other people seen in the picture were not wearing protective masks.Edhi later told a TV news channel that he and two industrialists had spent around six to seven minutes with the premier.In the last five days, Khan has presided over many meetings and met important individuals including President Arif Alvi and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed.Sultan further said the tally of Covid-19 cases in the country was expected to reach between 12,000 and 15,000 by the end of current month according to the government estimates.He added that though the coronavirus situation in the country was better than that in other countries and it was necessary to keep it under control.Edhi has placed himself in self-quarantine at Islamabad’s Edhi Home.Mohammad Bilal, spokesperson for the Edhi Foundation said the test was conducted two days ago at Al-Shifa hospital in the federal capital.“We feel he contracted the virus in Islamabad, as he has been there for a week,” he added.Edhi has been on the forefront in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic with his charity organisation. He is also a member of the Sindh’s coronavirus emergency fund.His son, Saad Edhi, said his father had started developing symptoms including mild fever and headache soon after meeting the prime minister. He added that the symptoms lasted for four days after which he had himself tested and was diagnosed positive for the disease.In a video message, Faisal Edhi said he was not suffering from any symptoms at the moment but his results had come back positive.He urged his foundation to continue working hard to provide relief to people.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Pakistan rose to 9,749 on Wednesday after new infections were confirmed in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-undergoes-covid-19-test-after-he-met-charity-head-who-tested-positive-for-infection/story-QPWJxSyMMJqu0WW6lwRdRJ.html
22-04-2020||World||Missouri lawsuit alleges China caused coronavirus pandemic||The state of Missouri filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the global pandemic.The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the state’s top lawyer, alleges Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.”Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt in a written statement said the Chinese government lied about the dangers of the virus and didn’t do enough to slow its spread.“The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,” he said. “They must be held accountable for their actions.”It’s unclear whether the lawsuit will have much, if any, impact. U.S. law generally prohibits lawsuits against other countries with few exceptions, said Chimène Keitner, an international law professor at University of California, Hastings College of the Law.“The legal problem is, it’s just not possible,” said Keitner, who recently wrote a blog titled “Don’t Bother Suing China for Coronavirus.”Missouri Democratic Party Executive Director Lauren Gepford called the lawsuit a “stunt” by a Republican attorney general who is up for re-election this year.The number of Missouri deaths statewide rose by 16 Tuesday to 215, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The number of cases rose by 156 to 5,963.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missouri-lawsuit-alleges-china-caused-coronavirus-pandemic/story-qUaB9HbMeFuuEh6KXHwNpJ.html
22-04-2020||World||Hong Kong reshuffles government as debate rages over Beijing’s role||Hong Kong unveiled a government shake-up on Wednesday that it said was aimed at reviving the financial hub’s beleaguered economy and had nothing to do with a recent controversy over Beijing’s role in the city’s affairs. Director of Immigration, Erick Tsang, will replace Patrick Nip as head of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said, shortly after China’s state council said it had approved the appointments. The move comes two days after Nip apologised for conflicting statements over the role of two Beijing institutions overseeing the global financial centre’s affairs. Nip has been reassigned as the head of the city’s civil service, replacing Joshua Law. “Hong Kong is in a very difficult position now, apart from the pandemic, we are going through a major economic recession with high unemployment and so we really need to start planning for Hong Kong’s economic recovery,” Lam said at a briefing. The government also announced new secretaries for technology, financial services and home affairs. Some lawmakers said the moves reflected Beijing’s tightening grip over the city. “This is not an ordinary reshuffle. This is a show of power,” Civic Party lawmaker Alvin Yeung told Reuters. Political tensions have escalated in Hong Kong over the past week after Beijing’s top representative office in the city said it was not bound by a law that restricts interference by other mainland Chinese agencies in the former British colony.The remarks prompted conflicting statements from the Hong Kong government regarding the legal status of Beijing’s Liaison Office, and Nip apologised for the confusion.Hong Kong returned to Beijing in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, and its high degree of autonomy is widely seen as key to its prosperity as an international financial hub.Many in Hong Kong fear Beijing is increasingly meddling in the city’s affairs, which the central government denies. A war of words intensified last week when Beijing’s top official in Hong Kong urged the local government to work to enact national security legislation “as soon as possible”, fuelling worries over what many see as encroachment on the territory’s freedoms. Fear that Beijing is flexing its muscle over Hong Kong risks a revival of anti-government protests after months of relative calm amid social distancing rules to curb the spread of the coronavirus.The government shake-up is the biggest under embattled leader Lam, who has rejected repeated calls to step down even after admitting she had caused “unforgivable havoc” by igniting political turmoil last year. Protests that escalated in June evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, which is expected to rebuild momentum once social distancing rules to curb coronavirus are lifted. Hong Kong’s Security Secretary John Lee said on Wednesday the Chinese-ruled city was facing the risk of “home-grown terrorism” after several police reports of finding explosive materials.Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office also ratcheted up tensions last week when it slammed opposition lawmakers who use “malicious filibustering” to paralyse the legislature, where a backlog of bills has angered the central government. Days later, authorities arrested 15 pro-democracy activists in the city’s biggest crackdown on the movement, drawing a swift rebuke from Washington and London. Beijing said on Tuesday it supported the arrests, adding certain “radicals” in the city were blind to the interference of outside forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-reshuffles-government-as-debate-rages-over-beijing-s-role/story-2i6zBGG3qCaxnTQFl0bD7K.html
22-04-2020||World||Taiwan Navy ship outbreak may threaten success against Covid-19||A coronavirus outbreak on one of Taiwan’s navy ships has raised concerns that a re-infection could threaten one of the world’s success stories in the fight against the pandemic.Twenty-eight sailors on a navy supply ship were confirmed to have the virus shortly after it returned from a visit to Palau earlier this month. Taiwan’s defense minister apologized Tuesday night and said he was willing to resign if requested to do so by the island’s president Tsai Ing-wen.Tsai apologized at a briefing Wednesday, saying Taiwan is investigating the outbreak on the navy ship, and that the president should take responsibility. She said the navy ship was on an annual routine drill and “special” mission, which she didn’t specify, and only visited Palau.The apologies come amid growing concern the military mishandled the outbreak after 744 personnel from three ships that visited the Pacific island nation were allowed to disembark after arriving back in Taiwan on April 9. Health officials first reported infections from the ship last week.The incident could blemish what has otherwise been a success story in containing the virus, which has infected more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Taiwan has managed to keep its outbreak largely under control, with businesses and schools remaining open and the number of confirmed infections totaling just 426.The democratically run island had reported no new infections for three days last week, raising hopes it was close to overcoming the worst of the virus.Biggest Cluster“This is the biggest cluster infection in Taiwan so far,” Chan Chang-chuan, dean of the College of Public Health at National Taiwan University, said Wednesday. “It’s regrettable that Taiwan paid little attention to this part while it has done extraordinarily well in other areas.”Chan said Taiwan’s prowess at locating suspected cases quickly using mobile phones and other technology pointed to it being able to limit the spread in the broader community.Still, “it’s concerning that it could trigger a second wave on infections in Taiwan,” he said. “So we urge the government to test as many suspected cases as possible.”Health officials confirmed a 28th infection from the naval vessel Wednesday, a student who had previously tested negative for the virus.The Taiwan navy cluster comes as the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which operates in the region, has been under intense scrutiny over its handling of the coronavirus. Brett Crozier, captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, was dismissed for writing a memo warning the service about the potentially dire situation aboard the carrier.As it battled the pandemic, Taiwan was also forced to scramble its navy to monitor the movements of China’s Liaoning aircraft carrier group, which conducted exercises around the island earlier this month. Beijing considers the island part of its territory, a claim Taiwan’s government rejects.Taiwan Hopes Nimbler Weapons Can Stave Off an Invasion by ChinaGrant Newsham, a retired U.S. marine officer and senior research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies, warned that Taiwan’s leadership shouldn’t overreact to the outbreak.“When you’ve got the People’s Liberation Army intimidating you -- and threatening even more than normal, it’s important to show you’re ready and able to fight. Perceptions matter,” he said. “Given the problems facing the U.S. Navy in the region -- arguably as a result of overreacting to the virus -- it’s especially important that the People’s Republic of China doesn’t think the timing is right to ‘make a move’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-navy-ship-outbreak-may-threaten-success-against-covid-19/story-cBqiop7qbmFxBQIDA4j0fL.html
22-04-2020||World||Early Covid-19 patients, recovered fully, test positive again after 70 days||China has successfully slowed the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19, and in outbreak epicentre Wuhan, life also returned to normal.But a new mystery is now baffling the doctors in China: A growing number of patients who had recovered from the Sars-CoV-2 virus continue to test positive without showing symptoms.Those patients all tested negative for the virus at some point after recovering, but then tested positive again, some up to 70 days later, the doctors said. Many have done so over 50-60 days.A man told news agency Reuters that he had stayed at three hospitals in Wuhan before being moved to a flat in the centre. He had taken over 10 tests since the third week of February, he said, on occasions testing negative but mostly positive. “I feel fine and have no symptoms, but they check and it’s positive, check and it’s positive,” he said. “What is with this virus?”The prospect of people remaining positive for the virus, and therefore potentially infectious, is of international concern, as many countries seek to end lockdowns and resume economic activity as the spread of the virus slows. Currently, the globally recommended isolation period after exposure is 14 days.China has not published precise figures for how many patients fall into this category. But according to Reuters, there are at least dozens of such cases.In South Korea, about 1,000 people have been testing positive for four weeks or more. In Italy, the first European country ravaged by the pandemic, health officials noticed that coronavirus patients could test positive for the virus for about a month.“We did not see anything like this during SARS,” said Yuan Yufeng, a vice president at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, referring to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak that infected 8,098 people globally, mostly in China.Meanwhile, Wang Guiqiang, director of the infectious disease department of Peking University First Hospital, said at a briefing on Tuesday that the majority of such patients were not showing symptoms and very few had seen their conditions worsen.“The new coronavirus is a new type of virus,” said Guo Yanhong, a National Health Commission official. “For this disease, the unknowns are still greater than the knowns.”Experts and doctors struggle to explain why the virus behaves so differently in these people.Some suggest that patients retesting as positive after previously testing negative were somehow reinfected with the virus. This would undermine hopes that people catching Covid-19 would produce antibodies that would prevent them from getting sick again from the virus.Other South Korean and Chinese experts have said that remnants of the virus could have stayed in patients’ systems but not be infectious or dangerous to the host or others.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 patients jumped by 1,383 in India on Wednesday, pushing the country’s tally to 19,984, according to the health ministry. Fifty people died due to the disease in the last 24 hours, the health ministry data further said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-concern-for-world-recovered-covid-19-patients-test-positive-even-after-70-days/story-CouvKuRui8UsqQxj8mg1nN.html
22-04-2020||World||‘All the measures are a joke’: Putin faces ire of Russia’s entrepreneurs||Moscow entrepreneur Anastasia Mesheryakova is scathing about the assistance from President Vladimir Putin’s government as she fights to prevent the collapse of her family-owned chain of cafes.“All the measures they’ve announced are just a joke,” said the 43-year-old. “I’ve only got myself to rely on.”The crisis, which could wipe more than 5% off the Russian economy this year thanks to the twin blow of coronavirus and the plunge in oil prices, may prove even more devastating for hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Long squeezed by high levels of corruption and bureaucratic harassment, the sector could shrink by as much as half, potentially costing millions of jobs, according to one forecast.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe authorities’ failure to stop the meltdown of businesses that account for a fifth of economic output could pose a political problem for the Kremlin as Putin moves to extend his 20-year rule. While the entrepreneurial class is tiny compared to the Russian leader’s core support base of state workers and pensioners, businesspeople are often more politically active, especially in Moscow.“Putin is losing the entrepreneurial class,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, an analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center. “The gradual erosion of the economy and the political system’s legitimacy will cause huge problems for him.”Putin’s New $14 Billion Stimulus Plan Seen Falling ShortWhile wealthier European countries like Germany are paying up to 80% of workers’ salaries in firms hit by the economic turmoil triggered by the virus, Russia is covering only a fraction of wage costs while offering only delays in paying tax and rent bills. Putin promised a big increase in government economic support last week, but business groups say the measures still fall short of what’s needed. Most aid is going to big companies, many state controlled.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakKremlin officials concede their assistance efforts aren’t enough. They say the programs will pick up in the coming weeks as the authorities have substantially increased the money available after taking a cautious approach in the early days of the epidemic. But the plunge in prices for oil, Russia’s main export, has the Kremlin leery about spending too much of its reserves now in case things get worse.“We’re not members of the European Union and we don’t issue our own reserve currency, so there are limits to our economic policy,” Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on state television last week. The government’s latest steps will help about half a million businesses, with more than 3 million workers, he said, and there’s more to come. The authorities also say they’re suspending audits and other checks that bureaucrats often used to pressure businesses.“The latest measures are a step forward, but not a big one,” said Alexander Khurudzhi, head of a business-support group that works closely with the government. The new monthly grants to help pay salaries, though modest at only 12,130 rubles ($164) per worker, “are the first efforts that could be more or less effective,” he said.Those payments, which start only next month, could come too late for many companies. More than one in seven small businesses say they’re already at risk of imminent bankruptcy, according to a survey by the Center for Strategic Research in Moscow. The group forecasts the share of small businesses could drop to 18% this year from 20% last.Oleg Vyugin, a former senior official at the central bank and Finance Ministry, says that share could drop as low as 10%. The government is willing to let small businesses go bust because it takes the “cynical view” that others will eventually take their place, he said.The deferrals on tax and rental payments offered by authorities are useless for Vyacheslav Mukhin, who runs cosmetics stores in 14 shopping centers -- all currently closed.“You’ll still end up having to pay this sooner or later,” Mukhin said. “Officials live on a different planet.”This crisis is far worse than the two previous downturns, in 2008-2009 and in 2014-2015, according to Putin’s business ombudsman, Boris Titov. The government’s latest aid is “better than no support at all but these measures aren’t enough to allow companies to survive,” he said.Nonexistent thirty years ago when the Soviet Union collapsed, the sector was once as much as a quarter of the economy but has shrunk in recent years as behemoths in commodities and other industries have grown.Mesheryakova started her Coffee Piu chain of seven cafes with her husband, opening the first outlet seven years ago, and reached an annual revenue of 200 million rubles. If things don’t start to get back to normal by end of May, she says she’ll have to lay off her 100 staff and liquidate the business.“They don’t want us,” she said. “We’re a nuisance, there are too many of us and we all have our own opinion. Big companies are easier to control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-the-measures-are-a-joke-putin-faces-ire-of-russia-s-entrepreneurs/story-YFzZYU3KtsdpLoxG3cvPQP.html
22-04-2020||World||China’s early patients test positive for Covid-19 two months after recovering||Dressed in a hazmat suit, two masks and a face shield, Du Mingjun knocked on the mahogany door of a flat in a suburban district of Wuhan on a recent morning.A man wearing a single mask opened the door a crack and, after Du introduced herself as a psychological counsellor, burst into tears.“I really can’t take it anymore,” he said. Diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in early February, the man, who appeared to be in his 50s, had been treated at two hospitals before being transferred to a quarantine centre set up in a cluster of apartment blocks in an industrial part of Wuhan. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhy, he asked, did tests say he still had the virus more than two months after he first contracted it?The answer to that question is a mystery baffling doctors on the frontline of China’s battle against COVID-19, even as it has successfully slowed the spread of the coronavirus across the country.Chinese doctors in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, say a growing number of cases in which people recover from the virus, but continue to test positive without showing symptoms, is one of their biggest challenges as the country moves into a new phase of its containment battle.Those patients all tested negative for the virus at some point after recovering, but then tested positive again, some up to 70 days later, the doctors said. Many have done so over 50-60 days.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe prospect of people remaining positive for the virus, and therefore potentially infectious, is of international concern, as many countries seek to end lockdowns and resume economic activity as the spread of the virus slows. Currently, the globally recommended isolation period after exposure is 14 days.So far, there have been no confirmations of newly positive patients infecting others, according to Chinese health officials.China has not published precise figures for how many patients fall into this category. But disclosures by Chinese hospitals to Reuters, as well as in other media reports, indicate there are at least dozens of such cases.In South Korea, about 1,000 people have been testing positive for four weeks or more. In Italy, the first European country ravaged by the pandemic, health officials noticed that coronavirus patients could test positive for the virus for about a month.As there is limited knowledge available on how infectious these patients are, doctors in Wuhan are keeping them isolated for longer. Zhang Dingyu, president of Jinyintan Hospital, where the most serious coronavirus cases were treated, said health officials recognised the isolations may be excessive, especially if patients proved not to be infectious. But, for now, it was better to do so to protect the public, he said.     He described the issue as one of the most pressing facing the hospital and said counsellors like Du are being brought in to help ease the emotional strain.     “When patients have this pressure, it also weighs on society,” he said.DOZENS OF CASES The plight of Wuhan’s long-term patients underlines how much remains unknown about COVID-19 and why it appears to affect different people in numerous ways, Chinese doctors say. So far global infections have hit 2.5 million with over 171,000 deaths.As of April 21, 93% of 82,788 people with the virus in China had recovered and been discharged, official figures show.Yuan Yufeng, a vice president at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, told Reuters he was aware of a case in which the patient had positive retests after first being diagnosed with the virus about 70 days earlier.     “We did not see anything like this during SARS,” he said, referring to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak that infected 8,098 people globally, mostly in China.     Patients in China are discharged after two negative nucleic acid tests, taken at least 24 hours apart, and if they no longer show symptoms. Some doctors want this requirement to be raised to three tests or more. China’s National Health Commission directed Reuters to comments made at a briefing Tuesday when asked for comment about how this category of patients was being handled. Wang Guiqiang, director of the infectious disease department of Peking University First Hospital, said at the briefing that the majority of such patients were not showing symptoms and very few had seen their conditions worsen.“The new coronavirus is a new type of virus,” said Guo Yanhong, a National Health Commission official. “For this disease, the unknowns are still greater than the knowns.”    REMNANTS AND REACTIVATION    Experts and doctors struggle to explain why the virus behaves so differently in these people.    Some suggest that patients retesting as positive after previously testing negative were somehow reinfected with the virus. This would undermine hopes that people catching COVID-19 would produce antibodies that would prevent them from getting sick again from the virus.Zhao Yan, a doctor of emergency medicine at Wuhan’s Zhongnan Hospital, said he was sceptical about the possibility of reinfection based on cases at his facility, although he did not have hard evidence.     “They’re closely monitored in the hospital and are aware of the risks, so they stay in quarantine. So I’m sure they were not reinfected.”    Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said the virus may have been “reactivated” in 91 South Korean patients who tested positive after having been thought to be cleared of it.   Other South Korean and Chinese experts have said that remnants of the virus could have stayed in patients’ systems but not be infectious or dangerous to the host or others.Few details have been disclosed about these patients, such as if they have underlying health conditions.Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of East Anglia’s Norwich School of Medicine, said an unusually slow shedding of other viruses such as norovirus or influenza had been previously seen in patients with weakened immune systems.     In 2015, South Korean authorities disclosed that they had a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome patient stricken with lymphoma who showed signs of the virus for 116 days. They said his impaired immune system kept his body from ridding itself of the virus. The lymphoma eventually caused his death.Yuan said that even if patients develop antibodies, it did not guarantee they would become virus-free. He said that some patients had high levels of antibodies, and still tested positive to nucleic acid tests. “It means that the two sides are still fighting,” he said.    MENTAL TOLLAs could be seen in Wuhan, the virus can also inflict a heavy mental toll on those caught in a seemingly endless cycle of positive tests.Du, who set up a therapy hotline when Wuhan’s outbreak first began, allowed Reuters in early April to join her on a visit to the suburban quarantine centre on the condition that none of the patients be identified.One man rattled off the names of three Wuhan hospitals he had stayed at before being moved to a flat in the centre.  He had taken over 10 tests since the third week of February, he said, on occasions testing negative but mostly positive.     “I feel fine and have no symptoms, but they check and it’s positive, check and it’s positive,” he said. “What is with this virus?”Patients need to stay at the centre for at least 28 days and obtain two negative results before being allowed to leave. Patients are isolated in individual rooms they said were paid for by the government.The most concerning case facing Du during the visit was the man behind the mahogany door; he had told medical workers the night before that he wanted to kill himself. “I wasn’t thinking clearly,” he told Du, explaining how he had already taken numerous CT scans and nucleic acid tests, some of which tested negative, at different hospitals. He worried that he had been reinfected as he cycled through various hospitals.His grandson missed him after being gone for so long, he said, and he worried his condition meant he would never be able to see him again. He broke into another round of sobs. “Why is this happening to me?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-early-patients-test-positive-for-covid-19-2-months-after-recovering/story-iqTtqU7yNvGtVy1FjOOj8M.html
22-04-2020||World||North Korean media silent on Kim Jong Un’s whereabouts||North Korean state media on Wednesday made no mention of leader Kim Jong Un’s health or whereabouts, a day after intense international speculation over his health was sparked by media reports he was gravely ill after a cardiovascular procedure.North Korean media presented a business as usual image, carrying routine reporting of Kim’s achievements, publishing his older or undated quotes on issues like the economy.South Korean and Chinese officials and sources familiar with U.S. intelligence have cast doubt on the South Korean and US media reports, while the White House said it was closely monitoring the matter.US President Donald Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons, said the reports had not been confirmed and he did not put much credence in them.“I just hope he’s doing fine,” Trump told a White House news conference on Tuesday. “I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un. And I’d like to see him do well. We’ll see how he does. We don’t know if the reports are true.” Asked whether he would try to reach out to Kim to check on his condition, Trump said: “Well I may, but I just hope he’s doing fine.”Speculation about Kim’s health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea’s founding father and Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15.On Wednesday, the main headlines from KCNA included pieces on sports equipment, mulberry picking, and a meeting in Bangladesh to study North Korea’s “juche” or self-reliance ideology. The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried older or undated remarks attributed to Kim in articles about the economy, the textile industry, city development, and other topics.As usual Kim’s name was plastered all over the newspaper, but there were no reports on his whereabouts.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported late on Monday that Kim, who is believed to be about 36, was hospitalised on April 12, hours before the cardiovascular procedure.The story’s English version carried a correction on Tuesday to say the report was based on a single unnamed source in North Korea, not multiple as it earlier stated.It said his health had deteriorated since August due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork, and he was now receiving treatment at a villa in the Mount Myohyang resort north of the capital Pyongyang. ‘EXTENDED SILENCE IS UNUSUAL’ On Tuesday, CNN reported an unnamed US official saying that the United States was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in grave danger after surgery.However, two South Korean government officials rejected the CNN report and South Korea’s presidential Blue House said there were no unusual signs from North Korea. China, North Korea’s only major ally, also dismissed the reports.Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, told Fox News the White House was monitoring the reports “very closely”.“There’s lots of conjecture going around,” a senior Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity late on Tuesday when asked if there was confirmation of the reports.North Korea experts have cautioned that hard facts about Kim’s condition are elusive, but said his unprecedented absence from major celebrations for his grandfather’s birthday last week signals that something may have gone awry.Thae Yong Ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected to South Korea in 2016, said state media’s extended silence is unusual because it had been quick to previously dispel questions about the status of its leadership. “Every time there is controversy about (Kim), North Korea would take action within days to show he is alive and well,” he said in a statement. His absence from the April 15 anniversary worship, in particular, is “unprecedented,” Thae said.Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who rules North Korea with an iron fist, coming to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult, especially on matters concerning its leadership, given tight controls on information. There have been past false reports regarding its leaders, but the fact Kim has no clear successor means any instability could present a major international risk.Trump said he had asked Kim about succession in the past but declined to elaborate.“The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family,” said O’Brien. “But, again, it’s too early to talk about that because we just don’t know what condition Chairman Kim is in and we’ll have to see how it plays out.”With no details known about Kim’s young children, analysts said Kim’s sister and loyalists could form a regency until a successor is old enough to take over.In recent years, Kim has launched a diplomatic offensive to promote himself as a world leader, holding three meetings with Trump, four with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and five with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Kim has sought to have international sanctions against his country eased, but has refused to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, a steadfast demand by the United States.

22-04-2020||World||Harvard University says it didn’t get small business aid after Trump threat||Harvard University denied Tuesday that it applied for or received funding through the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses grappling with the coronavirus crisis, after President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House he planned to force the school to pay back federal assistance.“President Trump is right that it would not have been appropriate for our institution to receive funds that were designated for struggling small businesses,” the university said in a statement Tuesday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that the program wasn’t intended for publicly traded companies that had other ways to access funding, and that his department would be issuing guidelines soon in an effort to get those corporations to give back the forgivable loans to the federal government.The Shake Shack Inc. burger chain said earlier this week it planned to return a $10 million loan it received through the program amid public outrage that the package benefited chain restaurants and hotels rather than local businesses.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakAs Mnuchin was discussing the effort, Trump interjected to say Harvard will also “pay back the money.”“They shouldn’t be taking it,” Trump said. “When I saw Harvard -- one of the largest endowments anywhere in the country, maybe the world, and they are going to pay back that money.”The university -- which had an endowment valued at $40.9 billion as of June -- said it had received funding under a separate $14 billion program targeted at higher education institutions in the $2.2 trillion relief package passed by Congress late last month. That program grants universities assistance based on a formula that looks at overall enrollment and the number of students receiving federal financial aid, and at least half the funding must be provided directly to students affected by the coronavirus.“Like most colleges and universities, Harvard has been allocated funds as part of the CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund,” Harvard said in a statement. “Harvard has committed that 100% of these emergency higher education funds will be used to provide direct assistance to students facing urgent financial needs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”Harvard says it would give the all the $8.6 million it received directly to students, despite being eligible to spend half that on its institutional costs related to the virus. Other top-tier and highly-endowed universities also received funding under the program. Yale University was allocated $6.8 million, the University of Chicago got $6.2 million, and Stanford University took nearly $7.4 million in federal assistance.Late Tuesday evening, Trump posted on Twitter that Harvard should “give back the money now.” He did not say if he meant the $8.6 million.“Their whole ‘endowment’ system should be looked at,” the president added.The White House earlier Tuesday declined to comment on whether the administration would still seek to claw back Harvard’s grant under the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-university-says-it-didn-t-get-small-business-aid-after-trump-threat/story-2ApJCjZTxb0iYjjC0YRjCL.html
22-04-2020||World||US agency gives thumbs-down to Donald Trump’s ‘game-changer’ hydroxychloroquine Covid-19 drug combo||A panel of experts called by US government’s top infections diseases agency on Tuesday recommended against the use of a combination of an antimalarial drug and an antibiotic that President Donald Trump has touted as a potential “game-changer” in treating Covid-19.The experts’ panel said in guidelines for Covid-19 treatment that except for the purposes of clinical trials it “recommends against” the use of the antimalarial drug Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin, the antibiotic, “because of the potential for toxicities”.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here But it left open the use of Hydroxychloroquine or another version of it, Chloroquine, by itself, saying there is insufficient data to recommend for or against its use, but warned clinicians that if they did administer it, they should “monitor the patient for adverse effect”.Also, an analysis published Tuesday on the use of Hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients in US Veteran Affairs hospitals showed no benefits and caused more deaths. Researchers and experts have said the study was not rigorous enough, and more data is required.The panel of experts that issued the guidelines was convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a federal agency headed by Anthony Fauci, a member of President Trump’s White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak.Also read: Trump’s 60-day immigration suspension to impact those seeking green cardsFauci had previously, and repeatedly, cautioned against overestimating the benefits of the drug, or the combination, arguing there was no tested evidence it works against Covid-19. And he had been blunt about it, making his case from the podium of the White House daily briefing by the task force with the president looking on.Fauci did not attend the Tuesday briefing. When asked, Trump said he had not seen the guidelines.The president has been an outspoken advocate of the antimalarial drug by itself and in combination with the antibiotic. “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” he wrote in a tweet on March 21.Also read: Lockdowns may have only arrested first waveThe president pressed in tweets and remarks to reporters despite public pushback from his experts. A key part of his argument wast: “What do you have to lose”. The drug, Hydroxychloroquine, had been proven to be safe for for decades of being prescribed to malaria patients and even if ti did not work on a Covid-19 patient it will do them no harm.The panel experts has concluded it can be harmful in combination with the antibiotic. On its own, the drug has been allowed for clinical trials, which are currently underway on Covid-19 patients in New York, the epicenter of the American outbreak that infected 824,438 people all over the country and killed 45,052 by Tuesday night.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageIndia lifted restrictions on the export of a bunch of drugs this month to allow a consignment of Hydroxychloroquine to ordered by the United States at the urgent request by President Trump to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month. India is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of the medicine and has deployed it for large-scale use as a prophylactic for healthcare workers.Hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy against the coronavirus has faced worldwide scrutiny and it has not fared very well. Hospitals in Sweden stopped using Chloroquine earlier this month after reports of severe side effects and researchers in Brazil aborted a trial after the death of patients administered the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agency-gives-thumbs-down-to-donald-trump-s-game-changer-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-drug-combo/story-UHBUuHFEaZvwwJrvoDFhII.html
22-04-2020||World||New Zealand could pull off bold goal of eliminating Covid-19||While most countries are working on ways to contain the coronavirus, New Zealand has set itself a much more ambitious goal: eliminating it altogether.And experts believe the country could pull it off.The virus “doesn’t have superpowers,” said Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland. “Once transmission is stopped, it’s gone.”Geography has helped. If any place could be described as socially distant it would be New Zealand, surrounded by stormy seas, with Antarctica to the south. With 5 million people spread across an area the size of Britain, even the cities aren’t overly crowded.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAnd Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has taken bold steps, putting the country under a strict lockdown in late March, when only about 100 people had tested positive for the new virus. Her motto: “Go hard and go early.”New Zealand has so far avoided a widespread outbreak, and new cases have dwindled from a peak of about 90 per day in early April to just five on Tuesday, leaving the goal tantalizingly close. Only 13 people have died so far, and Ardern has been personally briefed on each death.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus,” Ardern told reporters last week. “But it will continue to need a team of 5 million behind it.”Petousis-Harris said the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other places.“New Zealand got everything right,” she said. “Decisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.”Ardern on Monday announced the country would stay in lockdown for another week before slightly easing some work restrictions to help restart the economy. Most of the social restrictions will remain in place.She also tried to temper expectations of her goal, saying elimination didn’t mean that new cases wouldn’t arise in the future but they would be stamped out immediately.New cases are likely when New Zealand eventually reopens its borders, but questions remain about how well prepared the health system is to implement effective contact tracing should a widespread outbreak occur. Petousis-Harris pointed to problems last year when the country failed to contain a measles outbreak.Even if New Zealand does purge itself of the virus, the effects will linger. Before the outbreak, tourism was booming. About 4 million people visited each year, drawn by stunning scenery and the lure of adventure sports. The industry employed more than 300,000 people and accounted for about 10% of New Zealand’s entire economy.“It’s been devastating. No question at all,” said Stephen England-Hall, the chief executive of Tourism New Zealand, a promotional agency. “No one can really plan to go from 100% to zero in three days.”A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that because of its reliance on tourism, New Zealand’s economy could initially be one of the hardest-hit by the coronavirus among developed nations.The government, which came into the crisis with its books in relatively good shape, has been handing out billions of dollars in temporary wage subsidies to try and prevent mass unemployment. More than half the nation’s workforce has suddenly become reliant on government handouts.Still, most people appear to support Ardern’s strict lockdown, under which schools are closed and people working nonessential jobs can leave home only for groceries or exercise. Google mobility data indicates there has been high compliance.Many have found creative ways to cope, like 28-year-old personal trainer Jessee James. Instead of meeting her clients in gyms or at their homes, she’s been leading virtual sessions over Zoom and FaceTime.Some of her clients are using cans of beans instead of dumbbells, or laundry baskets instead of sandbags. Many want to talk more about their feelings, like the business owner who needed to lay off employees or the client with emotional issues who needs encouragement.“Normally they would just talk to the people around them,” James said. “It’s been quite different.”One of the most symbolic casualties of the outbreak has been Air New Zealand. The airline had been a source of pride for many as it expanded internationally and won industry awards. In a series of frank updates, Chief Executive Greg Foran described how the carrier had reduced flights by 95% and would need to cut its workforce by at least 3,750.One person who doesn’t yet know if he will retain his job with the airline is 27-year-old pilot Scott Beatson. He and partner Bella Ashworth, who just finished law school, bought a house earlier this year, and they’re both now worried about their futures.“It’s quite sad,” Beatson said. “Just before the lockdown, I was talking with a baggage loader and a check-in person, and everyone took such pride in the company.”An eager fisherman and hiker, Beatson has taken to camping in his backyard while stuck at home. Like many around the country, he’s been tuning into some of the daily briefings given by Ardern and Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health.An unassuming official who spent a year working at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Bloomfield’s calm and reassuring presence has turned him into an unlikely heartthrob.Singer Maxwell Apse wrote a song about Bloomfield that has been viewed more than 75,000 times on YouTube. “If I had one wish, I would make it this: I’d be in your bubble,” go the lyrics.When New Zealand does come out of its bubble, the path forward remains unclear. It will need to continue relying on its traditional strength in farming to sell things abroad like dairy products, kiwifruit and wine.Some have suggested the country could first reopen its borders to Australia, which has also been successful in flattening its virus curve.England-Hall, the tourism executive, said New Zealand will look to first rebuild the domestic tourism market. He said being virus-free could eventually become a selling point abroad for the country.The conundrum is that to stay virus-free, New Zealand may need to continue its current requirement that new arrivals spend two weeks in quarantine. Given that the average tourist in the past has stayed for about 11 days, it seems an insurmountable obstacle.Ever the optimist, England-Hall foresees a new type of tourism product in which wealthy people could be pampered during a quarantine period — a kind of isolation spa.But with travel curtailed, some worry that New Zealand could revert to a more insular version of itself, before cheap flights allowed its citizens to roam the world, and foreigners to visit. A place where isolation can be both a blessing and a curse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-could-pull-off-bold-goal-of-eliminating-covid-19/story-OwbdoTl9KJTsGUnAg9HfGN.html
22-04-2020||World||Plan to use hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment receives setback||The plan to use much touted anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine for treating Covid-19 patients has received a setback with more deaths being reported among those who were given the drug, according to a report.While another report suggested that there was insufficient clinical data to either recommend or oppose the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating those infected with the deadly virus. President Donald Trump, who has been aggressively promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, said that he would look into the reports.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  His administration has stockpiled more than 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, a large chunk of which has been imported from India. “I don’t know of the report. Obviously, there have been some very good reports and perhaps this one’s not a good report. But we’ll be looking at it. We’ll have a comment on it at some point,” Trump told reporters during his daily White House news conference on coronavirus.Also read: Trump-backed drug to be tested on thousands in Mumbai slumsTrump was responding to a question on a study released by a group of scientists on use of hydroxychloroquine with or without antibiotic azithromycin for 368 Covid-19 patients. The unreviewed study submitted to New England Journal of Medicine for publication and posted online found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalised with Covid-19. “An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone,” said the study that was funded by the National Institute of Health or NIH. NIH in its report ‘Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Currently Under Investigation’ said that there are insufficient clinical data to either recommend or oppose using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19.If chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used, clinicians should monitor the patient for adverse effects, especially prolonged QTc interval, it said.Also read: ICMR study shows side effects of HCQ in health care staff The panel of NIH experts recommended against the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin because of the potential for toxicities. US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen M Hahn said that no final decision has been taken as yet.“I’ve mentioned from this podium and in other venues before, what FDA is going to require is data from clinical trials, randomised clinical trials, hydroxychloroquine/placebo, to actually make a definitive decision around safety and efficacy,” he told reporters.The first one is a small retrospective study at the VA. “And similar to the data we talked about before with the French study, this is something that a doctorate would need to consider as part of a decision in writing a prescription for hydroxychloroquine,” he said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “But the preliminary data are helpful to providers. I want to ask them (doctors) to incorporate the data as we have it come forward. It’s not definitive data. It doesn’t help us make a decision from a regulatory review.” “But doctors should incorporate that in the decision-making they make on a one-on-one basis,” Hahn said in response to a question. Congressman Bill Pascrell said the report analysing hydroxychloroquine as a potential COVID-19 treatment at veterans hospitals is a bombshell indictment of the damage Trump and his administration does to Americans by putting politics before science. “The world class medicine and doctors we enjoy today are the fruit of generations of painstaking work by our ancestors. Evidence-based science is the only way out of this crisis, not unproven miracle therapies personally favored by Donald Trump,” he said.“Trump’s frequent touting of this treatment was deeply irresponsible, and may have heaped unnecessary pain and suffering, not to mention false hope, upon Americans struck by this terrible illness.” “I have repeatedly warned the FDA about the danger of prizing Trump’s political pressure over scientific process. Unless we are guided by science and science alone, we will have more unnecessary deaths on our hands,” Pascrell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plan-to-use-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-treatment-receives-setback/story-iWZ8TY7XXbxYigGXTQymdI.html
22-04-2020||World||Political wrangling, controversy mark re-opening of US states||Governors of about half a dozen US states pushed ahead on Tuesday with plans to partially reopen for business despite warnings by some health officials that doing so could trigger a new surge in coronavirus cases.The easing of sweeping restrictions in Georgia, South Carolina and other mostly Southern US states follows protests against rules imposed during the pandemic that shut down businesses and largely confined residents to their homes.A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed a majority of Americans believed stay-at-home orders should remain in place until public health officials determine lifting them is safe, despite the damage to the US economy.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“It’s a matter of concern, this whole idea of opening up. It’s based on non-science generated parameters,” Dr. Boris Lushniak, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Health, told Reuters in an interview. Deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, topped 45,150 nationwide as cases climbed to over 810,000, according to a Reuters tally. New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan each reported their highest single-day coronavirus-related death tolls - over 800 between the three states. New York state, the epicenter of the US outbreak, reported 481 new deaths.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak Governors are under pressure from businesses and some constituents to relax stay-at-home orders that have thrown over 20 million people out of work in the past month alone.In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers who filed a lawsuit against Democratic Governor Tony Evers, challenging his stay-at-home order that runs until May 26.CDC WARNS OF FALL OUTBREAKTensions between US President Donald Trump, a Republican, and local officials have risen over the US government’s role in ramping up testing, which infectious disease experts say is key to enable a safe reopening. Those experts say the United States, with a population of nearly 330 million people, should test 3 million per week to get an accurate sense of the virus’s reach. States have tested only a third of that number in the past seven days, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Even as states move ahead with plans to reopen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned a second wave of the coronavirus could be worse if it coincides with the start of seasonal flu season.“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post.Georgia is among a half dozen states that will allow more business activity this week or next.Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, will allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys, tattoo and massage parlors to reopen on Friday, followed by movie houses and restaurants next week. Kemp said his plan balances public health with the need to reignite the state’s economy, saying social distancing rules would remain in place.Georgia has reported 174,000 positive cases and six deaths per 100,000 people, both below the national average, according to a Reuters analysis of data collected by the Covid Tracking Project.But the state also has one of the lowest testing rates, giving health officials less data on the reach of the illness to base decisions on reopening, the data showed.“Don’t go out,” Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a Democrat, told residents of the eastern Georgia city during a news conference. “People will not come here if they think our businesses are not safe.”CUOMO MEETS TRUMPNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo emerged from a meeting with Trump at the White House and said the president had agreed to help his state procure chemical reagents and other supplies needed to double testing capacity. Cuomo said it was up to his state to help labs boost their testing capacity and to organize the workers needed to take more samples.“That is an intelligent division of labor,” Cuomo said at a press briefing. “Let each level of government do what it does best.”The governor said New York would try to double the number of people it tests each day - including diagnostic and antibody tests - to 40,000, characterizing the task as an “enormous undertaking” that would take weeks.Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of California, the most populous US state, said despite evidence the outbreak was slowing there, cases and deaths were still rising. Over the seven-day period ending on Sunday night, the number of deaths in California nearly doubled, and the number of new cases increased by nearly 50%, state data showed.Newsom promised to release a detailed plan for testing and reopening on Wednesday, but cautioned it was too soon to loosen public health restrictions.In Washington, D.C., the US Senate unanimously approved $484 billion in additional coronavirus relief for the US economy and hospitals treating patients sickened by the pandemic, sending the measure to the House of Representatives for final passage later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/political-wrangling-controversy-mark-re-opening-of-us-states/story-Yrws1N0bDqsjH8x6gquSjJ.html
22-04-2020||World||Trump agrees to help New York double coronavirus testing: Governor||US President Donald Trump agreed to have the federal government help procure chemical reagents and other supplies needed for New York to double its testing capacity for the novel coronavirus, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday.Cuomo, speaking at a briefing after meeting with Trump in Washington earlier in the day, also said the president indicated he would work to get federal funding to states in the next financial aid legislation to be passed by Congress.With coronavirus-related hospitalizations trending lower in New York, Cuomo has in the past few days turned his attention to the challenge of widespread testing, which he has said would be critical to getting New Yorkers back to work.Cuomo said Trump had agreed in their White House meeting to have the federal government take charge of securing materials that the manufacturers who supply New York’s state labs have struggled to procure from overseas.The governor added that it was up to his state to help the labs boost their testing capacity and to organize the workforce needed to take more samples from the population.“That is an intelligent division of labor,” Cuomo told the briefing. “Let each level of government do what it does best.”Cuomo said New York would aim to double the number of people it tests each day - including diagnostic and antibody tests - to 40,000. He characterized it as “an enormous undertaking” that would take several weeks, without being specific on timing.New York, which is the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, has reported 257,000 cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, and nearly 20,000 deaths, accounting for nearly half of the country’s fatalities.Along with other governors, Cuomo has called on the federal government to provide direct cash assistance to the states, a request that has so far gone unanswered in the stimulus packages passed by Congress.The National Governors Association has called on Congress to grant a total of $500 billion to all states to help shore up battered finances.New York, which is facing a $10 billion to $15 billion budget shortfall, needs the infusion of cash to pay the salaries of teachers, police officers, healthcare workers, Cuomo said.“You know the state governments are broke,” Cuomo said, adding that Trump had indicated he understood the situation and had said he would “work hard” to get funding for the states in the next round of legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-agrees-to-help-new-york-double-coronavirus-testing-governor/story-q2XpAc1iB86372uwWDfeUM.html
22-04-2020||World||‘Would like to see him be well’: Trump on Kim Jong Un’s health||US President Donald Trump said he doesn’t know about Kim Jong Un’s health after American and South Korean officials gave differing accounts on the North Korean leader’s condition after he was conspicuously absent from a major celebration.“I wish him well, we’ve had a good relationship,” Trump said Tuesday in response to a question about Kim at a White House. The U.S. president said “we don’t know” if the reports about Kim’s health deteriorating are true, adding that he might reach out to check on him.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicUS officials said Monday they were told Kim was in critical condition after undergoing cardiovascular surgery last week and they were unsure of his current health. Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s office said that Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakKim continued to be absent from North Korean state media as of Wednesday morning. Neither the state broadcaster nor the official Korean Central News Agency mentioned new public appearances by the leader, although they continued to publicize his messages to dignitaries around the world.“I just hope he is doing fine,” Trump said. “I had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un and that is to the benefit of the country. That is not a bad thing, that’s a good thing, and i would like to see him be well. We will see how he does. again, I don’t know that the reports are true.”Trump and Kim have gone from trading insults in 2017, when North Korea was testing nuclear weapons and missiles that could deliver them to the US, to striking up what Pyongyang officials describe as “mysteriously wonderful chemistry” after meeting three times since a summit in June 2018. Despite the unprecedented talks and the bonhomie between the two, there have been non indications that Kim has slowed down his production of weapons of mass destruction.The health of Kim, overweight and a heavy smoker, is one of North Korea’s most closely guarded secrets, known by a handful of people in the inner circle of leadership. While North Korea had scaled down major events as it battles the coronavirus pandemic, speculation about Kim had been growing since his unprecedented absence from April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung, one of the biggest days on the country’s calendar.Even the most well-informed North Korea experts find it hard to tell what’s happening in the secretive state. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that gathers information from informants inside the isolated nation, separately reported that Kim underwent a “cardiovascular surgical procedure” and was now mostly recovered.“I do not trust such reports. If he has a serious health problem, only a handful of confidantes will know,” said Chun Yungwoo, a former South Korean envoy to international nuclear talks with North Korea. “Usually such a state secret cannot be leaked.”North Korea’s state media reported on April 11 that Kim attended a Politburo meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party. The next day it said he inspected a military unit, but didn’t reveal the date of that visit. There have been no state media reports since them on him at any event.Kim has made 17 public appearances this year that were mentioned in state media -- at a pace of a little more than one a week -- South Korea’s Unification ministry said. That’s slightly down from 84 public appearances last year.The BloodlineHe has been shown in state media in recent months appearing at military drills and riding a white horse on the country’s revered Mt. Paektu, where state propaganda says his grandfather used as a guerrilla base to fight Japanese colonial occupiers and his father was born.Any leadership crisis in North Korea could have ramifications for regional stability, as well as for talks with the US over the country’s nuclear arsenal. Kim, who took power in 2011 following his father’s 17-year reign, developed the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to any part of the US before engaging in direct talks with Trump over his arsenal and sanctions imposed on the state.While there’s been little time for him to groom a successor, Kim raised the status of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong as a key player in the secretive state. She was thrust into the global spotlight when she served as envoy to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and became the first member of the immediate ruling family to visit Seoul.“We can’t completely rule out his sister yet, although it would be unprecedented for their system causing much confusion because she’s a woman, but on the other hand, she’s part of the Mt. Paektu bloodline,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and Nuclear Policy at the International Crisis Group, referring to the mountain seen as the symbol of Kim family rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/would-like-to-see-him-be-well-trump-on-kim-jong-un-s-health/story-klABKRa2oYgcH52QJO4AtK.html
22-04-2020||World||US records more than 2,700 deaths from Covid-19 pandemic in last 24 hours: Report||The coronavirus death toll in the United States -- the country with the most fatalities in the pandemic -- has climbed by 2,751 in the past 24 hours, the latest tally from Johns Hopkins University showed Tuesday.The US has recorded more than 800,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to the Baltimore-based university, with 44,845 deaths.Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported between Monday at 8:30pm local time, and Tuesday at the same time, the university said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-more-than-2-700-deaths-from-covid-19-pandemic-in-last-24-hours-report/story-u2OPfDMzXgsgnT6JGe89iJ.html
22-04-2020||World||CDC chief warns 2nd Covid-19 wave may be worse, arriving with flu season||A second wave of the coronavirus is expected to hit the United States next winter and could strike much harder than the first because it would likely arrive at the start of influenza season, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday.“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Washington Post in an interview.As the current outbreak continues to taper off, as shown by a recent decline in hospitalization rates and other indicators, authorities need to prepare for a probable resurgence in the months ahead.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time,” he said, and the combination would put even greater strain on the nation’s healthcare system than the first outbreak.The virus, which causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory illness dubbed COVID-19, emerged late last year in central China. The first known U.S. infection, a travel-related case, was diagnosed on Jan. 20 in Washington state near Seattle.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakSince then, nearly 810,000 people have tested positive in the United States, and more than 45,000 have died from the disease.Redfield and other public health authorities credit drastic stay-at-home orders and widespread business and school closings across the country for slowing the spread of infections. But the restrictions have also stifled American commerce while throwing at least 22 million people out of work over the past four weeks.Even as the lockdown is gradually eased, Redfield stressed the importance of individuals continuing to practice social distancing among one another.At the same time, he said, public health authorities must vastly ramp up a testing system to identify those who are infected and to locate their close personal interactions through contact tracing.Asked about the recent flurry of street protests of stay-at-home orders and calls for states to be “liberated” from such restrictions - as President Donald Trump has advocated on Twitter - Redfield told the Post: “It’s not helpful.”Building a nationwide contact tracing network, key to preventing newly diagnosed cases from growing into large outbreaks, poses a major challenge because it is so labor intensive, requiring a workforce that by some estimates would require as many as 300,000 personnel.Redfield said the CDC is discussing with state officials the possibility of enlisting and training workers from the U.S. Census Bureau, and volunteers from Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, to create a new contact tracing workforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-chief-warns-2nd-covid-19-wave-may-be-worse-arriving-with-flu-season/story-EJosAHOydnoIAYZPd8cV3L.html
22-04-2020||World||US Senate approves new $480 bn coronavirus pandemic relief package||The US Senate approved a bipartisan, nearly half-trillion-dollar coronavirus relief package Tuesday, with funding earmarked for devastated small businesses, overwhelmed hospitals, and a ramp-up of testing nationwide during the pandemic.The essential job-saving measure, which passed by unanimous consent after more than a week of negotiations between Democrats, Republicans and the White House, now heads to the House of Representatives where a vote could occur as early as Thursday.The effort is the government’s latest massive cash infusion to prop up a collapsing economy amid struggles to contain a pandemic that has killed 43,000 Americans and left some 22 million people jobless.“This is a significant package,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, one which was cobbled together “on a crash timeline in these most unusual circumstances.”The measure builds on the $2.2 trillion rescue legislation -- the largest-ever federal intervention in the US economy -- signed into law last month. President Donald Trump called on Congress to swiftly send him the bill, which would re-fund a program that has already helped more than 1.6 million businesses, so he can sign it into law.“I urge the House to pass the bill, and they’ll be voting on it, I imagine, very soon,” he said.Late last month, with many shops and restaurants nationwide forced to shutter due to the pandemic, the government launched the PPP to provide $350 billion in what were essentially grants as long as businesses use the funds to pay their workers.Banks were flooded with requests, and the money quickly ran out.The new tranche would include $320 billion in small business funding, plus $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion to expand coronavirus testing, McConnell said.It also provides $60 billion in disaster recovery loans and grants, he added.“We have taken a giant step forward” towards providing more relief for small businesses and for first responders in hospitals, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said.Schumer claimed Democratic victory for obtaining funding for testing, and he praised Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief of staff Mark Meadows for agreeing to include it.“We will not get America moving again until we have a national, well thought out, well executed testing program -- and this administration doesn’t have one,” Schumer said.State funding later Republicans wanted to pass a measure to fund just the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, but ultimately testing and hospital funding was included.Schumer said considerable PPP money will be reserved for minority-run small businesses and those without access to large financial institutions.The deal leaves out a key Democratic demand: extra funding for state and local governments battling the pandemic.Trump said he wants such funding included in the next coronavirus rescue package, and congressional leaders said the forthcoming bill was already in the works.The next measure will be “bigger, bolder, better” than the interim deal, Schumer said.With the 100-member Senate having postponed its full sessions until May 4 due to coronavirus, Tuesday’s vote occurred during a pro forma session, which usually features few lawmakers but can pass legislation if there is unanimous consent.The measure passed, but McConnell made clear any subsequent aid package, including funding for state and local governments, would only be considered “when the Senate is back in session, with full participation” in Washington.A vote in the House, also on recess, this week could be complicated. The House is unlikely to pass the job-saving package by unanimous consent as the Senate did.Number two Democrat Steny Hoyer said it likely will have to convene a House session where more than half the members return to Washington to attend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-approves-new-480-bn-coronavirus-pandemic-relief-package/story-0VOk7AqPJMsWljFBFu83HP.html
22-04-2020||World||Boris Johnson’s government faces first political test of lockdown||Boris Johnson’s coronavirus strategy faces its first major political test since the U.K. was put on lockdown a month ago when members of Parliament question ministers in a sitting conducted via video-conference.The prime minister remains out of action recovering from his own severe case of Covid-19, and will not be in the House of Commons to answer questions when Parliament resumes its scrutiny of the government’s plans Wednesday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn his place will be Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, facing opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer. While both Raab and Starmer will be in the chamber, in a historic first, most of the members of Parliament taking part will be doing so via Zoom videoconferencing technology.That session, and the statement after it from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, will give ministers a sense of how much pressure they’re under from MPs to start easing the lockdown that Johnson imposed March 23. For nearly a month, most shops and all restaurants and bars have been closed, in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. That’s due to continue for another three weeks.The “virtual Parliament” will lack the drama of normal sessions, with only 50 MPs allowed in the chamber, meaning it’s likely to be a more subdued affair. The limits of videoconferencing will also restrict the ability of members to interrupt or challenge ministers, at a time when the government has placed restrictions of people’s liberties unprecedented in peacetime.‘The Long Run’The government faces criticism over shortages of protective medical equipment, and on Tuesday the Office for National Statistics released data showing the dramatic toll of the virus. It said that in the week ending April 10, 18,516 deaths had been registered, the highest weekly number in more than two decades and 76% more than the average for that week.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHancock tried to get onto the front foot that evening, announcing that Britain will begin human trials of a vaccine this week.“In the long run, the best way to defeat coronavirus is through a vaccine,” Hancock told the government’s daily news conference. “The U.K. is at the front of the global effort. We have put more money than any other country into a global search for a vaccine and, for all the efforts around the world, two of the leading vaccine developments are taking place here at home.”The trials will be of a drug developed at Oxford University. Hancock said the government would give 20 million pounds ($25 million) to support the research. “In normal times, reaching this stage would take years,” he said. Another 20.5 million pounds will go to a separate project at London’s Imperial College.Complaints from health workers about the availability of personal protective equipment continue, but Hancock was keen to emphasize the government’s achievements. He said that with the number of people hospitalized with the virus declining, the ministers had achieved their goal of protecting the National Health Service from being overwhelmed.“At no point in this crisis has anyone who could benefit from critical care been denied that care because there weren’t enough staff, or beds, or ventilators to treat them,” Hancock said.His announcement came as:The health secretary said the process for finding a vaccine would take “trial and error,” but he has told U.K. scientists leading the search he would “back them to the hilt and give them every resource they need” in order to succeed. “After all, the upside of being the first country in the world to develop a successful vaccine is so huge that I am throwing everything at it,” he said.Van-Tam said the number of new cases being diagnosed in the U.K. remained high. “It isn’t clear there is an enormous downturn at this point,” he said. “The numbers are varying day to day, but they remain high and we remain in a situation of danger that we must take very seriously indeed.”He also set out the difficulty facing governments in deciding how to ease restrictions on public activities. “We do at some point hope that we turn this curve down,” he said. The difficulty then, he said, was “easing some of the restrictions we are under without letting this virus just chase off again. That’s a really difficult balancing act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-government-faces-first-political-test-of-lockdown/story-MLZ9qSs5U4OEgmrOFSBT1K.html
22-04-2020||World||‘Covid-19 knows no borders’: China calls for solidarity not `finger-pointing’||China said Tuesday this is a time for solidarity and cooperation, not “finger-pointing” and “politicization,” as its top diplomats in New York officially handed over a donation of medical supplies to hard-hit New York City to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic.Consul-General Huang Ping recalled at the online ceremony that China’s President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump “called for anti-epidemic cooperation between our two nations and the world” in their last phone call on March 17.“As the two biggest economies in the world, China and the United States need to lead the effort to fighting the coronavirus,” Huang said. “This is not the time for finger-pointing. This is the time for solidarity, collaboration, cooperation and mutual support.”But after weeks of elaborate praise of president Xi’s performance in the pandemic, Trump has turned to blaming China and halting US contributions to the World Health Organization, accusing it of parroting misinformation from Beijing.China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun stressed the importance of multilateralism, saying “we live in one world” and Covid-19 “knows no borders.”“We need to support the United Nations and the WHO in playing a leading and coordinating role in defeating Covid-19, the common enemy of all mankind,” he said. “We should stand firm against the politicization of the pandemic and remove all obstacles which hinder our cooperation.”’Huang said the American people helped China “without hesitation” when it was in great difficulty, and its consulate and UN mission have donated 25,000 N95 masks, 2,000 protective suits, and 75,000 pairs of medical gloves, which reached New York last weekend.According to incomplete estimates, Huang said, China has also donated a total of 1,000 ventilators, 6,550,000 masks, 310,000 pairs of surgical gloves, 150,000 goggles and 32,000 protective suits to the United States, much of it to New York.Penny Abeywardena, New York City’s commissioner for international affairs, thanked China for its “extremely generous donation,” saying “it is what our health care workers need and we are absolutely grateful that you are in this fight with us.” She said the latest donation is already going to health care personel.She also referred to attacks on Chinese-Americans as a result of Covid-19 originating in China, saying New York City “will not tolerate any harassment or discrimination against your community.”Both the consul-general and UN ambassador expressed hope that the supplies will help New York win the fight against the pandemic.Zhang said he wanted to stress that living in New York “we share its joy, we share its pain,” and every evening at 7 pm EDT he and his wife go out on their balcony and join their neighbours in clapping to support the city’s essential workers.“I sincerely hope that, with the unity of all New Yorkers, we will defeat the pandemic and bring New York back to a dynamic and colorful life,” the UN ambassador said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-knows-no-borders-china-calls-for-solidarity-not-finger-pointing/story-uMh6CkkKRhidvLVf0hYckI.html
22-04-2020||World||Donald Trump’s 60-day immigration suspension to impact those seeking green cards||President Donald Trump has said he expects to sign an executive order Wednesday that will suspend immigration — mostly impacting Green Cards — for the next 60 days to ensure Americans hits by record layoffs caused by the coronavirus outbreak get a first shot at all available jobs.Exemptions will be over cases on humanitarian ground and short-term work, which could include, though he did not specify, H-1B visas, more than 70% of which have tended to go to Indians hired from US universities or from India by US companies and US subsidiaries of Indian companies.The president said he will review economic conditions at the end of the 60-day period to determine if he wants to extend the suspension or terminate it.Nearly 22 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits over the last four weeks and many more layoffs are feared as the economy teeters on the edge of the worst slowdown in US history, a situation compared by many economists to the Great Depression of 1929.As Hindustan Times reported earlier on Trump’s tweet about the upcoming executive order, more than 1 million new immigrants are admitted to the United States every year. India sent the most in 2017 with 126,000 people, according to a Pew study. It was followed by Mexico (124,000), China (121,000) and Cuba (41,000). Overall, people from Mexico comprise the largest group of foreign-born US national in 2018 at 25%, followed by India and China, with 6% each, according to the same report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-immigration-suspension-to-last-60-days-will-impact-those-seeking-green-cards/story-6QugSlrakbEQ5qCWfjDdFJ.html

Trump offered the first details about a vague announcement he made on Monday night, addressing an issue key to his conservative base as the country is ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 43,000 people dead.“By pausing immigration, it will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens,” Trump said at his daily pandemic briefing on Tuesday.“This pause will be in effect for 60 days” he said, adding that he would decide on any extension or changes “based on economic conditions at the time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-immigration-suspension-to-last-60-days/story-NjtL9So71nRCuROkGXU7oM.html
22-04-2020||World||WHO stands by China in coronavirus origin row||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that all available evidence suggests the coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory.US President Donald Trump said last week that his government was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in Wuhan, where the coronavirus emerged in December.“All available evidence suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not manipulated or constructed in a lab or somewhere else,” WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva news briefing. “It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin.”It was not clear, Chaib added, how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans but there had “certainly” been an intermediate animal host. “It most likely has its ecological reservoir in bats but how the virus came from bats to humans is still to be seen and discovered.”She did not respond to a request to elaborate on whether it was possible the virus may have inadvertently escaped from a lab. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has dismissed rumours both that it synthesised the virus or allowed it to escape.Also on Tuesday, as global cases crossed 2.5 million, the WHO warned that lifting of lockdowns must be gradual, and if restrictions were to be relaxed too soon, there would be a resurgence of infections. Takeshi Kasai, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, said, “At least until a vaccine, or a very effective treatment, is found, this process will need to become our new normal.”In Myanmar, a car used by the WHO to transport swab samples to be tested for the virus was attacked, killing the driver and wounding a passenger.In Germany, Bavaria cancelled the Oktoberfest for the first time since WWII. The event takes place from September to October.Spain unveiled a series of measures aimed at helping prostitutes and victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation survive the country’s lockdown.In the UK, as PM Boris Johnson said he would speak with US President Donald Trump and hold an audience with the queen this week, scientists at the University of Cambridge found a link between living in an area of England with high levels of air pollution and the severity of Covid-19. Researchers at the university’s MRC Toxicology Unit analysed data on Covid-19 cases and deaths against the levels of three major air pollutants, collected between the years 2018 and 2019.Meanwhile, watchdog Reporters Without Borders claimed China has “extensively” censored information on the outbreak, saying the impact of it has been experienced globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-stands-by-china-in-coronavirus-origin-row/story-hVD2ygHtJ4IO3EkUoipCfP.html

22-04-2020||India||Karnataka: Ambulances busted for ferrying people and alcohol||Late Tuesday, police personnel patrolling National Highway-13, near Sivaganga village, leading to Hollalkere in Chitradurga district of Karnataka saw an ambulance racing away. The personnel initially did not pay it much attention, given the rising number of Covid-19 cases and the strict lockdown rules in place. But when they saw the same ambulance parked along the highway next to a Maruti van, they got suspicious and decided to investigate. They found that the ambulance belonged to Horakere Deverapura primary health centre, and it was ferrying liquor. Four persons were arrested and the ambulance seized. Police said since the lockdown was imposed on March 24, there have been several instances of ambulances being misused across the state. On April 19, seven were arrested from an ambulance that was ferrying them from Puttur to Mysore. Similarly, on April 13, Lingadahalli police stopped an ambulance going from Bengaluru to Chikmagaluru. The ambulance driver had taken ₹28,000 from five persons to take them to Ganguru village of Chikmagaluru. The driver had managed to evade all check posts till Tarikere where policemen became suspicious and stopped the vehicle. A senior health and family welfare department official, on condition of anonymity, said, “In all cases that came to our notice, we took the strictest action possible under law. Licences of all such ambulances are suspended and cases registered,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-ambulances-busted-for-ferrying-people-and-alcohol/story-V39hUDN5RdonGGNWO5mM6L.html
22-04-2020||India||Woman, 92, grandchild, 3, recover in Pune||April 22 was a special day for Pune doctors treating Covid-19 patients. The city, which is one of the designated red zones in Maharashtra, with at least 753 cases saw the recovery of a pair of related patients: a three-year-old toddler and her 92-year-old great grandmother. Muralidhar Mohol, the mayor of Pune tweeted in Marathi about them on Monday, “We thank hospital authorities for their efforts. Both the patients have recovered and gone back home safely.”Maisarah Shaikh (3) and her 92-year-old wheelchair-bound great grandmother, Fatima Shaikh, were discharged from Symbiosis Hospital and Research Centre after their second Covid-19 test came negative. Both have completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine period. The nonagenarian, who had suffered a stroke seven months ago, is paralysed and unable to recognise many of her family members. According to doctors at Symbiosis hospital, the recovery of a 92-year-old indicated that even senior citizens with pre-existing ailments — the population most at risk of dying due to Sars-Cov-2 — could recover from the Covid-19 threat.“The old woman did not have any symptoms although she recently had a stroke and her body was paralysed. However, during her stay at hospital, all her health parameters were all right which actually helped our staff to treat her,” said chief executive officer of Symbiosis Hospital Dr Vijay Natarajan.The two residents of Kondhwa were among 15 people, including six from the same family who had tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this month. Their swabs were taken after one of their relatives died at Sassoon General Hospital on April 8. The other nine were indirectly related to the family: acquaintances whom the members had come into contact with prior to the lockdown.“It was a twin tragedy. There was death among the family because of the viral infection, and six of us also tested Covid-19 positive. However, the hospital authorities took good care of us,” said 55-year-old Aslam Shaikh, grandfather to Maisarah, and owner of a tailoring shop in Kondhwa.There are eight members in Shaikh’s family; six tested positive for Covid-19, including the toddler, her father (Shaikh’s son), Shaikh’s mother and Shaikh himself. However, none but the last, exhibited any symptoms.“All of us including my old mother were all fine, only my son had a mild cough. Since my mother is paralytic, we were more worried about her. However, the doctors gave her extra attention and she recovered,” said Shaikh, who was discharged from quarantine on Monday.Also admitted with the toddler and the nonagenarian was Maisarah’s 66-year-old aunt, who is affected with polio. Maisarah’s mother, Noorjaha, despite being tested negative, was allowed to stay at hospital to take care of her daughter and mother-in-law. Now back, all members of the family are attempting to keep social distance from each other and their neighbours in their six-room home. Though business is down, Shaikh said that he is happy: his family is safe and together again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-92-grandchild-3-recover-in-pune/story-k1aUxSEHvH7HbYYNVgaFxK.html
22-04-2020||India||Covid warriors get bigger legal shield||In the backdrop of persistent attacks on health care workers in the front line of the battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the Centre has approved an ordinance to make such attacks a cognisable and non-bailable offence, expedite investigation, imprison those convicted to up to seven years, and impose stringent penalties on vandalism and damage to property.Underlining its importance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, “The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 manifests our commitment to protect each and every healthcare worker who is bravely battling COVID-19 on the frontline. It will ensure safety of our professionals.” He underlined that there could be “no compromise” on their safety. The medical fraternity has welcomed the ordinance. The government’s decision, following a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, came in the wake of assurances of safety given by home minister Amit Shah and health minister Harsh Vardhan to representatives of the Indian Medical Association (IMA). The IMA subsequently cancelled protests scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday. Later in the day, the home ministry also sent an advisory to all state governments to ensure adequate security to all health care workers, and take strict action against any individual obstructing the functioning of health care workers, and the performance of the last rites of these workers.The Cabinet’s decision to promulgate the ordinance — which will amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 — follows a spate of incidents in which doctors and paramedical workers, engaged in testing suspected Covid-19 cases for confirmation, or treating patients, were assaulted and their vehicles damaged by people who feared catching the infection or stigmatised and ostracised health care workers for their proximity to confirmed or suspected cases. The government, Opposition, and civil society have repeatedly called for honouring these professionals workers. On Sunday, the burial of Samuel Hercules, a doctor in Chennai, was disrupted by violent protesters who damaged the ambulance carrying his body and injured its driver out of fear of the spread of the coronavirus. On April 8, two resident doctors of Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital were allegedly assaulted by a neighbour who accused them of “spreading” the disease. A week before that, two doctors and their team were pelted with stones during a drive to screen and identify possible Covid-19 patients in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar said such offences have no place in a civilised society, adding that they will not be tolerated by the government. The Centre has, therefore, he said, decided to bring in an ordinance to amend the 1897 Act; this has, so far, served as the key legal umbrella for a range of government measures against the pandemic.Once the President promulgates the ordinance officially, causing serious injury to health professionals and damage to property will invite imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine of up to ₹5 lakh. The offences will be probed in 30 days under the proposed amendment, and a decision will be given within a year. If the cars or clinics of doctors are damaged, double the cost will be recovered from the vandals, Javadekar said, pointing out that the government had also worked towards providing an insurance cover of up to ₹50 lakh for health workers on the front lines of the Covid-19 battle. Both the Centre and the states can exercise the powers awarded by the ordinance. The scope of the amendment will cover health professionals ranging from doctors and paramedical staff to accredited social health activists. Health care professionals welcomed the move. DS Rana, chairperson of the board of governors of Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it was the need of the hour as the instances of violence against health care workers, including doctors, were on the rise. “Not everyone was unruly but a section of people was misbehaving and it needed a regulation to rein it in as this section would not have listened to reason. There was no other way to check their irresponsible behaviour. Health care workers are putting their lives at risk in treating patients, and harassment and violence against them is the last thing they want in this crisis situation,” he said. Other doctors said these provisions must not be temporary — but last beyond the pandemic. Commenting on the decision, from the perspective of law enforcement, Yashovardhan Azad, a retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, said it was about time that the government intervened on behalf of the health workers to amend the “toothless” 1897 Act and display its strong intent. “However, to serve its purpose, special police officers should be appointed. This will help resolve the issue of scarcity of law enforcers for immediate response.”The Centre’s response came in the wake of demands by the IMA for a stronger law; the umbrella medical body had also called for ‘White alert’ and ‘Black day’ protests on April 22 and 23. Home minister Shah and health minister Vardhan met representatives on Wednesday morning. According to an official government statement, Shah allayed the concerns of the medical fraternity regarding their security, and assured them that the government would leave no stone unturned in ensuring their well being and security. He strongly condemned the recent attacks on health professionals and said Prime Minister Modi was closely following all issues and concerns of doctors. He also appealed to doctors to withdraw their planned protest -- a call heeded by the IMA.On Wednesday evening, the home ministry sent out an advisory to stage governments and Union territories. It pointed out that at this time, even a single incident of violence against health care professionals was likely to create a sense of insecurity among the entire health care community. It underlined its own past advisories, as well as the Supreme Court directive to provide necessary police security to doctors and medical staff in hospitals and places where patients who have been diagnosed with Covid-19, or patients suspected of Covid-19, or those quarantined are housed; and to doctors and other medical staff who visit places to conduct screening of people. It urged states to act in line with the Supreme Court directives and provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and also consult local chapters of IMA. The home ministry letter, sent by home secretary Ajay Bhalla to all state chief secretaries, also urged that governments impose strict penalties against those obstructing the functioning of health care workers, and against those offenders who obstruct the last rites of health care workers who may have died due to Covid-19 or any other reason. It also asked states and UTs to appoint a nodal officer both at the state and at the district level, on a 24*7 basis, to redress any safety issues of medical professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-warriors-get-bigger-legal-shield/story-Ou8grG2hcOjTtTsarcP2PI.html
22-04-2020||India||11 health workers test Covid-19 positive at Kolkata Medical College||Interns and the house staff at Medical College, Kolkata, have lashed out at the authorities alleging gross negligence, citing that 11 healthcare workers at the hospital have tested positive for Covid-19 as against only three Covid-19 patients who were admitted at the hospital.The MBBS interns at the hospital issued a media statement on Monday and, on Tuesday it was the turn of the junior doctors to bring the same charges against the authorities. Medical College, Kolkata, is one of the premiere state-run hospitals in the city.The authorities, on the other hand, have decided to keep the interns off work for the time being, considering that their lack of experience could expose them to greater risk than experienced healthcare professionals. “A ratio of 3 patients to 11 healthcare workers affected points to enormous callousness on the part of the authorities to set up any form of protection and testing facilities for those of us at the highest risk,” reads the press statement issued by the residents, which include the house staff and the post-graduate trainees, on Tuesday night.The house staff, also called junior doctors, alleged that despite the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s latest guideline to provide N-95 masks to all healthcare workers, it was denied at the hospital, in spite of repeated demands.“Outpatient departments continue without any personal protective equipment (PPE). Emergency doctors are provided with one PPE per shift. This is unacceptable,” the statement read.Responding to the allegations, hospital superintendent Indranil Biswas said that there was lack of awareness and alertness on the part of healthcare workers at the beginning but the issues had been resolved.“The infection spread from the gynaecology ward and not the isolation ward. All patients were asymptomatic and they showed symptoms only during their stay in the hospital, following which their swab samples were tested. Possibly, there was lack of alertness while treating patients in non-isolation wards who showed no symptoms and were not suspected to be Covid-19 patients. I don’t blame interns because they are barely one month and a half into their internship,” Biswas said.Among healthcare workers, three junior doctors, four nursing staff tested positive for Covid-19.He added that all precautionary measures have been taken after identifying the risk from asymptomatic patients. “Right now, we are treating all patients as suspected Covid-19 positive unless proved otherwise. So, precaution is being taken while dealing with any patient in any ward. Also, those coming from Covid-19 hotspot areas are being straightaway taken to the isolation wards and tests are being conducted,” Biswas said.The authorities have for the time being decided not to use the interns for any work related to the hospital. Mass testing of healthcare workers is also being carried out.The male medicine ward and the gynaecology ward at the hospital are presently shut. All staff at the outdoor section have been asked to wear N-95 masks. A patient at the gyanaecology ward tested positive soon after giving birth to a child. The report of another patient, who took admission with heart ailment, came positive after her death.As many as 44 nursing staff and junior doctors have been sent to quarantine centres for coming in contact with Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-health-workers-test-covid-19-positive-at-kolkata-medical-college/story-yOJQTyTbjdgr7QwLZWtrML.html

He inspected the use of masks, hand washing facilities and social distancing at the work site and directed officials to ensure that all Covid-19 guidelines are followed. Pilot, who is also minister of rural development and panchayat raj, also interacted with workers, who told him that they have got some financial support now that MNREGA works have started, as that was the main source of income in rural areas.In April 17, only 62,000 workers have found employment due to the lockdown. The works of individual benefit sanctioned under the MNREGA scheme includes construction of houses under PM housing scheme, cattle sheds and levelling of fields, among others. Priority will be given to employing workers of the state, so that social distancing will also be managed automatically, Pilot said. “The wages received under MNREGA scheme will increase the purchasing power of the people in rural areas, which will support the rural economy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mnrega-jobs-rose-10-times-in-four-days-sachin-pilot/story-o5LMh8x3AY41NHINooZzaO.html

22-04-2020||India||Central team projects sharp spike in Maharashtra in next 30 days, state says no need to worry||Even as 431 new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra on Wednesday kept the average number of new cases above 400 for the last four days, the government claimed the hotspots in the state had reduced to five from 14 a few days ago.It also claimed that the mortality rate had reduced and the doubling-rate had improved to 7.01 days from 3.1 days earlier this month.A central team that visited Mumbai and Pune has, however, projected a sharp spike in positive cases over the next two to three weeks and advised the Maharashtra government to make preparations anticipating a worse-case scenario. It also anticipated a massive surge of positive cases in Mumbai between April 30 and May 15. State health minister Rajesh Tope downplayed the concerns and said the projections made by the central team were based on the rate of increase which would not be applicable now. “There is panic among people about a spike between April 30 and May 15. It is a mathematical model. Surely there is a science behind it, but certain things have been assumed in this, such as the doubling rate, which is considered at 3.5 (for the projection) and it is kept static. We have taken a lot of preventive measures. We are carrying out surveillance, tests, etc,” Tope said. He said that a dramatic spike could only happen if the state government wasn’t taking any measures.In last four days, 2001 positive cases have been added to the state tally which reached 5649. 58 patients have died during this period, taking the toll to 269. Mumbai tops the chart for new Covid-19 patients and casualties with 3683 cases and 161 deaths. Of the 431 new cases and 18 deaths on Wednesday, 232 cases and 10 deaths are from Mumbai. Two each of the remaining 8 deaths are from Aurangbad and Pune, and one each from Kalyan-Dombivali, Solapur, Jalgaon and Malegaon.Five of the deceased were above 60 years of age, while 12 were in the 40-60 age group and one was below 40 years. 12 of these patients had high-risk co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, asthma and heart ailments.The mortality rate in the state dropped to 4.80 % on April 21, much below 7.21% on April 11. The doubling rate of positive patients has stayed at 7.01 days compared to 3.5 days a few days ago.During the presentation before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, the five-member Inter Minister Central Team (IMCT) reportedly projected an exponential rise in positive cases in Mumbai, with the figure touching 42,604 by April 30 and 6.56 lakh by May 15.The officials from the state health department, however, said that the figures do not reflect the present trend. “Those are the old figures estimated assuming the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases to be two days. But at the present, the cases are neither rising at that rate, nor are we conducting testing to reach that number by May 15. Even the percentage of the positive cases vis-à-vis the number of tests conducted, ranges between 5-8%, and with that rate, the projection appears to be unrealistic,” said the official.Tope said that the doubling rate was now at 7.01 days, and could go up even further. He added that the mortality rate has also improved in the state. “Earlier, it was 7%, now it has come under 5%, and with efforts, it will reduce further.” The minister added that the hotspots in Maharashtra have reduced from 14 to five--Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Nagpur Nashik.State health minister Rajesh Tope refuted the notion that the Central government has sent the team to Maharashtra fearing the lockdown measures were not being followed properly in the state and claimed that the state was faring well in terms of the mortality rate and the doubling rate.Tope said, “Nobody has said that the lockdown norms have not been followed [in Maharashtra]… In an epidemic, the situation is always serious. The cluster containment strategy is being properly implemented. If there is any lacuna, we are immediately identifying and resolving it… There are two important things-- doubling rate and mortality rate. The doubling rate has reduced. Earlier cases doubled in three days, then in five days, now it is happening in seven days. It is will increase further. The death rate is also improving. Earlier it was over 7%, now it is under 5%. The number of cases is increasing and would increase further in the coming days. But they are not growing exponentially.”A senior state government official said that the Central teams which visited Worli-Koliwada, Dharavi and other slum pockets in Andheri east area, has sought data of the people living there. It has also sought to know the number of tests conducted in these areas. An official added that the team has advised to shift people to quarantine facilities to curb the spread of the viral infection in the densely populated areas. “In Mumbai, around 75,000 people have to be taken from their homes and shifted into institutional quarantine facilities. We have spaces including schools and grounds where this can be erected. Institutional quarantine will aggressively start in Mumbai from tomorrow (Thursday),” Tope said.Health minister said the state has reviewed its preparedness plan. “As per the preparedness plan, we are checking the availability of hospital beds, oxygen beds, PPE kits, etc. We are considering the worst possibility and the BMC is preparing for it. I have instructed BMC to increase testing facilities and quarantine facilities as well,” he said.The minister also hinted that the lockdown could be extended beyond May 3 in areas with a high number of cases. After 67 patients were reported to have recovered fully on Wednesday, the total number of the patients to get discharged from the hospitals so far has reached 789. 1,09, 072 people are home quarantined in the state and 8051 are under institutional quarantine.State authorities have conducted 90,223 tests at government and private labs so far, of which 83,979 tested negative. State has 465 containment zones with 6,798 health teams with a combined strength of 25.61 lakh people.During an interaction with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the IMCT has asked the state government to prepare for the worst-case scenario, said an official.“They have directed the government machinery to strictly monitor the containment zones and start an aggressive outreach to avoid the spread of the virus further. They have pressed for contact-tracing and aggressive testing in the hotspots. The government has also been told to increase the number of health teams to trace more high and low-risk contacts,” said an official from the state government on the condition of anonymity. The official also said that the central team has asked the state government to take steps to avoid crowding on the roads by the Muslim community for prayers during the month of Ramazan.CM Thackeray apprised the team about the initiative taken by the government to contain the spread in the hotspots, especially in the slums of Mumbai and Pune. The team was told that the civic body in Mumbai has been reaching out without waiting for the people to report the symptoms.“We have increased the number of tests and it has resulted in the rise of positive cases in the state. We expect the ICMR nod for the rapid testing at the earliest. The centre should also respond positively to the demand raised for the supply of PPE kits, N-95 mask and other equipments,” he said.State government fears extreme reaction from more than 5.7 lakh migrants living in 4618 camps across the state if the lockdown is extended again after May 3. “We do not want to repeat the Bandra migrant crisis after the conclusion of the second phase of lockdown. We have been getting harsh reactions from these migrants who have been put up in the camps for more than four weeks with every facility at their disposal. The state has already spent around Rs 90 crore and huge machinery is engaged for the arrangements. At a few camps, the migrants have boycotted food demanding to return to their respective states. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is keen on sending them back at the earliest,” said an official from the state government. Meanwhile, reacting to the allegations of former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that the BMC is suppressing Covid-19 related death count in Mumbai, Tope said the civic body has assured him that the deaths referred to by Fadnavis were not related to coronavirus.“The patients were old and had comorbidities. The ICMR guidelines say that if a patient arrives in a critical or a serious condition, he or she must be stabilised first, and then swab should be taken. In this case, the patients died during stabilising. The ICMR guidelines also do not say that swab samples should be taken from such patients who died,” he said stressing the deaths referred to by Fadnavis were non-Covid deaths.Fadnavis in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said that patients labelled as ‘suspected Covid’ during admission to hospitals in Mumbai were not being tested for the disease after death. He said at least 44 bodies of ‘suspected Covid’ patients have been released from the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital — a dedicated Covid-19 facility now — without conducting the coronavirus test. There are several such instances from other hospitals too, said Fadnavis, who tweeted details of the letter he’s sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “We are not hiding any information; there is no reason. The directives of the government of India and the ICMR protocol are being followed completely,” Tope added.The minister added that there is a “question mark” over the rapid test or antibody test after the Centre directed the state government not to use the Chinese. “There is still a question whether to do it (rapid test) at all. In the Chinese kits, the IgM and IgG bands are not visible properly. We will act as per the corrective instructions of the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-projects-sharp-spike-in-maharashtra-in-next-30-days-state-says-no-need-to-worry/story-Soco4h1foyoRDz8C8zBFfO.html

They can get details by calling on helpline number 104,” state minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “Those who have their own vehicles and are stuck due to lockdown will be allowed to travel to their homes or workplace with due permission from the district authorities.”Similarly, employers needing transport for their workers to travel to workplaces allowed to function will be allowed to do so after necessary permission from district authorities.The state government has also instructed private schools to charge only 50% of total fees for one month and not to increase fees or deduct salaries of teachers and other staff. “If schools remain closed till the end of May, we will lose 52 working days. If the situation improves, we should be able to cover the session by taking classes on Saturdays and by reducing the number of holidays,” Sarma said.He announced the state government will conduct free Covid-19 tests for journalists on April 25 in Guwahati. As many as 53 journalists in Mumbai were found to be Covid-19 positive on Monday.Assam has not recorded any new Covid-19 for week. Of the state’s 34 patients, 19 have recovered, while one has died.Sarma said they have conducted 5,789 tests till date. “At present there are 3,338 isolation beds, 440 ICU [intensive care unit] beds and facilities to quarantine over 10,000 people. We have adequate stock of PPEs [personal protection equipment] and masks. The state government has ordered 1 lakh rapid testing kits and they should reach the state soon,” Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-allow-one-time-conditional-travel/story-s1YgHiiEfO8rWnkIsSa4NJ.html
22-04-2020||India||‘Agra model’ in doubt after 300 cases||Agra: The number of Covid-19 cases has crossed the 300-mark in Uttar Pradesh’s Agra and called into question the containment model followed in the city that the Centre lauded this month and asked other states to learn from it. The model was praised for its proactive approach in identifying cases, intensive testing, door-to-door surveys and strict quarantine measures that helped Agra halt the spread of Covid-19.Agra is the worst-hit city by the pandemic in Uttar Pradesh, which had 324 Covid-19 cases as of Wednesday.SP Singh Baghel of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, who represents Agra in Parliament, called for finding the “leakage” in the model. “The initial stress was on the supply of essential items and people had faith in the model which also earned applause from... Union ministry of health. But no one had guessed there would be such a rise in the number of cases in Agra, which has crossed the 300-mark and now stands at 313,” said Baghel.Baghel said the paramedical staff was justifiably asking for gloves, masks and other personal protection equipment as two dozen health workers have tested positive for the disease in Agra. “If front-line corona warriors like the medical staff and police personnel test positive, then who would look after the preventive measures?” he said.Vivek Sarabhoi, the convenor of the voluntary Covid-19 Agra Support initiative, said, “There is a huge gap between what needs to be done and what actually is being done.”District magistrate Prabhu N Singh defended the model and insisted the administration was on the right track. He said the stress was on testing more people as the source of the infection spread was known in all cases. Singh maintained there was no community spread of the disease so far. He added they were holding a series of meetings with the stakeholders and new guidelines were being issued in consultations with experts. ‘We have decided to keep suspected patients in institutional quarantine after having their samples tested so that they can be moved into isolation once they test positive,” he said. “A dedicated five-member team of the Indian Medical Association will ensure compliance with the Covid-19 protocol at private hospitals.”The model was implemented as six patients tested positive for Covid-19 in Agra on March 3 when India had only 30-odd cases. It involved door-to-door surveys, identification of suspected cases, and quarantining. A list of people with foreign travel was drawn up and their families and other close contacts were identified. A three-km area around Covid-19 hotspots was declared containment zones with five-km area as the buffer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agra-model-in-doubt-after-300-cases/story-SQKDbNQuchrmPCrb0JXHHO.html
22-04-2020||India||Did initial studies overestimate cases?||Infection and fatality trends from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic appear to be lower than those projected by several models at the beginning of the crisis, according to Canadian-American physician and popular podcast host Peter Attia, who says the difference may be key to understanding when and if cities should be reopened.Models created by infectious disease experts predicted, for instance, that 200,000-2 million Americans could eventually die due to Covid-19.These, Attia says, are wrong. “Today I suspect American fatalities from Covid-19 will be more in line with a very bad, perhaps the worst, season of influenza (The last decade saw flu deaths in the US range from 12,000 to 61,000, so you can imagine how much variability exists). This suggests Covid-19 will kill tens of thousands in the US this year, but likely not hundreds of thousands, and definitely not millions, as previously predicted,” he wrote in a blog post on his website.The divergence could be due to two reasons, Attia explains. “Either the models were wrong because they incorrectly assigned properties about the biology of the virus pertaining to its lethality and/or ability to spread, or the models were correct, but as a society we changed our behavior enough in response to the threat of the virus to alter the outcome.” At the heart of the modelling diversion, according to the physician, lies estimations of the virus’s basic reproduction number (R0). “If the predictions were wrong because we misunderstood the biology of the virus (overstating its risk significantly) then we may start the process of thoughtful reintegration. (But) if the predictions were wrong because we understood the biology, modelled it correctly, and appropriately put into place extreme social distancing measures then we need to continue strict social distancing until we have effective treatments,” he writes.Determining which case is true will give more insight into how the virus behaves, letting countries make “better decisions with at least some modicum of confidence, versus blind certainty in models that don’t have the humility to incorporate a margin of error or degree of uncertainty”.Thus, Attia concludes, it is crucial to find out how many people may have been asymptomatic to accurately determine the virus’s lethality. “Either way, we need to broadly test people with no symptoms, which is something we have not done so far in an area hit as hard as New York city,” he writes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-initial-studies-overestimate-cases/story-SiP3eZiMIAuwRjiTt80GEK.html
22-04-2020||India||Stranded cruise ship crew to land at Mumbai Port on Thursday||A total of 146 seafarers and crew on board the US cruise liner Marella Discovery will anchor off the Mumbai Port on Thursday, after spending 37 days on-board. According to a press note issued by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s office, the seafarers and crew members will be subjected to a Covid-19 test and will remain quarantined in a building within the port trust premises till their reports are received. On Tuesday night, the Home Minister issued an order allowing the sign-in and sign-off of Indian ship crew at different ports. “The order is set to benefit close to 35,000-40,000 seafarers,” the press note stated. Earlier on Tuesday, the crew on Marella Discovery had appealed to the Indian government to announce a policy for the seafarers on an urgent basis. The cruise was to travel to Cochin, New Mengaluru, Goa and Mumbai between April 2 and 6. However, owing to the coronavirus outbreak and lockdown, the passengers were disembarked at Laem Chabang in Thailand on March 14. After it arrived at Cochin on April 12, it was denied permission to disembark and reached Mumbai on April 14. Since then, the crew is waiting for permission though they stated that none of the crew members on board had been infected with the disease. After dropping the Indian crew members, the ship will set sail for Norway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stranded-cruise-ship-crew-to-land-at-mumbai-port-on-thursday/story-QFvjabbxwL4YyiDSflB3MN.html
22-04-2020||India||Boost for IT, ITeS firms as Karnataka to partially relax curbs from Friday||Some of the lockdown restrictions will be partially eased for select sectors in Karnataka from Friday.According to a notification issued by the state chief secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar, IT and ITeS companies can resume operations with “essential minimal staff” only and the rest continuing to work from home. This is seen as critical move as Karnataka is one of the largest exporters of IT services.The 14-page order also allowed works under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Act (MNREGA), courier services, cold storage and warehousing services, private security and facilities management, self employed electricians, IT repairs, plumbers, motor mechanics, carpenters, food processing industries in rural areas, manufacturing units of essential goods, packaging material and construction activities including metro rail, roads, irrigation works and other industrial projects. All of which will be allowed only outside containment zones, more than 400 of which have been identified across the state. It also requires wearing of masks, social distancing and other measures.The state government has been under immense financial pressure ever since the lockdown came into effect from March 25 that paralysed almost all revenue generating activities across the state. Apart from the above-mentioned exceptions, Karnataka’s primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar emphasized that lockdown in other areas of life would continue till May 3rd as announced earlier. Which means no malls, theaters, metro, bus train or flight services and all religious places would continue to stay shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boost-for-it-ites-firms-as-karnataka-to-partially-relax-curbs-from-friday/story-CwWwl7C7Tu29tTOwgnnbLP.html
22-04-2020||India||Modi will meet CMs on April 27 to discuss post-lockdown plans||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet state chief ministers on April 27, when the nationwide lockdown enters its final week.The meeting, officials indicated, is likely to review the set of relaxations of the lockdown allowed from April 20 and discuss the future road map that may include longer locking period for red or containment zones, as identified by the government.The meeting, which will be attended by all CMs, may also include Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah and a few senior officials of the Prime Minister’s Office.Officials said Modi will seek opinion of the CMs on how to consolidate on the gains achieved from the sweeping lockdown imposed from March 25 to contain the rapid spread of the highly contiguous virus. At the same time, there is a scope for a review of the relaxation measures that were taken to gradually restart some sectors of the economy.“The scope of the meeting is enormous. At this stage, the Prime Minister or the union government would not do anything without taking the states into confidence. Like, the extension of the lockdown was also announced after taking feedback from all CMs, public health experts and district magistrates,” said an official with knowledge of the developments.In his earlier meetings, Modi had categorically stated that the lockdown is the only option to save lives in India and that no one has advised him to lift the lockdown abruptly.Prime Minister Modi will address various Gram Panchayats across the country on April 24 to mark the National Panchayati Raj Day. Modi will also launch the unified e-GramSwaraj Portal and Mobile App on the occasion to provide an unified portal with a single interface to prepare and implement their Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP).The Pm is also expected to hail the work done by the panchayati institutions in tackling Covid-19 and especially the efforts of women self-help groups. According to an official, the self help groups have been the backbone of the government’s effort to tackle Covid-19 in the rural India.According to an official release, the PM will also launch the Swamitva Scheme for an integrated property validation solution for rural India. “The demarcation of inhabited land in rural areas would be done by the use of latest surveying methods – Drone’s technology with the collaborated efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Panchayati Raj Department, State Revenue Department and Survey of India,” said the release.Modi is also expected to inform the people of the progress made against Covid-19 and his views on the road ahead in his serial radio address –Mann ki Baat- on Sunday.

The project will involve diversion of 1150.08 ha of forest land and felling of 2.7 lakh trees in what FAC’s documents call “subtropical evergreen broad-leaved and subtropical rainforest”.“We have not heard from any locals about their concerns about the project. The FAC will hear it tomorrow [Thursday],” said Anjan Mohanty, the inspector general of forests.A FAC sub-committee report on Tuesday recommended the 3,097 MW Etalin Hydroelectric Project be allowed with a condition that the developer deposits money for wildlife conservation in the area.The FAC in October said the seven-member sub-committee will visit the project site to check if the land requirement for the project can be reduced after the ministry’s regional office in Shillong raised several concerns about the diversion of a large area as well as potential biodiversity loss and conservative estimation of trees to be felled. The sub-committee was asked to look into tree enumeration for felling and the project’s biodiversity impact.The sub-committee, which visited the site in February, found that the project lies in a remote area, and hence infrastructure facilities will have to be planned over a large area.The developer, Etalin Hydro-Electric Power Company, a joint venture of Arunachal Pradesh’s Hydro Power Development Corporation with Jindal Power Limited (JPL), has reduced the forest area needed to be diverted to 1150.08 ha from 1165.66 ha, according to the sub-committee’s report.The regional office also highlighted the sampling intensity of trees at the project site was very low and hence gave a conservative estimate of trees to be felled. It added there was no accounting of huge trees that will be cut down. The sub-committee found that over 3 lakh trees are to be felled. The company has submitted that it will reduce the number to 2.7 lakh.A Wildlife Institute of India (WII) study has documented 413 plant, 159 butterfly, 113 spider, 14 amphibian, 31 reptile, 230 bird and 21 mammalian species within the project area. The WII has recommended a plan to prevent loss of animals and birds there, and the development of butterfly and reptile parks, nest boxes, habitat restoration etc.No tiger presence has been documented at the project site through camera trapping. But Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary 12 km away has recorded tiger presence in the vicinity.The company plans to develop a combination of two run-of-the-river projects involving the construction of concrete gravity dams on the Tangon and Dri tributaries of the Dibang.The sub-committee’s report recorded the environmental impacts of the dams even as it added the project has the support of the local populace and has no major environmental issue. “In addition, it has remarkably favourable geological conditions for the region.”The FAC had earlier in 2019 observed the proposed project falls under the richest Himalayan bio-geographical area and comes under one of the world’s mega biodiversity hotspots.The proposed project location is at the junction of the Paleo-arctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan bio-geographic regions having luxuriant forests and a plethora of flora and fauna.Activist Jorjo Tana Tara underlined the proposed project is located in an extremely eco-sensitive area. “There have been local protests.”JPL MD and CEO Bharat Rohra said they have been eagerly waiting for the clearance, which is a must. “The proposal for grant of FC [forest clearance] to Etalin project was submitted to the environment ministry in 2014. The proposal has since been discussed in FAC a couple of times. In the EAC meeting scheduled to be held on April 23, the report and recommendations of the sub-committee of FAC will be discussed for final recommendations on the grant of FC to the project.” Rohra said they are hopeful that the FAC will finally recommend the proposal for the FC grant. He added the company will implement the conservation plan.Centre for Policy Research’s senior fellow Manju Menon said the world is living through a climate crisis but the FAC or other institutions simply ignore or refuse to factor in the role that forests, rivers, and land in Arunachal Pradesh can play to help deal with this. “These resources will also be massively affected by climate change. Our assessment procedures are completely misplaced for this environmental context we are now in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-7-lakh-trees-to-be-felled-for-hydropower-project-in-arunachal-s-dibang-valley/story-i0GVuHt8nHF4JbxeM4birM.html

Moments later, the PM was on the line and greeted Shri Narayan: “Namaskar Narayan ji kaisey hain? After exchange of pleasantries, the PM, in a lighter vein, asked Narayan that he must have completed a century. The former MLA replied, “106 ho gaya hai” (I am 106 years old now).At this, the PM asked him, “You must have seen five generations?”Narayan’s response was ‘yes’. The PM then disclosed the purpose of calling, “It’s been long since I saw you and today I thought of seeking your blessing in this difficult time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-dials-a-106-yr-old-man-for-blessings-amid-tough-times/story-QTikwEMLC5jpcvikxGuj4J.html
22-04-2020||India||How travelling in Mumbai local trains will be safer after lockdown ends||Converting the unprecedented lockdown into an opportunity, Mumbai divisions of the Central Railway and Western Railway are extensively carrying out safety and maintenance works on the suburban network, which was not possible during the normal busy train schedules.It has been a month since trains stopped plying on the Mumbai suburban rail network, which is one of the busiest and congested in the world.Nearly 3,000 local train services operate on the route daily and over 80 lakh commuters use it everyday, making it the lifeline of the country’s financial capital.Since disruption of services for even 15 minutes leads to a chaotic situation, rail authorities used to carry out important maintenance and safety works either during the few hours window available late night or by enforcing megablocks during the weekends or holidays, when comparatively less commuters travel in the local trains.As the system is so busy and overburdened, a few hours are never sufficient for carrying out some of the critical maintenance works and those lead to disruptions sometimes, causing hardships to commuters, a railway offiical said.But, as the trains are now not running since a month due to the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, the rail authorities are carrying out maintenance of the rail signalling system, tracks, overhead equipment and the rolling stock, he said.“The Western Railway is using this as an opportunity to complete the maintenance works wherever required, since getting a traffic block in this division is a big challenge,” Western Railway’s chief said Ravinder Bhakar said.Since the lockdown began, keymen are inspecting every inch of the 1,394 km track everyday. About 210 km of track and 1,250 critical welds were tested by ultrasonic flaw detectors, he said.“The entire fleet of track machines has worked and done tamping of 99 km of track and 105 turnouts. For the health assessment of the tracks, the Oscillation Monitoring System (OMS) run was conducted on 2,503 km of the railway track,” said Bhakar.The Western Railway also completed several other works of overhead equipment, signal and telecom infrastructure maintenance during the ongoing lockdown, he added.The Central Railway’s chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar said along with track maintenance and testing, they carried out some critical works like removal of rusty portal booms of overhead equipment, maggering (an electric test) of signal and telecom cables of the entire Mumbai division, cleaning and maintenance of transformers, among others. “In the Asangaon-Kasara section, line block margin is very less, hence the traction distribution department utilised the lockdown period for removal of the rusty portal booms and 34 upright masts. These masts were about 70 years old and some were even of the British era,” Sutar said.He said these works were being carried out by following the social distancing guidelines.“This period has also been utilised to carry out critical works to enhance the safety of train operations. The workplaces are sanitised and all social distancing norms are followed,” Sutar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-travelling-in-mumbai-local-trains-will-be-safer-after-lockdown-ends/story-30dMDR8Kmca9jNruGQOTmO.html

22-04-2020||India||Bengal bans mobile phones from Covid-19 wards in all hospitals, sparks row||The West Bengal health department has prohibited mobile phones in Covid-19 wards in all hospitals, saying that phone surfaces are also potential carriers of novel coronavirus.The ban has triggered allegations that the move was actually aimed at blocking flow of information from Covid-19 wards about likely mismanagement.While a section of doctors said that a mobile phone could, indeed, carry the virus if not properly disinfected, another section of doctors said that the ban could adversely affect the Covid-19 patients who are kept in isolation and use the mobile phone a lot to stay occupied. The instruction was given on Tuesday night by an additional secretary of the health and family welfare department of the state government in a WhatsApp message sent to the district magistrates, chief medical officer of health and superintendents of all Covid-19 hospitals. On Wednesday, a top official of the state’s health administration confirmed that mobile phones were indeed being prohibited. “Since mobile phones can be a potential source of spreading Covid-19 infection, no one will be allowed to carry, possess or use mobile phones inside the Covid hospitals in the State. This applies to all persons inside the hospital, whether patients or staff on duty. The deposit of patients’ mobile phones may be taken and a receipt may be given to them,” reads the internal message. “To ensure they have a communication channel to the hospital administration, intercom facility may be provided in the wards. The contact number of the control room or the hospital superintendent/manager should be publicised prominently among the patients. Also, land line arrangements with STD calling be kept ready in case the patient needs to make a call or receive a call from outside,” the message said. The instructions added that the hospital staff on duty should be informed of the restrictions on the use and carrying of mobile phones inside the wards and treatment areas. “While implementing this, take all measures for especially ensuring that the patients need for communication with hospital authorities is attended to with due priority,” the instruction said.Several Covid-19 patients who have recovered said that they had spent their time in isolation watching movies and listening to music on YouTube.“It is because we listened to Buddhist hymns on YouTube and received positive messages from friends and relatives on WhatsApp that my wife and I were able to deal with the unprecedented situation of contracting this disease, especially at a time when we lost one of our relatives to the disease,” said Dharamnath Singh, 59, a resident of Kalimpong in north Bengal.Another patient who is at present admitted at the infectious diseases hospital in Kolkata said that making and receiving calls from friends and relatives relieved him of the stress of living in complete isolation in the hospital.Senior doctor Punyabrata Goon said he suspected the government’s move is aimed at blocking the flow of information from Covid-19 wards.“Anything, from the mobile phone to watches and purses could be a carrier of the virus. But specifically prohibiting only mobile phones seems to be aimed at blocking flow of information from Covid-19 wards, as in the recent times some video clips emerged from a few Covid wards of hospitals that reflected mismanagement of the authorities,” Goon said. Incidentally, Central minister Babul Supriyo had shared a video from his Twitter account that allegedly revealed mismanagement at M R Bangur hospital, a Covid-19 hospital in Kolkata.On Wednesday, Supriyo wrote on Twitter, “Honble @MamataOfficial banning mobiles in hospitals ‘Kind of’ proves that the Bangur Hospital video was not fake -Thank you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-bans-mobile-phones-from-covid-19-wards-in-all-hospitals-sparks-row/story-u2A5vG1vNHg6qAFXFGyR8I.html

22-04-2020||India||Transporters seek fuel cost reduction, toll suspension amid financial crunch||Transporters have sought an immediate reduction in fuel cost and suspension of toll collection citing financial crunch because of the ongoing lockdown, which was initially enforced by the government from March 25 for 21 days and then further extended by another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Transporters have also urged the government to formulate a rescue package, including the extension of health insurance coverage to drivers and labourers involved in the movement of goods across the country. On Wednesday, the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways officials held a meeting with transport associations. The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) --- an apex body of transporters --- had reached out to the government, seeking an economic package for the sector. The cash-strapped sector is trying to bring back migrant labourers, as most of them have gone back to their native places because of the lockdown woes, and also to resolve supply chain hurdles.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“All pertinent issues were discussed such as the non-implementation of the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) directives on the ground, problems in bringing back drivers, providing insurance coverage to drivers and co-drivers, suspension of toll collection, reduction of diesel prices and a comprehensive financial package for the sector. The talks on insurance coverage for drivers is in final stages, and we’re hopeful of a positive announcement over the next few days,” said Kultaran Singh Atwal, president, AIMTC.On April 17, the Centre had issued an order to the national highways authority of India (NHAI) to resume toll collection from April 20. “India, which is the third-biggest importer of crude oil, couldn’t cash in on the historic slump in oil prices because of the Covid-19 outbreak. There has been no respite for spiralling diesel prices, which is impacting the transport sector in a big way. Besides, value-added tax (VAT) and excise duty have also increased significantly over the last four years. To make matters worse, toll collections have resumed from April 20, despite our stiff resistance. The government has increased toll rates by up to 7% from April 1. The sector is crumbling under financial strain and we’ve been pleading with the government to suspend toll collections for at least the next six months,” Atwal said. On April 10, HT had reported that truck drivers have asked for various safeguard measures, including Rs 50 lakh insurance coverage for those engaged in the supply chain and free medical treatment for those who test Covid-19 positive.“There is a clamour among the road transport fraternity for a minimum rescue package and suspension of toll collection, as the sector’s hardships are mounting by the day. Pending payments, mobility of drivers and co-drivers, hundreds, and thousands of trucks stranded on highways are making a transporter’s life difficult amid the lockdown. For instance, if a transporter has 600 stranded vehicles then as per the existing norms of two drivers per vehicle, he has to send 600 empty vehicles with 1,200 drivers to bring the stranded drivers back to their base,” Atwal said. Truck drivers have also urged the Centre to ensure preventive measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 among drivers involved in the movement of goods. Earlier, transporters had also asked the government to provide sanitisation points for trucks at loading and unloading points at every 200 kilometres on national highways.“Our worst fears have come true, as quite a few drivers have tested Covid-19 positive, despite repeated advisories and constant reminders to the government to ensure preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease. A truck driver, who travelled from Panipat to Gwalior, tested Covid-19 positive recently. We had also proposed no contact movement for drivers, including checking their documents, but the authorities concerned never paid heed to our suggestions. Besides, drivers on the move are yet to be provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) units such as masks, sanitisers, gloves, etc,” Atwal added.On April 15, the MHA had issued guidelines to allow repair shops and eateries located alongside highways to reopen for stranded drivers. The government had also issued several advisories to state chief secretaries, urging that the movement of both essential and non-essential goods be allowed in a bid to avoid their shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transporters-seek-fuel-cost-reduction-toll-suspension-amid-financial-crunch/story-dH7h0urEa6cHU8fY7qq9DJ.html
22-04-2020||India||Covid-19: ICMR ban on rapid tests triggers debate on Chinese versus South Korean kits||With the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) suspending rapid tests for two days, a debate has begun over the efficacy of Chinese and South Korean kits.Some states such as Rajasthan and West Bengal got the Chinese rapid testing kits imported by ICMR, while other states such as Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on their own imported the kits from South Korea.Rajasthan and West Bengal governments have complained about the efficacy of thousands of Chinese rapid testing kits saying they were giving faulty results after which the ICMR suspended the rapid tests across the country.On the other hand, the Andhra Pradesh government, which has placed an order for two lakh kits from the South Korean company but received only one lakh kits in the first consignment, has not had complaints so far.Andhra Pradesh Commissioner of medical and health, Katamneni Bhaskar, said as many as 10,000 samples were tested using the South Korean rapid testing kits on Tuesday and there were no complaints from experts. After testing 10,000 samples on the first day, the state government stopped the tests following ICMR’s orders.“The tests have been stopped following instructions from the Indian Council of Medical Research. We will resume testing after getting the nod from the ICMR,” he said.Bhaskar, however, refused to divulge the details of how many of the 10,000 samples tested on Tuesday were positive and negative. “We cannot reveal the details without approval from the ICMR,” he said. Another government official, however, said that most of the test results were negative.The health commissioner said the rapid antibody tests cannot be entirely relied upon to test whether the person is positive or negative for Covid-19. “It is only a screening test and not the final test to prove whether a person is Covid-19 positive or negative. You cannot take the result of these rapid antibody tests on its face value,” he said.Bhaskar said the rapid tests have to be done only on the people who have been suffering from Covid-19 related symptoms for at least 10 days. “If we do rapid antibody tests before this 10-day period, there is a possibility that it may give a false negative result. The person might test positive in the RT-PCR (Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test, which is the authentic test,” he said.However, the Rajasthan government, which was the first to say no to rapid tests using Chinese kits, said the Chinese kits procured by ICMR gave just 5.4% correct results as against expected efficiency of 90%. “The co- relation between the PCR test and the rapid test should have been 90% but it was only 5.4%,” said Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma.Dr S Banerjee, head of the medicine department at Jaipur’s SMS hospital, and member of the panel to check efficacy of the rapid testing kits, said if the anti-body test is positive then two bands appear on the test card after a drop of blood is put in the well of the test card. If a single line appears on the card, the test is negative.“In the tests they conducted, the kit did not show two bands even for (Covid-19) positive patients,” he said.On Wednesday, West Bengal chief secretary Rajiv Sinha called it “wastage of time” in conducting rapid tests with the kits alleging that the ICMR did not check the veracity of the kits before sending them to the state. West Bengal had got 10,000 rapid testing kits of which 220 were used to conduct tests.Bhaskar refused to comment on whether Korean kits were superior to Chinese kits.“We have imported Korean kits and not Chinese kits. So, it is not proper to talk about Chinese kits without using them,” he said. However, special chief secretary (medical and health) K S Jawahar Reddy said recently that the state had preferred importing rapid antibody testing kits from a South Korean company, as there were doubts over Chinese-made kits.Considering the increase in demand from Indian states, the South Korean company SD Biosensor Healthcare Pvt Limited has set up a kit manufacturing unit in Manesar, Gurugram, having the capacity to churn out five lakh kits, a statement from the Embassy of India in South Korea’s capital Seoul said on Tuesday.India is importing five lakh kits from South Korea, which is expected to reach India by April end. Some other state governments such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have also placed orders with South Korean firms for rapid testing kits. Rapid testing kits from China have been put on hold for the time-being, said ICMR officials.There is also a considerable price difference between the kits imported from the two countries. A Rajasthan government official said the cost of a Chinese kit was Rs 600 and a Chhattisgarh government official said they had procured the rapid kit from a South Korean firm for Rs 337 per kit.(Joydeep Gupta in Kolkata and Ritesh Mishra in Raipur also contributed to this story).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-icmr-ban-on-rapid-tests-triggers-debate-on-chinese-versus-south-korean-kits/story-2aMJ0C6xT2WH1hNMhNikII.html

Both the deaths are said to be the secondary contacts of the returnees from Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month.Overall, Andhra Pradesh has reported 24 deaths, while 23 people are reported dead in neighbouring Telangana.According to a bulletin issued by the state medical and health department in the afternoon, as many as 5,757 samples were tested in the last 24 hours of which 5,701 turned negative. Of the remaining 56 positive cases, Guntur and Kurnool accounted for 19 cases each, while Chittoor reported six, Kadapa five, Prakasam four and Krishna three cases.Kurnool and Guntur are leading the list with 203 and 177 positive cases, respectively, followed by 86 in Krishna district, 67 in Nellore, 59 in Chittoor, 51 in Kadapa, 48 in Prakasam, 39 in West Godavari and 36 in Anantapur.The bulletin said 24 patients got discharged from the hospitals in the last 24 hours, including eight in Guntur, five in Anantapur, four each in SPS Nellore and Kadapa, two in Krishna and one in Visakhapatnam.

Doctors and paramedical staff were happy to see off the octogenarian, who was brought out on a wheel-chair. They clapped to greet the woman and other four patients, as they came out.Doctor Ravi Shankar, director of the hospital, said he was particularly happy that the 85-year-old woman had responded to the treatment like any other normal person.The woman had contracted the infection from her son who died of Covid-19 early this month. Her grandson and three others who were serving the deceased were also affected. “In addition to the medication, the patients were provided nutritious food to improve their immunity,” he said.The state government on Wednesday announced that the number of Covid-19 hospitals in the state had gone up from three to 79 as state had increased the number of Covid-19 exclusive hospitals in the state to six per district.A total of 79 hospitals in 13 districts have been converted into Covid-19 hospitals till date.

22-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Odisha preps for deluge of home bound workers as lockdown nears end||The Odisha government which is preparing itself for the return of 7.5 lakh migrants of the State after the lockdown ends said the challenge would be a huge one.“We have to take back our homeward bound brothers and sisters. This is a big humanitarian challenge. In addition to that we have to keep them and the people staying inside Odisha safe,” said state government’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19 Subroto Bagchi.The lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus ends on May 3.“Most of them will be returning from States like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Telengana and Andhra Pradesh where the number of infected people and apprehension of infection is much higher than ours.”Odisha now has 83 cases of Covid-19 after it reported four new cases on Wednesday, all with travel history to neighbouring West Bengal.Odisha’s ratio of positive cases to samples tested is the lowest in the country and only one person has died of Covid-19 so far.Of the 83 positive cases in Odisha, 28 or about one-third of the patients had clear travel history to Bengal, where the cases are surging over the last few days. Many of the people who tested positive, sneaked in through ambulances, fish trucks and other hired vehicles from Bengal. With the porous border failing to prevent people from sneaking in, the Odisha government on Wednesday barricaded more than 50 roads connecting Balasore, Mayurbhanj districts to West Bengal. At least 10 platoons of police have been put on round the clock vigil. Apart from deploying police on the border, chief minister Naveen Patnaik administered the oath of responsibility to sarpanches to prevent people from crossing through the border.Aware of the risk of infection that the migrant population could bring from May 4 onwards, the state government said it would start an online portal, through which thousands of people stranded in various states will register to get back to the state once the lockdown is relaxed. The registration will begin on April 24.Principal secretary of Panchayati Raj Department DK Singh said all the migrants planning to come back to Odisha will have to mandatorily register on the portal for their return. The registration can be done by the migrant person himself/herself, anyone on behalf of the person or a relative of the person in his native who will have to fill a form and submit it to the officials at Gram Panchayat.Through the registration, the government will get to know about the details about the returnees and make arrangements for transport and other medical facilities for them at respective Gram Panchayat level, Singh said. “Once they arrive, they will be sent on quarantine at temporary medical camps set up at GP level for 14 days. They will be allowed to go back to their houses after the quarantine,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-odisha-preps-for-deluge-of-home-bound-workers-as-lockdown-nears-end/story-OKEEuTuIlJ1Lfuw1mNBHiK.html
22-04-2020||India||In Covid-19 front line, doctors welcome ordinance to protect them||Doctors have welcomed the government’s decision to bring an ordinance to protect the medical fraternity against the violence it has faced since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and to punish wrong-doers.“This was the need of the hour as instances of violence against healthcare workers, including doctors, were on the rise. Not everyone was unruly but a section of people was misbehaving and it needed a regulation to rein it in as this section would not have listened to reason,” said DS Rana, chairman of the board of governors of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.“There was no other way to check their irresponsible behaviour. Healthcare workers are putting their lives at risk in treating patients, and harassment and violence against them is the last thing they want in this crisis situation.”Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageA section of the ordinance states that its promulgation will not only deter criminal elements in society but also give confidence to healthcare workers who were becoming jittery because of attacks. On Sunday, the burial of Samuel Hercules, a doctor in Chennai, was disrupted by violent protesters who damaged the ambulance carrying his body and injured its driver out of fear of the spread of the coronavirus. On April 8, two resident doctors of Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital were allegedly assaulted by a neighbour who accused them of “spreading” the disease. A week before that, two doctors and their team were pelted with stones during a drive to screen and identify possible Covid-19 patients in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore. Shankar Narang, chief operating officer of Paras Healthcare, said: “Healthcare workers are frontline warriors in this battle, and along with other corona-fighters such as sanitation workers and police officials, they are the backbone of our crisis response in this hour.“They are already facing a high risk of infection as they venture into infected areas. It is absolutely essential, therefore, to ensure their safety and security and allow them to do their job with a sense of confidence.”Resident doctors – who get manhandled in hospital emergencies by attendants of patients – across the country have for long been demanding a central law to protect medical staff against violence.Amarinder Singh, former president of the resident doctors association at All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, said: “We have been pressing for a central protection law to be enacted since June last year, when there was violence against doctors in West Bengal. It has been a long-standing demand of doctors, especially resident doctors, who are most vulnerable being the first point of contact.“It is a great move but it seems to be a temporary provision till the pandemic situation lasts. What we would like is that the government makes it permanent, to be implemented long after the outbreak subsides.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-covid-19-front-line-doctors-welcome-ordinance-to-protect-them/story-xLMzCvxgTFHUlxwLXlFF2M.html
22-04-2020||India||Ambulance drivers in Karnataka double up as taxi drivers, bootleggers on the sly||Amid the lockdown that has turned roads across the country into desolate strips of asphalt, many ambulance drivers in Karnataka are trying to mint money by using their vehicles as taxis and for bootlegging.Late Tuesday night, when a police patrol on national highway 13 in Chitradurga district saw an ambulance racing away, it did not initially pay any attention because the sight of ambulances ferrying sick people during the lockdown is a common sight.But when Sub Inspector Manjunath Sidappa and a constable later saw the same ambulance parked some distance away on the highway with a van close to it, they got suspicious and decided to investigate. When they checked the ambulance belonging to Horakere Deverapura (or H D Pura) primary health center, they found that instead of carrying sick people it was ferrying alcohol. The van was the conduit to shift the alcohol to interior villages where it is sold at exorbitant prices to desperate tipplers.Four people including ambulance driver Subaan, lab technician Santosh and two people driving the van Girish and Jeevan were arrested. They were selling liquor sachets which normally cost Rs 90 per sachet at Rs 500 to those desperate for a drink. The four have been arrested, the ambulance seized and a case registered. Chitradurga’s superintendent of police G Radhika made it clear that “action will be taken against anybody violating the lockdown.”Across Karnataka, ambulances are being used for purposes other than what they are meant for ever since the lockdown began. On 19 April, seven people were arrested from an ambulance which was carrying them from Puttur to Mysore. The ambulance was detained after cops at a checkpoint in Dakshina Kannada district got suspicious by the presence of several men in the ambulance. The men later confessed that they were getting a ride in the ambulance to ‘escape the lockdown.’Inter-district movement is banned and Karnataka has sealed its borders with all neighbouring states except for emergency traffic movement.On 13 April, Lingadahalli police had detained an ambulance travelling from Bangalore to Chikmagaluru. The ambulance driver had taken Rs 28,000 from five people who had wanted to go to Ganguru village of Chikmagaluru from Bangalore. The ambulance driver had managed to evade all check posts till Tarikere where some policemen became suspicious because an ambulance with Bengaluru registration was entering a remote village. All of them were not just taken into custody but a case registered and sent to quarantine.A senior health and family welfare department officer speaking to HT who did not want to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media said, ”There may have been some instances of misuse of essential services like ambulance either to ferry people or liqour. In all cases which come to our notice we take the strictest action possible under law. Licenses of such ambulances are suspended and cases registered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambulance-drivers-in-karnataka-double-up-as-taxi-drivers-bootleggers-on-the-sly/story-GM5VGbR4BFTc0AwLtfCchM.html
22-04-2020||India||Jammu and Kashmir administration withdraws order cancelling Amarnath Yatra||The annual Amarnath Yatra in the south Kashmir Himalayas was shelved on Wednesday only to be revived a short while later by the Jammu and Kashmir administration saying the cancelling order stands withdrawn.Earlier, on February 13 when Covid-19 outbreak had not reached the country, the government decided to hold 42-day long annual pilgrimage to the holy cave shrine. The pilgrimage had to start from June 23 and had to conclude on August 3 on the day of Shravan Purnima (Raksha Bandhan).Last year, the duration of the yatra was 40 days while in 2018 the pilgrimage had a duration of 60 days.In an official statement titled “Shri Amarnathji Yatra 2020 cancelled due to outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic”, a spokesman said that the decision was taken at the 38th Board meeting of the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) which met under the chairmanship of Lt Governor G C Murmu at Raj Bhavan.However, he said the board decided that the Pratham Pooja’ and ‘Sampann Pooja’ would be done with traditional fervor.Later, within half an hour, another official statement was issued which read, “The Press Note titled Shri Amarnathji Yatra 2020 cancelled due to outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic may be treated cancelled and withdrawn.” Earlier, Murmu, who is also chairman of the SASB, had said there were 77 red zones identified in the Kashmir valley from where the pilgrimage passed.“Due to this pandemic, the establishment of langars, medical facility, camp establishment, material mobilization and snow clearance are not possible,” he said.“Though Government of India extended the nationwide lockdown till May 3, it is highly unpredictable to know which direction it will take later. The safety of the pilgrims is of prime importance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-administration-withdraws-order-cancelling-amarnath-yatra/story-cvBX8TVelT5HJageI0DT0O.html
22-04-2020||India||South Korean firm begins making rapid testing kits at Manesar facility||A South Korean company has launched the production of Covid-19 rapid antibody testing kits at its subsidiary at Manesar in Haryana, with a capacity of making 500,000 kits per week, to meet the needs of the Indian market.The Chhattisgarh government is set to be one of the first customers for the testing kits made by SD Biosensor Healthcare, the subsidiary of the South Korean firm, with state health minister TS Singh Deo tweeting that authorities plan to procure 75,000 kits at a price of Rs 337 each kit.The move comes against the backdrop of complaints from several state governments about the efficacy of rapid testing kits sourced from China.SD Biosensor rolled out the first batch of test kits at its Manesar facility on April 19, the Indian embassy in Seoul said in a statement.This is an example of the “Make In India for World” policy as the “company plans to ramp up production to meet growing demand in India as well as other part of the world”, it said.SD Biosensor was granted a licence by the Indian government to manufacture the rapid test kits in a “very short period of time”, and this was reflected in the cooperation by the Indian and South Korean governments in the fight against the pandemic, the statement added.The South Korean firm is sourcing materials for making its test kits from India and it “capitalises on India’s low cost, high quality resources and skilled and technical workforce”.SD Biosensor chairman Cho Young-shik met Indian ambassador Sripriya Ranganathan on Tuesday to discuss the company’s plans for countering the Covid-19 pandemic. Ranganathan also visited the firm’s manufacturing facility in North Chungcheong province.Chhattisgarh health minister Deo said in a string of tweets the state government is “procuring 75,000…rapid testing kits at a benchmark price of Rs 337 + GST from a South Korean company based in India, which has proven to be the lowest bidder”. He added the “rate we have been able to close at is the lowest in India” and this was due to interactions with South Korean ambassador Shin Bong-kil and Ranganathan.Yoo Chang-ho, the minister counsellor for political affairs at the South Korean embassy, said: “South Korea and India are very close partners and we are working closely together to overcome these hard times. This production of kits in India is a good example of how dynamic our partnership really is.“We are cooperating to fight these challenges we have in front of us while also taking the opportunity to encourage the ‘Make in India’ policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/south-korean-firm-begins-making-rapid-testing-kits-at-manesar-facility/story-jMEPRyKsN5kxLCJ755JoxI.html
22-04-2020||India||Milind Deora disagrees with Rahul Gandhi’s stand on oil prices||Former Mumbai Congress unit chief Milind Deora has disagreed with senior leader Rahul Gandhi over a demand for passing on benefits of the unprecedented fall in international crude oil prices to consumers.Former party president Gandhi and other leaders have asked the government to pass on the gains of the record plunge in international crude oil prices to consumers by reducing petrol and diesel prices, but Deora questioned the move, asking who would benefit when no vehicles are on the roads.“Prices of crude oil have fallen to unexpected levels across the world, yet why is petrol in our country sold at Rs 69, diesel at Rs 62? It is good that prices have fallen in this disaster. When will this government listen?” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi on Tuesday.But Deora disagreed. “India imports Brent crude – not WTI – currently priced at $21 per barrel. We will import less oil due to weakened demand. Falling rupees may also offset gains from low oil prices. Lastly, when car truck buses train and planes are sitting idle, consumers can’t gain from petrol and diesel price cuts,” he tweeted.Gandhi posed the question on oil prices to the government on a day the Brent crude futures price, the international benchmark, for delivery in June fell to as low as $18.10, its lowest since November 2001.Fuel prices at the pump haven’t budged since mid-March in India, though crude oil has been on the decline because of concerns over the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on world economies and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.Gandhi’s views were echoed by Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, who said oil prices had fallen to less than one dollar a barrel, and yet the government was silent and not reducing prices of petrol and diesel.“WTI Crude Oil price plunges below USD 0 per barrel! We, the People, are still paying Rs 69.59 for Petrol Rs 62.29 for Diesel (Delhi). Why is Modi Government mum? Will ‘Self Styled Nationalists’ at least now become ‘Rationalists’ and demand relief?” Surjewala tweeted.Another party spokesperson, Pawan Khera, asked what was holding the government back from reducing prices when crude oil had fallen to unprecedented lows as manufacturers had no storage capacity. “Why is government not transferring this reduction in oil prices to end-users like farmers and middle class? This relief will go a long way to help them,” he said.Surjewala was also quick to contradict Deora. “@milinddeora bhai. US is now India’s 6th largest Oil Supplier. In the 6 months of 2019-20, we imported 54 lakh tonnes of crude oil from U.S. Also, North India has peak harvesting season now with Diesel guzzling Harvesters Tractors and Trucks…again moving the supply chain,” he tweeted.Deora’s tweet prompted Amit Malviya, in-charge of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national information and technology cell, to take a dig at the former Congress president. “Rahul Gandhi’s smarter colleague, Milind, answers the question…,” he tweeted.The Congress has maintained that the benefits should be passed on to transporters and farmers amid the Covid-19 crisis, given that the government raised oil taxes 12 times in the past six years and raised Rs 20 lakh crore.Deora, a former Union minister, resigned from the post of the Mumbai Congress chief in June last year, in a move seen as an expression of solidarity with Gandhi who stepped down as the Congress president on May 25 after the party’s drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In February 2020, he was engaged in a Twitter war with party colleague, Ajay Maken, after the former praised Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the assembly election win in the city-state.A Mumbai Congress leader said Deora removed the mention of the Congress party from his Twitter bio soon after his resignation as the Mumbai unit chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/milind-deora-disagrees-with-rahul-gandhi-s-stand-on-oil-prices/story-df7j4KndN9Q5JizP7I607J.html

Commending PM Modi’s bid to flatten the curve in India, the co-founder of Microsoft said, “We commend your leadership and the proactive measures you and your government have taken to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 infection rate in India, such as adopting a national lockdown, expanding focused testing to identify hot spots for isolation, quarantining, and care, and significantly increasing health expenditures to strengthen the health system response and promote R&D and digital innovation.”Also read: PM Modi to hold video conference with CMs on Monday as country heads into last week of lockdownGates said he is glad that the Indian prime minister’s government tapped its exceptional digital capabilities as a formulated response to Covid-19. “I’m glad your government is fully utilising its exceptional digital capabilities in its COVID-19 response and has launched the Aarogya Setu digital app for coronavirus tracking, contact tracing, and to connect people to health services.”“Grateful to see that you’re seeking to balance public health imperatives with the need to ensure adequate social protection for all Indians,” the former CEO of Microsoft told PM Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-gates-writes-to-pm-modi-lauds-leadership-in-fighting-covid-19-in-india/story-2ewwjocLeLSOQjuCkGdB2J.html
22-04-2020||India||BMS discusses migrant workers’ issues in industry dialogue||The need for a comprehensive national policy on migrant workers that will include provisions for their social security, guaranteed jobs, medical support and insurance was flagged on Wednesday by the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) at the International Labour Organisation (ILO)-United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO)-led UN Bipartite Dialogue on the Revival of MSMEs and protection of workers. The BMS, which is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and claims to represent over 6,000 trade unions, underlined that in a post-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) world, governments will need to focus on issues related to migrant workers, including reverse migration. The dialogue, in which representatives of trade unions and industry bodies from India shared their views, was held via video conference. Initially, the government imposed lockdown restrictions for 21 days but it was further extended for another 19 days till May 3 amid the spike in Covid-19 positive cases and also issued an order against slashing jobs or wages of stranded migrant workers. Thousands of migrant workers are stranded across the country.The Centre and state government have opened shelters and are providing food to hundreds and thousands of migrant workers, who have been left stranded because of the lockdown amid uncertainties over the loss of their livelihood triggered by the economic downturn due to Covid-19.BMS president CK Saji Narayanan, who participated in the dialogue, said the twin concerns of labour shortage and mobilising returnees back to their workplace can be addressed by issuing electronic passes, free train tickets, cash incentives, etc.“There is a growing need to create a National Agricultural Labour register with details of Aadhaar and Jan Dhan direct benefit transfer accounts, etc. Migrants in labour camps need to have access to ration, health, income support and free internet for communicating with their family members,” he said.He said though the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment has taken the initiative to identify the migrant workers and prepare their database, there is an immediate need for a national policy on this class of people.“We need to normalise economic activities and protect the livelihood of labourers after the lockdown restrictions are lifted. We welcome the Centre’s directive to employers to pay wages and salaries, landlords to exempt payment of rent and not to retrench workers, particularly contract and casual ones. Both domestic laws and international labour standards need to be complied with for MSME workers. Social dialogue and effective consultation with tripartite partners cannot be compromised,” he said.The BMS president offered a suggestion for the MSMEs who are finding it difficult to pay their wage bills during the lockdown period. He suggested that they can look at paying the bills and getting them reimbursed from the government’s stimulus package as income support or wage subsidy. If the MSMEs could avail of this facility, it would improve the relationship between an employer and his workers, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bms-discusses-migrant-workers-issues-in-industry-dialogue/story-XA9VnJLbvZZun8DrjpST6N.html

We conducted 220 tests with these kits. We are lucky that we didn’t proceed earlier with these kits. It was a complete waste of time and energy. ICMR should have tested the veracity of the kits before sending,” Rajiva Sinha, chief secretary of West Bengal said.In all, 7037 tests have been done in Bengal with RT-PCR kits. But two components of the RT-PCR test kits - Viral Transport Medium (VTM) and RNA extraction machine –are in short supply.“Only 3456 RNA extractors and 2500 VTM were supplied by ICMR. To conduct 7000 tests, 14000 VTMs were required. If we had depended solely on ICMR, we wouldn’t have been able to conduct 7037 tests. We had to make our own arrangements. While supply was scarce we were being blamed for low tests,” Sinha said.Banerjee lashed out at the Centre alleging kits were coming in short supply and defective kits were being supplied to the state.“Rapid test kits are being withdrawn because of their defects. The other kits too are either in short supply or have been found to be defective and are being withdrawn. I am not being able to understand the Centre’s plan. Patients will die if not tested. Who will be responsible?” she said.HT had earlier reported that the ICMR-NICED has already decided to replace the apparently defective RT-PCR kits in medical colleges across the state.“ICMR has decided to replace the kits which, some states claimed, were yielding inconclusive results. These kits were supposed to be standardized by the medical colleges and kept in -20 degrees Celsius without which they would give inconclusive results. It appears that the state-run medical colleges neither standardized the kits nor did they maintain the right temperature. But as the tests need to go on these will now be replaced by kits from the National Institute of Virology in Pune,” Shanta Dutta, Director of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases in Kolkata, had said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-10-000-rapid-testing-kits-found-faulty-in-bengal-mamata-lashes-out-at-centre/story-aSnmZngTyFNps97qgSqLPL.html
22-04-2020||India||In Kashmir, doctor sacked for demanding standard quality protective gear||Last week, a young doctor at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) here went out of his way to nurse one of the sickest Covid-19 patients, who later died of the disease, in the isolation ward. However, the doctor was sacked on Monday. Reason: he demanded standard quality personal protective equipment (PPE) for the staff treating infected patients.As the said patient’s family was away, the doctor would feed him, give him medicines, and hours before his death, he even changed his clothes, which he had brought from his home.“The protective gear given to us is like a tissue paper and once I was completely exposed to the virus as the patient’s intravenous fluid leaked and seeped into my clothes through the substandard PPE, while I was changing his clothes,” said the resident doctor who did not want to named.“My heart sank in that moment and I thought about my family. Later, I talked to my seniors and we all protested for good quality PPE sets, but I was sacked on Monday,” he said.The doctor claimed that he was targeted only to threaten the other doctors for demanding standard protective gear. “We work under extreme risk. The administrators don’t dare to come to the wards where we are working day and night. Instead of acknowledging our effort, they targeted me individually and sacked me to set an example and threaten other doctors. Earlier too, they had sacked an ECG technician for demanding protective gear,” he said.“I was threatened and told that my whole family will be sent behind the bars. What has this got to do with my family,” he asked.Some 50km away, a senior doctor working at Government Medical College (GMC), Baramulla, was tested positive on Tuesday, becoming the first health worker to have contracted the disease in the valley. Here too, the hospital staff blamed the lack of proper protective equipment for the doctor’s infection.Last week, the GMC faculty had even written a letter to the principal deploring, among other things, the lack of PPEs. “Our patients are our priority, but we cannot breach the national and international guidelines in terms of our own and families’ safety due to non-availability of specific PPEs,” the letter read.The two incidents have exposed the working conditions of the healthcare workers in Kashmir, which has over 85% of the total Covid-19 cases (351 out of 407) in the Union territory.Besides this, healthcare workers of the hospitals not exclusively for Covid-19 treatment have also raised similar concerns. “We are working without protection kits and have been provided simple gowns and washable masks which we are supposed to use for a month. Shoe covers have to be used as headgears and only using two gloves in 24 hours is allowed,” said a nurse at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital’s casualty wing.Civil society members are questioning the authorities over the lack of standard protective gear.“How can the administration take healthcare staff’s safety so lightly? I get have received so many calls from the frontline workers complaining that their protective gears are flimsy,” said Mudasir Naqshbandi, an advocate.Reyaz Ahmad Untoo, principal of SKIMS Bemina, said the doctor was on a tenure engagement and was asked to go because of “gross indiscipline”.“He rebuked and abused a senior faculty member and was inciting other doctors about the PPE kits being improper. Everybody in the hospital gets the same kit, if they don’t have issues, what is his problem,” Untoo asked adding that a committee looks into the quality issues and they have not raised any questions.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said they were acquiring full-body PPE kits from outside as there were no approved manufacturing units in the valley for the same.Stating that the doctor who tested positive in Baramulla was not on Covid-19 duty, Pole said, “Doctors getting exposed to the virus is a cause of concern and I have directed the medical superintendent and the deputy commissioner to make sure it does not happen. Gaps in our preparations, if any, will be rectified,” he ensured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kashmir-doctor-sacked-for-demanding-standard-quality-protective-gear/story-PKS4tn6feo8iNuHEAE4L6H.html
22-04-2020||India||India will stick to its NDCs under Paris Agreement despite Covid-19: Prakash Javadekar||Union environment minister, Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday said India stands committed to its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. He was speaking on a webinar organised by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) organised on the occasion of Earth Day.But Javadekar said action on climate would depend on whether big polluters deliver on their promises. “The biggest hurdle in climate action is broken promises. Next week I am participating in the Petersburg Climate dialogue XI where I will raise this issue. Yes, we have a pandemic (Covid-19) and the economy is impacted, there can be a little delay on action but we have to accept the new lifestyle,” Javadekar said.He said in 2009 the world had agreed that developed countries will mobilise 100 billion dollars every year for climate adaptation and mitigation. “Its been 11 years and the amount is 1 trillion now. Where is the money? There is no money on the table,” Javadekar said adding that a second big promise on technology transfer has also not been delivered on.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageSustainable lifestyle is at the core of India’s ethos, Javadekar said adding that our electricity consumption is only 1,000 units per person per year compared to 12,000 units per person per year in the US.Javadekar added that there was no point romanticising about the clean rivers and air during the lockdown. “Last one month we saw clean rivers, green earth, blue sky, stars, one could see Himalayas from Jalandhar. That is how we used to live in villages... If we want these to continue then we have to stop only a few things -- you cant have vehicles, you cant have industries, cant have cities, you can sustain only 30 crore people and not 130 crore people.”India has three main NDCs -- to achieve 40% of electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030; to reduce the emissions intensity of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 33 to 35% compared to 2005 levels by 2030; to create carbon sinks of about 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-stick-to-its-ndcs-under-paris-agreement-despite-covid-19-javadekar/story-yuffnttLO2HJKX5LcTdIrL.html

22-04-2020||India||Covid-19: A herd immunity strategy could actually work in youthful India||Controversial given the high risk of deaths, a coronavirus strategy discarded by the U.K. is being touted as the solution for poor but young countries like India.The herd immunity strategy, which would allow a majority of the population to gain resistance to the virus by becoming infected and then recovering, could result in less economic devastation and human suffering than restrictive lockdowns designed to stop the virus’s spread, a number of experts have begun to argue in the nation of 1.3 billion people.“No country can afford a prolonged period of lockdowns, and least of all a country like India,” said Jayaprakash Muliyil, a prominent Indian epidemiologist. “You may be able to reach a point of herd immunity without infection really catching up with the elderly. And when the herd immunity reaches a sufficient number the outbreak will stop, and the elderly are also safe.”A team of researchers at Princeton University and the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, a public health advocacy group based in New Delhi and Washington, has identified India as a place where this strategy could be successful because its disproportionately young population would face less risk of hospitalization and death.They said allowing the virus to be unleashed in a controlled way for the next seven months would give 60% of the country’s people immunity by November, and thus halt the disease.Mortality could be limited as the virus spreads compared to European nations like Italy given that 93.5% of the Indian population is younger than 65, they said, though no death toll projections were released.The radical proposal underscores the challenges that poorer developing countries -- including nations like Indonesia and some in sub-Saharan Africa -- face in curbing the epidemic using the lockdown measures that have been adopted by advanced economies.The impossibility of social distancing in crowded living conditions like in many cities and villages in India, the lack of testing kits to detect infections and the human suffering that occurs in lockdowns suggests a different path may be needed in these places.To do this, the Princeton and CDDEP team recommends lifting India’s strict lockdown -- which has been extended to May 3 -- and letting most of the population younger than 60 return to normal life, though social distancing still would be encouraged, masks would be required and large gatherings would be banned. The reopening would be accompanied by an effort to test as many people as possible and isolate confirmed and suspected cases.The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given no indication it plans to adopt such a strategy.Yet the government has laid out criteria that effectively rations coronavirus tests, limiting them to the very sick or most at risk. Critics who suspect the disease has spread much more widely than the official numbers suggest say the government’s restrictive criteria amounts to allowing the disease to spread.Pessimistic Indian Doctors Brace for Tsunami of Virus Cases“In some sense, you are saying, we will let them get infected and recover, and take care only of those who are sick,” said T. Sundararaman, the New Delhi-based global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement, a public health group. “That’s the policy, that’s what it amounts to.”The government has maintained its testing criteria gives an accurate tally of India’s number of cases, and says the disease is not spreading untracked in the community. Nevertheless, as India has ramped up testing, it is finding more cases each day, bringing the nationwide tally to 18,658, with 592 deaths, as of April 20.But if questions remain as to the extent and severity of India’s outbreak, the costs of the government’s lockdown are clear. Local governments have had to set up camps to house 1.25 million migrants who left cities when they lost work, while food camps feed 7.5 million daily wage earners also rendered destitute by the lockdown. There are already signs these stopgap measures are starting to fray.India Workers Paid $4 a Day Are Trapped Between Hunger and Virus“We’re dealing with a trade-off against starvation, hunger, all this other stuff,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the CDDEP and a Princeton researcher. By allowing the coronavirus to spread in a controlled way, “undoubtedly there will be deaths, but it will be much smaller this way, and it opens us up for business by November,” he said.But the strategy has already proved controversial internationally. The U.K. adopted and then abandoned it early in the pandemic after projections showed its health care system would be overwhelmed by the resulting hospitalizations. That brief dalliance is still being blamed for the British government’s slow response in testing for the virus.Risky StrategyEven in a country like India with a young population, the concept has inherent risks. Allowing people to become infected will inevitably bring many more patients to hospitals. The researchers say India will have to urgently expand critical care and isolation-bed capacity to ensure that multiple waves of patients don’t become casualties before herd immunity is reached.Another risk is that India’s worst-in the-world air pollution and high rates of hypertension and diabetes have compromised young people’s health, meaning that mortality from the virus could be higher than expected. People may let their guards down and fail to follow social distancing guidelines.“I would worry that it would relax concerns of younger individuals, who still remain at substantial risk themselves,” Jason Andrews, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said in an email. “The messaging in particular may lead younger people to perceive themselves as at lower risk than they are, and to fail to understand their potential role in transmission.”And given the novel coronavirus only made its debut in humans some time late last year, there’s still a lot that’s unknown. Immunity from the virus may be a more complex process than expected. One group of researchers estimated as much as 82% of the population would have to be infected before herd immunity is reached.“My view is there are a number of questions about whether it can work,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The main questions being how much immunity do we need in the population, and how much immunity does each person get as a result of infection.”Then there’s also the question of whether it’s possible to wall off the higher-risk portion of the population in densely packed India, where multiple generations commonly live under one roof.Ultimately, the researchers lobbying for the strategy argue that cultivating herd immunity may be the best of various bad options.“I think eventually all countries will follow this Indian model,” Laxminarayan said. “Because otherwise we are going to be in lockdown on and off all the way through until June of next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-a-herd-immunity-strategy-could-actually-work-in-youthful-india/story-tvF0jaOVfN0nACccdBUZoJ.html
22-04-2020||India||Buyers rush to farmer’s rescue who sought help on Twitter with 100 tonnes cabbage||On 18 April, Kannaiyan Subramaniam, a farmer in Karnataka’s Chamarajanagara district, posted a 15-second video on Twitter seeking help to find buyers for his 100 tonnes of cabbage ready for harvest. Forget profit, he said he would be happy to sell his stock at Rs 3 a kilo, barely covering his investment.On April 20, Hindustan Times published a piece on the plight of vegetable farmers such as Subramaniam who were piling up massive losses unable to sell their produce during the prolonged lockdown. Within a day of the story’s publication, Subramaniam said, he was able to find buyers for most of his crop. This includes Waycool, a Chennai-based agriculture technology startup, which has purchased eight tonnes from Subramaniam at Rs 5.5 a kilo with the option of buying up the entire lot in accordance with the demand. Several Charitable organisations in Bengaluru and Coimbatore have bought smaller lots of 3000 kilos.Waycool procures nearly 250 tonnes of farm produce every day and sells it to large retail chains and restaurants in South India. The company has even arranged to pick up the stock from Subramaniam’s farm saving him transportation cost. “When we read Subramaniam’s story, we felt this is what our company was built for. And it was the right thing to do,” said Karthik Jayaraman, CEO, Waycool.“With no buyers in sight I would have had to write-off Rs 300,000. More painful was the prospect of helplessly watching 100 tonnes of vegetables rot. After HT highlighting my story, I was flooded with calls from people who were keen to buy. In the process I have found some who I could do business with even in the long term,” said Subramaniam, who sold his previous harvest of cabbages at Rs 11.50 per kilo.With markets shut and people homebound due to the lockdown, vegetable farmers across India are saddled with massive losses. Since Monday, other farmers too have taken to social media platforms to seek buyers, including a watermelon farmer from Bijapur, a tomato farmer from Sarjapur and a banana farmer from Tutocorin. According to an April 8 report by financial research firm Credit Suisse, despite a bumper harvest in the Rabi season, the arrival of fruit and vegetables in the country’s 7000 wholesale markets has fallen by 50% to 95%, as only a fraction have been functioning after the lockdown was enforced on March 25. In 2019-20, farmers sold 284 million tonnes of horticultural produce worth Rs 5 lakh crore. Even assuming only a 50% fall in market arrivals over a month of lockdown, vegetable farmers would have lost in excess of Rs 20,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buyers-rush-to-farmer-s-rescue-who-sought-help-on-twitter-with-100-tonnes-cabbage/story-mEBdr4oREDvdR1Ln4AmvaM.html

We have taken their samples and sent them for Covid-19 testing on Wednesday morning, as a precautionary measure as we are suspecting that they might have contracted the deadly virus. The test results are awaited,” said Dr NS Khatri, deputy chief medical superintendent of the hospital. Follow coronavirus latest updates here.Dr Khatri said the 23-year-old man was referred to Doon Hospital from Coronation Hospital in Dehradun on Tuesday afternoon, “in a very critical condition, without any pulse or blood pressure rating and died of cardio-respiratory arrest.” The 75-year-old man was admitted to Doon Hospital on Monday afternoon. Neither patient had any history of foreign travel nor were they living near any hotspot area in Dehradun.Uttarakhand has so far reported 46 cases of Covid-19 out of which 19 people have recovered.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that obstructs airflow to and from the lungs.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Wednesday held a meeting with senior officials regarding control and various arrangements to check the Covid-19 pandemic and instructed officials to make concessions as per the Centre’s guidelines.“Covid-19 cases are doubling across India on an average of 7.5 days, while in Uttarakhand, they are doubling in 26.6 days. From this point of view Uttarakhand is in a far better position in tackling the outbreaks and ranks third in preventing coronavirus infection in the country,” said Rawat.Rawat directed the officials that for effective control of Covid-19, honouring corona warriors by garlands, shawls or giving bouquets, need to be banned completely with immediate effect as it goes against norms of social distancing. Apart from this, people should also not take photographs with the people who are distributing the goods, he said.The CM asked officials to make an action plan on how to generate income for small businessmen and locals along with giving permission for agricultural works as per the guidelines of the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-covid-19-suspects-die-in-designated-hospital-in-dehradun-test-results-awaited/story-cH7IXMiv908KagRtkWRP3M.html

Oli described India’s help as “generous” and added that it will aid Nepal’s fight against the spread of COVID-19.“I thank PM Narendra Modi ji for India’s generous support of 23 tonnes of essential medicines to Nepal, to fight #COVID19 Pandemic,” Oli’s tweet said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been lauded by several heads of states including US President Donald Trump, Brazilian President JL Bolsonaro, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, Kazakhstan President Qasym-Jomart Tokayev to name a few, who were all grateful for India’s decision to remove an embargo on the export of anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine and Paracetamol, which are in high global demand for their use in the treatment of COVID 19 patients. India has supplied several hundred tonnes of essential medicines to friendly countries across the globe. Among its immediate neighbours, New Delhi has either already sent medical supplies to Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh or is in the process of sending them.On April 20, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had thanked PM Modi.“Thank you my friend Prime Minister @narendramodi , and thank you India for providing 500K tablets of hydroxychloroquine, 100K tablets of paracetamol, and 75,000 metric tons of wheat, that the first consignment of it (5,000) will reach AFG in a day or so, for the Afghan people,” Ghani had tweeted.Several of Saarc countries are highly dependent on India for their medical supplies including Hydroxychloroquine. India is one of the largest manufacturers of this medicine.The Indian government has allayed domestic concerns over the availability of the medicine as the outbreak peaks, by saying it had stocked more than double of the required and projected doses. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier in March, most members of Saarc grouping barring Pakistan had praised Modi’s initiative for a joint regional response to the pandemic by sharing of experiences, technology, funding and related expertise. PM Modi has often stressed on New Delhi’s unwavering commitment to its neighbours and friendly countries.PM Modi had also told the leaders of the G-20 grouping that the world needed to keep humans at the centre of the global response instead of the economic targets while dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.

22-04-2020||India||UP carpet factory owners disgruntled as relaxations come with conditions, refuse to open units||To help states grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the centre had announced that certain industries would be allowed to function starting April 20. Uttar Pradesh allowed 11 types of industries, including paper, sugar mills, cement, fertilisers, among others to start operations. The carpet industry was another. India exports carpets worth about Rs 12,000 crore annually. Eastern UP’s Bhadohi district alone accounts for Rs 7,000 crore of the exports, according to Carpet Export Promotion Council India (CEPC) data.However, carpet manufacturers in the district are disgruntled because the relaxation of the curbs has come with conditions which they said were not feasible. At least 40 carpet manufacturers and factory owners, who attended a meeting with district authorities on April 20 have unanimously decided not to begin operations despite the financial losses they are incurring during the lockdown, as the authorities have asked them to provide accommodation to workers inside factory premises. This is not possible, they said, as factories have not been designed for residential purposes and they would not be able to guarantee that the coronavirus would not spread in such makeshift accommodations.The Bhadohi district administration on Monday held a meeting with the members of All India Carpet Manufacturers Association (AICMA) and CEPC to give them permission to open the factories starting April 21 as long as certain conditions were fulfilled. The administration asked factory owners to screen workers, make sure they wore masks and maintained social distance, and significantly only employ those workers who didn’t live near Covid-19 hotspots. The authorities also asked factory owners to ensure that the workers are provided accommodation within factories. “In a meeting on Monday, the carpet manufacturers and owners of carpet factories were apprised of the guidelines and instructions required to be followed by them. They have been allowed to operate the factories with certain conditions as per instructions from the government,” Deputy commissioner industries, Bhadohi, Harendra Pratap Singh confirmed. According to AICMA executive member and former honorary secretary Piyush Barnwal, not all conditions are practical, which is why the owners have decided not to reopen the factories as long as the lockdown continues.“The administration has imposed many conditions and it is not possible for us to implement them practically. Therefore, we have decided to not run our factories and start production till the lockdown is over,” he said. According to some owners, factories cannot be converted into proper residential facilities due to a lack of space and the existing design. Barnwal said that in most factories, it would not be possible to keep even 50% of the workers together on the premises, and the possibility of spread of Sars-Cov-2 could not be ruled out.Bhadohi district has one case of a Covid-19 patient: an 18-year-old migrant worker in a makeshift shelter home at a college tested positive on April 12. He was later shifted to an isolation ward where he is under treatment. Imtiyaz Ahmad, owner of Textico, a carpet manufacturing and export unit based in Bhadohi said he would not open his factory for the same reason. “The government should ease the conditions,” he said. Another factory owner, who doesn’t wish to be named said that while it is possible to screen workers, it is difficult to find out which area they have visited or whom they met in the past 15 days. Rajkumar (who goes by his first name), a carpet weaver who lives in the outskirts of Bhadohi said that it would be difficult for weavers like him to live in factories at this time, as this was the harvesting season. The carpet industry provides employment to 2 million persons nationwide. A majority of them, like Rajkumar, belong to the unorganized sector. In UP, for instance, the industry provided employment to the people largely in rural pockets of Mirzapur, Bhadohi and Varanasi. After the carpets are woven — usually at home, women comprise a large section of the weavers — they are carried to factories, where they are washed, stretched, bound and made ready for shipment. The Indian floor coverings industry, which includes the carpet manufacturing hub in and around Bhadohi is already staring at heavy losses as at least 40% international orders have been cancelled in past three months due to uncertainty in the international market caused by the pandemic, said CEPC chairman Siddh Nath Singh.With the lockdown in place, existing orders have been on hold for the past month. “Around 60% orders are on hold. Of these around 2/5th are at the ports awaiting shipment and one fifth is held up in godowns due to lack of transportation. Uncertainty looms large over these orders too,” Singh said. Even if the manufacturers begin production of the carpets, Singh feared that it would be difficult to get export orders from the United States of America and the European market comprising Italy, Germany, France and Spain — both of which form the bulk of our export market at 55% and 25% respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-carpet-factory-owners-disgruntled-as-relaxations-come-with-conditions-refuse-to-open-units/story-WItWozztIca8zQta1q8SbM.html

It will ensure safety of our professionals. There can be no compromise on their safety,” PM Modi tweeted shortly the government announced the ordinance. The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 manifests our commitment to protect each and every healthcare worker who is bravely battling COVID-19 on the frontline. It will ensure safety of our professionals. There can be no compromise on their safety!The Prime Minister had several times in the past few weeks warned people against misbehaving with medical professionals who are in the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic in the country.The ordinance allows for stringent punishment for the attackers of up to 7 years in prison and or a penalty of up to Rs 5 lakh. Several states like Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have invoked the National Security Act and provisions of Indian Penal Code to take action against those attacking medics.Over the past few weeks, several doctors and health workers in different parts of the country have faced attacks in the course of their duties, often by relatives and neighbours of people who have tested positive for Covid-19. In many places doctors and nurses have been harassed by landlords who have asked them to vacate their accommodations for fear that they could spread infection.Several doctors associations have repeatedly asked the government to bring in a law to make attacks on medical professionals a non bailable offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-compromise-on-medics-safety-pm-modi-on-ordinance-for-health-workers/story-aMWGSBJElO4i95eIRpywmI.html
22-04-2020||India||PM Modi to hold video conference with CMs on Monday as country heads into last week of lockdown||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will once again hold discussions with the chief ministers on Monday as the nation enters into the last week of lockdown brought in to check the spread of coronavirus. The PM is likely to seek views of states in lifting the lockdown, which is in place till May 3. Earlier today, the government passed an ordinance to protect health workers from violent attacksOn April 20, Telangana state cabinet decided to extend the lockdown period in the state till May 7.The number of coronavirus cases touched 20,471 on Wednesday, with 652 deaths, according to data from the ministry of health and family welfare. Maharashtra is the worst-affected state with 6,191 cases of the coronavirus disease, and 251 deaths.Earlier, in his third interaction with chief ministers since the first lockdown began on March 25, the PM acknowledged that many CMs suggested that the lockdown be extended for a fortnight.Subsequently, the PM did extend the lockdown period, saying that India will have to strike a balance between “jaan” (lives) and “jahan” (the outside world).For the government, both at the central and state level, the situation clearly has posed a difficult choice. The demands of public health -- which dictate that an extension of the lockdown is the best way to control the spread of the disease — and the demands of the economy — which is in crisis with supply and demand shocks, closure of factory plants, business becoming unviable, loss of jobs and incomes — have to be reconciled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-hold-videoconference-with-cms-on-monday-as-country-heads-into-last-week-of-lockdown/story-WSkrMwO5VTvqPdfA8E66FI.html

The teams of doctors have been asked to probe the reason for the sudden outbreak of classical swine fever and suggest remedial measures, according to Atul Bora, the state agriculture and animal husbandry minister. Dhireshwar Kalita, principal scientist at Assam Agriculture University (AAU), told journalists that the deaths were due to classical swine fever and not swine flu, or H1N1.“Classical swine fever is a viral disease, which attacks pigs at this time of the year. However, this year the attack has been severe resulting in the death of a large number of pigs and mounting losses for farmers,” said Manoj Basumatary, president, North East Progressive Pig Farmers’ Association (NEPPFA).Classical swine fever afflicts only pigs and not humans. The outbreak can be prevented through vaccination, he added. “Swine flu, or H1NI, is a flu that affects humans. The outbreak lasted between January 2009 and August 2010. The H1N1 flu virus can’t be spread by consuming pork products even though it is informally called swine flu,” Basumatary said.Assam has the highest pig population in the country. The north-east consumes over 65% of the country’s total pork production and the region’s pork meat business is estimated to be around Rs 75,000 crore, according to the 20th livestock census data from 2012 to 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swine-fever-kills-1-300-pigs-in-assam-farmers-hit-hard/story-FJ86KEwd3fTKrYURrxxe1O.html

In this regard, a memorandum will also be written to the highest authorities including J&K L-G GC Murmu. We hope the media fraternity, which is working amid huge challenges will get a conducive atmosphere to deliver their day to day duties,” the statement reads.Jammu and Kashmir Police on Tuesday had filed a FIR against journalist Gowhar Geelani accusing him of glorifying terrorism on social media. He is the third journalist to be booked in last two days. Police said the cyber police station, Kashmir zone, has received information through reliable sources that Gowhar Geelani is indulging in unlawful activities through his posts and writings on social media platforms which are prejudicial to the national integrity, sovereignty and security of India.The fresh case comes a day after police had registered cases against woman photo journalist Masrat Zahra and Peerzada Ashiq. Police had invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) against Zahra for allegedly uploading ‘anti-national posts’ on her social media accounts. Former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: “No ifs, no buts, no whataboutery - this campaign of FIRs against journalists and commentators in Kashmir is wrong and must stop. If your version of events is so weak that you have to charge these people, it says more about what is happening in Kashmir than anything they have written.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/withdraw-fir-against-valley-scribes-kashmir-press-club/story-dbbKNhQf53HhyvUOMrCz9K.html

Jaipur, which is a coronavirus hotspot, reported 66 cases while 44 cases were reported from Ajmer, which has seen a worrying rise in cases in the past couple of days.Six cases were reported from Kota and seven from Tonk. Four cases were reported from Nagaur. Three cases were reported from Jodhpur, another hotpot. One case each was reported from Bharatpur, Dausa and Sawai Madhopur.Jaipur now has 663 Covid-19 cases while Jodhpur has 326, which includes 47 positive cases of evacuees from Iran. A total of 27 people have died of the coronavirus in the state.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.Health minister Raghu Sharma said the positive cases were not a matter of concern as it shows the real situation on the ground regarding the spread of the disease. “Aggressive testing is part of our strategy. We are now conducting 4,700 tests per day and soon we will be in a position to carry out 10,000 tests per day. After that we will establish testing facilities in all 33 districts,” he said.Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health, had already said that the rise in number of positive cases was expected on Tuesday and Wednesday as the test results of the backlog 4,000 samples sent to a private lab in Delhi have started coming will be entered in the database.Sharma said the government had hoped that the rapid testing kits would aid in tracing symptomatic cases but the 30,000 kits that were sent by the ICMR to Rajasthan were found faulty.“To test accuracy of the kits, we used 168 kits to test Covid-19 patients. It showed even positive patients as negative. There should have been a 90 per cent corelation between the rapid test and PCR test but there was only 5.4 per cent corelation so we stopped the tests and wrote to ICMR,” he said.Rajasthan was also boosting the health workforce in the state with the appointment of 2,000 doctors soon, the minister said.“The process of recruitment of 2,000 doctors that was announced in the budget has started. In one month or so, we will finish the recruitment process,” he said. The minister said 735 doctors who were recently recruited have already been posted in districts.He said the recruitment process 12,500 General Nursing and Midwifery (GNM) and Auxiliary Nursing Midwifery (ANM) posts had been completed but their posting was stuck due to litigation.“We have consulted the advocate general on this and it has been decided that 9000 posts on which there are no litigations, those staff will be posted in the field.”In view of continuing attacks on police personnel and health workers in the state, Sharma reiterated that no misbehaviour with COVID warriors will be tolerated. “Strict action will be taken and arrests will be made, if required.”He said for convenience of patients suffering from other illnesses who are finding it difficult in these times to get treatment, the government has started 400 mobile OPD vans from Wednesday.These vans will take patients or pregnant women to the nearest health facility so they can get treatment, especially in curfew bound and rural areas, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/133-new-covid-19-cases-take-rajasthan-s-count-to-1-868/story-gp3Gr6DjR2YfuJIryBwlaO.html

Edited excerpts:Is India testing enough people?Data from India shows that 4-5% people, mostly at-risk populations (symptomatics, contacts, healthworkers or people in containment zones), who have been tested in India are positive for Covid-19, compared to 30-40% in other countries. This indicates testing is appropriate to the situation, but it will have to be scaled up as numbers increase.India has suspended rapid antibody tests because of quality issues. How reliable are rapid tests?Quality serological tests take around six months to be developed with ample data and validation. There’s a flood of tests with unproven quality, which cannot be depended on for diagnosis.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageMolecular (polymerase chain reaction, or PCR) tests are the gold standard for diagnosis because they reveal current infection. This result is actionable, as it can be followed by isolation and treatment for the patient, and quarantine and testing for close contacts. Rapid antibody tests show past infection, and are useful as an epidemiological tool to map community infection and study Sars-Cov2 transmission.Are high summer temperatures expected to slow Sars-CoV2 transmission?We don’t know if temperature will have an effect. From what we know, it may reduce transmission by 10%-20%, but we can’t depend on it to stop transmission.Only 2-8% people in affected populations have antibodies against Covid-19, indicates early data. How many does herd immunity offer protection to?We are very far away from herd immunity. For diseases with high rates of transmission, a higher number of people need to be infected for herd immunity. This virus has an R0 of 2-3, so at least 80% people need to have antibodies against the virus for herd protection. (R0, or R-nought, is the basic reproduction ratio that gives the number of people infected by one case).South Korea has reported reinfection or reactivation in recovered patients. Will reinfection affect global efforts to develop a vaccine against Covid-19?There is no evidence reinfection can happen. Molecular tests often detect fragments of the virus RNA that is not viable (cannot cause infection) several days after patients have clinically recovered. Diagnostic results depend on several factors, on how samples are collected, how procedures are followed, and depending on which tests are used, can show false positives or false negatives. We need more studies of the natural history of this infection and what kind of immunity is generated by people.CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) has identified several promising candidates, including some that are already in clinical and pre-clinical trials. How soon can a vaccine be ready?Our goal is a vaccine before 18 months. Normally, it takes about a decade to develop a vaccine, but global partnerships (between health agencies, academics, donors, industry, nations and philanthropies) have helped hasten development of vaccines against emerging public health threats. A vaccine against Ebola took five years, the one against zika took less than two years. The global effort to develop a Covid-19 vaccine in less than 18 months is unprecedented and would be an amazing achievement.How has the virus evolved? Is the new vaccine expected to offer long-term protection?Over 10,000 viral genome sequences of Sars-Cov-2 have been shared by 70-80 countries with GISAID , which is a global initiative to share influenza data. Since the start of the pandemic, laboratories in countries across the world have generated viral genome sequence data with GISAID, which has enabled real-time progress in the research and development of vaccines and drug therapies.Some evolution in the virus is bound to happen, but the rate of mutations is lower than the influenza viruses. Scientists have identified three different closely related lineages, which give valuable insights into the origin of the virus and epidemiological data on how it is spreading across the world.None of the changes are on any important sites – the spike protein, polymerase or protease -- which are being targeted by potential vaccines and drug therapies. These sites have no major mutations, so an effective and long-lasting vaccine appears possible.What is the progress on WHO’s Solidarity Trial for Covid-19 treatment? Which are the most promising therapies?It’s too early for results. India is part of this trial, with 1,200 patients enrolled so far globally. The approvals have been obtained by the National AIDS Research Organisation in Pune, which will coordinate the study.How do you rate India’s Covid-19 response?India’s containment response was very prompt and robust and was rolled out very early, much before cases started rising. It’s exemplary, and the doubling rate of Covid-19 is now eight days. The challenge for India now will be to sustain the gains when the lockdown lifts and to ensure infection rates stay low across all states.New infection rate has dropped in some states like Kerala.Kerala has done a great job. Several things contribute to its success, such as a strong primary health system, a good panchayati raj system and local governance, high education levels and public participation. This was also evident during the containment of Nipah virus disease outbreak, when robust public health measures ensured infection did not spread to other states.Do you think Covid-19 has ushered in a new social reality for the world?I believe it will, at least for the next two to three years before we get a vaccine to the majority of the susceptible population. Social distancing will become the norm, which will change the way we work and socialise, with fewer conferences, events and large gatherings.The WHO warned of a second wave of infection on Monday. How high is the threat of resurgence after lockdowns lift?That’s really the question everyone is interested in and is impossible to predict. It depends on a number of things, and can be different in different countries. A lot depends on what steps are taken between lifting the lockdown and the steps post that, and most countries are going for a phased lifting. We see in China that it’s come down to a very low level of new infections, they still have infections. It’s important to get the infection rate down, as places like Taiwan, Hongkong, South Korea and Singapore have done. They still have new infections, but they are more localised outbreaks, which are quickly detected and contained.Will US President Donald Trump’s freeze on funding affect WHO’s work?The WHO will stick to its mandate and continue to support countries in implementing science-based measures to slow transmission, reverse and stop Covid-19. The 193 United Nations member-states recently pledged solidarity in the response to Covid and to support the WHO, in its global role to coordinate and give technical guidance on international health. It’s early days yet, and we hope this decision does not affect our important work too much.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-response-prompt-testing-appropriate-who-s-soumya-swaminathan/story-DGJTl1DzWcC0gounIEYnpN.html

The attacker will be liable to pay twice the market value of the damaged property, according to an amended law cleared by the union government on Wednesday.The amendment, done through an ordinance cleared by the union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, makes changes into the Epidemic Disease Act 1897 to make attacks on health workers a cognizable and non-bailable offence.The ordinance also allows for a stringent punishment for the attackers who will face up to 7 years in prison and or a penalty of Rs 5 lakh.The ordinance comes amid reports of attacks on health professionals engaged in fighting the coronavirus epidemic. Several states like Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have dealt with these attacks by invoking the National Security Act and provisions of Indian Penal Code against the culprits.Union minister Prakash Javadekar said that the ordinance protects the entire medical fraternity including doctors, paramedics and ASHA workers.“It has been seen that they have been attacked while conducting their duty or they have been harassed, but there will be zero tolerance for such behaviour under this government, ” Javadekar said.Several incidents of doctors and other health professionals being harassed by their landlords and other residents, driven by the fear that they could be carrying the deadly disease, have been reported in the last couple of months. Javadekar said that home minister Amit Shah and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan held a video conference with doctors and senior representatives of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and assured them that the government was doing everything possible to provide them with protection while they discharge their duties. Javadekar said that the ordinance mandates that investigations in cases of attacks on health professionals are completed in 30 days and a trial concluded within a year so that speedy justice is delivered.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDr Harsh Vardhan soon tweeted his thanks to the medical body for withdrawing their protest over the continued attacks after the video conference with the two ministers. “I thank the Indian Medical Association for withdrawing their protest after meeting with Union Home Minister @AmitShah & me via VC today. We have assured #IMA that govt is committed to ensuring full safety & protection to doctors as well as all frontline health workers,” his tweet said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-through-nose-for-attacking-covid-warriors-govt-s-ordinance-spells-out-zero-tolerance-policy/story-IVzzmbvCuuepGbjGypFfXM.html
22-04-2020||India||Saved from tigers, Sunderbans’ honey collectors face hunger, poverty amid lockdown||Every year during April and May, honey collectors at Sunderbans risk their lives and enter the mangroves which are home to around 100 tigers. This year, although they are safe from the tigers as they didn’t get any permits due to the coronavirus lockdown, these honey gatherers are facing poverty.These collectors here depend on gathering tons of honey and beeswax from the hives of wild honey bees around this time of the year. For the rest of the year, they depend on fishing and catching crabs in the rivers and creeks - an equally risky business.  55-year-old honey collector Gopal Mondol is safe from tigers but is left without his livelihood and is battling poverty and hunger.Mondol is one of the many honey collectors who live on the remote islands of the Sunderbans. “It is a risky business. Tigers have killed my father, two brothers and cousins in the past. But we still enter the forest to collect around this time as it is a lucrative business and we depend on it. But this year because of the lockdown the forest department has not issued any permits. There is hardly any money in the house to buy the essentials like spices, oil and other items. We are receiving some help from the government but that’s insufficient,” said Mondol, a resident of Pakhiralaya village.Sunderban - the world’s largest delta – comprises 102 islands in India. While 54 are inhabited by humans, tigers rule the rest. Every year, thousands of people enter the forest to collect honey and catch fish, crabs and prawns - legally and illegally - and get attacked by tigers and crocodiles. Many cases go unreported.“Tourism and fishing activities are suspended between April and June every year as it is the spawning and breeding season for fish. Only honey collectors are allowed. But this year because of the lockdown even honey collection has been stopped,” said RK Sinha chief wildlife warden of West Bengal.Every year, around 3000 people are allowed to enter the mangroves with valid permits to collect honey. Many more enter illegally. Locals said that on Monday a villager was killed by a tiger in Pirkali-1 range when a team sneaked into the forest illegally to collect honey. The forest department has no information on this, senior officials said.The state forest development corporation buys a portion of the honey while the rest is sold in the markets by the honey collectors. Even though there is no official figure of the total amount of honey collected, it is estimated that the production could go up to more than 2.5 lakh kilograms.“We used to call it ‘blood-soaked honey’ because, among the many people who get killed and attacked by tigers, maximum are honey collectors. It is because unlike fishermen who stay on boats, honey collectors enter the forest and chase the bees to locate the hives,” said PK Vyas, former chief wildlife warden of West Bengal.West Bengal accounts for the highest number of tiger attacks with around 30 people being killed between 2017 and 2019. Every year, more than 100 people are mauled to death by tigers. But these are just official figures and the total numbers could be much more.“In April, the honey collection reaches its peak. But we are not being allowed to enter the forest because of the lockdown. It would be a huge loss for us. There is hardly any money at home. The local shops have started refusing to give essential items on credit. Whatever rice and dal we are getting from the ration shops is falling short. Hard days lie ahead,” said Nitish Mondol, a honey collector from Lahiripur village.        Nitish said that for a family of five, he has to depend on 20 kilograms of rice, four kilograms of atta, three kilograms of potato for the entire month. “Do you think this is enough to sustain?” he said.    The forest department is rolling out some plans to help these honey collectors. But that would take time and is still in the proposal stage. A few NGOs are also providing food to the villagers but help is yet to reach all the islands.  “We are preparing the budget proposal for the next financial year. It will be placed soon. We are trying to create some extra employment opportunities for these people and link them to various government schemes so that they can cope up with the loss,” said Sudhir Das, field director of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saved-from-tigers-sunderbans-honey-collectors-face-hunger-and-poverty-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-qajHCIIDhcdVUpMDBeDccP.html

On Wednesday, they began painting the classrooms.“We are labourers. We will become sick if we continue to sit idle,” said Shankar Singh Chauhan, 58, from Haryana.“Gaonwalo ne hamari itni achchi vyavastha kar rakhi hai. Badle me hum bhi gaon ke liye kuch karna chahte hain (The villagers made very good arrangements for us. We wanted to do something for them in return),” he added.The district administration brought 54 workers from Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the government senior secondary school at Palsana in Sikar district, 90 km from Jaipur, on March 31 when they were found moving around during the nationwide lockdown.The workers were restless – they had been without work for 15 days.“They started cleaning the school campus from April 15, and on April 18, they came to us to ask for work that would be remembered long after they are gone,” said the school’s principal, Rajendra Kumar Meena.He said the school hadn’t been painted for 10 years. “I discussed with sarpanch Roop Singh Shekhawat if we could arrange for paint. He agreed. My colleagues agreed to fund one 20-litre can of paint each,” he said.“We brought paint and other materials for them and they began painting the verandahs the next day.”Shekhawat said some of the workers had done this sort of work earlier, and the others were helping by scrubbing off the old paint and cleaning the building.“Around six people are painting the school,” Shekhawat said, adding the workers are given three meals and fruits in the evening.“They were happy with our facilities and so they are doing this in gratitude,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-migrant-workers-paint-rajasthan-school-to-express-gratitude/story-KsE59DMEtUQGgmyHFsDBNL.html

Subsequently, the top court had on March 23 directed the states and UTs to set up high powered committees to determine which class of prisoners that can be released on parole or interim bail.The apex court on Wednesday noted that Michel did not qualify for release as per the criteria prescribed by the committee. Michel, who is being probed for his role in the Rs 3,600 crore AgustaWestland chopper deal, was extradited to India from Dubai on December 4, 2018, and was taken into custody by the CBI on December 5. Subsequently, he was arrested by the Enforcement Diractorate (ED) on December 22, 2018 on money laundering charges. He was later sent sent in judicial custody.Michel is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the case by the investigating agencies. The others are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa.The AgustaWestland scam relates to the purchase of 12 helicopters for use by VVIPs in India. It is alleged that Michel, acting as middleman, secured the deal for AgustaWestland Company by paying kickbacks to Indian politicians and officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agustawestland-scam-accused-cites-covid-19-risk-in-bail-plea-sc-declines/story-2muLQ3Mpgi0Ub71qLWKXdO.html

The number of Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh has risen to 1552 and there have been 76 deaths related to the coronavirus disease, which has spread to 26 of the state’s 52 districts.Also read: Congress targets BJP govt over variation in Covid-19 numbers in Madhya PradeshIndore has emerged as one of the major Covid-19 hotspots in the country and prompted the Centre to send a team on Monday to the city to assess and manage the situation.This is the third time the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader will be handling the charge of the health department. Mishra, who has been the health minister twice from 2003 to 2018, will also be the state’s home minister.“The portfolios are being distributed in view of our government’s focus on controlling corona in the state at the moment. The cabinet will be expanded after lockdown period and then the distribution of portfolios among all the ministers will be done after consideration in totality,” chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said.“Narottam Mishra will coordinate among all the departments concerned, government and private agencies, industrialists, traders and individuals and review the situation regarding Corona. He will also get feedback from the district crisis management committees,” he added. Also read: 12-day-old baby girl tests positive in Bhopal, hospitalised Kamal Patel has been made the central state’s agriculture and family welfare minister, Tulsi Silawat has been given the water resources department, Govind Singh Rajput will be the cooperative and food and civil supply minister and Meena Singh will be in charge of the tribal welfare department.Shivraj Singh Chouhan also held a meeting with his cabinet ministers after the allocation of portfolios.The allocation of portfolios came a day after the five were sworn in by Governor Lalji Tandon amid the Covid-19 lockdown on Tuesday morning. Later in the day, Shivraj Singh Chouhan assigned the ministers different divisions to monitor and coordinate the implementation of the measures taken to check the spread of Covid-19.Silavat was health minister in the previous Congress government headed by Kamal Nath and Govind Singh Rajput had revenue and transport departments with him. Both are loyalists of BJP leader and former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia. They joined the BJP last month after rebelling against Kamal Nath, along with four other ministers and 16 MLAs.The Congress party pointed out to the “treatment meted” out to the rebels.“Those who betrayed the Congress to topple its government and joined the BJP cabinet must be shocked with the treatment meted out to them in BJP government as they have been given insignificant departments,” Narendra Saluja, state Congress president’s media coordinator, said.“One of them wanted to become deputy CM in Kamal Nath government but he has been given water resources. When chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan with just five ministers in his cabinet was free to give them important departments what he will give to them after cabinet expansion and more ministers can be anybody’s guess,” he said.Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who was sworn in as the chief minister on March 23, chose to expand his cabinet after nearly a month of taking charge of the central state. The senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader had been criticised by the opposition and on social media for running his government without a cabinet, particularly without a health minister, as the Covid-19 situation continued to worsen in the state.When Chouhan assumed office the coronavirus pandemic was rearing its head in the state with only seven Covid-19 cases registered in two districts. But in the span of about 29 days, the state has registered as many as 1485 Covid-19 cases with 76 of them dead and as many as 26 of its 52 districts affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narottam-mishra-gets-health-dept-as-shivraj-singh-chouhan-distributes-portfolios/story-2gxIDKeBqvL2VR0IUm7QTM.html

22-04-2020||India||‘Corona immune people’ valuable, key to restart economy: Researchers||As nations stare at a crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a group of economic experts from Europe has argued hundreds of thousands of people who were infected and are immune are a key resource from a social perspective and for restarting economic activity.The researchers have advocated this vital resource of “corona immune people” must be looked for, employed effectively or reinstated in all activities, including societal activities such as caring for the elderly and sick, issued immunity certificates by governments and even sent to countries with peak healthcare demand.The research paper titled “Certified corona immunity as a resource and strategy to cope with pandemic costs”, published by Switzerland-based Centre for Research in Economics, Management and the Arts (CREMA), states people who have survived the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are largely immune and the probability of them contracting the same virus a second time within a few years and passing on the disease is small, and hence they should be treated as a resource.The researchers – David Stadelmann (University of Bayreuth, Germany), Reiner Eichenberger (University of Fribourg, Switzerland), Rainer Hegselmann (Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Germany), David Savage (University of Newcastle, Australia) and Benno Torgler (Queensland University of Technology), have predicted those countries which treat their corona-immune people as a resource are expected to perform comparatively better than others, and engagement of corona-immune people is necessary for a controlled exit from lockdowns. “There are now potentially millions of people (worldwide) who have been infected with the Coronavirus and who are now immune. Their immunity makes each of them individually a valuable resource in the fight against the virus, a resource that grows as the number of people infected increases,” the research paper states.“Antibodies from immune people might even be used to produce blood serum as a potential treatment. Moreover, from a societal perspective, the larger the stock of persons with immunity, the lower the risk of infection for the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions.”The paper further states: “As the number of immune people grows, restrictions on all but the most vulnerable can be gradually relaxed. Those who are already immune could go back to their economic and social activity immediately and could even provide active support to the healthcare system. Their engagement and contribution to society and the economy would reduce the risk of overburdening the healthcare system and would reduce the potential for social breakdown.”One non-profit organisation, the “The Corona Immunity Initiative” has been started in Switzerland. It enables targeted “at home” testing of the population for SARS-COV-2 immunity and will allow the organisation to gather information on the spread of the virus and level of immunity in the general population. An email sent to the Corona Immunity Initiative remained unanswered.CREMA researchers have concluded that due to complete lockdowns and self-isolation, the world is on the brink of a second very real crisis, and this hasn’t been caused by the Coronavirus but by decision-makers and societal reaction to the pandemic. Quoting one of the hypotheses from the research, David Stadelmann told HT: “The side effects of societal infections could be vast. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to distinguish whether the cure may have been worse than the disease. However, there are sectors where the negative side effects of government measures against the crisis can be easily investigated.“For instance, we expect online gambling, alcoholism, domestic violence, divorces, obesity and suicides of non‐infected people to increase. We also expect shadow market activities to increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/researchers-argue-corona-immune-people-are-valuable-should-be-used-in-fight-against-pandemic/story-0jpHJg7IFIDn2UUbqpTlGM.html

22-04-2020||India||How the railways has fared since the suspension of passenger services||A month after passenger services were suspended due to the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, Indian Railways has adapted to a new role of running only freight trains, marking an unprecedented change from primarily catering to millions of travellers. Passenger trains have been suspended since the Janta Curfew of March 22. The national carrier, which used its mammoth network to ferry an average of 23 million passengers on 13,000 trains every day, now operates only freight and parcel trains to ensure the supply of essential goods. On April 16, the railways marked its 167th birth anniversary against the backdrop of no passenger trains plying on its network for 25 days - the first time this has happened in its history, thanks to the lockdown.“We are running uninterrupted 24X7 freight train operations to ensure availability of essential commodities through the country. From March 24 to April 20, more than 10.13 lakh wagons carried supplies to keep the supply chain functional,” a railway ministry official said. “Of these, more than 6.53 lakh wagons carried essential commodities like food grains, salt, sugar, milk, edible oil, onions, fruits, vegetables, petroleum products, coal, and fertilisers throughout the country.”The railways, already reeling under financial stress over the past few years, has seen a decline of 122.80% in passenger earnings till April, when compared to the same period last year, according to data monitored by the railway ministry. Freight earnings too have seen a decline of 44.12 %, with earnings from commodities such as coal and coke dipping by 48.25% to 1,880.61 crore from Rs 3,633.76 crore. Carrying of minerals too has declined by 38.71%. The lockdown and the government’s focus on boosting supplies of essential goods have led to a substantial increase in the transportation of food grains, which has gone up by 88.21%. In April alone, the railways transported 4.07 million tonnes of food grains, compared to 1.65 million tonnes in the same period last year, according to the railway ministry. “In order to ensure that kitchens of all Indian homes continue to run normally, during the lockdown period…these efforts have been made to ensure that farm products like food grains are picked up on time and also to ensure timely supply during the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19,” the railway ministry said in a statement.“The loading, transportation and unloading of these essential commodities has been in progress in full swing during the lockdown period. Close association is being maintained with ministry of agriculture for food grains loading. It may also be noted that CONCOR is also working with NAFED to ensure transportation of pulses in a big way.” Former railway board chairman Vivek Sahai said: “The railways’ resolution must be to increase its daily cargo capacity after the pandemic.” He added, “Railways are ferrying nearly 1.1 billion tonnes of cargo along with 23 million passengers a day. After this pandemic is over, the resolution should be to reach 1.5 billion tonnes load per day.” In addition to this, the railways has identified 66 routes for special parcel trains for supplying perishable commodities such as fruits, vegetables, milk and dairy products and seeds for agriculture.“Trains are being run even on those routes where demand is less, so that no part of the country remains unconnected. Trains have been given en route stoppages at all feasible locations, so that maximum possible clearance of parcels may be done,” the ministry said. A voluntary service by Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS) officers, called Setu, has been developed to track special demands to ensure doorstep delivery of essential items. The service tracks urgent SOS calls for medical supplies across the country. A railway ministry official said, “Recently, for an autistic child, skimmed camel milk was transported by a parcel train from Ajmer to Mumbai when the parents sought help on a social media platform. Similarly, another autistic child in Ajmer, suffering from serious ailments, had his stock of medicines run out. His relatives approached railway officials and medicines were transported by a parcel train from Ahmedabad to Ajmer.” Till April 18, the railways has transported 1,150 tonnes of medical supplies amid the lockdown. The Centre has also cleared the running of two special trains for Indian Army personnel, citing national security considerations.As the demand for ferrying millions of stranded migrant workers grew, the railway ministry clarified that it has no plans to deploy any special trains so far. Once restrictions are lifted, the railways plans to ensure strict social distancing norms in trains, which include mandatory thermal screening and no allotment of middle berths in the sleeper class. Airlines have also prepared a plan for possible operation of commercial flights once the lockdown is lifted. Reporting time for passengers at airports could be increased by up to two hours, so that they can smoothly clear access control, random screening, check-in and immigration (in case of international travellers) while maintaining appropriate distance.Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri had on Monday said restrictions on passenger flights will be lifted only when the Centre is confident the spread of Covid-19 has been controlled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-railways-has-fared-since-the-suspension-of-passenger-services/story-mI3Jyz8ieTsZIZf5ZuDBdO.html

Later, it was found that the cabinet and law department were not consulted before signing the deal.When the government responded that it had sought the help of the company for data analysing and vetting, the court asked if the government was incapable of handling the data of 2 lakh people. It also asked whether the government had an IT department.“We do not want the Covid-19 pandemic to be substituted with data pandemic. Data confidentiality in the present world is most important,” the court observed. It also questioned the jurisdiction of the agreement in a court in New York.The Sprinklr controversy came up two weeks back and the opposition, Congress-led United Democratic Front, had announced a series of agitation from next week seeking Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s resignation alleging it was a “sell out” and that many state-based IT and data companies were overlooked to gift the contract to the US firm. But CM Vijayan brushed aside all the allegations saying the “opposition was jealous of the rising popularity of the government.”     As the controversy flared up, state IT secretary M Shivasankar, also the CM’s private secretary, told the media on Saturday that he took the decision personally as the pandemic situation was getting out of control in the state. Later, he also appeared in a promotional video of the deal which was removed from Sprinklr’s website after the controversy cropped up.“We direly needed an entry that could vet a considerable amount of health data to identify infection patterns to streamline the containment strategy. Spirnklr agreed to provide the service without charge. The arrangement did not warrant the prior vetting of the finance or legal departments. It was my decision at a desperate time,” he said justifying the deal. But the opposition said he owned up the guilt to save the chief minister.“We don’t believe that without the CM’s consent such a deal will take place. Nearly 1.75 lakh people under observation had volunteered their personal information to field workers in good faith. But the government betrayed their faith and handed over valuable information to the US firm. It is strange the IT secretary did not know the value of this data,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala who was the first to raise the charge on April 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-seeks-explanation-on-data-deal-with-us-firm/story-Itba8NNzadEueq7oB9522I.html
22-04-2020||India||‘101 arrested, not a single minority member’: Maharashtra minister on lynching||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has said that there is no communal angle to the April 16 Palghar lynching incident and the attack was a fallout of swirling rumours triggered by social media posts about child-lifters on the prowl in the area.“Not even a single member of the minority community was among the attackers. Altogether, 101 people have been arrested on charges of lynching. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has started the probe. We’ll release the list of names of all the accused soon,” Deshmukh said.The home minister stopped short of naming the main opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but alleged that a few politicians were trying to give a communal angle to the “unfortunate incident”.“Three persons were lynched by a mob in an unfortunate incident. The deceased were pleading with their attackers. But their cries were misinterpreted because of language barriers and were erroneously thought to be seeking help from a particular community. There was no communal angle to the incident,” he said.The BJP has attacked the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government --- a coalition of the Nationalist Congress Party, the Shiv Sena and the Congress -- over law and order. The BJP has also demanded Deshmukh’s resignation.On April 16, three men --- two seers and their driver --- were dragged out of their vehicle outside Gadhchinchale village, located about 110 kilometres from Palghar, and beaten to death by a mob on suspicion that they were child-lifters. The incident occurred when the victims were going from Mumbai to Surat to attend a funeral.The deceased were identified as Kalpavriksha Giri (70), Sushil Giri (35), and driver Nilesh Telgade (30). The seers belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were on their way to attend the last rites of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri in Surat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-communal-angle-to-palghar-lynching-maharashtra-minister/story-GAJdB6QE4b0J2HlIoocQHP.html
22-04-2020||India||From Kerala Governor, rare praise for Pinarayi Vijayan’s role in Covid-19 battle||It is rare to hear governors praise governments in states where parties with other ideological persuasions are in power. But, faced with the Covid-19 pandemic, Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan has banded together with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. In an interview to Vinod Sharma, Khan praises the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government for controlling the disease, and talks about the roles governors can play in such a situation. Edited excerpts: You’ve had differences with the chief minister, especially his stand against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act? Are you on the same page on Covid-19 crisis?We need not read too much in those differences. My duty was to uphold the Constitution, and to let them know that the subject of citizenship comes exclusively under the jurisdiction of the central government. As individual or even as a party they have every right to criticise CAA, but the state government and legislature are under a constitutional obligation to abide by the law passed by Parliament. Don’t forget that despite my clear understanding that CAA was beyond the state government’s purview, I agreed to read the paragraph critical of CAA in my address to the assembly. What made me concede was the letter of the chief minister in which he did not question the issue of jurisdiction or opposed CAA on any principle, but asserted that it involves the question of law-and-order in the state. It was the same argument that was made during the Shah Bano episode when minister after minister defended the move to reverse the judgment of Supreme Court in Parliament - not on the grounds of principle but that large scale demonstrations are happening and if judgment is not reversed then peace may be endangered.Other than CAA, we are on the same page -- not only in the fight against coronavirus but on almost all issues. Kerala is a progressive state; the government is doing excellent work, and I am keen to see they take their good work to more heights.The first Covid-19 case in India was detected in Kerala in January. It subsequently became the country’s first hot spot, but has since flattened the curve. What has made its public health model click?The hot spots were confined to two districts. It is important to keep in mind that almost 80% of the cases were those who came from foreign countries, or foreigners. This means that contact infection was only 20%. This is irrefutable evidence of the proactive and vigilant role played by the state government. The CM and the health minister were on their toes, and were helped by their colleagues who were put in charge of different districts. Kerala society has a strong sense of empathy and voluntarism. For instance, Kudumbshree, an NGO with 43 lakh women as members, was able to start 483 community kitchens within 24 hours of the lockdown, and by the next day, they were operating about 1,500 community kitchens. A few days later, they started Janakeya Food outlets and provided parcel service for all those who found it difficult to operate their home kitchens. Additionally, more than 50,000 people registered as volunteers on different websites of the state government.In 2018, Kerala faced the Nipah virus, and in 2019, the floods. Did past experience help in containing the spread? Sure, the past experience was very helpfulWhat lessons can populous states with lower literacy, bigger geographical expanse, and larger concentration of population learn from Kerala? One lesson is to promote women NGOs. Kudumbshree is a brilliant example of a game-changer. They are engaged basically in setting up self-help groups of women and provide them micro-financing but in emergencies like floods during last two years or the Covid-19, they provided relief quickly and effectively.How do you view the governor’s role in the crises? Can Raj Bhawans help the Union government reach informed decisions about requirements of individual states without prejudice?The governor has duty not only to counsel and advise, but also to encourage the state government where they are implementing programs of development and welfare. I consider it a part of my duty that I should highlight the achievements of the state, and try to help them secure more finances for their progressive schemes and I assure you that I spare no opportunity to do so.In Kerala, I am representative of the Hon. President of India, but outside Kerala I behave more like a representative of Kerala. I feel pleasure in highlighting the achievements of the state and very positive features of the Kerala society. Let me also say that Malayalis are sturdy patriots and very proud Indians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-playing-a-proactive-vigilant-role-in-covid-fight-governor-arif-mohammad-khan/story-EbjVEdkoMTt8KvHPZ18blI.html

22-04-2020||India||Marriage certificate issued without rituals null and void: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday turned down a four-year-old certificate of registration of marriage obtained by a Thane resident and his girlfriend on grounds that it lacked the sanctity, as no rites for solemnising a marriage was performed, and also observed that the Thane Family Court was not justified in rejecting his plea.The appellant had moved the HC after the Thane Family Court had rejected his plea on November 16, 2017.He had sought a declaration that the marriage registration certificate issued by the Thane Municipal Corporation on September 29, 2016, which stated that he married his girlfriend on July 28, 2016, at a local Mandal, which solemnises marriages, was illegal and that he was still a bachelor.Also Read : Man asks for marriage certificate after 16 yrs. Officials say, remarryHe said that he had fallen in love with one of his colleagues at a gymnasium, where both of them worked. Though they were keen to get married, they were apprehensive that their family members might not accept the match. They hatched a plan to convince their family members. They obtained a marriage registration certificate from a local Mandal and had planned to reveal to their family members about tying the nuptial knot.But the woman’s parents were annoyed when she disclosed the plan. They compelled her to lodge a police complaint at Rajaram police station in Ratnagiri district, alleging that she was abducted and her signatures were forcibly obtained to get hold of the forged marriage registration certificate. A case was registered against the man and some other persons.Later, the dispute was settled amicably.The HC held that the family court was not justified in rejecting the appellant’s plea.It said under section 7(1) of the Family Court’s Act a suit or proceeding for a declaration as to the validity of a marriage or as to the matrimonial status of any person is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court and that the Thane resident’s plea fell in that category.“The respondent woman (his purported wife) has not disputed these facts,” said the HC bench. “She is not opposing the prayers made before the Family Court at all. The Family Court was not justified in dismissing the petition filed by the appellant on the ground of lack of jurisdiction,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriage-certificate-issued-without-rituals-null-and-void-bombay-hc/story-INjw17frUuvVHOTj8bbPhP.html

The incident happened on April 16 when they were going from Mumbai to Surat in Gujarat to attend a funeral.Their vehicle was stopped near a village in Palghar district.The deceased were identified as Kalpavriksha Giri (70), Sushil Giri (35), and driver Nilesh Telgade (30).The Maharashtra government had earlier ordered a high-level probe into the incident, and two policemen from Palghar were suspended on Monday for alleged dereliction of duty.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday issued a notice to Maharashtra Police chief over the Palghar lynching case, observing that the “incident is apparently indicative of negligence by public servants”.According to the release, NHRC has sought a detailed report within four weeks including action taken against the culprits and relief, if any, granted to the next of kin of the three deceased.BJP leader Kirit Somaiya had said that an investigation into the case should be done under the guidance of a judge of a high court or by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Congress party leaders too have condemned the incident.Palghar police on Sunday arrested 110 people, including nine juveniles, in connection with the lynching.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cid-takes-over-palghar-lynching-case-day-after-notice-to-police-from-human-rights-panel/story-kHZXZKt6YDPT5MPSZp1dRI.html
22-04-2020||India||Cleaner rivers, less pollution: India’s Covid-19 lockdown has some positive effects||India’s extended lockdown to curb the coronavirus outbreak has shut down schools, workplaces, industries, transport, and forced people to stay home.It also led to an unexpected bonus in the country with six out of 10 of the world’s most polluted cities: cleaner air.“It is a hell of a change,” said Kunal Chopra, who suffers from chronic bronchitis and whose morning walks no longer begin with a shot from an inhaler. “The air is much fresher and my breathing problems have gone down.”India accounts for the highest pollution-related deaths in the world with more than 2 million people every year, according to a December 2019 report by the Global Alliance of Health and Pollution.On March 25, the first day of the lockdown, the average PM 2.5 levels decreased by 22% and nitrogen dioxide — which comes from burning fossil fuels — dropped by 15%, according to air pollution data analyzed by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air.“These are extraordinary times,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Center for Science and Environment, a research and advocacy organization in New Delhi. She attributed the drop in air pollutants to less vehicles on the road, construction activity, and factories shutting down.“People are more vulnerable during a pandemic in areas with high pollution,” she said. “Our lungs and hearts are already compromised, and we cannot fight the virus.”India has reported nearly 20,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 600 deaths.The stringent lockdown measures that are set to be lifted on May 3 also have had an effect on India’s rivers.Pictures of pristine clear waters of the Ganges, India’s longest river considered holy by Hindus, were enthusiastically shared on social media a few weeks into the lockdown. India’s pollution monitoring body said the water had even become fit for bathing in some areas, according to real-time monitors placed along the 2,575-kilometer (1,600-mile) -long river.A recent analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Board found that the quality of the Yamuna River flowing along New Delhi has also improved during the lockdown. The report cited a decrease in runoffs from 28 industrial clusters and less trash.“The lockdown has clearly told us what the main sources of pollution are,” said Vimlendu Jha, an environmentalist and founder of Swechha, a non-governmental organization helping youth fight climate change. “Effluents are forced into our river bodies, and that is major reason why our rivers are black.”Jha and other experts warn that the environmental improvements may be short-lived as the government eventually lifts the lockdown and rampant economic activity resumes.“How was a lockdown for just a few weeks able to achieve what governments could not for decades?” said Jha, who believes authorities should study data collected during the lockdown to devise better environmental policies.Roychowdhury suggested private workplaces that shifted their work online during the lockdown should institutionalize working from home to consider the impact of commuting on air pollution.But that’s not everyone.Ashok Mandal, a scrawny rickshaw driver in New Delhi, spends hours scanning the streets for a passenger. He finds none. Used to making at least 400 rupees every day ferrying passengers in a residential neighbourhood, his income has been slashed to a meager 70 rupees for picking up and delivering groceries.“Clean air means nothing to me,” Mandal said. “I am just trying to make it through each day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cleaner-rivers-less-pollution-india-s-covid-19-lockdown-has-some-positive-effects/story-Gq4IoC6nuyOe7kInyQeHnM.html

22-04-2020||India||Delhi begins plasma therapy trials for critical Covid-19 patients||Delhi begun plasma therapy trials for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients on Tuesday, with two persons receiving the treatment that uses antibody-rich plasma (a blood component) taken from those who have recovered from the infection to treat critical patients.One of them was a 60-year-old man admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Lok Nayak Hospital. He was not on ventilator but had low oxygen saturation (85%), a condition that indicates his organs were not receiving adequate amount of oxygen. The normal oxygen saturation is 95% to 100%.“The donor plasma has been screened for infections like HIV and Hepatitis B and then injected into the patient. Hopefully, the antibodies from the plasma will help the person (Covid-19 patient) to fight the virus better,” said Dr JC Passey, director of the Lok Nayak Hospital.He said the second patient was younger, between 30 to 40 years of age. “He had no comorbidities (like diabetes or hypertension), but had a severe infection and had to be put on oxygen support (not ventilator). He was also given plasma therapy along with the other person,” Passey said.The trial is being conducted in collaboration with the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which will be processing the blood to derive plasma and store it.Two more recipients for the treatment were identified on Monday, but they weren’t given the therapy. “One of them had problems in multiple organs and the other person was extremely old and might not have tolerated the treatment,” Passey said.The rapid antibody test kits received by Delhi from the Centre were used on Sunday to identify the donors. These tests, however, have been put on hold for two days over huge variations in results.In the absence of antibody tests, those who are below the age of 60 and do not have underlying health conditions such as the diabetes, hypertension, heart disease etc. will be considered potential donors.As per the trial procedures, 10 patients will be randomly administered plasma therapy and an equal number will receive a placebo (a treatment without any therapeutic effect). The trial will find out whether people getting the plasma therapy are doing better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-begins-plasma-therapy-for-covid-19-patients-at-lok-nayak-hospital/story-WMXuosOKlaNtDIhOo3KYzH.html

They are at a school in Mahabaleshwar (in Satara district) completing their mandatory quarantine,” he said.Wadhawan brothers and 21 other family members were detained by Satara police on March 7 after they illegally travelled to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala in Pune violating the lockdown orders. They had travelled between two districts on a letter issued by IPS officer Amitabh Gupta, who is principal secretary (special) in home department. The Wadhawans and 21 others have been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code.“We would not let Wadhawans flee the country as a few defaulter businessmen have fled in the past,” he added.Maharashtra government has ordered an inquiry against Amitabh Gupta by additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik for illegally issuing the letter to the Wadhwans. Gupta has been sent on compulsory leave.After their arrest the CBI and ED had written to Satara police to keep Wadhwans under detention until the end of the lockdown.

22-04-2020||India||As chilli field workers walk back to their homes in Covid-19 lockdown, farmers feel the pinch||Thousands of migrant labourers from Chhattisgarh and Odisha, who had been working in chilli fields in Telangana and parts of Andhra Pradesh, have been returning to their native villages due to extension of Covid-19 lockdown. And many have returned on foot, passing through the difficult terrain in dense forests having presence of Maoists in Chhattisgarh and Odisha.According to official estimates, around 10,000 workers, majority of them from Chhattisgarh, had been working in chilli fields spread over 10,000-12,000 acres along the Godavari river belt in Vajedu and Venkatapuram mandals (revenue blocks) of Mulugu district and Charla and Dummugudem mandals of Bhadradri Kothagudem district (both in Telangana), besides Chintoor, Kunavaram and V R Puram mandals of Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district.They migrate to these parts during the chilli crop season - in February and March - to earn their livelihood. But this year, as the crop almost reached the harvesting stage, the coronavirus epidemic started and thousands of labourers began hurriedly returning to their native villages in Chhattisgarh and Odisha.“Except 1,000-1,500 labourers from Chhattisgarh and around 500 from Odisha, all of them have left for their native places on foot, notwithstanding the imposition of lockdown and sealing of inter-state borders. Since they know the forest route, they might not have come to the notice of the police authorities,” said Jatvati Venkatesh, an activist belonging to Jana Vikas Samithi (JVS), working for the rights of Chhattisgarh tribals.The plight of Chhattigarh tribals returning from the agricultural fields of Telangana back to their native hamlets came to light with the death of 12-year-old Jamlo Madkami, a resident of Aded village of Bijapur, on her way back to her village on April 18.The girl came with her maternal uncle to work as labourer in the chilli fields of Peruru village of Vajedu mandal in Telangana. As the lockdown was extended till May 3, she started back to her village, about 150 km away, but collapsed, reportedly due to dehydration and lack of proper food, about 50 km away from her village.The Mulug district administration ordered an inquiry into how Madkami, a minor girl, was allowed to work in chilli fields and how she managed to cross the border. “Ever since the lockdown was announced, our district officials have been taking all measures to see that the migrant tribal labourers remained in their respective areas of working and not ventured to go back breaking the lockdown,” Mulug district collector S Krishna Aditya told Hindustan Times.He said each migrant labourer was provided with 12 kg of rice, besides Rs 500 towards subsistence allowance, though some big farmers promised to take care of these migrant labourers. “In Vajedu mandal alone, we distributed rice and money to around 1,726 migrant labourers. Yet, some of them seem to have tried to go back to their native places fearing uncertainty in lockdown,” he said.The exodus of tribals back to their native places have left the chilli farmers in lurch. “We are not able to get labourers to harvest the crop when we actually need them, as majority of them have walked back to their native places,” Srinu Kandula, a chilli farmer in Nandigama village of Chintoor block said.Normally, these migrant labourers come in groups of families - each comprising parents and their children. “We pay equal wages to each of them, irrespective of their age - ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 300 depending on the work they do. If we deny work to minors, the parents, too, drop out from work. So, we are forced to employ even minors,” Kandula said.Besides cash, the labourers also get some quantity of chillis as wages, which they carry along with them back to their villages, where they sell it to make some money. “This time, the yield in chilli crop is very good and the market price is also very encouraging - Rs 12,000 per quintal, as against Rs 7,000 last year. But we are not position to harvest the crop due to migration of labourers. If we can’t complete the harvesting in another couple of weeks, we will be at a big loss,” said Kandula.Back home, these tribal migrant labourers are not finding it easy to return to their villages. “The villagers are informing administration about their return. In most of the places these migrant labourers are camping outside the village,” said a police officer posted in Bastar region, who was not willing to be named.Dantewada superintendent of police Abhishek Pallav said that about 2,500 people from Telangana and Odisha returned to their villages in the district in last 20 days. “Police are monitoring them through sarpanch, village secretary and police station and putting them under quarantine outside the village after medical examination,” he said.Bijapur Collector KD Kunjam said about 6,000 labourers returned from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and are quarantined in 40 camps. “The tribal villagers have become vigilant about the Covid-19; they are not allowing their own relatives to enter their villages. We are taking care of each and every labourers and for that relief camps have been set up in schools and ashrams,” said Kunjam.Chief Medical Officer of Bijapur district Dr BR Pujari said many labourers had returned from crossing jungles and mountains. “Most of these are camping outside their villages with the help of villagers and administration,” said Pujari.Bastar Collector Ayaj Tamboli informed that 41 relief camps have been set up in Bastar district. “As many as 1,084 people have been kept in quarantine. Recently, 17 laborers of Odisha have been stopped outside the village Nangur Gaon, 20 km away from the headquarters,” he said.Bastar Commissioner Amrit Khalko said that that the villagers of Bastar division are aware of the coronavirus. “More than a thousand villagers are been closed. The traditional Mati festival of Bastar, Devguri Puja, Ama Tihar, Cock fight are not celebrated and people are following the rules,” said Khalko.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-chilli-field-workers-walk-back-to-their-homes-in-covid-19-lockdown-farmers-feel-the-pinch/story-sXb7WR8Vg8kVP04yDOuGNL.html

He tweeted the appreciation while greeting the people on Earth Day.“On International Day of Mother Earth, we all express gratitude to our planet for the abundance of care & compassion. Let us pledge to work towards a cleaner, healthier & more prosperous planet. A shout out to all those working at the forefront to defeat COVID-19,” PM Modi said in his tweet.A landmark in the emergence of the environmental movement when it first took place in 1970, Earth Day has prompted calls from many companies, politicians, and economists for governments to pursue green recoveries.Every year, Earth Day is celebrated all over the world on April 22 to show support for environmental protection.In his message on the eve of World Earth Day on Tuesday, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu said it is time people revisit and re-invent developmental and economic strategies.“We must reinvent the future on more sustainable lines by drawing appropriate lessons from the past and the harsh present,” he said.The closure of factories, industries, cancellation of flights and lesser number of vehicles plying on the roads have led to a remarkable reduction in air pollution levels, Naidu pointed out.The first Earth Day took place in 1970 when millions of Americans took to the streets to protest environmental ignorance and demand a new way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-earth-day-pm-modi-gives-a-big-shout-out-to-covid-19-warriors/story-Y9ZewuUd53h31mX7X4IJ6L.html
22-04-2020||India||Earth Day: How the planet healed during Covid-19 lockdown||No one was sure that there would be a day when they would see, at least in this lifetime, nature recovering after a fallow due to excessive pollution including dumping of industrial and domestic waste, irresponsible chopping of trees, and every possible abuse. But, the lockdown has turned the tables. Not just the skyline is becoming clearer with each passing day, the rivers are visibly purer, and the once endangered flora and fauna is now coming back to life. Here’s a glimpse of how the Earth has healed itself amid the lockdown. Our Lifelines — Rivers You can see the surface of river Ganga, which could not be cleaned despite spending crores of rupees is now cleaner than ever as reportedly none of the industrial waste is being dumped in it. According to a report in HT, Ganga may be cleaner today, than it was in 1986 — the year when efforts to clean the river were first launched. And, a similar case is with Yamuna. Due to a blanket reduction in industrial pollutants, and increased discharge of water from Haryana to Delhi, a cleaner Yamuna is visible these says. Both the factors have increased the self purification capacity of the river. READ | Ganga water cleaner than it was in 1986? Clear skies, and clearer skyline With absolutely limited movement of vehicles on the roads, most of the metro cities in India are breathing in much cleaner air with relatively safer levels of pollutants to deal with, as compared to the time before the lockdown. Metro cities have reported ‘satisfactory’ AQI, and those who had been battling smog in Delhi-NCR can vouch for it anytime!Feathers flock togetherThe news of pink flamingoes return in huge numbers to Mumbai beach is certainly something to rejoice about. The reduction in intensity of human activities at and around the city is being touted as a major reason for the possibility of flamingos to flock the city in such large numbers. The Bombay Natural History Society has stated that their number is 25% more than it was in the last year. A Himalayan view People in Jalandhar can see Himalayas from their roof top, for the first time in decades! The lockdown has cleared the air pollution to the extent that people in Punjab could catch a sight of Himalayas from some of its cities. The Himalayan range is more than 100 miles away from Punjab, and when spotted, its sight left many in awe!

Most of these mills are located in the containment zone and need special permission from the government to resume operations.The state government is yet to decide on the permission sought by the 45 other mills.West Bengal, the jute hub of India, has most of its mills located along two banks of river Hooghly in the districts of North 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Howrah and South 24-Parganas. Of them, North 24-Parganas and Howrah are Covid-19 hotspots falling in the ‘red zone’. Hooghly, though in the orange zone, has declared most of its municipal areas along the river Hooghly as containment zone.The five mills which have received permission for opening are in South 24-Parganas district. “There are around 60-odd jute mills in the state out of which around 50 have applied to resume work. Till April 20, only five have received the permission. We are yet to receive any information about the other mills,” said Raghavendra Gupta, chairman of Indian Jute Mills Association.“The five jute mills have been allowed to resume work with 50 workers each. This is not practical. We can at the most carry out the finishing touches required for already manufactured products and dispatch them,” said Gupta.The Bengal government had on April 15 decided to allow the jute industry to operate with 15 per cent of its regular workforce from April 20 after multiple requests from the Centre.Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani had called up Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee requesting her to allow these mills to resume work. Banerjee had also received calls from chief ministers of Maharashtra and Telangana with requests to allow jute mills to resume work.With the harvest season nearing, the states as well as the Food Corporation of India are now looking up to Bengal for jute sacks.Requesting anonymity, a jute mill owner said, “The industry, for remaining closed during this time, may have to pay a larger cost in the future as the Centre would allow the use of plastic in large scale due to unavailability of jute sacks. Once plastic enters the sector, jute may not recover its place.”The jute mills employ about two lakh people and each mill on an average employ around 3,000 people. Hastings Jute Mill in Hooghly district, for example, has 4,338 workers on its roll.“But as large areas in the districts of as North 24-Parganas and Howrah have been declared as red zones where lockdown needs to be strictly implemented it is still not certain what will happen to these mills,” said a senior official of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-50-jute-mills-ask-for-permission-to-operate-only-5-get-it-in-west-bengal/story-0dkfur7sSJEwIU4i5Q13AI.html

22-04-2020||India||India count crosses 20k mark, rapid tests put on hold: Covid-19 news today||The number of Covid-19 cases in India rose above the 20,000-mark on Tuesday, but the rate at which this threshold was crossed – it took more than 8 days for the tally to double – raises hopes that the country may be able to avert the sort of devastation seen in some other parts of the world. But in a move that compromises efforts by many states to test aggressively in so-called containment zones, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) put on hold for two days antibody testing for Covid-19 using rapid testing kits, or RTKs, citing huge variations in the results.Covid-19 cases in India double to 20,000 in 8 daysThe coronavirus outbreak in India began in early March after people who flew in from abroad introduced the infection to others, and has grown largely in small clusters – except for the one linked to the religious group in Delhi that led to thousands of infections – after the government enforced what is the largest global shutdown in population terms.Read MoreICMR puts rapid tests on hold to check faulty kits ICMR said the reason it has asked states to stop using the rapid testing kits (RTKs) for two days is that samples which are positive in RT -PCR are showing too much variation when tested by RTKs in the range of 6% to 71%.

According to additional director of social justice and empowerment department, SK Gupta, Rs 800 crore was spent on giving one-time relief of Rs 2,500 to about 14 million poor families, who are not covered under social security pension scheme. These included Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, registered construction workers, street vendors and other workers, rickshaw pullers and the destitute people.“The money was transferred to the bank accounts of people by Department of Information and Technology (DoIT). For people who don’t have bank accounts, money was given the district collectors,” he said.For medical and other related needs, Rs 307 crore has been given from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), Rs 72.95 crore from budget for 2019-20, and Rs 224.78 crore from budget for 2020-21.Rajasthan’s allocation for SDRF in 2019-20 was Rs 1,340 crore and was raised to Rs 1,975 crore this fiscal.Secretary of disaster management department Siddharth Mahajan said that Rs 211.27 crore was given to medical education department for facilities at medical colleges, and Rs 37.10 crore to the medical and health department for facilities at district hospitals and rapid testing kits.The medical education got Rs 62.15 crore from 2019-20 budget and Rs 149.12 crore from budget for 2020-21 for testing facilities, ventilators, thermal scanners and other equipment.Mahajan said that the disaster management department sanctioned Rs 2.10 crore from last year’s budget and Rs 35 crore from the coming fiscal to medical and health department for masks, personal protective equipment (PPE) kit and rapid antibody testing kits.The district collectors got Rs 49.36 crore from SDRF for quarantine facilities, screening, shelter for migrant labourers, dry ration and food packets. The collectors also got money from this fund for providing personal protective equipment to health workers, police personnel and sanitation workers.Mahajan said that the disaster management division of ministry of home affairs wrote to state chief secretary on March 14 about items and names of assistance from the SDRF in wake of Covid-19 outbreak. On March 28, a revised list was sent.Apart from this, the district collectors got around Rs 50 crore from CM Relief Fund and MLA LAD as untied fund for expenses not covered under the Disaster Management Act.The state government decided to provide free ration through Public Distribution System (PDS) to all beneficiaries under the NFSA who got wheat for Re 1 and Rs 2 a kg under normal distribution.

Jammu & Kashmir has had low-speed 2G internet connectivity since a communications blackout imposed to check protests against the nullification of Constitution’s Article 370 that stripped the region of its special status in August was eased in phases. Residents say the absence of 4G services have prevented them from availing digital health, business and educational services while the rest of the world is increasingly relying on them to stay connected amid the pandemic that has prompted lockdowns globally.“Militancy is still there and it is a very serious issue. When a militant was recently killed, about 500 people gathered at his funeral. They are making martyrs of these people [militants],” attorney general K K Venugopal told the court while opposing the restoration.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for Jammu & Kashmir, sought a week to submit a consolidated response to the pleas seeking the restoration of the services.A bench of Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai told the Centre to mention its stand in affidavit latest by Sunday. It directed Jammu & Kashmir to file its response by then while directing the matter to be listed next on April 27. The Court said a similar matter was pending before the Jammu & Kashmir high court. Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, who appeared for the petitioner, told the bench that the high court proceedings related to a host of other issues of which internet connectivity was one of the aspects. The court asked Mehta to take instructions in this regard.In its petition, Foundation for Media Professionals, a non-governmental organisation, has argued for 4G connectivity citing the coronavirus cases that have crossed 350 in the Union Territory. It argued social distancing was impossible as the lack of 4G prevented residents from seeking online advice from doctors. Professionals are finding it hard to work from home and groceries cannot be purchased online, the petition said.A fresh petition by Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir also came up for hearing in the court. It pleaded the 2G connectivity has restricted over 2,000 schools from holding online classes for over 7 lakh students. Mehta inquired about the availability of laptops and tabs for the students. Lawyer Charu Ambwani, who represented the Association, said the hardware is available but internet connectivity was the problem. The court said it will hear the Centre and Jammu & Kashmir on this aspect on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/debating-sc-plea-govt-opposes-4g-restoration-in-j-k/story-ETzirvdgYXhq4bjNlFKeKK.html
22-04-2020||India||Five sworn into Chouhan cabinet||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday expanded his cabinet with the induction of five ministers after much criticism for running the state alone despite the Covid-19 crisis for nearly a month since taking office following the collapse of the previous Congress government.The five include Tulsi Silavat, 66, and Govind Singh Rajput, 58, whose rebellion along with 20 other lawmakers, brought down Kamal Nath’s Congress government in March. Silavat and Rajput are the loyalists of former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, who joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) last month. The two were ministers in Nath’s cabinet too. The other three ministers, who were sworn in at a low key ceremony at governor Lalji Tandon’s residence amid the Covid-19 lockdown, are Narottam Mishra, 60, Kamal Patel, 58, and Meena Singh, 48. Chauhan, 61, is expected to further expand his cabinet after the extended Covid-19 lockdown ends on May 3.Mishra was one among the front runners for the chief minister’s post when the BJP toppled the Congress government. He along with Patel and Singh have served as ministers previously as well.Experts said Chouhan has taken caste and regional considerations into account while constituting the cabinet.Mishra, a sixth-term lawmaker from Gwalior-Chambal region, is a Brahmin. Silavat is a five-time assembly member from Malwa and is from a scheduled caste. Patel comes from central Madhya Pradesh and represents the Other Backward Class community. Singh, who is from Vindhya, is a tribal leader and Rajput from Bundelkhand is also an upper caste like Mishra.Patel was arrested in May 2010 and spent three months in jail on charges of destroying evidence in a murder case in which his sons are accused. He was acquitted in 2011. Chouhan congratulated his ministerial colleagues for their induction. “We will together work for the progress and development of Madhya Pradesh and achieve our goal of public welfare,” he said.In a tweet, Scindia said, “My good wishes to all the five ministers who took oath today. I hope, you all will fight together against Corona and achieve victory.”Congress leader Narendra Saluja said 22 Congress lawmakers betrayed their party for the BJP government’s formation but only two “turncoats” got ministerial berths. He questioned why have the rest been excluded. “Is it not betrayal? Also, many heavyweights of the BJP are missing from the cabinet. Is it the party with a difference?” he asked.There was no distribution of portfolios till Tuesday evening but Chouhan assigned the ministers different divisions monitoring and coordinating the implementation of the measures taken to check the spread of Covid-19.The number of Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh has risen to 1,485. The state has so far reported 76 Covid-19 related fatalities and the pandemic has spread to 26 of its 52 districts.Indore has emerged as one of the major Covid-19 hotspots in the country and prompted the Centre to send a team on Monday to the city to assess and manage the situation.INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-sworn-into-chouhan-cabinet/story-ZvkR5ly6JSHs05JeWZLvdK.html

22-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||In April 18, Delhi identified 186 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). All 186 were asymptomatic. It’s possible that some asymptomatic people develop symptoms after some time. It’s equally possible that some don’t. Research from Italy has shown that the viral load in some asymptomatic patients is as high as that in patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms. The viral load is the quantum of virus found in a sample taken from a person. It is an indicator of the virus’ ability to replicate. A high viral load means it is replicating well. But there’s also research, including one published in The Lancet, that shows that patients who get severe infections tend to have a higher viral load of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.While our understanding of the virus and its effect on the human body will become better in time, it is safe to surmise that not everyone reacts to a Sars-CoV-2 infection the same way.One of HT’s photographers in Mumbai tested positive for the virus, but is asymptomatic. The local health officials have isolated him in a hotel — he is not unwell at all, and doesn’t need hospitalisation. The four HT employees who came in touch with him have been labelled low-risk contacts by the health officials and asked to go into self-quarantine. The office itself has been shut and is being deep-sanitised. He is well, in no discomfort, but is infected.On Monday, the health ministry said in its daily briefing that 80% of people infected by the virus in the world show either mild symptoms or none at all. The ministry didn’t comment on India specifically on Monday, but the fact that it brought up the issue seems to suggest that the situation isn’t very different here. On Tuesday, the Indian Council of Medical Research said that 69% of all Covid-19 cases in India did not show symptoms at the time of testing; it did not specify whether they developed symptoms later.People who are asymptomatic may still retain the ability to infect others because they carry the virus — potentially making them dangerous, especially to old people who may not be able to fight off the disease.Data on fatalities in India show that around 75% are over the age of 60 (of which around 40% are over the age of 75). While the rest of India may, over time, develop herd immunity to the virus, this is the population that has to be protected — till a cure or vaccine for the virus is found, or, as epidemiologist Ramanan Laxminarayan wrote in this paper last week, 65% of the population develops herd immunity (which pretty much reduces to nothing the virus’s chances of jumping from person to person till it finds one over the age of 60).India will have to open up sometime. A lockdown, according to some studies, reduced R0 (R naught) to less than one. R0 is a measure of how infectious a disease is; it is expressed in terms of the number of people likely to catch the disease from one infected person. Most scientists who have studied Sars-CoV-2 say it has an R0 of around 2.2. Still, it will not be possible for any country to stay locked down for months on end.As India considers opening up, it will have to protect its most vulnerable population — 104 million people over the age of 60 (according to the 2011 census). That number is sure to have increased by now. Six states, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan accounted for around 54% of all people over the age of 60 in 2011. The list shouldn’t surprise anyone. These are the most populous Indian states. Another 15% were in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.Since census data is collected at a disaggregated level, it should be possible for the government to identify within these nine states that account for seven out of every 10 people over the age of 60, cities and districts that are especially vulnerable because they have a high proportion of people over the age of 60, 70, or 80. These areas should consider stricter-than-normal social distancing measures, perhaps special guidelines on interacting with senior citizens; maybe even mandatory self-quarantines for such people. That will keep them safe and allow the rest of India to carry on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-XQtRJii4PwPZoIeN5qCPEI.html
22-04-2020||India||Six front-line workers Covid+, sweeper may have died of virus||A sanitation worker died of a heart attack, suspected to be linked to Covid-19, while six front-line workers, including police, sanitation staff and ration shop owners, tested positive for the virus.A 52-year-old woman sanitation worker of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) died of a heart attack Tuesday at the Lok Nayak hospital, but doctors suspect that she may been suffering from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Her Covid-19 test results are yet to arrive.EDMC spokesperson Arun Kumar said, “We have been told that she had suffered a heart attack at the LN Hospital Tuesday and died, but her final Covid test reports are yet to arrive. So we can’t be sure of any underlying reasons for the heart attack she suffered.” However, the 52-year-old woman’s husband, over the phone, said, “We have been verbally told that she had contracted the coronavirus infection. We are not being handed over the body and have been told to reach the Nigambodh Ghat directly for her last rites. The doctors also said only a maximum of four people can be at the crematorium and a team of doctors will be there to supervise the last rites. She was only given a mask by EDMC to carry out her duties -- she did not even have gloves on.” Also, on Tuesday, a 35-year-old co-worker of the dead woman was Tuesday admitted to the Lok Nayak hospital after she tested positive for Covid-19. Officials said she works in the Dharampura area of Shahdara.A ration shop owner in Roop Nagar neighbourhood tested Covid-19 positive. Following the development, the district administration has directed all beneficiaries of the fair price shop — as many as 1,648 — to remain in home quarantine. They have also put the locality under surveillance for the next 14 days, a senior government official said Tuesday.This is the first such instance of a ration shop owner getting infected in the capital. The person has no history of travel to foreign countries. The health department is in the process of tracing his contacts, a senior government official said. Four constables posted at central Delhi’s Nabi Karim tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) after 80 personnel of the police station were screened till Monday. The four were asymptomatic and their tests were done after Nabi Karim was declared a containment zone.With the four new cases, the total number of police personnel infected with the virus rose to 20. Of these, 12 personnel are from Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal police stations in central Delhi.“The Nabi Karim police station has not been sealed yet as everyone else, besides the four, tested negative. So far, screening of more than 150 personnel of the two police stations has been done. Of them, 12 have been found positive and they all were asymptomatic,” said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-front-line-workers-covid-sweeper-may-have-died-of-virus/story-xRdQpVDo4HLstbjL1QPRvM.html
22-04-2020||India||Covid-19 cases in India double to 20,000 in 8 days||The number of Covid-19 cases in India rose above the 20,000-mark on Tuesday, but the rate at which this threshold was crossed – it took more than 8 days for the tally to double – raises hopes that the country may be able to avert the sort of devastation seen in some other parts of the world.Globally, there are now 2.5 million infections and close to 175,000 deaths. In India, the number of fatalities as on Tuesday was 644.The outbreak in the country began in early March after people who flew in from abroad introduced the infection to others, and has grown largely in small clusters – except for the one linked to the religious group in Delhi that led to thousands of infections – after the government enforced what is the largest global shutdown in population terms.“Our doubling time of cases is increasing. The current situation indicates that significant increase in number of Covid-19 cases is unlikely,” said Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, the head of infectious diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).In contrast with India’s rate of increase, the United States, which now has the highest number of infections at over 800,000, went from 9,000 infections to over 24,000 infections in three days.But within the 1,504 new cases and 54 new deaths on Tuesday lurked a statistic that threatens to reverse India’s gains: Maharashtra, the second-most populous state in the country, accounted for more than a third of all new cases recorded on Tuesday, and Gujarat, which till a week ago had a little over 500 infections, now has over 2,000 cases.At four days, Gujarat’s doubling rate was less than half the national average – suggesting the spread was happening twice as well.Maharashtra, at 5,218 cases, now has more infections than the next two – Gujarat (2,178) and Delhi (2,156) – have cumulatively.“We have managed to buy time to be able to provide hospital care to all our positive cases, and have tried as much to flatten the curve so that there is a possibility that we are able to push it so much that we might actually get a vaccine or an effective drug to treat patients,” said Gangakhedkar added.This weekend, India will complete a month in lockdown – a near-total interruption of normal life for more than 1.3 billion people, many of whom are from vulnerable socio-economic backgrounds, stuck in cities where they had migrated to for work but now find themselves jobless. Schools, colleges and any transport of individuals between two cities seems unlikely for the time being.According to a Union health ministry last week, there are at present 170 hot spot districts, which house roughly 37% of the population and make up 29% of the geographical area of India.“Now, we have added 61 more districts that have not reported any new case in the last 14 days,” said Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary of the Union health ministry, during the daily government briefing on Tuesday.The lockdown will stay till May 3, but officials at the highest levels of the government are working on opening some regions and industrial sectors to ease access to products and employment.The lifting of the curbs must not be hasty, the head of World Health Organization said at a press briefing in Geneva on Monday, as signs poured in from the world over that the sweeping shutdowns had worked to suppress the spread of the disease.For now, authorities across the country are attempting to ramp up testing in order to get a better sense of the contagion, which will make the task of isolating the outbreaks easier and allow other regions to safely resume some activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-double-to-20-000-in-8-days/story-xfUAbcTuOocCMLKDHoGuJI.html
22-04-2020||India||ICMR puts rapid tests on hold to check faulty kits||New Delhi:The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday asked states to put on hold for two days antibody testing for Covid-19 using rapid testing kits or RTKs supplied to them late last week, citing huge variations in the results -- a move that compromises efforts by many states to test aggressively in so-called containment zones using these kits, which were procured with some difficulty. Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, ICMR, said that after receiving a complaint from one state on Monday, the body at the forefront of the country’s fight against Covid-19 spoke to three states on Tuesday. “We are learning that samples which are positive in RT -PCR are showing too much variation (when tested by RTKs) in the range of 6% to 71%,” he added.This means that only 6% of the samples that test positive in the accurate but time-consuming Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), test positive in the antibody test. ICMR’s guidelines for such rapid tests mandate that they be carried out only for people who show symptoms of the disease for at least seven days, or those who have been directly or indirectly exposed to the infection, and that a negative test be followed by a RT-PCR one.Ahead of Gangakhedkar’s comments at the daily press briefing on India’s fight against Covid-19, Rajasthan stopped using the antibody test kits after they were accurate in only 5.4% of the cases, according to state health minister Raghu Sharma. It wasn’t immediately clear which other states ICMR spoke to. West Bengal on Monday complained about the quality of RT-PCR tests supplied to it. The 550,000 RTKs ordered from China arrived late last week after missing two deadlines and were distributed to states. While ICMR initially wanted them used to assess the extent of the disease’s spread in so-called green zones (according to the health ministry, districts with very few or no cases), it subsequently allowed states to test them in containment zones in hot spots -- where lots of cases, including clusters were found. Many states hoped to use the blood test (RT-PCR uses a nasal swab) to ramp up testing. Those plans have now been put on hold by ICMR, which has created eight field teams to validate the results. “It was anticipated that Chinese kits won’t be of good quality as many of their exported products haven’t worked of late,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, CMC Vellore. “On Feb 2 we knew it was a pandemic. We were the last to be hit but we didn’t make use of the time... This is the time to consolidate our resources and work like a single unit. It should be a consortium approach and not a competitive approach,” he added.To be sure, unlike the RT-PCR kits that show up only active infections, at any stage, however early (and even in asymptomatic individuals), antibody tests do not detect infections till antibodies have been generated, which could take up to a week after the infection, and usually happen around the same time or even after the symptoms show up. While some countries have said they will use these tests to see who can return to work (they are a good measure of immunity), most experts say they are best used to assess population exposure. “The RT-PCR is the gold standard in terms of identification of patients is concerned. The rapid test has limited utility, and is good for surveillance and conducting epidemiological investigations,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary at the Union health ministry, said. Gangakhedkar said the kits were tested in Delhi and had shown a 71% accuracy and also mentioned that Covid-19 antibodies emerge after seven days. It wasn’t immediately clear how many of the samples tested involved patients who tested positive in a RT-PCR test within the past week. “In the lab testing for quality check, we found the efficacy to be around 71%, which was decent considering rapid tests are usually about 80-84% accurate, and we sent it across to our regional centres for distribution in states,” Gangakhedkar said. The ICMR said as the tests are halted, it will send experts from eight of its institutes to different locations to conduct field testing of samples using RTKs.“After two days we will be in a better position to issue a revised advisory in this regard,” Gangakhedkar added.If its validation exercise continues to throw up variations, ICMR plans to take up the matter with the manufacturer. Gangakhedkar said the findings (variations) could not be ignored despite the antibody test being a first generation ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Such tests are used to find antibodies against specific diseases, and usually get better with time. For instance, it took several generations before the ELISA test for HIV-AIDS was perfected. The kits were ordered from Chinese manufacturers Guangzhou Wondfo and Zhuhai Livzon. Hindustan Times couldn’t ascertain the sensitivity (ability of the test to come up with a positive result when presented with an infected sample, also known as true positive) and specificity (ability of the test to correctly identify a non-infected sample) rating of the test. ICMR had ordered 3.5 million more RTKs.Experts have previously raised concerns about the accuracy of the tests received from China. “There were ample examples from the US and Europe on how these Chinese kits were of dubious quality. The Chinese government has become strict and not allowed many of its manufacturers to export because of quality issues, so we had to be careful while ordering these,” said a senior virologist, who wished to remain anonymous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antibody-testing-on-hold/story-fQ9y9ukjAQdAVU9zBx1FgM.html
22-04-2020||India||Mumbai bus conductor runs 21km to report to work||Devidas Jaisingh Rathod, 55, is an employee of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). He lives in Manor, 100 km north of Mumbai. He is a conductor on a bus that runs every day from Palghar, 21 km from his home, to the central Mumbai bus depot, Dadar. These days, he is in charge of a bus that has an important job -- ferrying 25 doctors and nurses to KEM Hospital. He usually hitches a ride on trucks ferrying essentials that pass by Manor. They drop him off at Palghar. On Sunday, though, there were no trucks. So, he ran. “I could not let them down as the doctors and nurses are treating Covid-19 patients and they are my daily passengers,” said Rathod.It helped that he loves running. He runs every morning before going to work and has taken part in several marathons -- both full and half. “I did not wear my uniform and kept it in a bag. I told my wife, Usha, to give me extra water bottles mixed with glucose, just to keep me hydrated. Then, wearing shorts and vests, I began to run,” he said. Upon reaching Palghar depot, he quickly freshened up and the bus, with the medical personnel, set off for Dadar. Deputy manager of Palghar depot, Nitin Chavan, later honoured Rathod in a small ceremony.  Rathod reports for duty at the Palghar bus depot at 6am, his new duty time following the lockdown. The bus he is a conductor on goes from Palghar to Dadar, where KEM Hospital is situated. At 3pm, Rathod’s bus leaves Dadar and reaches Palghar at 5pm, after which he again hitches a ride to Manor.The pandemic has disrupted his daily running schedule. “Due to my emergency duty, my running practice is not possible but I will continue once the lockdown is lifted.” A commerce graduate with a conductor’s licence, Rathod joined MSRTC in 2003 after spotting an advertisement for conductors. “Even the recruitment officer was shocked. My qualification is too high for a conductor’s job, he said,” recalled Rathod. In the past, Rathod has worked as a daily wager. He and his wife, Usha, who works as a tailor, have four children: Sachin, 29, Priyanka, 27, Archana, 25, and Deepak, 21. Sachin works as a security guard and Deepak is studying printing. But the health care workers Rathod’s bus ferries everyday are likely to remind him more of his daughters. Priyanka has a post graduate degree in medicine from Nagpur University and Archana is a nurse at a civic hospital in Vakola.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-bus-conductor-runs-21km-to-report-to-work/story-YRRch8ducKPUqVgTYIlj3M.html

22-04-2020||India||Tablighi Jamaat chief asks members to donate blood plasma to fight Covid-19||Tablighi Jamaat chief Muhammad Saad who has been under fire for the congregation that it organised in Delhi last month and which fuelled a spike in Covid-19 cases in the national capital and other parts of the country, called on members of his organisation on Tuesday to donate blood plasma for those still infected and under treatment.“During this time of crisis it is important to take care of people’s needs, food and essentials items and to enquire of their well-being especially the poor and needy. But an even greater responsibility that we have at this time is to save the life of a sick person and expend our own life and wealth so that he/she can be cured of a terrible disease,” Muhammad Saad said in an appeal to Tablighi Jamaat members.“It is required that such people who are now cured of this disease should donate blood plasma to others who are still fighting the disease and are under treatment,” he said.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.India’s total number of infections has reached almost 19,000 and over 600 have lost their lives to Covid-19. Muhammad Saad who was booked by the Enforcement Directorate for money laundering last week, is under quarantine.Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his government had received the go-ahead from the Centre to start trials for plasma enrichment technique. If successful, plasma enrichment can be used to treat seriously ill Covid-19 patients.Plasma enrichment technique entails taking blood plasma from a person who has recovered from Covid-19 as it contains antibodies which, when transfused to a sick patient, can boost immunity and help in recovery.There is currently no cure for Covid-19 and convalescent plasma is an experimental procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tablighi-jamaat-chief-asks-members-to-donate-blood-plasma-to-fight-covid-19/story-AraEGckJ8CvsG4qjDyZALP.html
22-04-2020||India||Patients admitted to hospitals in clusters to be tested for virus||All patients visiting hospitals in and around containment zones identified by the local authorities will be considered “suspected cases of Covid-19” and those getting admitted will undergo mandatory diagnostic tests for the coronavirus disease irrespective of symptoms, according to a central advisory on Tuesday.In a first, the Union health ministry advisory also advocated a clear demarcation between outpatient departments (OPDs) and wards, and asked doctors to stick to the same federal guidelines they follow in the treatment of Covid-19 patients even while attending to OPD patients.According to a ministry official, the advisory sent to state governments is aimed at preventing the spread of the deadly infection in health facilities, especially in light of the emergence of a few such cases in parts of the country.“There is a detailed guideline by the ministry on how to prevent hospital-acquired infection. But there have been cases where hospitals have reported the spread of infection and even shut down in some cases, probably because they got patients who had Covid-19 even though their symptoms weren’t pronounced enough…The new advisory is asking them to treat all patients as suspected Covid-19 cases, and take required safety measures,” the senior health ministry official who did not want to be named, said.For example, the paediatric intensive care unit of central Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College emerged as a hotbed of infections last week, with 12 health care workers testing positive for Covid-19. Two babies in the ward -- a 45-day-old and a 10-month-old --- got infected. The 45-day-old baby died on Saturday morning.Since March 2, when the first infection was reported in Delhi, at least 80 health care workers and doctors have been infected in the national capital.“Hospitals are likely to become high-risk areas. This is because doctors are not testing everyone; that is not possible,” said SK Sarin, director at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)“…if the population has a large number of those who have no symptoms, and if they get into the hospitals, doctors and nurses will get infected and then pass it on to others – colleagues, families and patients,” Sarin, who is the chairperson of a five-member committee that advises the Delhi chief minister on Covid-19, said, explaining the challenges health care workers and facilities are facing.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – the country’s apex health research body – about 69% of those infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, either have no symptoms or very mild symptoms.The central advisory came on the day all of Delhi’s 11 district magistrates as well as deputy commissioners of police, among other officials, held talks with lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal via video conferencing. Some of them raised issues faced by front-line workers.“The increase in the number of health care workers, those posted at hospitals and their contacts testing positive is a cause of concern. It might be that adequate measures for protection from the infection are not being taken by hospital authorities, including those which are not treating Covid-19 cases. There is an urgent need to fix these lapses,” said a district magistrate, requesting anonymity.A statement issued by the Delhi LG’s office said the city-state’s health department had been directed to take all precautionary measures.Under the central advisory, those who get admitted in hospitals will have to undergo the RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which is a confirmatory test to detect Covid-19. The results take about five-six hours.“RT-PCR is the gold standard as far as case confirmation is concerned, and results from rapid tests (or antibody tests) are still not foolproof, especially for early diagnosis…And the hospital staff has been directed to particularly keep an eye on patients for any development of unexplained fever, cough or respiratory illness (symptoms of the disease),” the official added.If a patient tests positive, all those who have had contact with him/her will be put on anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is considered a prophylaxis – a treatment to prevent a disease, according to ICMR guidelines. The government, however, has said the drug has to be taken under strict medical supervision as it could have serious side-effects, especially in those having underlying health conditions such as heart and kidney ailments.Each hospital in the country, be it a dedicated Covid-19 or non-Covid-19 facility, was earlier directed to have a Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC), which will be responsible for coming up with an effective mechanism for reporting the onset of symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 in health care workers.This includes surveillance for fever, cough and breathing difficulty, among others, either through self-reporting or active and passive screening at the beginning of shifts.“Whenever a non-Covid-19 patient or any healthcare workers is suspected to have Covid-19-like symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-19, the HICC will come into action, investigate the matter and suggest further course of action… rapid isolation, contact listing and tracking disinfection will follow, with no need to shut down the whole facility,” the advisory said.It said if the primary source of an infection could not be established and if a hospital continued reporting a large number of cases among patients and health care workers, the facility should be converted to a dedicated Covid-19 hospital and the local health department must be notified.“In terms of precautions, we are treating new patients as if they were Covid-19 positive even while conducting emergency surgeries. We are sanitising our operation theatres post surgeries, and our staff are wearing personal protection equipment (PPE) and taking other necessary precautions. All admitted patients are being tested irrespective of the Covid-19 symptoms…Same goes for patients who are frequent visitors such as those undergoing chemo, dialysis and so on; they are also being tested,” said a spokesperson for Max Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patients-admitted-to-hospitals-in-clusters-to-be-tested-for-virus/story-WwXlgI8JzA9Vf8ckOOuwKI.html
22-04-2020||India||Rhino calf separated from mother in Assam’s Kaziranga||GUWAHATI Rangers at the Kaziranga National Park in Assam are on a mission that has nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic the rest of the country is preoccupied with: they are trying to reunite a baby rhino and his mother.The one-month-old calf was separated from the mother on or around Sunday in the Deopani area near the 430-square-kilometre park, the biggest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world and home to around 2,400 members of the species.“The calf got separated from the mother and was found roaming around Deopani area close to the national highway. When we got the information from the nearby villagers, we went and rescued it around 11:00 am on Sunday,” said P Sivakumar, the park’s director.“We tried to locate the mother but weren’t successful. Since there was a threat to the calf from tigers or other animals, we sent it to the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC),” he added.Located in Borjuri village near the national park, CWRC is the only facility in India where orphaned or injured wild animals are hand-raised or treated before being returned to the wild.“The calf is a male weighing around 70 kilograms. It was very dehydrated and weak. Treatment and its care are underway. Hopefully, we will be to feed it prepared milk using a bottle,” said Rathin Barman, in-charge of CWRC.Every year, the centre handles several baby rhinos and elephants that are rescued during the annual floods that submerge most areas of the park.“We have engaged our people in the Deopani area to trace the mother as she should be in that particular location. There are around 50 rhinos in that area. “Without knowing the mother, we can’t release the calf into the herd as there is a possibility of an adult rhino attacking it,” said Sivakumar.Baby rhinos are extremely attached to their mothers, with whom they stay for around three years before venturing out on their own.“Since the baby is very small, it must have been suckling. As there is a threat to it if it’s left in the wild, it is better for it to stay at CWRC till the mother is found. It’s a challenging task, but personnel at the centre are experienced and well-equipped to handle such babies,” said Bibhab Talukdar, founder of the wildlife NGO Aaranyak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rhino-calf-separated-from-mother-in-assam-s-kaziranga/story-J5dpDwXUZi0xepjZ3unCpM.html
22-04-2020||India||Helpline numbers in place to address issues of migrant workers, Centre tells SC||Migrant workers are being fed and sheltered by governments and non-government organisations, and helplines have been made operational so that people can call and report issues concerning implementation of relief measures put in place for the workers in the aftermath of Covid-19, the Supreme Court was told on Tuesday.During the hearing of a case relating to payment of minimum wages to migrant workers, the central government’s second senior-most law officer, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, denied claims by petitioners Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj that thousands of workers still lacked access to basic amenities. Mehta also questioned the genuineness of the petitioners, demanding to know why there were filing public interest litigations (PILs) instead of helping the state authorities on the ground to provide aid to migrant workers.“Around 50,000 NGOs are working shoulder-to-shoulder with governments to provide food and necessities to the poor and migrant workers. Why don’t you do something for the poor? Why can’t the petitioners help the workers”, Mehta asked.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioners, said that they were doing their bit and distributing food etc. “But do you want us to feed 15 lakh people”, he responded.The bench of justices NV Ramana, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and BR Gavai disposed of the petition after recording the submissions made by the central government.“Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta, has filed a status report and submitted that various measures are in place to address the issues concerning the migrant workers. He further argued that helpline number has been provided to report issues concerning the implementation at the ground level, and that whenever any complaint is received, the authorities are attempting to address the same immediately”, the court noted in its order.The court, however, asked the central government to look into certain material produced by the petitioners and take necessary steps to address any shortcomings.“The learned counsel (for the petitioners) further argued that studies conducted by NGOs indicate that there are several areas where the aid is not reaching to the migrant workers. Taking into consideration the material placed before us, we call upon the Union of India to look into such material and take such steps as it finds fit to resolve the issues raised in the petition”, the order said.The plea by activists Mander and Bhardwaj sought payment of minimum wages to all migrant workers, who are either employed by companies or contractors or self-employed. In the aftermath of the lockdown enforced on March 25 for Covid-19, tens of thousands of migrants left the cities for their homes in the hinterland in an exodus triggered by loss of income.The centre had earlier filed a status report detailing the steps taken by various state governments to address the problems faced by migrant workers. According to the report, there are 26,476 relief and active shelter camps across the country housing 1.03 million migrant workers and others during the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/helpline-numbers-in-place-to-address-issues-of-migrant-workers-centre-tells-sc/story-PKO46pY1vdcH28BEqRz6oI.html
22-04-2020||India||Pressure on states to bring back migrants||Uttar Pradesh’s move to evacuate students from the state stuck in Rajasthan’s Kota last week has mounted pressure on other states to follow suit and ensure the return of their people stranded in other states. States like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Assam and Jharkhand have asked Rajasthan to facilitate the return of their stranded students as they were making arrangements for their travel back home. Uttarakhand had earlier arranged for the return of its students from Rajasthan.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said he spoke to Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday about the issue. “A large number of Rajasthanis, including migrant workers, shopkeepers, private employees, small businessmen are stuck in Assam, [rest of the] Northeast, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra and other states. They are feeling frustrated and desperately want to return...”Gehlot said he told Shah if the Centre allows them to return, only then would they be eager to go back to their workplaces once the lockdown is lifted. He said the Centre should have given at least five days to migrant workers and others to return to their homes. Gehlot added Shah has assured him the Centre will soon take a call on the issue and inform him about it on Wednesday.Gehlot said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should facilitate the return of migrant workers and others, including five lakh Rajasthanis, to their homes when the Centre can help in the evacuation of foreigners stranded in India.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said he would request for a special train to transport migrant workers and others struck in other states.He said the Uttar Pradesh government’s move has triggered demands from the people in his state for a similar step. “We are getting calls from parents demanding similar arrangements.”Soren said he spoke to the Prime Minister and complained about “one nation, two sets of rules” and sought clearance from the Centre for making arrangements to ensure that the students of his state return to their homes.Officials in Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh said they are inundated with calls mostly from students seeking help in returning to their states.Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow, Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said the government should formulate ways for allowing the workers to commute during the lockdown by issuing electronic passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pressure-on-states-to-bring-back-migrants/story-Vx82St1M8JFwvZ6jGJ5Q2K.html
22-04-2020||India||India must turn focus inward for military needs in post-Covid world: Top officials||India must turn focus inward for its military needs in the post-Covid world and make every effort to cut dependence on imported military hardware that could not only become cost prohibitive but also hard to come by in the coming years, three senior military officers said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity.The armed forces will have to get rid of their traditional appetite for imported weapons and equipment, and work in harness with the domestic industry to guarantee self-reliance in defence, said the officers with direct knowledge of the military’s modernisation goals.Despite pursuing the Make in India programme vigorously to reduce military imports, the country was the second-largest arms importer in the world over the last five years, according to data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute last month.“Indigenisation with Make in India as the dictum can no longer be a mere slogan. If the coronavirus crisis has energised us to produce ventilators, personal protective equipment and other gear for our healthcare workers in a matter of weeks, the focus in the coming times should be on fuelling a new wave of innovation in the defence sector,” said the first officer cited above.Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and it has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for a raft of weapons and systems including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers.“This is the time for us to look inward. The local industry is willing to support indigenisation, although it may not be able produce the best weapons and equipment. But if given the opportunity, it will reach global standards over time. It requires the full support of the armed forces. The temptation to import hardware will have to be resisted,” said the second officer cited above.From warships, fighter jets to air defence systems and helicopters, modern artillery gun systems to ammunition, the domestic industry has demonstrated that it has potential to contribute to building a stronger military, the second officer pointed out. One of the key responsibilities assigned by the government to the department of military affairs, headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, is to promote the use of indigenous military equipment in the armed forces.“After the 2016 Uri strike, the armed forces scrambled to fill worrying gaps in their arsenal, including ammunition. We can’t allow this to happen. Encouraging the domestic industry will help us get more bang for the buck and ensure we are not in dire straits in times of conflict,” said the third officer cited above.He added a robust indigenous defence industry would allow the armed forces to cut costs by holding lesser stocks of weapons and ammunition because production and supplies could be ramped up when required.“Storage in itself is cost prohibitive because high-grade weapons and ammunition require special storage conditions, including air conditioning. Round-the-clock security of large ammunition and weapon storage depots also adds to the cost,” he stressed.The draft Defence Production Policy-2018 visualises India as one of the top five countries in the aerospace and defence sectors in the coming years, with defence goods and services accounting for a turnover of ₹1.7 lakh crore by 2025. It also seeks to drastically reduce India’s dependence on imported military hardware over the next five years....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-must-turn-focus-inward-for-military-needs-in-post-covid-world-top-officials/story-b2NWg20gmn7MSShReQ0V1H.html
22-04-2020||India||Working from home to be the new norm: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Work-from-home will be the new norm in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, minister of communications, and electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday, and asked the departments under his charge to work on putting in place a platform to facilitate the emerging trend.Prasad held review meetings with officials in both ministries to work out a plan to make work-from-home a permanent fixture in a wide range of “other service provider” establishments, officials said.. The first step towards the policy formulation, the officials said on condition of anonymity, will be a meeting with industry associations in the coming days. For such a policy to work, a senior IT ministry official said, infrastructural bottlenecks will need to be removed “We will have to ensure that the relaxations we have announced for these services become more permanent and the system will need to use the least amount of bandwidth,” the official said.  Other service providers, or OSPs, include IT and IT-enabled services such as international call centres and business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing centres, e-learning sites, billing centres and medical transcription companies.. The department of telecommunications (DoT) said on March 13 that OSP employees can work from home without going through an authorised PPVPN (provider provisioned virtual private network) as required by the rules. Later, DoT waived a mandatory Rs 1 crore deposit needed to let employees work from home; the OSP will only have to inform DoT of the addresses of its remote workers, it said. DoT said OSPs will have to maintain a register of call logs and calls detail records for a whole year which must be provided to the department when it calls for the records. A penalty fee of Rs 5 lakh, the DoT said, will be levied if the OSP violates these terms, and its license will also be liable to be cancelled. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had in October 2019 recommended that DoT ease the norms needed to be followed by OSPs . Sanjay Singh, vice president of the OSP Association of India, said removing the regulations may be a good move in the long run. “The government should be able to improve the proactive monitoring system; if they can implement those controls, then the liberalised guidelines will be effective,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-from-home-to-be-the-new-norm-ravi-shankar-prasad/story-vQFKsJANkZeAjUyfmUP1FI.html
22-04-2020||India||Delhi will test journalists after +ve cases in Maha, Tamil Nadu||A day after 53 journalists in Mumbai were found to be Covid-19 positive in a health camp conducted by the city’s municipal body, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday that the Delhi government will conduct free tests for journalists in the Capital city starting Wednesday.“There are reports coming from different states about journalists being infected by the virus… To ensure media persons in Delhi are safe, we are starting free testing for them from tomorrow,” Kejriwal said during a digital media address. The location for the tests was not announced.“Reporters are frontline workers in the battle against Covid-19. I salute the work being done by all journalists. Their work is very important for dissemination of authentic information,” the Delhi CM added. A senior official in the chief minister’s office said that any media person, including photojournalists working in the Capital with a valid media identification card would be accepted for the tests. Officials have begun to seek lists of eligible reporters and photojournalists from media houses to draw up batches to undergo testing.Television and print reporters, camera persons, photographers whose job entails visiting hospitals and other high density areas are at high risk of contracting Sars-Cov-2. Several cities, including Chennai, Jalandhar, and Dharamshala have reported at least 39 cases of positive Covid-19 cases among the fraternity, prompting some states like Karnataka and cities like Gurugram to set up testing facilities specifically for journalists. At least 27 media persons working with a television news channel in Chennai tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 after 92 employees working for the Tamil channel underwent the tests when a colleague on Sunday was found to be positive for Covid-19. Chennai, which has emerged as one of the hotspots in Tamil Nadu, has 358 cases of infections.Issac Livingstone, managing director of Sathiyam channel announced that the channel would stop live telecasts. Since reporters go across the state to report news, the current situation was unfortunate, but was also unavoidable, he said. In Punjab’s Jalandhar district, nine journalists of a leading vernacular media group, which publishes Hindi and Punjabi newspapers, have tested positive in the past week. Most of the journalists, including one designer, are part of the news desk and are between 27 and 42 years old. At least four family members of one of these journalists have also tested positive, while 100 people linked to the media group have been quarantined at home, the health department said. All journalists have been kept in isolation at the Civil Hospital. The site of the media organisation has been sealed off, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma told Hindustan Times. Another employee of the same news organisation has been found to be positive in Dharamshala, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh.The Gurugram health department on Monday began testing journalists in the city. The first batch of 30 samples were tested using Rapid Testing Kits (RTKs), none of which showed the presence of antibodies, indicating that the journalists were Covid-19 negative. However, as per the union ministry’s guidelines, RTKs are only surveillance tests, which need to be borne out by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. “We took 30 samples and all of them were negative. On Monday night, the district administration finalized to test journalists after the reports of Mumbai journalists contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus started coming in. A lot of journalists in the city are visiting hospitals, slums and meeting multiple people. Therefore, it became important to test them,” Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, Gurugram’s chief medical officer said. Testing, conducted at the old Civil Hospital, Jharsa Road, will take place on Wednesday too.Karnataka education minister S Suresh Kumar announced that the state government will also hold tests for media personnel.On Monday, 53 journalists tested positive for Covid-19 in Mumbai, after Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation-run health camp took the nasal and throat swabs of 171 journalists. All 53 were asymptomatic, and have been moved to a Covid Care Centre in the suburbs. The family members of all these journalists will be tested towards the end of this week, officials said.Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday tweeted, “It is shocking that more than 50 journalists of electronic media, particularly Camera persons, have been found #Corona positive in Mumbai. Every journalist should take proper care.”The same day, three Chennai journalists tested positive for Covid-19, prompting many to visit government hospitals to undergo tests. Journalists associations have requested the Centre to extend insurance to journalists covering the Covid-19 pandemic. Some states, like West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, have also announced insurance cover for accredited journalists in the states.Indeed, the issue of the safety of frontline journalists has been an issue of global concern. The Global Investigative Journalists Network will conduct a webinar on Thursday on the matter, where Richard Dawood, who heads London Fleet Street clinic will offer tips to journalists on how to stay safe.Last month, the National Geographic Society launched an emergency fund for journalists all over the world who wish to cover COVID-19 within their own communities. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-will-test-journalists-after-ve-cases-in-maha-tamil-nadu/story-jWBJwGQP80jqkjJJweIxaN.html
22-04-2020||India||‘When will govt listen?’: Rahul takes on Centre over fuel prices||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday questioned why the government hadn’t reduced the prices of petrol and diesel, which would have benefitted consumers, when global crude oil prices have fallen to near-record lows at a a time the world is combating the coronavirus crisis. Government officials said such low levels were unsustainable.Gandhi also took a swipe at the government over reports that rice would be used to make sanitisers He posed the question on oil prices to the Narendra Modi government on a day the Brent crude futures price, the international benchmark, for delivery in June fell to as low as $18.10, its lowest since November 2001. At 1200 GMT, it was down 18% at $20.98.“Prices of crude oil have fallen to unexpected levels in the world, yet why is petrol in our country sold at Rs 69, diesel at Rs 62?. It is good that prices have fallen in this disaster. When will this government listen,” Gandhi wrote in a tweet in Hindi.Fuel prices at the pump haven’t budged since mid-March in India although crude oil has been on the decline because of concerns over the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on world economies and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Demand for oil products has slumped amid a lockdown imposed in many economies, including India, to stop the spread of the disease. In India, fuel prices haven’t been cut to allow allowing oil refiners to make up for inventory losses and giving the government room to increase levies on the auto fuels for a second time to reinforce its war chest against Covid-19, government officials have told HT previously, For the government, the crude price dip means a windfall gain from lower import costs, given India’s dependence on oil imports to meet around 80% of its demand. The gain has been boosted by one hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs.3 per litre announced in March. It will be offset by the expenditure the government is incurring on the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a 40-day national lockdown. The government has already announced a Rs.1.76 lakh crore economic relief package for the poor and is under pressure to allocate a vastly bigger sum for economic stimulus.The government is closely monitoring global oil price movements, two officials working with two different economic ministries said on condition of anonymity.Global oil prices are unsustainable at the levels to which they have fallen, they said, adding that the freeze on pump prices would act as a cushion in case of a sudden spurt in crude prices International oil prices were about $69/barrel in August 2007, but had spiked to $147/barrel by July 2008. Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala separately wrote in a tweet: “WTI Crude Oil price plunges below USD 0 per barrel! We, the People, are still paying Rs 69.59 for Petrol Rs 62.29 for Diesel (Delhi). Why is Modi Government mum? Will ‘Self Styled Nationalists’ at least now become ‘Rationalists’ and demand relief?”The reference was to West Texas Intermediate,a US benchmark, whose price for May delivery hit a negative $3.99, after Monday’s dive below $0 for the first time, settling at a negative $37.63 per barrel.Anotgher Congress spokesperson, Pawan Khera, asked what was holding the government from reducing fuel prices.“Last night was a historical moment that saw unprecedented fall in prices of international crude oil {futures} as manufacturers have no storage capacity left. Why is government not transferring this reduction in oil prices to end-users like farmers and middle class? This relief will go a long way to help them,” he told reporters through video-conferencing.Khera said that at a time the country was in the midst of a crisis because of the coronavirus pandemic, the government was still busy making a profit out of crude oil.“Central excise duty on oil has been increased 12 times in last 6 years that has earned Rs 20 lakh crore. Why has the benefit not been passed on to consumers? Is government fulfilling its obligation by not passing on this benefit to the consumers,” asked Khera.Gandhi, separately, attacked the government for approving a proposal to convert surplus rice available with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) into ethanol to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitisers and also for blending with petrol.“After all, when will India’s poor wake up? You are dying of hunger and they are busy cleaning the hands of the rich by making sanitizers from your portion of rice,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the poor need hand sanitizer as much as the rich did. “FCI had surplus of 27.2 MMT {million metric tonnes}. Even after distributing free ration to 80 cr people for 3 months in advance, we have enough to spare. PDS {public distribution system} is flush. Value added bio products increase farmers’ income,” BJP’s information & technology in-charge Amit Malviya said in a tweet.On the recent order to use rice to make hand-sanitiser, one of the official who works for the oil ministry said, “This is for the rice that is in surplus and almost rotting. Sanitiser is the need of the hour, it is required in large quantities hospitals and mainly procured by government agencies/hospitals, where it is used for all patients, rich as well as poor. In fact, some states have demanded this policy so that their farmers could get better price for their crops.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-govt-listen-rahul-takes-on-centre-over-fuel-prices/story-yUYWpTIpHlYG7tqYcbnDVJ.html
22-04-2020||India||High presence of an enzyme behind delayed recovery of men: Analysis||New Delhi: A new analysis of Covid-19 patients admitted in the isolation ward of a Mumbai hospital, and three families who tested positive for the virus, has found that men have a delayed viral clearance compared to women patients -- or, simply put, men test positive for the virus for a longer time than women.The analysis does not mention if men also remain symptomatic for a longer time.The yet-to-be-published paper uploaded in MedRxiv, a preprint server for health research papers, suggests that high expression of ACE2 (an enzyme the Sars-Cov-2 virus uses to enter the body) in the testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may be playing a role in viral persistence among male patients.The study was conducted by 10 scientists from the Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Mumbai; Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York; Department of Microbiology, Topiwala National Medical College and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, involved 68 patients -- 48 men and 20 women, with a median age of 35 -- admitted to Kasturba Hospital with infectious diseases. seven members of three families tested positive.Swabs collected at the time of diagnosis were tested using the Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method and subsequent swabs were collected at approximately 48 hour intervals until they tested negative. The median time for testing negative for male patients was six days, compared to four days for women, the study said.“ACE2 was determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that cause Covid-19). High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males,” the paper concluded.To be sure, the theory is still to be validated.“It is true that ACE2 receptors are present in the testicular cells and the virus may be binding there and staying for a longer time. But this is the only paper which is saying this could be the reason. At the moment, we cannot generalise,” said Dr Shobha Broor, the former head of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) department of virology, who has read the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-presence-of-an-enzyme-behind-delayed-recovery-of-men-analysis/story-0zXs2oE7Pq8Nf41bHe7v3J.html
22-04-2020||India||Covid-19 will make tackling of natural disasters difficult: WMO||The Covid-19 pandemic will make tackling climate-related hazards very difficult as overstretched health systems may be unable to cope with the additional burden of patients due to natural disasters like severe heat waves in the coming months, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned.“Extreme weather has increased, and it will not go away because of the coronavirus. On the contrary, the pandemic exacerbates the challenge of evacuating people and keeping them safe from tropical cyclones as we saw with Category-5 strength Harold in the South Pacific...,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas, referring to the tropical cyclone that struck Vanuatu, an archipelago of 83 islands near Fiji, this month. Taalas said governments need to do more to strengthen warning systems to cope with multiple hazards.The April-May-June season is likely to be warmer than normal in most parts of the country, according to Indian Meteorological Department’s seasonal outlook released on March 30. The frequency of heatwaves is also likely to be slightly above normal during the season, it added.Gandhinagar’s Indian Institute of Public Health director Dilip Mavlankar said above-normal heatwave could mean extremely difficult conditions for people living in small houses in the Covid-19 containment zones. “We have to monitor those in slums in very small units especially if their movement is restricted. Additional water should be diverted by municipalities to these areas to deal with the heat and for handwashing. In the West, water is rationed from swimming pools or gardens to deal with heat episodes.”In a statement on Tuesday, the WMO said Covid-19 may result in a temporary reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions with the suspension of vehicular and air traffic, but new global mean temperature record is likely to occur in the next five years. The WMO said CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have risen in March compared to last year. The monthly average of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii last month was 414.50 parts per million, compared to 411.97 ppm in March 2019.The WMO also released a report on the global climate between 2015 and 2019, which said that the past five years were the warmest on record. The global average temperature has increased by 1.1 degree C compared to the pre-industrial levels, and by 0.2 degree C compared to 2011-2015 period. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one, the WMO statement said.US space agency NASA’s earth observatory on Tuesday showed a massive drop in pollution levels over India since the lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19 was imposed on March 25. The agency’s satellite sensors have also observed that aerosol levels have been at a 20-year low for April in North India.“We knew we would see changes in atmospheric composition in many places during the lockdown. But I have never seen aerosol values so low in the Indo-Gangetic plains at this time of year,” said Pawan Gupta, a scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Centre. NASA has put out maps showing aerosol optical depth (AOD) over India. AOD is an indirect proxy for air quality, which shows how solid and liquid particles in polluted air block sunlight and leads to smog.Experts said heavy rains in North India could have also helped clear aerosols. In parts of South India, however, aerosol levels have not decreased. They seem to be slightly higher than in the past four years which could also be because of meteorological factors, NASA researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-will-make-tackling-of-natural-disasters-difficult-wmo/story-sLpYdR6nD1D2QKcHKfdiUK.html
22-04-2020||India||Study highlights threat of spread in public transport||New York city’s labyrinthine subway system “was a major disseminator” of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections, according to an economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who used daily ridership data at different stations and infection trends in these areas.The finding, submitted to American nonprofit research agency National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), underscores the threat of infection in public transport where people are prone to being in close proximity and touching several surfaces through which an infection could spread.“The near shut-off of subway ridership in Manhattan – down by over 90% at the end of March – correlated strongly with a substantial increase in the doubling time of new cases in this borough,” Jeffrey E Harris wrote in the working paper.To establish causation, Harris cites the Gosce model , which adjusts the model used for predicting epidemics to include factors that are unique to mass mobility: people sharing space in a confined setting – such as a bus or a metro train – over a particular period of time during when they will be exposed to the virus.“The Goscé model offers a number of insights that are immediately applicable to the data from the New York City Flushing subway line,” Harris wrote while using the example of a particular route. These, he added, are how: rate of disease transmission is related to number of trips and average number of stations per trip along the line; passengers who board from remote stations spend longer in a train and are thus increasing the time when infections can take place; crowded trains raise the average number of infections and trains with more stops are more likely to seed epidemic than express lines with fewer halts.“An entire subway line, rather than the individual stations or subway cars, is the appropriate unit of analysis,” he added.Lara Gosce, now at University College London, used the model to establish a higher likelihood of people being infected with airborne disease when they had longer journeys through more crowded stations in the London Underground, in a paper published in the journal Environmental Health in 2018.To roughly adapt this to the Delhi Metro’s context, someone boarding a metro train on the yellow line – the busiest network – at Gurugram’s Iffco Chowk for a journey till North Campus in Delhi is statistically more likely to catch an infection than someone who uses the violet line (with significantly less ridership) to go from Janpath to Nehru Place.In New York’s case, Harris plotted infection hot spot along with data of how many people left or entered the subway stations in these boroughs to further establish the pattern.“We know that close contact in subways is fully consistent with the spread of coronavirus, either by inhalable droplets or residual fomites left on railings, pivoted grab handles, and those smooth, metallic, vertical poles that everyone shares,” he said.To tackle this problem, Haris added, authorities will need to look at staggered work hours (to reduce crowding), limits on the numbers of passengers per coach, enhanced ventilation and new technologies to determine which stations an infected person entered and exited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-highlights-threat-of-spread-in-public-transport/story-22su4J64IBtcBfqS96hZ7M.html
22-04-2020||India||Lockdowns may have only arrested first wave||The sweeping shutdowns across the world appear to have absorbed what may only be the first wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections, according to officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) and findings by researchers in France – one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic.The assessment is based on the number of people who appear to have contracted and recovered from the disease – the only way to develop an immunity till the time a vaccine is developed – which, according to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, “was not more than 2-3%”.“Early data suggests that a relatively small percentage of the populations may have been infected, even in heavily affected areas,” Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva on Monday, after warning that the “the worst is yet ahead of us”. The estimates were based on detection of antibodies in the regions where blood tests have been carried out.The findings are backed by a research uploaded to the French open access journal HAL. “By 11 May, when interventions are scheduled to be eased, we project 3.7 million (range: 2.3-6.7) people, 5.7% of the population, will have been infected. Population immunity appears insufficient to avoid a second wave if all control measures are released at the end of the lockdown,” the authors say in the report .France accounts for the highest number of infections as well as fatalities after the United States, Spain and Italy. As on Tuesday, 155,383 have been infected and at least 20,000 have died in France. The country ordered a nationwide shut down on March 17 when infections were at close to 7,000 with 175 fatalities.The researchers also add that an analysis of hospitalisations and ICU admissions suggest the lockdown had a drastic impact in France. “We find that the basic reproduction number R0 prior to the lockdown was 3.31 (95% CrI: 3.18-3.43). At the national level, the lockdown resulted in a 84% reduction in transmission with the R dropping to 0.52 (95% CrI: 0.50-0.55),” they said. R0 or R naught is the number of people infected by one person carrying the virus. A 95% Crl means there is a 95% probability that a value falls in a particular interval, also called credible interval or Crl. “National daily ICU admissions have gone from 700 at the end of March to 220 on the 14th of April. If current trends continue, by the 11th of May, we project between 10 and 45 daily ICU admissions,” the researchers add.This suggests France may have “flattened the curve”, a disease containment strategy that aims to reduce infections to levels that a country’s health infrastructure can manage.With a population of 1.36 billion, this is especially hard for a country like India, which has one doctor for every 1,457 people. France, on average, has 3.2 doctors for every 1,000 people, according to World Bank data.Globally, more signs emerged that the lockdowns that began in mid-March may have helped enough for some of these curbs to be relaxed in some areas. On Tuesday, Germany reported the smallest increase in infections – 1,323 – in a month. German chancellor Angela Merkel told a meeting of her Christian Democratic Party on Monday that easing the curbs risks sparking a new wave of infections.In Australia, health minister Greg Hunt said the lockdown measures have led to a “sustained and consolidated” slowdown in new infections – he said the growth rate had been less than 1% for nine consecutive days – but cautioned that there would be no relaxations for at least three more weeks.(With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdowns-may-have-only-arrested-first-wave/story-cDZeeKKumXijggEf8XeNzJ.html
22-04-2020||India||ICMR says 69% patients didn’t show Covid-19 symptoms||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Tuesday that 69% of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients in India who were tested did not show symptoms of the infection, even as the Union health ministry said that the trend of cases worldwide showed about 80% of the patients had mild or very mild symptoms.Roughly two-thirds of all Covid-19 cases in 10 major states comprise people who did not show any symptoms at the time of testing, according to a recent HT analysis of state government data that reinforced growing evidence that “silent spreaders” were unknowingly infecting others, and underlined the need for extensive testing to isolate such patients.Responding to a query on a study that suggested about 80% of the Covid-19 patients were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, ICMR’s head of epidemiology and communicable diseases Raman Gangakhedkar said that it was just one analysis that presented these numbers.“Among the total coronavirus tests conducted so far in India, 69% were asymptomatic and 31% were symptomatic. Which means for one positive patient when we initiated contact tracing, on average we found two asymptomatic patients,” Gangakhedkar said at the daily news briefing.He also said that usually, when there are asymptomatic cases, the chances of a patient reporting them are low.An analysis by HT on Sunday found that 65% of Maharashtra’s cases and 75% of Uttar Pradesh’s cases did not show symptoms at the time of testing. In Assam, 82% of the cases were of people with no symptoms.At the briefing on Tuesday, Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal, while referring to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, said: “There are few reports of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases which are truly asymptomatic. There has been no documented asymptomatic transmission. This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur.”“Using community surveillance and contact tracing, we are taking pre-emptive action to test asymptomatic persons with high risk contacts so that we are able to identify infected patients in early stage, treat them and reduce mortality,” he said.“On the basis of worldwide analysis, 80% of the Covid-19 patients show mild symptoms to very mild symptoms. Around 15% patients turn into severe cases and 5% may become critical,” Agarwal added.Experts say that the expansion of testing from only symptomatic contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 patient to testing everyone who could have been exposed to the infection, irrespective of symptoms, is leading to more asymptomatic cases being detected n India.The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 644 and the number of cases climbed to 20,004 in the country on Monday, according data from states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-says-69-patients-didn-t-show-covid-signs/story-lfNTncrIBGYUaVur9pAJXP.html

In this interview on Skype with Sunetra Choudhury, chief minister Pramod Sawant talks about the Goa model of combating the virus.Edited excerpts:Goa has declared itself a Covid-19 free zone. Are you at all wary that it may be too early to have declared this?Thanks to our Covid hospital team that worked hard to bring down our infections from seven to zero. We did their entire treatment, went house-to-house and surveyed, shortlisted the maximum people and we have tested them. So we can say that unless someone comes from outside the state, that’s the only possibility. else there is no positive case in the stateRemarkable at a time when states next to you like Maharashtra is really struggling. Isn’t the challenge also that you have quite a few entry points?That’s our only worry- that Maharashtra and Karnataka are nearby. In both the states, the cases are rising. Till the 3rd of May, there is a total lockdown. We have sealed our entry points, we aren’t allowing anyone into the state.One of the criticisms about your system is that you have not tested enough.Till now, only 826 tests have been done. I know your capacity to test is 80 per day. Are you planning to ramp it up? It is true and I am telling you that we have tested all contacts of those who have been impacted. We are starting with rapid testing at more centres. Approximately 150-200 tests per day we are trying to do.One of the things that is of concern is that you have 8,000 stranded seafarers who are waiting to come back to Goa. What’s your plan to deal with them?That’s true and we are in touch with MHA {ministry of home affairs}, MEA {ministry of external affairs} and ministry of shipping. We have already appointed a nodal officer to coordinate with the seafarers. As soon as the ministry issues guidelines, we are ready to quarantine them in the state. Our state has decided and fixed quarantine facilities. Hotels, hostels have been fixed for this.For those who say Goa is their favourite holiday destination, can you describe the situation there now? We may be a Covid-free state but only those activities that are permitted by Centre, only that are we allowing. We are strictly following that and not allowing anyone in. Even labourers and workers from other states aren’t being allowed inEveryone’s talked about the impact on the economy. How do you see your state in the post-Covid world?We are only focussed on managing Covid right now. We have established an economic revival committee and are expecting the preliminary report soon. Whatever measures we need to take afterwards, we are ready for it.Did the Bhilwara, Rajasthan, model of containment help Goa?We have our own model. After the 22nd {of March}, when PM announced junta curfew, we extended it by two days. We have our model which we worked on--the Goa model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-has-no-local-cases-outsiders-are-a-concern-cm/story-WeuzX8WHEy2mWsu9jLG8CI.html
22-04-2020||India||House to review protocol over video call meetings||The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will review rules and procedures to consider whether standing committee meetings can be held over video conference, a practice that has not taken place till now in order to maintain the secrecy of the proceedings.The rethink has been necessitated by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, which has led to the grounding of inter-city transport and the need for people to avoid gatherings as far as they can.Senior officials have been directed to recommend necessary amendments in the rules and procedures and to suggest how a digital alternative can be put in place for meetings of the panels, according to a senior functionary aware of the plans.On Tuesday, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held his first virtual meeting when he spoke with his counterparts from state assemblies to discuss the Covid-19 situation. They decided to set up control rooms in each assembly and Parliament for better coordination and help.Parliament rules emphasize in-camera sitting of committees to maintain secrecy, especially when officials or experts are called for deposition or report is being finalised. Every meeting also starts with members taking an oath of secrecy not to reveal anything about the proceedings outside.Rule 266 of the Lok Sabha, for instance, says: “The sittings of a Committee shall be held in private” and the next rule says, “The sittings of a Committee shall be held within the precincts of the Parliament House, and if it becomes necessary to change the place of sitting outside the Parliament House, the matter shall be referred to the Speaker whose decision shall be final.”A video medium for this raises concerns over whether a trail of this can be kept, and possible breaches. One video conference tool was recently in the spotlight for possible security vulnerabilities, prompting the Union home ministry’s Cyber Coordination Centre to issue an advisory for people to take precautions since the service “was not safe”.“We are absolutely clear that even if the Speaker allows online meetings, it can’t happen over private, unsafe platforms such as Zoom. The NIC’s meeting portal, which is now extensively used by Prime Minister and the entire government machinery to hold meetings, can provide the only possible way for such meetings,” said the official cited above.An official in the Speaker’s office said that after recommendations are collated, leaders of various political parties and the government would be consulted — indicating that it might take some time for the committees to go online.Many lawmakers have pitched for online meetings in the view of this unusual situation. Lok Sabha’s IT panel head Shashi Tharoor sought Speaker’s permission to hold a meeting virtually, Congress leader Manish Tewari wrote to finance standing committee chairman Jayant Sinha for a video conference on the economic situation in India, and another Congress leader Jairam Ramesh suggested Rajya Sabha chairman hold a session virtually in the wake of the Covid pandemic.The British Parliament, which had heavily influenced Indian Parliamentary system, is debating whether to hold its first session over video.At least one committee chairman has recently contacted all his panel members through emails and circulated a draft copy of a report for their approval so that the panel can submit its report to the Lok Sabha Speaker through the official email even when the lawmakers are unable to meet physically. In his video conference with assembly Speakers, Birla urged them to use digital technology as far as possible for meetings on legislative matters, movement of files and documents. He also urged them to ensure social distancing and other health safety norms in their respective assembly houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-to-review-protocol-over-video-call-meetings/story-pRxNTxZwuKFr7Z6xQ2cApN.html
22-04-2020||India||LS staffer, kin of Rashtrapati Bhavan worker test positive||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reached the apex of the Indian State — Rashtrapati Bhavan and Indian Parliament — on Tuesday as a special housekeeper of Lok Sabha — whose son works in Parliament too — and a daughter-in-law of a Rashtrapati Bhavan sanitation worker were tested positive.A cluster of 125 residential houses in the Rashtrapati Bhavan estate was sealed while New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) turned a large number of residential houses near Kali Bari Marg, where the parliament employee lived, into a containment zone.The daughter-in-law of the presidential house sanitation worker tested positive after she came in contact with her mother. The older woman died because of Covid-19 related complications at a private hospital near Karol Bagh seven to eight days ago, a Rashtrapati Bhavan official said.“After we came to know that the lady’s mother died with Covid-19 complications and she had visited her, we sent the entire family to a government-run isolation facility near Birla Mandir. The staff’s house was sealed too,” the official said. As a matter of abundant precaution, 125 houses in that area, within Rashtrapati Bhawan, were also sanitised and bleached in a bid to curb any possible spread of the virus that has already affected millions around the world.“All family members of the staff were tested for Covid-19. While everyone else came out to be negative, the daughter-in-law’s test showed positive results,” the official added, emphasising that no Rashtrapati Bhavan staff has been infected.Last month, President Ram Nath Kovind cancelled all his engagements indefinitely after it came to light that BJP lawmaker Dushyant Singh, who attended a breakfast meeting with him at Rashtrapati Bhavan, had also attended a party where Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor was present. Kapoor tested positive for Covid-19 and later discharged from hospital after testing negative.The Lok Sabha housekeeper, who tested positive, was not attached to the main Parliament complex, but its printing establishment at 36 Gurudwara Rakab Ganj Road in central Delhi. But he lived with his son, along with other family members. The son, in turn, works with the Electronic Corporation of India Limited and is currently posted in the CCTV wing in Parliament House. Both the father and the son had not been coming to work since March 23. “Approximately 10 days ago, the housekeeper fell ill and went to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for check-up and tests, including ECG. He was discharged the same day,” a parliament official said. “But after some days, he developed cough, fever and body ache. On April 18, he again went for check-up at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. This time, the doctors tested him for COVID-19. On Monday, April 20, his report came with COVID-19 positive result,” added the official.The housekeeper lives with his wife, three sons, one daughter, and four grandchildren in the same house at New Delhi’s Kali Bari Marg, said another senior official. One of these sons works in Parliament. Concerned agencies were quickly contacted to get COVID-19 test done for all family members on Tuesday. The results have not come yet.The housekeeper was shifted to Safdarjung hospital from his home on Tuesday morning and officials added that all precautions and steps as mandated by the government will be taken.The Parliament secretariat had resumed work from office on Monday after a gap of several weeks. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla too attended office and held a video conference with his counterparts in state assemblies to discuss the Covid-19 situation and other important issues relating to the role of the Speakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-staffer-kin-of-rashtrapati-bhavan-worker-test-positive/story-VbZuWOtT6olFiI4RU6zTuO.html
22-04-2020||India||Test all patients getting hospital admissions for Covid-19: Centre to states||All patients visiting hospitals in and around containment zones identified by the local authorities will be considered “suspected cases of Covid-19” and those getting admitted will undergo mandatory diagnostic tests for the coronavirus disease irrespective of symptoms, according to a central advisory on Tuesday.In a first, the Union health ministry advisory also advocated a clear demarcation between outpatient departments (OPDs) and wards, and asked doctors to stick to the same federal guidelines they follow in the treatment of Covid-19 patients even while attending to OPD patients.According to a ministry official, the advisory sent to state governments is aimed at preventing the spread of the deadly infection in health facilities, especially in light of the emergence of a few such cases in parts of the country.“There is a detailed guideline by the ministry on how to prevent hospital-acquired infection. But there have been cases where hospitals have reported the spread of infection and even shut down in some cases, probably because they got patients who had Covid-19 even though their symptoms weren’t pronounced enough…The new advisory is asking them to treat all patients as suspected Covid-19 cases, and take required safety measures,” the senior health ministry official who did not want to be named, said.For example, the paediatric intensive care unit of central Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College emerged as a hotbed of infections last week, with 12 health care workers testing positive for Covid-19. Two babies in the ward -- a 45-day-old and a 10-month-old --- got infected. The 45-day-old baby died on Saturday morning.Since March 2, when the first infection was reported in Delhi, at least 80 health care workers and doctors have been infected in the national capital.“Hospitals are likely to become high-risk areas. This is because doctors are not testing everyone; that is not possible,” said SK Sarin, director at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS)“…if the population has a large number of those who have no symptoms, and if they get into the hospitals, doctors and nurses will get infected and then pass it on to others – colleagues, families and patients,” Sarin, who is the chairperson of a five-member committee that advises the Delhi chief minister on Covid-19, said, explaining the challenges health care workers and facilities are facing.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) – the country’s apex health research body – about 69% of those infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, either have no symptoms or very mild symptoms.The central advisory came on the day all of Delhi’s 11 district magistrates as well as deputy commissioners of police, among other officials, held talks with lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal via video conferencing. Some of them raised issues faced by front-line workers.“The increase in the number of health care workers, those posted at hospitals and their contacts testing positive is a cause of concern. It might be that adequate measures for protection from the infection are not being taken by hospital authorities, including those which are not treating Covid-19 cases. There is an urgent need to fix these lapses,” said a district magistrate, requesting anonymity.A statement issued by the Delhi LG’s office said the city-state’s health department had been directed to take all precautionary measures.Under the central advisory, those who get admitted in hospitals will have to undergo the RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which is a confirmatory test to detect Covid-19. The results take about five-six hours.“RT-PCR is the gold standard as far as case confirmation is concerned, and results from rapid tests (or antibody tests) are still not foolproof, especially for early diagnosis…And the hospital staff has been directed to particularly keep an eye on patients for any development of unexplained fever, cough or respiratory illness (symptoms of the disease),” the official added.If a patient tests positive, all those who have had contact with him/her will be put on anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is considered a prophylaxis – a treatment to prevent a disease, according to ICMR guidelines. The government, however, has said the drug has to be taken under strict medical supervision as it could have serious side-effects, especially in those having underlying health conditions such as heart and kidney ailments.Each hospital in the country, be it a dedicated Covid-19 or non-Covid-19 facility, was earlier directed to have a Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC), which will be responsible for coming up with an effective mechanism for reporting the onset of symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 in health care workers.This includes surveillance for fever, cough and breathing difficulty, among others, either through self-reporting or active and passive screening at the beginning of shifts.“Whenever a non-Covid-19 patient or any healthcare workers is suspected to have Covid-19-like symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-19, the HICC will come into action, investigate the matter and suggest further course of action… rapid isolation, contact listing and tracking disinfection will follow, with no need to shut down the whole facility,” the advisory said.It said if the primary source of an infection could not be established and if a hospital continued reporting a large number of cases among patients and health care workers, the facility should be converted to a dedicated Covid-19 hospital and the local health department must be notified.“In terms of precautions, we are treating new patients as if they were Covid-19 positive even while conducting emergency surgeries. We are sanitising our operation theatres post surgeries, and our staff are wearing personal protection equipment (PPE) and taking other necessary precautions. All admitted patients are being tested irrespective of the Covid-19 symptoms…Same goes for patients who are frequent visitors such as those undergoing chemo, dialysis and so on; they are also being tested,” said a spokesperson for Max Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/test-all-patients-getting-hospital-admissions-for-covid-19-centre-to-states/story-Wonk3rpLdKP1s7dDJJTrnM.html
22-04-2020||India||This Delhi man risked his life for a stranger in distress||How many of us would put our lives in danger just to fulfil a promise made to a stranger ? Delhi businessman Hemant Bhayana drove his car non-stop, covering about 1326 km in 24 hours from Delhi to Bhagalpur, Bihar to help a migrant in distress. He wanted to ensure that Tipu Yadav, a 19-year-old daily wager, attends his mother’s cremation. Tipu’s mother had died a tragic death after getting trapped into a threshing machine. Some thoughtless relatives had sent Tipu extremely distressing pictures of his mother’s body which has caused him a nervous breakdown. The boy has stopped eating completely and he was crying inconsolably. He somehow wanted to reach his village in time to be able to cremate his mother’s body, but it seemed impossible due to the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Hemant’s sister, Delhi based activist Yogita Bhayana managed to get a permit letter from the government for Tipu to travel via roadways from Delhi to Bihar. But no one was willing to take up the highly arduous and risky journey to drive Tipu all the way home during the lockdown. The administration could not provide them a vehicle and a driver to carry out the mission. But Yogita was adamant to send Tipu home to be able to perform the last rites of his mother and share his old and ailing father’s grief. That’s when Hemant, 40, volunteered to drive all the way in his sister’s car along with Tipu and two more daily wage earners from Bhagalpur. He took along his friend Rohit Kumar to help him in this unique mission. “I can’t bear to see any one in pain…Tipu’s agony left me perturbed…there’s was boy in front of me crying because his mother had met such a horrific death, and he was away from his father. I just had to help him,” he says.Covering a distance of around 1,326 km in almost 24 hours in his sister’s car, Hemant dropped Tipu and his friends to Bhagalpur, and after resting for just a few hours, started his journey back to Delhi. By the time he reached home, he could barely stand. “I was extremely exhausted, but the peace and satisfaction that I got after fulfilling this task made up for everything,” he says.But there were a few sights that he witnessed during this journey that torment him even now. “As I drove through Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, I saw so many dead bodies of stray dogs, who apparently could not survive due to starvation. I could do nothing about that. I hope people come forward and ensure that no more voiceless beings bear the brunt of the lockdown,” says the dog lover who feeds stray dogs daily in Model Town.It’s been almost eighteen days that Hemant returned from Bihar but he has kept in touch with Tipu over phone. A few days ago, Tipu informed him he is trying his best to cope up with the tragic loss. He is keeping himself busy by working in the fields, helping his father cut wheat. Tipu says he can’t thank Hemant enough, for what he did for him. The two have made a unique bond, one that reinstates our faith in humanity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-delhi-man-risked-his-life-for-a-stranger-in-distress/story-k2qp2yrXRUqvlXM1pMeS2L.html
22-04-2020||Editorials||The significance of the Jio-Facebook deal| HT Editorial||Facebook’s investment of Rs 43,574 crore in Jio Platforms (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries) for a 10% stake reaffirms two axioms about valuations in tech and telecom. One, which is old, is that access matters. Jio, with 388 million subscribers at last count, has that in spades — it is the window to the world of 388 million Indians (and because we know that its data-rich network is used by entire families in some cases, probably a lot more). The second axiom, which is new, is that the pace of digitisation has been accelerated by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19); as a corollary, even entities (businesses, government departments, utilities) that thought they had already digitised their operations greatly are discovering how stuck-in-the-physical-world key parts of their processes still are. This presents a great business opportunity for both. In comments after the Jio deal was announced, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg spoke of the presence of “more than 60 million small businesses in India” and helping businesses create new opportunities. There’s already talk that WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, and Reliance Retail could partner, creating a mix of an online-and-offline model. For Reliance, the deal makes great financial sense. Rs 15,000 crore goes to Jio Platforms itself, which will use the money to grow; the rest, around Rs 28,000 crore, will be used by the company to redeem some of the optional convertible debentures parent Reliance Industries holds in it. Reliance will use the money to retire some of its substantial debt of over 1.53 lakh crore. The deal will also help Reliance in its aim of enhancing the revenue from its retail and telecom businesses to 50% of its overall revenue in a few years, from the current 32%. And it can help Facebook, which has had a series of run-ins with the Indian government, navigate the regulatory environment better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-significance-of-the-jio-facebook-deal-ht-editorial/story-8RiZxuAKUmUQ9u7NflHYhK.html
22-04-2020||Editorials||Pakistan’s Covid-19 gambit| HT Editorial||Pakistan is using the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) to secure its terror infrastructure. First, there were reports that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — which in February, gave Pakistan only four months to deliver on an action plan to curb terror financing — is expected to put off a review of steps taken so far by Pakistan till much later in the year because of the pandemic. On April 20, another report emerged of Pakistan removing almost 3,800 names from a terrorism watchlist for Punjab province. Of these, more than 1,800 names were removed since early March, while the international community was focused on the Covid-19 pandemic. Counterterrorism experts also noted that Pakistan’s National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) cited no explanation for the removal of names, which is the standard practice during such delistings.Pakistan’s counterterrorism practices are notoriously opaque. For years, NACTA’s website only maintained a list for proscribed organisations, with officials asserting that the maintenance of lists of proscribed individuals was the responsibility of provincial authorities. It is not just the listing of terrorists; there is no information in the public domain regarding the trial of the seven men arrested for alleged involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. There is also no information on the whereabouts of one of these men, Lashkar-e-Taiba operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, following his release on bail five years ago.Pakistan is clearly making the most of reduced pressure from the world community to crack down on terrorism at a time when most countries are focused on defeating the pandemic and addressing its impact on their economies. This is shameful. The let-up of pressure on terrorists comes at a time when Pakistani forces have intensified shelling along the frontiers in Kashmir. India will find it hard to take up these issues with other countries as bilateral and multilateral meetings have ground to a halt. The only option now is for India to keep its powder dry to deal with mischief by Pakistan-based terrorists, and to firm up its plans to increase the cost for Pakistan using terrorism as a State policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/pakistan-s-covid-19-gambit-ht-editorial/story-wXim5Mf9tUKz48MAEhEYWL.html
22-04-2020||Editorials||Entering week five of the national lockdown||The national lockdown has entered its fifth week from today. It is also the second day of selective relaxations in districts and zones that have seen either limited or no cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). With the lockdown, India is seeking to preserve public health and slow down the rate of the spread of the virus. With the partial relaxations, it is seeking to revive economic activities.But this picture obscures the variations within states. Health is a state subject, which requires state governments to be open to evolving responses based on the disease burden (which varies from state to state), best practices (the efficacy of social distancing and lockdowns), and successful models (such Rajasthan’s Bhilwara model or Kerala’s Kasaragod model). Some states have rightly decided to exercise more caution than others. Despite the economic toll of the lockdown, Delhi, Karnataka, Punjab and Telangana, for instance, are not easing restrictions for now, with Telangana even extending its lockdown till May 7.India stands at a crossroads, with both the Centre and the states on test. The next fortnight will determine if India can flatten the curve of infections enough for the partial relaxations to expand both in scope and geography — or there is a somewhat unmanageable rise in cases, which leads to a continued stalling of economic activities. There is now a consensus on health protocols, from testing to isolation, provision of protective gear for health care workers to ramping up health infrastructure for severe cases. This must continue. The actions in weeks five and six of the lockdown will define India’s course beyond May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/entering-week-five-of-the-national-lockdown/story-OWESTyTpwCtOkiM8fUh9DJ.html
