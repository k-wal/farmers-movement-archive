29-04-2020||News||Amend the FRBM Act, and spend more now||In Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s latest instalment of “Mann ki Baat” on April 25, he exhorted the citizens to treat the present moment as a yudh (war) against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). However, the government’s approach to the economy, under lockdown for over five weeks, has been anything but warlike. An economy is an emergent phenomenon, its path altering when it is buffeted by shocks. This calls for a creative response by the authorities concerned when one occurs. Globally, we are facing a situation that is not just abnormal but, failing a providential reversal, is set to damage our prospects as societies. Public authorities in almost all democracies have recognised this threat and unleashed unprecedented economic force. By contrast, in India, the economic policy appears paralysed, without no significant economic package announced yet.The lockdown being implemented is tantamount to an economic shock. As there is no production, there are no avenues of income generation for a vast majority of Indians. This would be cause enough for concern even if the loss is confined to a single period. But an economy exists in time. Today’s national income drives tomorrow’s expenditure, which determines income the day after. So the lockdown is likely to have consequences that extend well into the future. It is unlikely that incomes will bounce back to some predetermined level once it is lifted. In fact, there is the possibility that we will continue to slide. Economic policy in a democracy is expected to address this possibility. Recent world history has shown that there are varieties of responses even among democracies when it comes to assuming responsibility for the economy. Consider the responses of the United States (US) and by governments in the Eurozone, respectively, to the global financial crisis in the last decade. An aggressive fiscal stimulus in the former meant that the US recovered briskly, while reluctant activism by the conservative European Central Bank and equally conservative governments has meant that a whole continent has fared poorly by comparison. This contrast suggests that Europe’s misery was of its own making; in the words of the Dutch macro-economist Willem Buiter, “recessions are a choice”. It implies that it is within the reach of economic policy to determine the state of the economy by preventing a collapse of aggregate demand. Could it be that our own future in India after the lockdown is lifted will be closer to the experience of Europe rather than the US after the global financial crisis?Of course, as long as a lockdown persists, the problem is not just one of aggregate demand, for it is the supply side that is impacted first. But as wages not paid today lowers tomorrow’s expenditure, a supply restriction could soon end up as a demand recession. Of the two arms of macroeconomic policy, namely monetary and fiscal, it is the latter that has greater potential once demand slows. This feature, which is established in theory, is particularly relevant under the circumstances India finds itself in. The economy has been slowing for three years since 2017-18, following the demonetisation in late 2016. There is an explanation for this. In a slowing economy, private investors tend to be sceptical of the growth of profits, and are likely to contract investment. Now growth slows further, impacting investment in the next period, and so on. Only the government can counteract slowing private investment. The Great Depression is reckoned to have lasted for a decade from 1929, ended only by World War II. War had meant greater public expenditure, which restored economic activity. Nowhere was this more in evidence than in the US, which was launched into a period of extraordinary prosperity for three decades. It is important for us in India to learn from this period in world history and to tailor our economic policies accordingly.A hurdle in the path of the renewal of economic activity post-lockdown is the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act (FRBM) of 2003. It ties expansionary economic policy to a fiscal deficit limit of 3% of the gross domestic product. This when the Centre’s fiscal deficit was already at 3.8% in 2019-20. The government can, of course, amend it to allow for an emergency, like the one we face at present. Not amending the Act is one of the sources of the paralysis in economic policy today. It ensures that the government cannot expand its spending to battle the consequences of the spread of the coronavirus. Greater expenditure is required in four buckets, first for relief, next for the medical response, then for an aggregate demand stimulus and, finally, for ramping up the public health infrastructure. It is difficult to fathom the non-interventionist macro-economic policy stance of the government, one bordering on irresponsibility though wrapped in the rhetoric of fiscal rectitude. Never before has it been as true that, as John Maynard Keynes said: “Practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/amend-the-frbm-act-and-spend-more-now/story-b1TcKvMMwekY0s51PKrpmL.html
29-04-2020||News||Announce the stimulus, now||It has been 37 days of the national lockdown. Besides the first announcement — on March 27 — of a ₹1.7 lakh crore package to provide what were rather minimal relief measures to the poor, the Centre has not yet come up with a package for the economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in one of his first speeches to the nation on the coronavirus pandemic, spoke of the creation of a high-level economic task force to suggest measures, but little has been heard of it since. There are indications that the government is working on a stimulus. Besides the fact that this is already delayed, reports suggest that this is broadly focused on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). There can be no doubt that MSMEs have been severely affected due to the lockdown. They have little financial cushion; they employ the majority of India’s workforce; and they need urgent help. But it will be a mistake if the government just focuses on them, and ignores the demands of larger industry bodies that have sought a more comprehensive package. Given India’s socialist past, there is a tendency to look at bigger businesses with suspicion. But as the decades after economic reforms have shown, these businesses are critical. They provide mass employment, both in manufacturing and services; they are at the forefront of innovation; they can embark on larger projects which are critical for infrastructure needs; and their contribution to the revenue basket is key to fiscal health. The lockdown has affected every sector, small and big. Given the complex supply interlinkages that exist among all segments of the economy, helping one part — while neglecting another — will not be enough. The expected collapse in demand will also affect all industries. That is why it is crucial that when the government announces its package, it must take into account all industrial activity. Announce the stimulus now, with an eye on all the moving parts of the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/announce-the-stimulus-now/story-fIaYjPiIc8wwdGPT7Ol8LM.html
29-04-2020||News||Protect Indian media from predatory tech platforms||Silicon Valley has always preferred to portray itself not as a profit-making enterprise, but as a populist crusader for free speech. From invoking Martin Luther King, as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg did in a speech to defend his company’s strategy to allow false political advertising in the United States (US), to framing catchy slogans such as “Do No Evil” (Google) , the technology firms have played an aggressive advocacy game to keep public opinion in its favour.More recently, the original defenders of free speech — traditional news publishers in western democracies — have locked horns with Silicon Valley companies such as Google and Facebook over advertising revenue and the fake news propagated on these technology-enabled platforms. These news publishers charge the technology companies with two sins that threaten not just the news industry across the world, but also democracy in India.The first sin is that of playing an outsized role in peddling fake news. Rather than investing resources (proportional to their trillion-dollar valuations) to keep fake news off their platforms, most Silicon Valley companies pass the buck to users in the name of “free speech”. Any attempt to get these companies to crack down on fake news invites allegations of censorship. This tsunami of fake news is undermining the traditional media in India, which unlike the Silicon Valley platforms, continues to bear the risk of prosecution for publishing speech that falls foul of Indian laws. This means, that unlike, the technology companies, the news business has to employ editors, reporters and fact-checkers to ensure that their news is authentic.The second sin that these technology companies are often charged with is their tendency to profit off the work of others without paying them. No news aggregator, including Google and Facebook, generates any content of its own. The only way they can bring people to their platforms is by leeching off the content of others. While producing a video of a cat playing with a ball of yarn or making a viral meme is not expensive, it does cost a pretty penny for news publishers to pay journalists to collect, verify and publish news.Once published, these news stories are shared on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, thereby, drawing more users to them. Google operates in a slightly different way. By aggregating links to the websites of almost all news outlets in the world on its popular Google News platform, it offers users a one-stop-shop to find news stories. In the process, both Google and Facebook collect heaps of personal data of users that then allows both of these companies to offer targeted advertising solutions for their clients at a scale that the traditional news media cannot even dream of. In the process, news publishers around the world are losing significant advertising revenue to these giants.As the fourth pillar of democracy, the news media is one of the few industries whose financial health can affect the quality of a democracy. Across the world, there are two reform measures being discussed to alter the skewed equation between these tech companies and news publishers. The first reform measure is aimed at removing the “safe harbour” provisions in the law that provide Silicon Valley platforms with legal immunity for content posted by others. This is one of the reasons that Facebook, WhatsApp or YouTube cannot be sued for defamation or hate speech in most countries, despite profiteering from the traffic that such speech often draws towards their platforms. Removing this immunity will create incentives for them to invest more in content moderation. As of now, the progress on this front is slow.The second reform measure, which has already come into effect in Europe, and is under discussion in Australia and the US, is granting news publishers a legal right to charge a royalty from Silicon Valley platforms every time the latter displays a link to a news report with a short snippet. Accompanying this amendment is another measure that allows news publishers to create legal cartels in order to negotiate collectively with the platforms, without being subject to scrutiny by competition regulators. There is no guarantee that this law will work as intended because it is predicated on the news publishers and Silicon Valley firms arriving at a deal on the royalties. It is theoretically possible for companies like Google to shut out European news publishers from Google News. The company did this with Spanish news publishers a few years ago when Spain enacted a similar law. Such a refusal to deal with European news publishers may invite anti-trust scrutiny from competition regulators, but that is a long and messy road.So where does this leave Indian news publishers? There is surprisingly little public discussion on this important issue in India. Many of the legacy print news publishers are experimenting with paywalls and transitioning to a subscription-based model, but none of them are close to mastering the new business model. Even in the West only a few such as The New York Times have cracked the digital model. It is not easy to convince Indians to purchase subscriptions for online content that they are used to accessing for free.With Google, Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies eating into the traditional advertising pie in India, it is likely that the Indian news industry is going to lose revenue over the next few years as digital penetration increases at the cost of print revenues. At some point, news publishers will face a moment of reckoning. The weaker the financial health of the news industry, the less likely it is to spend on reporting. It is possible that some level of policy intervention will be required to strengthen the revenues of the Indian media. But any such intervention must be guided by empirical evidence based on Indian realities.It would be a mistake for India to copy the policies of the European Union or Australia, without accounting for the realities of its own news industry. The ball is now in the court of the Indian news publishers. They will have to make a case to convince public opinion of their need for protection from the conduct of the SV platforms.Prashant Reddy T is an intellectual property lawyer and co-author of Create, Copy, Disrupt: India’s Intellectual Property Dilemmas.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/protect-indian-media-from-predatory-tech-platforms/story-JwMNXLMceenG26siUli1JN.html
29-04-2020||News||Covid-19: An opportunity to overhaul green policies||The two overriding emotions that India is witnessing these days, thanks to the coronavirus-induced crisis, are fear and happiness. The first stems from the panic that the virus has caused and the harsh impact it has had on the poor and the economy. At the same time, there is a degree of relief at the impact on the environment; air and water bodies are cleaner now, and snow-clad mountains are visible from cities situated in the foothills.But are these a cause for celebration? Many commentators point out that these developments are only a short-lived reality. When the lockdown is over, it will be business as usual, and we won’t slow down to remember this magical interlude. The last two months, however, have made us intensely aware about the linkages that exist between the destruction of the ecosystem and the systematic plunder of the natural environment to the coronavirus crisis. These observations are not new, but now they are gaining traction because we are collectively facing a crisis. It is known that zoonotic diseases emerge due to anthropogenic activities, linked to unsustainable economic practices of plundering diverse ecosystems through deforestation, mining, and illegal trade in wildlife. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19), like Avian influenza, Ebola, Nipah, and Zika, has origins in excessive human influence on natural environments. The recent exhortation by the acting executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, to ban wildlife markets is testimony to this. A return to business as usual will be suicidal. A balance must now be achieved in how humans and other living beings, as well as natural ecosystems, survive, if not thrive, in each other’s company. The concept of “One Health” for humans, animals, and ecosystems can work as a guide to nations. Originating from the discussions on biodiversity and the health of ecosystems, “One Health” is defined by the World Health Organization as “an approach to designing and implementing programmes, policies, legislation, and research in which multiple sectors communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes”. The areas of work in which a ‘One Health’ approach is particularly relevant, the WHO says, is “food safety, the control of zoonoses (diseases that can spread between animals and humans…) and combating antibiotic resistance.” We believe that “One Health” should become a key pillar of India’s environmental policy. A recent European Commission report highlights the links between the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the climate crisis. The report noted: “Experts suggest that degraded habitats coupled with a warming climate may encourage higher risks of disease transmission, as pathogens spread more easily to livestock and humans. Therefore, it is important — now more than ever before — to address the multiple and often interacting threats to ecosystems and wildlife to buffer against the risk of future pandemics, as well as preserve and enhance their role as carbon sinks and in climate adaptation.” Realigning the focus of environmental policy with the “One Health” concept will be transformational. It will prioritise the resilience of ecosystems as well as the relationships of humans and other living beings to their ecosystems, rather than focus on solutions like pollution control. Such transformative change also requires new kinds of partnerships and alliances between actors within the government, civil society, and the private sector. To draw up a plan of action, the involvement of environmentalists, conservationists, and medical doctors will be a must. The ministries of environment, forests, climate change, and health and family welfare would have to work to develop and implement this transformative agenda. There are some elements of this plan in the Government of India’s programmes, but these have to be more emphatically articulated and implemented. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought with it untold misery. But it’s given us an unexpected gift — the potential to press the reset button of the planet. We might celebrate the moment by taking photographs of peacocks on our terraces, but we shouldn’t lose the opportunity of a large-scale overhaul of our environmental policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-an-opportunity-to-overhaul-green-policies/story-jFiwmCyNfKhyrkuTihK0OP.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||Malegaon emerges among top five Covid-19 hotspots in Maharashtra||Following a spike in Covid-19 cases over the last few days, Malegaon in Nashik district has become one of the five hotspots in the state. The Maharashtra government has now launched Mission Malegaon, to tackle the coronavirus outbreak in this densely-populated city.Of the 195 cases in the district, 171 (around 90%) were reported in Malegaon and the 12 related deaths were also from the city. The tally of cases in Malegaon has doubled from 85 in a week since April 21, largely because of the failure of containment mechanisms and social distancing norms. This has put the city among the top five hotspots in the state, alongside Mumbai, MMR excluding Mumbai, Nagpur, and Pune. The state has now appointed a task force of medical workers and security personnel to control the situation.“Lockdown orders were ignored and power loom and handloom industries were working for a few days after the announcement. Police officers who took action against violators faced pressure from political leaders. Administrative staff, health workers, and security personnel are not ready to work in the area,” said an official from the district collectorate.The state government has deployed three companies of State Reserve Police Force, in addition to the local police, taking the total strength to 1,800 personnel deployed on the ground in Malegaon. Home minister Anil Deshmukh said that the government is ready to deploy additional forces if required. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The death rate in Malegaon is high because patients did not report symptoms, making it difficult for the authorities to trace contacts,” he said. Tope said that authorities have now been asked to organise mass institutional quarantine of contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/malegaon-emerges-among-top-five-covid-19-hotspots-in-maharashtra/story-VIquInXbGFADhZQgcYDqDP.html

These works will not be permitted in containment zones.Residents can carry out repairs such as plumbing and plastering work but no new work will be permitted during the lockdown period.The lockdown period in Thane district might be extended further as the district is one of coronavirus hotspots in the country. This will affect emergency pre-monsoon work.Thane district collector Rajesh Narvekar said, “Most construction works are incomplete in some parts of the district. Trenches have been dug up for plinth and basement work and have been left incomplete. This can lead to waterlogging and mosquito breeding during monsoon. We have decided to permit such works which are important for residents’ safety.”All work should follow safety guidelines at the site and workers should stick to guidelines.Narvekar said, “We have allowed structural repair works for buildings and urgent repairs such as plumbing and plastering for buildings. The transport vehicles for such works should strictly follow lockdown guidelines. The company should take permission to bring workers to construction sites in small batches and they should be given accommodation at the site.”The collector said the construction site should be barricaded and a signboard put up.The contractors should provide a copy of work permit to the local police station before starting the work and all safety rules should be followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-collector-gives-nod-for-pre-monsoon-repairs/story-VzYHBJk0NyEwA4UQ07GpHM.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||Bhabha Hospital will have to pay ₹37L to Taj Group for housing its staff||KB Bhabha Hospital in Bandra will have to pay over ₹37 lakh to Taj Group of hotels for accommodating hospital staffers on Covid-19 duty. The Taj Group, in an email, said they don’t want to respond. As the pandemic broke out, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started to make alternative accommodation arrangements for hospital staffers on Covid duty to curb any possible transmission among their family members and non-Covid staff. In March, the Tata Group of hotels offered Taj Lands End in Bandra and Taj Santacruz to accommodate around 150 hospital staffers, mostly from Bhabha hospital, which got a Covid ward with 150-bed capacity and intensive care units (ICU). The initial agreement stated the hotels were to provide free accommodation. But according to BMC officers, they have redone their agreement under which the corporation may now have to pay a daily charge of ₹2,000 per staff member.Confirming the change, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “In March, the accommodation at the hotel was for free, but now the agreement has been changed…It is still just a proposal. We are still in talks and will take a decision on it soon.”However, the data accessed by HT shows that on April 24, medical superintendent of the hospital has released a bill of ₹37,12,000 to be paid to the hotels for accommodating hospital workers. It reads, “As per the telecommunication with Dr Prachi from BMC who is coordinating this, it has been agreed upon to pay ₹2,000 per staff. Accordingly, the below bill has been generated.”The bill doesn’t mention any amount for the period of March 20-April 1. But from April 2, the hotel has imposed the new charge. The document has the signature of the medical superintendent of the hospital. On April 2, the number of occupants from the hospital in Taj Lands End was 27, for which the BMC has to pay ₹54,000 a day. Gradually, with the rise in the number of occupants, the bill amount started surging from ₹1,48,000 to ₹2,34,000 for each day. The hospital has drawn up a bill of ₹34,72,000 for 12 days of stay at the hotel till April 18.Similarly, for the other hotel, the hospital has to pay ₹2,40,000 for the accommodation of 12 workers for 10 days between April 11 and April 20. This takes the total amount to ₹37,12,000.Civic activist and teacher Aftab Siddique has filed a complaint with the BMC for paying over ₹2 lakh per day to accommodate staff in five-star hotels. “This is quite upsetting, people have no food to eat, people are stranded in the city and BMC is on a different node,” reads the complaint copy sent on April 26. She said, “The staff could easily have been shifted to the deputy municipal commissioner’s building.” Dr Pradip Jadhav, medical superintendent of the hospital, said, “I won’t be able to comment on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhabha-hospital-will-have-to-pay-37l-to-taj-group-for-housing-its-staff/story-DCueEODQzlg3O0P7Tx1G7J.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||After scrapping exam, board yet to decide on SSC marking scheme||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) is yet to decide on the marking scheme for the secondary school certificate (SSC) exam, leaving students and parents worried about what this means for their final SSC marks. It has been more than two weeks since the state education department cancelled the last SSC exam. On April 12, the education department decided to cancel the final paper for SSC-Geography, which was scheduled for March 23 but was cancelled owing to the lockdown. The papers for vocational subjects (offered to children with special needs and conducted a few days after the board exams) were also cancelled. Officials at the state board had said a marking formula would be arrived at for the cancelled paper. However, even while the board has formed a committee to deliberate the issue, it is yet to arrive at a decision. “Since it is the first time such a cancellation has taken place, we need time to explore all possible options. This would be done in consultation with the government,” said a senior official from the state board. Parents complained that with no clarity on the marking scheme, students have been left hanging. “Students prepare for their board exams throughout the year and while it is true that the current situation is unprecedented, they are worried about their marks for the last paper,” said Sarita Tambe a city-based parent, adding that the uncertainty was leading to greater anxiety.While the board has, in the past, resorted to giving average marks to students whose answer sheets were lost or stolen, this was done only for a handful of students. This year, nearly 17 lakh students appeared for the SSC exam and officials say they have to consider all possible options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-scrapping-exam-board-yet-to-decide-on-ssc-marking-scheme/story-XdwedpgV07gWw7jL2Q2jUL.html
29-04-2020||Lucknow||Post lockdown, 17 green zone districts in UP set to get maximum relief||Seventeen Uttar Pradesh districts, which have not reported a single Covid-19 positive case since the outbreak of the pandemic, are likely to get the maximum relief in terms of resumption of commercial, industrial, construction and agriculture activities, once the lockdown ends on May 3.Dubbed as districts in green zone, these areas will see minimum possible restrictions, unlike in districts where there are cases, said a senior state government officer familiar with the development. Additional chief secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said, “The green districts are likely to get maximum relief with opening up of various activities. The state government departments as well as the district magistrates have been directed to prepare a work plan for the starting of the activities in these districts.”Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had also directed senior officers of various state government departments to draw up a plan for activities that could be permitted in ‘green’ and ‘orange’ zones.Districts that do not have enough confirmed cases to meet the ‘red zone’, but are being seen as potential hotspots, are part of the ‘orange zone’.Awasthi said though activities will get momentum in green districts, it is likely to be restricted in orange districts while there will be no activity in areas where the Covid-19 positive cases have been reported. Dubbed as red zones, there will no activities in the districts where 20 or more Covid-19 cases have been reported, Awasthi had said.The chief minister had directed the DMs of all 75 districts to take decision regarding starting of the activities according to the situation in the respective districts. “Much will depend on the decision of the DMs,” he said. On April 16, the state government has given nod to the continuous process industries, including steel, chemical, refineries, fertilizer, paper, sugar mills, cement, tyre and textile (not garment) factories to start operation in the green and orange districts, said a state government officer. The state government will implement the central guideline for starting various activities in the green and orange zones. The 7,425 industrial units have been activated and estimated 1.33 lakh labourers have been employed. They will stay in the premises of the factory, he said.The state government has already started works on the three expressways, Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway and Gorakhpur Link expressway.The Public Works Department (PWD) is planning to launch 225 projects while the rural drinking water department is set to begin work in 78 projects.The state government has also ordered resumption of operation at 32,345 common service centres and 12,027 brick kilns in the green and orange zone districts. The minor irrigation department is planning to start construction on 84 check dams and 96 ponds in the green zone districts. The DMs of the green and orange districts have been directed to permit the transportation of construction materials in the respective districts, he said. The 119 sugar mills are continuing with the crushing of the canes and manufacture of the sanitizer in the distilleries, he said.Along with the opening of the state secretariat in Lucknow with one third officers/ employees, the state government has directed the DMs of the green and orange zones to start working in the collectorate and other state government departments according to the guideline issued by the state government.The operation of the public transport is likely to be banned, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/post-lockdown-17-green-zone-districts-in-up-set-to-get-maximum-relief/story-JWGB3ewaqJvKt8w1pbGRPJ.html

He replaced sub-inspector Gurmeet Singh, who was sent to Police Lines. The reshuffle comes after reports surfaced that a Covid-19 positive case, held a rooftop party at his house in the colony and invited many people. However, the concerned station house officer (SHO) Narinder Patial, police post in-charge and beat officials were completely unaware of the event. Explanation sought from Sector 26 SHO UT Police on Wednesday sought written explanation from the SHO of Sector 26, Narinder Patial, on why they were unaware of the party that took place at the residence of a Covid-19 positive patient. Sources said if found guilty, he could be transferred. Resort to baton wielding if need be: DSP EastIn an audio clip that was leaked on multiple WhatsApp groups, the deputy superintendent of police, East, Dilsher Singh Chandel stated that since the people were not listening to the prohibitory orders, the six station house officers (SHOs) under him, in their respective areas needed to increase the number of cases against violators and rounding up of people. “We have got directions that if the people do not listen, we need to resort to lathi charge, especially in areas of Sector 30 and 26 (containment zones). We need to do so after taking permission from duty magistrate as the infection is spreading at a rapid pace. From now, we need to be inflexible against violators,” the DSP stated in the audio.Police have started to install cameras outside houses of people that are supposed to be under quarantine for round-the-clock surveillance. At present there are nine functional cameras. At least 50 police personnel along with two inspectors and one station house officer (SHO) will be on duty round-the-clock outside BDC and no one will be allowed to enter or exit. The force has been provided with protection gears, including PPE kits, masks and face shields. The outer perimeter of the area has been cordoned off by central reserve police force (CRPF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-bapu-dham-colony-police-post-in-charge-transferred-to-police-lines/story-1QfAhd4zpeZdnvlxaRCTfN.html

29-04-2020||Mumbai||IIT-B’s e-token app to help grocers and buyers||To maintain physical distance and minimise the time spent in queues while picking up groceries and fresh produce at markets, a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) and Chennai Mathematical Institute have developed an e-token system for grocers and local buyers. Called SMALL-BAG — an acronym for Shopping Management App for Local Buyers and Grocers — the app uses both SMS and email. Once the customer has filled a Google form or sent a text message with their order to the grocer’s mobile number, a token is generated and sent to the customer by either text or email. The customer can check the token’s live status via a web address. The token’s status is updated by the vendor and customers can collect their orders accordingly.“The e-token system will be beneficial even after the lockdown because physical distancing will have to be followed for a long time. The system is useful for managing crowds by minimising the number of people visiting the grocer, which will also be helpful during summer and monsoon months,” said Professor Bhaskaran Raman, department of computer science and engineering, IIT-B. Both SMS and email versions of the e-token system are operational at the institute, he said.At present, the software is open source and the team will provide free support to set up the system.With many local vendors accepting orders on WhatsApp, the team has created an online ordering system by which a customer fills a form comprising partial product information. When the order is ready, the customer receives an “order ready” email. “Orders on WhatsApp are very unstructured as compared to an online system. No third party in our online ordering system will bring down costs for the vendor while scaling up business,” said Raman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-s-e-token-app-to-help-grocers-and-buyers/story-lZHPDCJZLAyl5EJghZCpyM.html
29-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt freezes DA, DR for its employees, pensioners||The Delhi government has put on hold hike in inflation-linked allowance for around 2.2 lakh employees and pensioners till July 2021, following a similar step by the Centre. The dearness allowance for employees and dearness relief for pensioners were due from January 2020. The Delhi finance department has issued an order endorsing the central government’s order to put on hold hike in DA and DR till July 2021. “The Centre’s order on the issue of DA and DR has been endorsed by the Delhi government and it will also be applicable on Delhi government employees and pensioners,” a government official said. Money saved by the move can be used to combat COVID-19 in the national capital, the official said. Umesh Batra, general secretary of Delhi government employees welfare association, said that the move will affect around 2.2 lakh state employees and pensioners. Last month, the Union government had announced a 4 per cent increase in dearness allowance (DA) for its 50 lakh employees and 61 lakh pensioners beginning January 1, 2020. But it recently froze the inflation-linked allowance in view of the coronavirus pandemic. Several states have followed suit. Delhi government employees and pensioners will continue to receive DA and DR, respectively, at the current rate -- 17 per cent -- till June 30, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-freezes-da-dr-for-its-employees-pensioners/story-pyYTBo8Q4dUeb9AXTBgHJJ.html

The shops selling essential commodities inside residential complexes, gated colonies, vehras, etc can also be opened. Any shop, situated inside a market, market complex, shopping mall has not been allowed to operate and the wholesale market selling essential goods would be allowed to open only after 11 am.

29-04-2020||Mumbai||Amidst political uncertainty in state, Uddhav Thackeray dials Modi||After Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari appeared non-committal on nominating chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to the legislative Council, Thackeray dialled Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday night to discuss the current political situation in Maharashtra.A senior Shiv Sena leader said that Thackeray expressed unhappiness over the politics being played around nomination as a member of legislative Council (MLC).The conversation between the two leaders assumes significance in the context of the ongoing friction between the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as well as Governor Koshyari’s alleged delay in nominating Thackeray to state legislative Council.The state cabinet had recommended Thackeray’s nomination to one of the two vacant seats in the upper house. Over 20 days later, the Governor has not processed the recommendation of the cabinet. On Tuesday, a delegation of MVA ministers met Koshyari to urge him to nominate Thackeray.A senior Sena leader said Thackeray decided to call Modi and directly speak to him after he got indications from Koshyari that he would be consulting with the Centre before deciding on his nomination. The Sena leader said the CM requested Modi to intervene as a bitter political tussle in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak would affect the state’s measures to control the pandemic. Maharashtra has the highest number of cases among India’s states.“Uddhav discussed the current political uncertainty in the state with the PM. He expressed unhappiness over the politics being played over his nomination as MLC at a time when the state is combating the coronavirus outbreak,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader, requesting anonymity. Despite attempts, none of the senior Shiv Sena leaders wanted to officially comment on the issue.With less than a month left for Thackeray to fulfil the constitutional requirement of getting elected to either of the houses of the state legislature, the alleged delay by the Governor has kept the proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over the CM and his government. Thackeray, who is not a member of either of the houses of the legislature, took oath as the CM on November 28. He could lose the post if he is not elected to the legislature by May 27. The Shiv Sena is also exploring legal options to tackle the current uncertainty surrounding Thackeray’s nomination.A senior BJP functionary said the governor had taken time to seek legal counsel. “Legally, election or nomination to vacant seats in the legislative Council cannot be done if the remainder of the term of a member in relation to a vacancy is less than one year,” he said. The functionary, who requested anonymity, declined to comment on Thackeray’s call to the Prime Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amidst-political-uncertainty-in-state-uddhav-thackeray-dials-modi/story-fwYnkTxfkahldzs12QrfwN.html

We hope to be a part of the study that shall establish the role of plasma therapy,” said professor Tulika Chandra, head of the department of transfusion medicine at KGMU, Lucknow.The university has already taken permission from the drug controller general of India for plasma therapy for coronavirus patients. Three cured patients have donated plasma and it has been transfused to one patient, who is still under treatment.The therapy aims to obtain plasma from a cured patient and administer the same to a patient under treatment. This exercise is based on the theory that a cured patient develops antibodies for the coronavirus.KGMU had applied to be made a nodal centre for plasma therapy in the state. Communication was going on with ICMR in this regard for the past 20 days and now the same is under way to include KGMU for a pan-India study.“We have treated 12 patients and several more are admitted. Not just our patients, but we can collect plasma from patients treated at other medical centres in the state and conduct plasma therapy,” said professor Chandra. She said a decision will be announced by this weekend, but she was sure ICMR will include KGMU in the study.The study will include other centres from different states as well. Although it will take months to ascertain the role of plasma therapy in treatment of Covid-19, the move will help start the facility at many centres across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/plasma-therapy-kgmu-looks-to-be-part-of-icmr-s-pan-india-study/story-fXZVzGDFbr5IXvOondkuSL.html
29-04-2020||Delhi||Produce supply dips at Azadpur Mandi as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana shut their borders||The Azadpur agriculture produce market in Delhi saw a nearly one-third drop in total arrivals of produce this week, compared to the previous week, owing to strict restrictions imposed by Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments at the borders they share with the national capital.Both governments have shut its borders at Faridabad (Haryana), Noida and Ghaziabad (both Uttar Pradesh), in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in their respective states.“Wednesday, around 5,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables arrived at the market. The daily average is 7,500 tonnes. We will take all possible steps to ensure that the supply chain is not disrupted and prices remain stable,” Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agriculture market committee, said.The market is Delhi’s lifeline for produce and accounts for roughly 80% of the total produce consumed in the city. Shortage in arrivals can lead to a supply crunch in local markets and prices shooting up.Before the borders were sealed, the district administration in Haryana’s Sonepat had already prohibited farmers from sending their produce to Azadpur after a trader in the local wholesale market there -- who used to frequent Azadpur -- tested Covid-19 positive earlier this week.“The restrictions in Sonepat would affect supply of cucumber, ladies finger, bottle gourd and bitter gourd, among other vegetables. But such vegetables also come from Rajasthan. So, there are alternatives,” Khan said.But to reach Delhi, trucks from Rajasthan will have to cross the Haryana border, which has sealed the borders, an issue that has become a bone of contention between Delhi and her neighbours.Azadpur market is currently witnessing a coronavirus transmission scare after 11 traders in the market tested positive for the disease with one death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/produce-supply-dips-at-azadpur-mandi-as-uttar-pradesh-haryana-shut-their-borders/story-7XnvbbFiEGY7vyAOxvwNtO.html

The response comes a day after the UT education department sought inputs from schools on whether they wanted reopen on May 3 or May 15, maintaining social distancing among students.District education officer, Alka Mehta, said, “90% of the schools in Chandigarh informed that they were not in favour reopening in May as it was difficult to ensure social distancing among students. A few schools informed that they might think of resuming classes of senior students appearing for board examinations but in a phased manner.”Sources also hinted at the prolonged closure of schools in the city because of increasing number of Covid-19 positive cases. The total number of positive Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh on Wednesday evening stood at 68. Officials said schools may resume working in July. Mehta said the admission process will be initiated in June after and the classes will start in July. She said admissions will follow a normal course of action. The UT education department has chalked out a proposal to allow specific schools to collect monthly fees if the lockdown is extended. Education department had earlier instructed the schools to display their balance sheets on their websites.

Negative.For a 73-year-old man from South Delhi’s Govindpuri Gali no. 13, fortune changed multiple times over a period of nine days.

When he got to know that he had tested negative, he kept pestering us to take him home,” his son says.While the mood of the household after his return was joyous, their neighbours continue to stigmatise them. “Our neighbours are behaving as if even speaking to us could infect them,” his son adds. The elderly man is a retired government officer and lives with his three children and their families in Govindpuri. He has high blood pressure and high sugar, which his family calls old-age ailments.During the lockdown, the family says that they hardly ever stepped out of the home. “Only my brother stepped out to purchase essential items. The items he purchased would be kept outside the house for hours and he would mingle with the family only after bathing every time he returned,” he says. But despite all precautions, by mid-April, the elderly man developed a fever that wouldn’t subside. He did not develop a cough or breathing issues though. On April 19, his sons took him to Holy Family Hospital. “We were asked to get him tested for Covid-19. We got the tests done at Max Hospital in Saket. The result was negative on April 20,” his son says.Around the same time, the elderly man’s other son too developed a fever but tested negative. For the next couple of days, while the elderly man remained admitted to Holy Family Hospital, his doctors advised him to undergo a second test. “We got him tested again at an authorised private laboratory. The result this time was positive,” his son says. The family suspected that he may have been infected while travelling to the lab in an ambulance.They got him admitted to Max Hospital in Saket on April 23.“We were all worried about his health. He was among five other patients in a ward at the hospital, but he felt so lonely,” his son says. Back at home, his family allegedly battled discrimination from local residents even as their building was sealed.“The shopkeeper refused to sell milk to us. Vegetable vendors would be told by neighbours to avoid our house. Our tenants couldn’t procure drinking water jars. We had to request a relative to drop essential items outside our home,” the man says. But what hurt the family the most was videos of the house and their family circulating on WhatsApp groups. “We felt like we had committed a crime. Neighbours looked at us with such hatred in their eyes,” he says. However, after a few days, they heard some good news. “On April 25, my father’s third test result was negative. We were happy, yet cautious. How could someone who tested negative one day test positive two days later and then negative after three days? There was a mistake somewhere, most likely with the results of the private lab which declared him Covid-19 positive,” the son says.According to a senior Delhi government health official, “there is the possibility of errors in test results”. “There have been cases in which labs have declared people positive. They eventually turned out to be free of infection,” the official said, refusing to comment on any specific case. The family’s concerns about the latest test result were dismissed when the fourth result on April 27 was also negative. He was finally discharged from the hospital on Tuesday night. “When he walked in, we clapped and cheered for him. Five days earlier, we were worried about his life and now we had him back with us,” the son says.Max Hospital cited patient confidentiality and refused to comment on this case. The family may have won one battle in the hospital, but the battle closer home continues. “When all this is over, I’ll meet the local residents and tell them we hadn’t erred even once,” the son says while his father sleeps alone in a separate room at their home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/one-false-positive-leads-to-trouble-stigma-for-this-73-year-old-delhi-man/story-5qBlY2WqRLQrAjYmirDFBJ.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Government caught napping as Nanded pilgrims jack up Punjab’s count||The state government’s preparedness to deal with people entering Punjab from other states has been exposed as 36 pilgrims who returned from Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra, in the past three days have tested positive for coronavirus. On Wednesday alone, 24 Nanded-returnees were found infected with the virus. The state’s health department was caught napping as it had no strategy to deal with the Punjabis entering the state, especially Maharashtra, which is one of the worst-hit states as far as coronavirus cases are concerned. The guidelines to quarantine these visitors in government facilities were issued on April 27, two days after the first batch of pilgrims entered the state and that too after three of them were found Covid-19 positive in Tarn Taran district.When the guidelines were issued, the damage had already been as more than 500 pilgrims had entered in the state by April 27 evening.In absence of any strategy before the guidelines were sent to deputy commissioners, Nanded-returnees were advised home quarantine after thermal screening. There are reports that these visitors not only met fellow villagers and family members, but were accorded welcome by people at several places. On April 28, the panic-struck health department called back all Nanded-returnees from home quarantine and shifted them to government facilities and started taking their samples.As per the health department’s official spokesperson for Covid-19, around 4,000 pilgrims have already entered Punjab. Many are said to be on their way as government-run buses sent to ferry them are still arriving. Health department officials says more than 1,500 pilgrims who returned from Nanded have tested for Covid-19. SOURCE OF VIRUS UNKNOWN Many pilgrims who spoke to HT claimed that during their stay of over one-and-a-half month in Nanded, confirmatory tests were conducted results of which came negative.“We underwent regular medical check-ups during our stay in Nanded and those with minor symptom were checked and even confirmatory tests were conducted. Nanded reported its first case on April 22. May be, our fellow pilgrims contracted the virus on their way to Punjab,” Surjit Kaur Khalsa, a Sikh pilgrims from Bathian village of Gurdaspur district said, adding that she and around 1,000 other Sikh pilgrims were stuck at Gurdwara Langar Sahib in Nanded. Health department officials said more than 2,000 pilgrims reached Punjab in private vehicles hired by Takht Hazur Sahib management. The others are coming in Punjab government-run buses which have specially sent to Nanded.HEALTH MINISTER PUTS BLAME ON MAHA GOVTPunjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu has blamed the Maharashtra government for not carrying out tests on pilgrims before sending them back to Punjab. “We conducted tests on people of other states stuck in Punjab before sending them back,” he said. He said the Maharashtra government also did not share the information on private vehicles being used by pilgrims to enter Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/government-caught-napping-as-nanded-pilgrims-jack-up-punjab-s-count/story-NZ3AbX9jQQtfoGXyJmagDL.html

The police said the man sustained at least three gunshot wounds and his condition is reported critical at a private hospital. The victim, identified as Nikhil Gupta, is a resident of Garhi Harsaru village in Sector 10. He has a flour mill business, the police said. According to the police, the incident took place around 1.15pm when Gupta got a phone call from two acquaintances, Sunil and Sonu, who asked him to come to Bamroli to collect Rs 50,000 which the duo had borrowed from the victim. The victim’s brother, Prince Gupta, said that his brother drove his scooter to Bamroli, about three kilometres from their house, to meet the suspects. “They shot him near a drain after refusing to return the loan money. He sustained gunshot wounds in his foot, stomach and left arm. After sustaining injuries, he made a phone call to my uncle informing him of the shooting. Within a few minutes, we reached the spot and found him lying in a pool of blood and rushed him to a private hospital near Rajiv Chowk,” said Prince.He added that on the way to the hospital, his brother had identified the shooters before falling unconscious. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, that the victim was later referred to another private hospital for treatment. “On the statement of his brother, we have registered a case and a probe has been initiated. Preliminary probe suggests enmity over a money dispute was the reason for the alleged shooting,” said the police official, adding that the suspects are at large. A case was registered against the suspects under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Sector 10A police station on Tuesday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/19-year-old-shot-at-over-financial-dispute-critical/story-xxw7p6DriU65HL9s1wwiLP.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Following MHA order, 200-odd migrants at shelter homes in Chandigarh, P’kula look forward to going back home||It has been a month since 500-odd migrant labourers walking back to their native places on foot, owing to the mass exodus amid the Covid-19 lockdown, were housed at shelters homes in Chandigarh and Panchkula.So far, 10 migrants from Chandigarh, and 336 from Panchkula, have gone back to their homes after authorities tied-up with their respective states. Currently, there are around 60 inmates putting up in Chandigarh and 120 in Panchkula.They have no complaints, but a unanimous request; for an arrangement to made so they can go back to their native places. A month after millions of people, mostly migrant workers were stranded without work in different parts of the country, the Union home ministry on Wednesday finally allowed states to repatriate them to their respective states.The only condition that the home ministry has imposed for such inter-state travel is that the government of states, from where these people begin the journey and the government in the destination state, should clear the trip.Panchkula deputy commissioner (DC) Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said the administration is working to get the remaining labourers back to their native places. “A meeting for this was held with officials concerned and we will soon initiate the next step of the process. I have come across recent orders from the MHA and will go through it with other officials. The administration will go as per guidelines issued by the central government and will take up the matter accordingly, on Thursday.” Hotam Singh, a 22 –year- old labour from Rajasthan, putting up at a Chandigarh shelter home, says he worked in Mullanpur, 35 km from the city, and was walking towards his native place on foot, before he was brought to the facility. “If I was at home, I could have earned for my family, instead of sitting here idle,” he adds. Another inmate, Manmohan Singh, whose family is in Badayun, Uttar Pradesh, says his wife and three-year-old child, are alone there. Even he wishes to reunite with his family.Also stuck with them, is 26- year -old Anita, who says her four children are alone in UP. “I am living here with one of my children. I cannot sleep thinking what my other kids are doing alone in UP. It’s a nightmare for me.” She adds.Most of them had no complaints about the arrangements. They get food, tea from time-to-time and have access to TV. They are visited regularly by a doctor and yoga instructor from a local varsity.Rajiv Tiwari, nodal officer of Chandigarh said, “The Chandigarh administration set-up a shelter home for stranded migrant labourers on March 29, and they have been looked after well since then. But now, they want to go back to their native places, especially after their stranded friends and relatives in Ambala were shifted to UP on Tuesday. We have 60 migrants staying at the shelter home here, 37 are from UP, seven from West Bengal, seven from Rajasthan and eight from Bihar.”“We have received updated guidelines from ministry of home affairs and the course of action will be decided after discussion with higher authorities,” he said.The UT administration had setup a facility to house 140 migrants following the Centre’s order. But, reported only 70.In Panchkula, 454 such persons were housed at 12 different shelter homes, of which 336 have been sent back by arranging buses to states including UP, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. Now, only 118 odd migrants are left, including 42 origami artists, natives of Badarpur in Delhi.Damodar, 58, says they were kept well. “But, in this scenario, I don’t want to live here,” he says.Duli Devi, 35, who is stuck here with five children, aired a similar sentiment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/following-mha-order-200-odd-migrants-at-shelter-homes-in-chandigarh-p-kula-look-forward-to-going-back-home/story-9c0hPdgwwRCc75HkW50RlJ.html

29-04-2020||Delhi||I didn’t want rumours to reach my family, says Delhi police constable after recovering||For ten days, 34-year-old Delhi Police constable Vikas Kumar Verma evaded questions about his health from his kin so that they did not worry about his well being in a city that is being ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic..On Monday, however, a Facebook post by Verma’s colleague welcoming him back to work, alerted his family. Soon after the social media post went up, he got a call from his wife and mother, who live in Kotputli, near Jaipur, Rajasthan. Verma took the call and said told them the truth.Verma was among the first three policemen to have contracted the virus and tested positive on April 17. He recalls how while performing duty in Central Delhi’s Chandni Mahal, he suddenly started feeling weak and then within hours had developed high fever. As a precaution, he got himself tested and was declared coronavirus positive on April 17. He said that everything happened so quickly, he didn’t get time to properly convey the news properly to his family. After the three policemen from Chandni Mahal tested positive, the police station was sealed with 26 policemen being asked to stay there in isolation. The remaining workforce were told to report to duty from Jama Masjid police station for some time.“My mother and grandmother live in a village in Rajasthan and aren’t very well educated.Because Covid-19 is a scare in villages, I didn’t want them to start worrying about me. Another major concern was that villagers and neighbours start reacting in unexpected ways. In villages coronavirus is not only a threat to life but also carries a stigma. They would tell my mother and grandmother things about the virus, which aren’t true. This would only give rise to rumour mongering and make them worry. I didn’t want them to be caught in such a situation,” Verma said.The day Verma’s test reports were out, he called up his younger brother, who also lives with the family and works with a private firm there, and told him everything. “Only he knew the truth. I had to confide in someone because the virus has so far claimed thousands of lives. At that time, I didn’t know if I will return alive. I had asked my brother to tell others in the family that I am just unwell and under observation, so that if something happened to me, they aren’t shocked all of a sudden. I felt bad, but at that time I thought that was the best I could tell them,” he said.On Monday, when Verma was discharged from the hospital after 10 days, he was welcomed back by his colleagues and senior officers with garland, flowers and music. Some of them posted pictures on social media and one such post on Facebook led Verma’s family to learn the truth.For past three years Verma had been living in the barracks of Chandni Mahal police station. After resuming duty, he has chosen to put up at a hotel in Karol Bagha.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said Verma will stay in the hotel and will join office on April 30. “There are 15-20 other policemen in that hotel, which we have hired to keep our men in isolation. Policemen who are active in the field and do not want to go home to prevent their families from getting the infection, are staying there. Verma is fit to join work and his condition is being monitored regularly,” Bhatia said.Verma, however, is not sure when will he be able to visit his family. The constable, who had joined the police force in 2015, is a father to four daughters, the youngest of whom is one-and-a-half-year-old.“For us, duty comes first. I was on duty when I fell sick. Now I have been discharged from the hospital and am ready to join work. In such times, I can’t ask for a holiday to go home. I have told my family that I am fine now and will be home once the crisis is over,” he said.Verma remembers how tiring his treatment was as he spent ten long days at in the hospital wondering if he will ever be able to meet his daughters again. “All i seemed to be doing there (at the hospital) was swallow tablets and getting tested. It wasn’t easy but i needed to be strong willed. When I came to know that I was Covid-19 positive, it scared me. But, I had to remain strong. I had heard that many people have even recovered and going for the treatment with a positive mind was the only option I had,” Verma said.Apart from Verma, more than 30 Delhi police personnel have so far tested positive for the virus in the city that so far has seen 3,439 cases in total with 56 deaths. Two more cops of Chandni Mahal police station recover, offer to donate plasmaTwo more constables from Chandni Mahal police station who were infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) recovered from the virus on Wednesday and returned from a private hospital, where they were under medical observation.Three constables of the police station have recovered from the virus, so far, while five others are still under medical observation at a central Delhi hospital. All three of them have offered to donate their plasma to help save lives of coronavirus infected, said deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia.DCP Bhatia said that the duo – constables Pushpendra Yadav and Indraj – were discharged from the hospital after their two tests came negative, The Chandi Mahal police station, which was sealed since eight personnel were tested positive for the virus, will be de-sealed on Thursday, he said.“Twenty-six personnel of the police station, including the station house officer (SHO), will resume their duty on Thursday, as they have completed their 14-day quarantine period and will be discharged. We will welcome them at the police station,” added the DCP.DCP Bhatia said that Pushpendra and Indraj were the first two constables who were tested positive from the police station. Thereafter, 32 staffers were sent in self-quarantine to avoid the spread of the virus. Another six of them were later found positive and admitted to different hospitals and quarantine centres. Among them, Constable Vikas, was the first who recovered from the virus on Monday.“Like Vikas, Pushpendra and Indraj also want to join duty. But we have presently shifted them to a guest house in Karol Bagh where they will spend two more days to ensure they do not suffer a relapse,” Bhatia said.As on date, 32 personnel from the city police have tested positive for the Covid-19, of which 14 are from central district’s Chandni Mahal, Nabi Karim and Jama Masjid police station. Another six personnel were from the Jahangirpuri police station. A total of four personnel are now recovered.

The administration has issued an email ID at which the details of such students can be sent.“Gurugram has a large number of such students. To help them, we have issued the email ID – covid19gurugram@gmail.com. Parents will have to mail basic details mentioning ‘overseas support’ in the subject line. A form will be sent to them which has to be filled up with details of their kids who want to come back,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner.The state government has initiated the process of collecting details of such students with the help of the central government. “Many parents were approaching the senior authorities at the state-level. Taking cognizance, the state government is collecting the data of such students which will be shared with the central government for bringing them back,” a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ggm-admin-seeks-details-of-indian-students-stranded-abroad-to-bring-them-back/story-pu5s72zCt7qgZY1UtFdnuM.html

Complaints of cyber bullying have increased by 19 per cent compared to the period between February 23 and March 24.and women have been complaining of vulgarity, stalking and misbehaviour on cyberspace during the past one month, as per the data of Women Power Line (WPL)-1090.The WPL which is a dedicated centre for women in distress was launched in November 2012 and specifically deals with complaints related to stalking on phone, social media platforms and other issues with which women require help.Additional director general (ADG), WPL, Anju Gupta said that as many as 2,61,000 calls were received between March 25 and April 24 of which 2,59,800 were related to women related crimes while 1200 complaints were related to problems during the lockdown. Around 2,18,000 calls were related to vulgarity, stalking and misbehaviour on phone and social media platforms before the lockdown between February 23 and March 24, she added.The comparison shows that at least 41,800 more complaints related to misbehaviour, vulgarity and stalking were received during the lockdown period that stands for around 19.17 per cent of the calls between February 23 and March 24. However, the complaints of stalking and misbehaviour on streets have declined drastically due to restricted public movement.The ADG, however, emphasised that the team of counsellors was busy warning troublemakers on phone and tracking people causing trouble for the fair sex on social media platforms.Gupta said the WPL had also received multiple complaints about domestic disputes during the lockdown period since April 7 following which a separate team of counsellors was set up to handle these cases. She said the WPL team had counselled and sorted out disputes in over 200 such complaints in the past few weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/despite-lockdown-no-let-up-in-vulgarity-and-stalking-on-social-media/story-B8bRnM7a80YMAmW9DcNP1J.html
29-04-2020||Gurugram||70% govt school students accessing lessons on WhatsApp||Around 70% of government school students from classes 2 to 12 in the district have connected via Whatsapp as part of the ‘Ghar se Padhao’ online learning campaign, according to a state government report. The ‘Ghar se Padhao’ campaign was launched on April 14 to ensure that teachers remain in regular contact with parents and students through WhatsApp during the countrywide lockdown imposed from March 25 to contain Covid-19. While teachers share academic videos and worksheets, students are required to maintain a dedicated notebook to record their work. The findings were based on data recorded through Google Form responses, where in respondents could send feedback over the programme. Out of the 117,731 students in the district that fall under the category, 82,060 had connected via WhatsApp.The remaining students have struggled to stay in tune with the rest of the class on WhatsApp due to accessibility and connectivity issues. Teachers and students said that while some couldn’t afford a smartphone, others were unable to get it recharged.As per the report, around 2,106 teachers out of a total of 3502 are registering participation of students in Gurugram. They were reporting detailed action/activities-undertaken during the lockdown. District education officer Indu Boken said, “We created five Google Forms which are sent out daily (to WhatsApp groups), and collated.” She said that students in remote locations were attending classes which implied that lessons were reaching students in most areas.School principals said that while teachers were sharing study material and assignments regularly via WhatsApp, the medium had its limitations, and they couldn’t accurately ascertain the engagement levels of students. “While some students are taking the lessons seriously, asking questions and responding, there are some who need to be prodded for submission of work,” said Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, Urban Estate.Sharma said that some students had been unable to catch up due to the unavailability of smartphones. “Most of these children come from backgrounds where parents have a simple phone for the purpose of making calls. Some of them even borrow phones from their neighbours to access assignments, but they fail to respond actively due to the hassle of borrowing the phone time and again,” said Sharma.She, however, added that more and more students were gradually understanding the gravity of the current situation, and trying to connect via WhatsApp. “We are noticing an improvement in engagement levels as children become aware of online classes. Parents have also reached out with doubts regarding online classes,” said Sharma.For students who can’t access WhatsApp, the state education department has initiated the transmission of lessons via NCERT’s Swayamprabha channel and three Haryana EDUSAT channels which are being aired on cable TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/70-govt-school-students-accessing-lessons-on-whatsapp/story-7B6uZkY3Gc6D8A4TmWKxYM.html

The toll plaza is fumigated every day and the booth operators have been told to follow safe distancing norms while interacting with commuters.Commuters passing through the toll plaza cannot pay the booth operators directly anymore. They place the cash in a plastic tray placed for the purpose. At present, six canopy lanes are operational at the toll plaza.The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) had shut all toll plazas in the country from March 25 to April 19, following which it opened up with relaxations issued by the Centre.Anish John, systems manager, Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the concessionaire, said, “With the outbreak of coronavirus disease, toll operators are afraid to take cash from commuters. We have devised a plan where the toll booth operators hand over a small plastic tray from inside their booth to the commuter sitting inside the car.”The booth operators have been trained to use tongs to pick up the bills from the tray. “After the cash is picked up from the tray, all notes are held in front of a heat blower for a minute and only then kept inside the cash register,” said John.Officials of the toll plaza are disinfecting the cash bags daily. The project head of Kherki Daula toll plaza, Rajendera Bhati, said, “We are spraying steam with the help of an iron inside the cash bags so that they are disinfected.”The toll officials also said that everyone entering the toll plaza office at Kherki Daula is being checked with infrared thermometers.“When we restarted toll operations on April 20, all toll booth operators were given masks, gloves, caps and we have trained them to remain at a safe distance from commuters. We are disinfecting the entire toll plaza every single day, including every toll booth and the operators too,” said Bhati.Toll officials said that about 20 toll booth operators are working presently in three shifts.As per the data released by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for April 27, FASTag traffic amounted to 32% whereas commuters paying through cash was 25%, electronic payment amounted to 0.6%, while 31% were emergency exempted vehicles while 12% were exempted vehicles of villagers in the vicinity.MCEPL officials said that during the lockdown, the sale of FASTags at the toll plaza has come down to zero. “With lockdown in place, the sale of FASTag has come down considerably at the toll plaza. There are no bank officials who are selling FASTags anymore,” said John.On April 18, the NHAI had come out with operating procedures and guidelines for protecting workers at toll plazas. The NHAI has instructed toll officials to use their own transport. “Wherever possible workers should travel to the toll plaza alone using their own transport. Parking arrangements for additional cars should be made (sic),” read the guidelines.The highways authority has instructed that all non-essential visitors should be stopped. Not only this, but the guidelines also say that there should be a restriction on the number of people using toilet facilities one at a time. “All manpower on the toll plaza shall use masks/gloves and goggles for their own protection. Mass sanitisation of toll plaza through spray may be done at regular intervals (sic),” read the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/using-tongs-toll-operators-blow-dry-notes-before-placing-them-in-registers/story-1QNVO4On0nio1Z8KBrF2lI.html

The move had drawn criticism from city residents who raised complaints with the department demanding revision and relaxation in due date due to the lockdown.Sunil Yadav, Palam Vihar resident, said, “I got a bill of only Rs 3000 of two months February and March. I knew it was wrong because my average bill of two months comes to around to Rs 15000. Also, the department sent us bill on WhatsApp and many people received wrong bills. We lodged complaints with the department requesting to correct the bills and extend the due date. During this lockdown, it is not possible for us visit the office and deposit the bill by cheque, as we normally do.”The notification said that the consumers will not have to pay late fine and surcharge for the one month extension extended period.“This relaxation is being given in light of lockdown put in place to contain Covid-19. Also, our men have been restricted from visiting every consumer and taking actual metre reading of two months. The virus outbreak started showing in mid March itself and almost restrictions in office and public movements were restricted from March 21 only.

Another person who tested positive is a general duty assistant (transport) at Medanta Hospital. The Medanta employee is a resident of Islampur village. Over 100-150 samples will be collected from people who came in contact with the nurses,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer.All three patients are admitted at the ESIC hospital, a declared Covid-19 hospital in Gurugram, officials said, adding that a total of 11 health care workers have tested positive for the deadly virus in the district so far.Om Nagar was declared one of the 24 containment zones in the district after it reported a Covid-19 case earlier. Islampur, on the other hand, shares proximity with Jharsa, which is also a declared containment zone. Meanwhile, Sector 9 has been removed from the containment zone list after no case was reported for two weeks following the first case. Till now, eight positive cases involving nurses and medical staff have been reported in Medanta Hospital. It includes a 21-year-old nurse who had tested Covid-19 positive in Panipat in the first week of April. A few days later, two other nurses were confirmed coronavirus positive, and earlier this week four health workers, including three nurses and one male staff who transported patients, were infected.On Wednesday, Medanta hospital collected samples of all its health staff from Covid-19 ward and did random sampling of nurses and medical staff deployed in other wards. According to doctors, cases that have been confirmed Covid-19 positive were from other wards instead of Covid-19 ward. On Wednesday, the health department collected more than 243 samples from different containment zones. Of 54 Covid-19 positive cases in Gurugram, 38 are discharged and 16 are undergoing treatment. At least 96 people are under surveillance at the quarantine facility. A health team will collect samples of journalists for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests at Civil Hospital from Thursday onwards, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-health-workers-test-covid-19-positive/story-JQcBjYAqOJFmDv3toFJrbK.html
29-04-2020||Gurugram||Resuming work during lockdown: Work environment, conditions witness sea change||Industrial units in Manesar which have been allowed to resume operations amid the lockdown are tweaking their seating plans, introducing staggered timing for workers and installing sanitation amenities, among a slew of other strict measures the district administration has ordered to prevent the spread of Covid-19 as the district, and the country, tries to maintain the supply chain and restart its economy. While agreeing that the introduction of these measures is essential, industry owners warned that they would also reduce their output as fewer workers would occupy the space available. At MM Creations in Manesar, 40-odd workers occupy the shop floor where 300 men worked till last week of March. They now wear masks at all times and are seated around five to six feet from each other in a large room, where the supervisor keeps a check on their movements. Wednesday was their second day of work in the factory, which had been closed for over a month and the change in work environment has left them all unnerved. As soon as the workers enter the unit they sanitize their hands, their body temperature is checked with a non-contact thermometer and then they wash their hands at the newly installed washbasin. “These measures are tough to implement and will definitely cause loss of productivity, but these are desperate times,” said Manmohan Gaind, CEO of MM Creations, which makes couture clothing and home furnishings. The more pressing worry for industry owners was space optimization, Gaind said. At V&M Industries, which makes and exports leather goods, the owners are trying to ensure that all steps are taken to keep production compatible with norms of physical distancing. Its three floors now have all of 50 workers as opposed to 250-300 workers earlier. The entry gates are marked with strips of yellow tapes pasted six feet apart to ensure workers don’t huddle while entering, no-contact thermometres have been placed, and instruction charts and posters pasted on the wall as constant reminders. “We are training two HR employees so they can give daily live demonstrations to workers to follow the norms. Audio recordings on precautions are being created and this shall be broadcast after every two-three hours,” said Suman Chawla, owner of the firm.A large hall in the factory has also been turned into a dormitory for 25 workers, whose meals have also been taken care of, she said, adding that as and when more workers come back their living arrangements would be made. The industrialists grudgingly admit that though implementing the safeguards came at great cost, they were better than risking the spread of Sars-Cov-2. “We are disinfecting the factory, entry and exits, masks and sanitizers are being issued, but the most difficult thing is maintaining the correct physical distance while working on machines. Sometime people pass by each other and it is difficult to remain six feet apart,” said Pradeep Kumar, owner of Gaps enterprises based in Udyog Vihar. The workers, who are new to this environment, are also unnerved by the change in work culture but said they would adapt as there was no alternative.Ramesh Kumar, an industrial worker who lives in nearby Kasan village, said that working in such a strict environment was difficult but there was no option. “We have to earn a livelihood and keep ourselves safe from the coronavirus. Last few weeks have been quite difficult, so we want to work and all of us will remain disciplined despite the discomfort,” he said.Auto major Maruti has also introduced similar measures at its plant in Udyog Vihar, where the company has been permitted to make PPEs, ventilators and other equipment. Kuldeep Janghu, president of Maruti Suzuki Kamgar Union, said workers’ body temperature is checked when they enter the factory, they wash their hands, wear masks and undergo other safety checks to ensure there is no spread of Covid-19.“We are aligned with government of India’s directives to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and are working towards the safety and well-being of our employees and communities around our manufacturing units. Our teams are coming up with ways to ensure proper social distancing and hygiene are maintained whenever we resume production,” a company spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/resuming-work-during-lockdown-work-environment-conditions-witness-sea-change/story-5SX0DM8lY3GELeCuYwci2N.html
29-04-2020||City||Uttar Pradesh to add 52,000 bed in Covid hospitals; three more test positive in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad on Wednesday recorded three more Covid-19 positive cases — two from Vaishali Sector 5 and one from Dasna — taking the total number of cases in the district to 63. Officials on Wednesday also said that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had ordered the setting up of an additional 52,000 beds at Covid hospitals across the state.“This will include total of 30,000 beds at L1 category hospitals, 15,000 in L2 category hospitals and 7,000 in L3 category hospitals,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).Till date, Uttar Pradesh has a total of 155 Covid L1 category hospitals, 78 L2 hospitals and six L3 category hospitals to deal exclusively with Covid cases.Recently, the CM had also given directions for creation of 20,000 additional quarantine beds in each district.“We already have about 1,450 quarantine beds with about 650 persons admitted. We have also received directions that from now on only the close contacts of Covid-19 positive patients will be admitted in quarantine. We have many colleges in Ghaziabad and these can be acquired as quarantine centres,”said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO)..“As of now we have only 106 beds in L1 category Covid hospitals and 370 more have been identified at four locations. The Sanjay Nagar hospital is L2 category and has 100 beds available, which are vacant at present. We can also add 20 more at Sanjay Nagar. Besides this, we have 200 more beds identified for L2 hospital and these can immediately be converted when the need arises,” he added.Meanwhile, Gupta said that thirteen patients admitted to the Covid hospital in Muradnagar will be discharged on Wednesday.“Of the people who tested positive on Wednesday, two cases are from Vaishali Sector-5. One of them had undergone an operation at a private hospital in March and had later sought treatment at another private hospital in Tuesday. His test report came positive on Wednesday. He has been shifted to L3 facility in Meerut,” said Gupta.According to officials, the prime localities of Indirapuram-Vaishali have number of Covid-19 positive cases emerging and most of these are related to medically acquired infection.“The second positive patient is from Vaishali sector-5 and had gone to a private hospital in East Delhi on Tuesday. His test reports found him positive for Covid-19. He has been shifted to ESI Hospital in Sahibabad. There were reports that a sub-inspector of Delhi police was also infected. Our teams are trying to trace him in Vaishali. We have come to know that he is admitted in Delhi and confirmation regarding the same is awaited. There is information of one more case from Garhi area, but that is yet to be verified,” Dr Gupta added.He said that the third positive case on Wednesday was of a 25 year old woman from Dasna who had gone to Meerut for delivery and later tested positive. According to officials, 13 test reports of patients were also received on Wednesday and they are likely to get discharged from Covid L1 category hospital at Muradnagar on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uttar-pradesh-to-add-52-000-bed-in-covid-hospitals-three-more-test-positive-in-ghaziabad/story-XzEaXbJLjPFuVAIAzlXFuI.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Tally may cross 200 in Chandigarh: UT adviser||UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, on Wednesday, in a tweet, predicted that the city’s Covid tally may cross the 200 mark. Later, talking to Hindustan Times, Parida clarified that it was a rough estimate.Parida tweeted, “Our assessment says we may cross 200.” When asked about the time frame in which the case may go up to 200, Parida said it cannot be estimated as of now, and the number may increase or decrease.In the last five days, the city has seen a spike of 40 new cases taking the total number to 68.The administration’s main concern is that most cases are coming from congested and densely populated areas including Sector 30 and Bapu Dham. 23 cases have been reported in Bapu Dham alone in the last five days, as social distancing has been flouted in such areas. Significantly, the first man to report positive in the colony had thrown a party and police has booked him for violating the curfew restrictions.In the daily review meeting, Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore expressed serious concern about the continuously rising corona cases in the city. Badnore has asked for intensive screening and testing to be done in affected pockets such as Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 30-B and Kachi Colony. He said all resources and manpower should be concentrated on this while maintaining a strict vigil.Badnore also directed director general of police Sanjay Beniwal to regularly patrol all the areas and take stringent action against those found violating norms.On Wednesday, the administration installed 14 CCTV cameras in Bapu Dham Colony and 26 CCTV cameras in Sector 30-B to monitor violation of social distancing.Parida said affected zones in Bapu Dham Colony will be expanded to include 2,500 more people to contain corona more effectively. Badnore stated that although the Punjab Government has extended the curfew by two weeks Chandigarh will take a decision on May 3, only after consulting all stakeholders and keeping in view guidelines of Government of India on this subject.Enthused city residents are flooding the twitter handle of UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida with requests for delivery of cakes to their relatives or friends’ homes on their birthdays. This comes a day after a video went viral showing Panchkula police delivering a cake to a senior citizen on his birthday.Parida tweeted, “They want me to send police with cakes to their friends for birthdays” and “I plan to block my direct message facility (on Twitter) since I am getting too many such requests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tally-may-cross-200-in-chandigarh-ut-adviser/story-FlNZGyYmHlpsOvwocRHrQI.html
29-04-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Four workers booked for ‘stocking extra ration’, no seizure so far||Four workers were booked by the Link Road police on a complaint by the Ghaziabad district administration on Tuesday, alleging that they allegedly demanded ration “repeatedly” and told fellow workers about helpline numbers so that they too could get extra ration in this manner. No raids, however, have been conducted nor any extra ration have been seized so far. The complaint was filed by Surendra Singh, who is a Lekhpal.The four were identified as Chandrabhan, Ajay Kumar, Satish Kumar and Rajvansh Kumar. They were booked under Indian Penal Code Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant).HT on Wednesday spoke to Ajay, Satish and Rajvansh. Although according to the police all four are residents of Kadkad Model village in Sahibabad, Ajay claimed he lives in Ghaziabad’s Budh Bazar, Khoda.Ajay said he lives in a rented accommodation and had procured ration from the Khoda Nagar Palika only once, five days ago.“They gave me five kilogram (kg) flour, one kg sugar, one kg pulses and half a litre of oil. This is sufficient for me for about 10-15 days. Why would I demand more rations when I already have some? This is the first time that I procured food items through the government’s help. Even my landlord here is very helpful and has been supporting me. I have no links with anyone from Kadkad Model village and used to work at a stitching unit in Noida’s Sector-65,” said Ajay, who is from Bihar.None of the three HT spoke to said they were aware of the FIR lodged against them and denied they stocked any excess rations in their homes. They also said no raid had been conducted by administration officials or police. Meanwhile, when asked, neither the district administration nor the police said there had been any seizure of extra rations from the homes of any of the workers.A detailed query was sent to district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey for remarks over the issue but there was no response till late Wednesday.“I don’t know about others and have no links with them,” said Satish who is from Bhagalpur in Bihar and worked at a construction site in Ghaziabad.Another suspect, Rajvansh, has been trying to support his three children and wife while the family is staying in Kadkad Model during the lockdown.“Four days ago, I received the ration items from Vasundhara and a day later, cops came and inquired whether I received the ration or not. I told them that I had received them and they noted my details and went away. I have called the helpline to get rations only once. Why would I call them time and again,” Rajvansh said.Lekhpal Singh, the complainant, meanwhile, alleged that the four were booked as they had allegedly procured rations time and again.“All four of them are from Kadkad Model village and are stocking ration at their houses. They are also telling others to get rations in such a manner. Normally, a family is given rations in about 15-16 days. I cannot say anything about the seizure of extra food items as that is the police’s job. These people are taking away rations every three days,” he added.Pravardhan Sharma, his senior officer and the Tehsildar of Ghaziabad (sadar) area, said that there have been inputs that people have been stocking ration and even selling it to buy liquor and tobacco items such as Gutkha.“There have been complaints to us by NGOs, too. This is the input we have: Such people are violating lockdown norms and not maintaining social distancing. I cannot provide any details about seizure of any extra items from their houses. It is a matter of investigation and we cannot disclose it,” he said, while denying that the complaint was based on any finding.Rakesh Mishra, circle officer of Sahibabad, on the other hand said that the complaint was given by the Lekhpal and he, along with other officials, had gone to Kadkad Model village.“The seizure, etc., will be a part of the investigation but four persons have been booked upon the complaint which is for stocking and demanding extra ration. The investigation in the case will be free and fair,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-four-workers-booked-for-stocking-extra-ration-no-seizure-so-far/story-PHyf7QzT4GiyPrUitA710L.html
29-04-2020||City||Two pvt hospitals get ICMR nod to conduct Covid-19 tests in GB Nagar||Noida: Amid the rising Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given permission to two private hospitals -- Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida and Jaypee Hospital in Noida -- to conduct Covid-19 tests. It will provide some relief to the health department as the district has been facing a lot of troubles in getting sample reports of Covid-19 cases. Currently, the district has only two full-fledged Covid-19 labs -- one at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences​ (GIMS) and the other at National Institute of Biologicals (NIB).While the lab at Sharda Hospital is ready to function from Thursday, Jaypee Hospital will take another 12 days to set up its lab, authorities from the two hospitals said.“We have got the orders to start conducting Covid-19 tests and we have placed our requirement of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits. It is going to take a few days to start the lab. We will be able to test up to 30 samples per day,” said Dr Suryasnata Das, associate director, department of lab medicine and microbiology, Jaypee Hospital.Both the hospitals were opted by the district health department to function as Covid-19 centres also. “Our lab is ready to start conducting Covid-19 tests. We are in the process of finalizing the price of the test. The price will be fixed as per the orders of the state government,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, joint registrar and media spokesperson, Sharda University, Greater Noida.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said that the Covid-19 tests will be conducted for Rs 2,500 in the state, but some diagnostic centres, which are collecting home samples of Covid-19 suspects, are still charging Rs 4,500 for the test. “We have stopped doing Covid-19 tests as the costing is much more than Rs 2,500. We are only doing home collection of Covid-19 suspects,” said a receptionist of a private diagnostic centre in Noida.When asked about the issue, Dr Deepak Ohri, Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), said he will ensure that no testing centres charge more than Rs 2,500 in the district. “I will look into the matter. Required action will be taken against those who are not charging as per the directions of the state government,” said Ohri.Recently, four patients from the Sharda Hospital got themselves shifted to a private hospital in Delhi after their reports to confirm them negative got delayed for days. The hospital staff have also been facing troubles in handling Covid-19 patients and suspects as they start panicking when their reports are delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-pvt-hospitals-get-icmr-nod-to-conduct-covid-19-tests-in-gb-nagar/story-z3Aff9FCrlha8Sd5pps2qI.html
29-04-2020||City||Patients kept waiting, some given preferential treatment at Covid-19 sampling centre||Inaugurated with much fanfare earlier in April, the Covid-19 testing centre at Sanjay Nagar Hospital has not turned out to be the succour it was promised to be. Patients said they were kept waiting for hours before the staff arrived and many of them complained that a few persons, who appeared to have been recommended by unidentified officials, were given preference in the queue.“I was waiting for testing my 46-year-old brother, who was complaining of cough for the past few days. We arrived at the sampling centre at 8am Wednesday but were kept waiting for hours. When the staff finally arrived at noon, they told us that they will initially test four to five persons recommended by some officials. So all other patients were again made to wait for hours while the four to five persons got tested ahead of others,” Ajeet Chauhan, a resident of Bhood Bharat Nagar near Vijay Nagar, said.Another resident Sachin Kumar had come around 9am with his 76-year-old father from Bajaria.“We kept waiting and my father also had bouts of breathlessness as he is a heart patient. Initially, we were told by a person at the sampling centre that the staff will come by 11pm. But no one arrived. They came only by noon. My father’s Covid-19 test is required as we went to a hospital and doctors told us that we will have to get him tested for Covid-19 first,” Kumar said.Another woman from Nandgram said the gloves used at the sampling centre were unclean and could pose a risk to those giving their samples.“I came here at 11am and no health care staff member was present. Since I am a media person, I tried calling up the chief medical officer but he did not take calls and disconnected my call. It is a sad state of affairs as patients were waiting since morning and no one was attending to them,” she said, requesting that she not be named. The sampling centre has also come under fire from health care professionals. Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of the Women Hospital, said the reports of a 25-year-old woman who delivered a child on April 25 is still awaited.“Initially, we had no PPE kits to get the delivery of the woman done and we had to use kits meant for use for HIV patients. Her sampling was also done but she is still in isolation at our hospital and breastfeeding her child. Her reports are yet to arrive. In case she turns out to be positive, her baby is also at risk of getting infected. Further, the sampling of our 50 nurses and staff was also done after this centre got inaugurated on April 7,” Dr Tyagi said.“My staff are yet to get their reports. We have received 50 PPE kits for carrying out deliveries. But the stock will soon be exhausted as 12-15 deliveries are happening each day,” she said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not revert to detailed queries sent to him over the issue.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said, “We will inquire about the issues at the sampling centre. Patients should come for testing between 11am and 4pm. The reports of the Women Hospital staff will also be made available to them soon and other test reports that are pending will be expedited. There has been some delay in getting reports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patients-kept-waiting-some-given-preferential-treatment-at-covid-19-sampling-centre/story-RwAOAcDe4djaJduHBrTBDM.html
29-04-2020||Jaipur||Liquor prices to go up by 10% as Rajasthan hikes excise duty||Tipplers in Rajasthan may have to shell more to enjoy their drinks as the Rajasthan government increased excise duty on Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and basic license fee on country liquor on Wednesday. The bottling fee has also been increased a little. The government is likely to make approximately Rs 800 crore from the change, said officials.According to the Rajasthan Excise (Second Amendment) Rules, 2020, notified on Wednesday, the additional fee to bottle IMFL having ex-distillery price (EDP) below Rs 900 will be Rs 5.50 per bulk litre. For IMFL which has EDP of Rs 900 or above, the fee will be Rs 11 per bulk litre. The notification also increased the basic license fee for sale of country liquor from Rs 10 to Rs 20 for one bulk litre.In another development, the department amended notification of 1997 to the Rajasthan Excise Act, 1950, to increase additional fee. This has been increased from 25% to 35% for IMFL with EDP below Rs 900, and from 35% to 45% for IMFL with EDP of Rs 900 or above.The additional excise duty on beer has also been increased from 35% to 45% of sum of ex-manufacturing unit price, CST and Export Fee, excise duty and actual cost reimbursed by the Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation Limited.Onkarmal Rajotiya, joint secretary (excise), who signed both the notifications, said the changes are likely to increase the MRP of IMFL and beer by 10-12% and that of country liquor by Rs 2-3.“All MRPs will be revised. Lower slabs will be mild but upper slabs will be little more expensive,” said excise commissioner Bishnu Charan Mallick.Rajasthan annual excise revenue target is about Rs 15,000 crore; Rs 12,500 from excise and Rs 3000 from sales tax. There is a 70% shortfall in tax revenue in April, the first month of the 2020-21 financial year because of the lockdown to contain coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The state reported 74 new cases on Wednesday, taking the tally to 2,438. There have been 55 Covid-19 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/liquor-prices-to-go-up-by-10-as-rajasthan-hikes-excise-duty/story-FkEa6yXYCxdsZYWscW37jM.html
29-04-2020||Jaipur||70% revenue shortfall in Rajasthan, finances in bad shape||The revenue collection in Rajasthan in the first month of the 2020-21 fiscal has fallen by 70% as on Wednesday even as it fights the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, said officials of the state finance department. There was a shortfall of Rs 18,000 in revenue in the last fiscal, 2019-20, they added.“We set out for Rs 8,400 crore in April and have been able to achieve only Rs 1800 crore. In March also, there was a shortfall of Rs 3,500 crore. This has put us in a fiscal crisis to tide over which the chief minister, who is also the finance minister, has requested the Centre for a package,” said Niranjan Arya, additional chief secretary of finance, taxation and excise department.The state targeted to earn Rs ,6800 crore through tax and GST compensation, and Rs 1,600 crore of non-tax revenue, which is primarily royalty from mining and petroleum activities.Rajasthan has allocated around Rs 1,200 crore on Covid-19 related expenses, including that on providing free PDS wheat to beneficiaries of National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Centre had recently given Rs 500 crore as GST compensation for January, while Rs 2,482 crore for February and March is pending, said another official of the department, who requested anonymity. The Centre compensates states for GST shortfall every two months.The biggest drop in tax revenue was seen in stamps and registration and vehicle tax because there was virtually no sale of property and vehicles, he added. The target for stamps and registration for April 2020 was Rs 466 crore; the state got only Rs 6 crore. Similarly, for vehicle tax, the target was Rs 500 crore, and the state has managed to collect only Rs 8 crore, which is a little more than 1 per cent.Arya said the state entered into a new financial year with a shortfall of Rs 18,000 because of a general slowdown of economy. “Loss of 70 per cent of April revenue will bleed our coffers,” he added.The state government deferred a part of salaries of legislators and its employees, including the all-India services officers, such as IAS and IPS, in March. Seventy-five per cent salary of legislators, 50 per cent salary of AIS officer and 30 per cent of state administrative officers was deferred. Five days of salary was deducted as donation to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for Covid-19. As the date for disbursement of April salary nears, the finance department is staring at a crisis.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has demanded from Centre a stimulus of Rs 1,00,000 crore for the state. This can be distributed to the state according to the states’ share in central taxes. Gehlot has also requested for raising the limit of borrowing from open market, which is currently 3 per cent of the state GDP for Rajasthan; the CM wants this to be raised to 5 per cent.Arya said the state’s GDP is around Rs 11,00,000 crore. The 2 per cent raise will enable the state to borrow around Rs 20,000 more from open market. He said the CM has also requested for a raise in the wage and means allowance advance from Reserve Bank of India (RBI).To tide over the fiscal crisis, chief minister Gehlot has sought a moratorium of six months on repayment to RBI and other financial institutions. Another demand of the state government from Centre is compensation of GST until 2027; currently, the GST is to be compensated to states until 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/70-revenue-shortfall-in-rajasthan-finances-in-bad-shape/story-Dcxjl4LmFJSKZ1nn1628fJ.html
29-04-2020||Delhi||Sharjeel Imam booked under stringent UAPA||Delhi Police Wednesday booked Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to incite communal riots outside Jamia Millia Islamia campus last December. He has already been arrested in this case and is in custody.On April 18, a charge sheet was filed against Imam charging him with instigating riots and delivering seditious speech outside the university campus during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act is aimed at effective prevention of unlawful activities and associations in the country. A person charged under the law can be jailed for up to seven years.Delhi police spokesperson Anil Mittal confirmed that UAPA was added Wednesday to the case against Imam, in which he is already booked.Imam was arrested from Bihar’s Jehanabad on January 28, by the Delhi Police for a speech he had delivered on December 13, two days after which protesters, who had gathered outside Jamia Millia Islamia campus, clashed with police during a march against the amended citizenship law.Imam’s counsel Ahmad Ibrahim said they will take appropriate legal action in the matter soon. “The police has added UAPA provisions on the 88th day [of arrest] with the intention of keeping him jail for a longer time. We will challenge this in the appropriate manner,” he said.At least four buses were torched, over 100 two-wheelers and vehicles damaged and more than 100 persons injured in the violence.Last Sunday, Delhi Police had also arrested president of Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia, Shifa-Ur-Rehman, under UAPA for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to incite communal riots in northeast Delhi in February. Four days before that, the police booked suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain under UAPA. Hussain is already in jail in connection with communal violence and murder of an Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer. The same week, police also arrested Jamia Millia Islamia students Meeran Haider and Safoora Zagar under the UAPA. They were also accused of allegedly hatching a conspiracy to incite communal riots. While Zargar is the media coordinator of Jamia Coordination Committee, Haider is a member of the committee.Earlier this month, a 20-member group of scholars, filmmakers, advocates and writers, who said they have launched a campaign against the witch-hunt of anti-CAA activists, released a statement saying that instead of engaging with protesters, the state has chosen to detain and arrest them under harsh penal provisions. They also said while the crime branch is already probing the case of the riots in north-east Delhi, the Delhi Police’s special cell had filed a separate FIR under which the scholars were being arrested. “This FIR has enabled the stitching together of a political narrative where a direct link is sought to be made between anti-CAA protests and the widespread violence that rocked north-east Delhi in the end of February,” reads the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sharjeel-imam-booked-under-stringent-uapa/story-fdpJMsFdcXG8yZrkLdtmeL.html
29-04-2020||City||Ulhasnagar records first Covid death||An 87-year-old woman, who was a Covid-19 patient, died in a private hospital on Monday. Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) said this was the first coronavirus death in the city.“The woman was admitted to a private hospital. Her swab was collected by the hospital and the report came after her death. This is the first Covid death in the UMC,” said Raja Rijhwani, medical officer, UMC. In Kalyan-Dombivli, 13 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Wednesday, taking the total count to 156. The civic body said most of the cases reported in the past five days are of essential services workers who travelled to Mumbai for work. Out of the 13 cases on Wednesday, eight are of those who regularly travel to Mumbai and got infected there.

29-04-2020||City||4 lakh intoxicating pills smuggled from Delhi in parcel train seized in Amritsar||Police on Wednesday seized 4 lakh intoxicating pills that were smuggled from Delhi in a special parcel train.According to the commissionerate police, these pills were smuggled in the guise of essential commodities on April 26. After being unloaded from the goods train at the Amritsar railway station, the contraband was sent to a private godown situated at Bhagtanwala area here. The pills were seized by the police following a tip-off. However, the accused who had ordered for the contraband are absconding.Police said they have identified two accused in this connection -- Naval Sood of Dhariwal village in Gurdaspur district and Mukesh Yadav of Amritsar. Sood, who runs a chemist shop in Gurdaspur, had ordered the consignment. Due to enforcement of the nationwide lockdown, Indian railways run 134 special parcel trains on 67 routes to ensure the supply of essential commodities.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP-investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar said, “A police team, led by crime investigation agency (CIA) wing in-charge Sukhwinder Singh Randhawa, raided Golden Deep Enterprises godown at Bhagtanwala. They recovered 4 lakh pills of tramadol (a banned drug) from eight cartons.”He said the police have also identified the locations in Delhi from where the drugs were dispatched. “A team is being sent to Delhi to unearth the racket. Another team is conducting raids to arrest the accused who placed the order,” he said. He said the preliminary investigation has suggested that as the supply chain of drugs has been cut off due to the lockdown, these pills were to be sold at exorbitant rates in various villages of Majha region. The accused have been booked under the various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-lakh-intoxicating-pills-smuggled-from-delhi-in-parcel-train-seized-in-amritsar/story-p5om0HFd2bNYRWWXBUHQJL.html
29-04-2020||Kolkata||Mamata hints at continuing with Covid-19 restrictions in West Bengal||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday hinted that the ongoing lockdown would continue in the state, saying experts and doctors are of the opinion that the restrictions imposed to check the spread of Covid-19 should remain in force till the end of May.She, however, announced a few relaxations, in accordance with the orders of the central government, such as opening stand-alone shops dealing in non-essential items and resuming bus and taxi services in green zones, following all precautionary and social distancing measures.Banerjee also said her government has made arrangements to bring back 2,500-3,000 students hailing from the state who are stranded in the coaching hub of Kota in Rajasthan and they are likely to reach in three days.She added the students boarded buses for West Bengal this evening.“Nobody can say when this crisis will end. Most of the countries have already announced the lockdown till the end of May and the first week of June. Our experts and doctors believe that the restrictions regarding Covid-19 should continue till the end of May,” she said.The graph of infection might go down after that but it might again show an upward trend during the rainy season in July and August, she said.“We had announced the lockdown before the Centre did it. Till now the situation has not improved, so it is not possible to revert everything to normal. So, for a few more days, we have to follow the restrictions and continue with the lockdown. It may be 100 per cent in some areas or partial in other areas. My appeal to all of you not to venture out of their homes now,” she said.Banerjee announced the lockdown in the state from March 23 evening. Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed it across the country from March 25 to break the chain of coronavirus transmission and it was scheduled to be lifted on April 15. The 21-day measure was later extended for 19 more days till May 3.The chief minister said that from May 4, restrictions will be eased in green and orange zones where stand-alone shops of non-essential items will be opened.“But there will be no relaxation for containment areas. The relaxation applies only to stand-alone shops and home delivery of non-essential items, not for market complexes or shopping malls,” she said.Stand-alone shops selling electronics goods, stationery items, books, paints, hardware products, laundry, tea, and paan will be allowed to open in green and orange zones, she said. “Police will survey which shops will be opened. Hawkers’ markets and shops on footpath won’t be opened. Factories can open in green zones but they need to abide by all protocols,” she said.“We are yet to get clarifications from the Centre regarding its order last week on opening of shops in non-containment zones. Once we get that, we would take steps about extending the relaxation in some other areas,” she added.Buses will also ply in green zones but will not carry more than 20 passengers at a time, she said adding that the vehicle should be sterilized at regular intervals. “Taxis also can operate in green zones, but with not more than three passengers,” Banerjee said.She said the Economic Task Force has prepared a six-month economic rehabilitation plan.The TMC supremo also alleged that the BJP was indulging in politics at the time of this crisis.“There are some people who are trying to spread rumours that there are no beds in hospitals of Kolkata to get admitted. There are still 790 beds ready for Covid-19 patients in Kolkata. We have moved from one Covid lab to 14 labs. And the BJP is busy doing politics to malign us. This is not the time for politics,” she said.“The BJP is making a hue and cry over the attack on policemen in Howrah. What about assault on policemen in BJP-ruled states,” she asked.A mob attacked policemen who were enforcing lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus at Tikiapara in Howrah district, a red zone, on Tuesday.“What happened in Tikiapara was wrong, it should not have happened and I have asked the police to take stern action. In Bengal, we treat everyone equally irrespective of their caste or religion. But those who are doing politics should come down on the road, clean the roads, stand beside the Covid-19 patients,” she said.Referring to the attacks on police personnel in BJP-governed Uttar Pradesh, she threatened to “open the Pandora’s Box, if the saffron camp continues to needle the Bengal government”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-hints-at-continuing-with-covid-19-restrictions-in-west-bengal/story-nT5VqSXo4uD5EeaXnL8rwO.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Recovery rate of Covid patients in Haryana climbs to 73%||Haryana reported the first recovery of a Covid-19 patient on March 21, the day when the state had 22 positive cases. Five weeks later, on April 28, the number of positive coronavirus cases in state swelled to 308. But heartening is the fact that the number of recovered patients stood at 224, about 73% of the total positive cases. Despite four hotspots — Nuh, Faridabad, Gurugram and Palwal — in the national capital region (NCR) accounting for over 60% of the total positive cases across the state, the impressive rate of recovery has placed Haryana in an enviable position as compared to neighbouring Delhi (33%) and Punjab (30%). The state’s remarkable recovery rate also came in for appraisal on Monday during the videoconference convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the chief ministers of all states. Notably, the national recovery rate as on April 29 was close to 25%.RECOVERY TRAJECTORYThe recovery trajectory of the state has a lot to do with the efforts to ramp up real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, pool sampling, and prompt tracking down and testing of suspected Tablighi missionaries and their contacts, besides intensive house-to-house screening in 155 containment zones across 20 districts. The stepped up measures ensured that the spread of the virus was checked and contained in an effective manner. “Had the virus spread gone berserk, the recovery rate would have come down,” said a health official posted in an NCR district. “The state had tested nearly 3,900 samples till April 12. By April 14 evening, we had tested over 6,100 samples and in next two weeks (till April 28), the number climbed to 25,000,” said additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora.The virology lab at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, which started pool sampling on April 14, had tested over 2,300 samples in the first seven days. The pool-tested samples accounted for more than 27% of the total samples tested in that particular period by the lab. Pool sampling is recommended in the areas with low prevalence of infection (below 2%). NEW THREAT FROM DELHI LOOMS LARGEThe state, however, is trying to gear up to tackle the flow of infection from Delhi to Haryana districts. After a number of coronavirus cases with Delhi links being reported in Panipat, Jhajjar, Faridabad – all NCR districts – alarms bells have started ringing. Keeping the situation in view, Panipat, Jhajjar and Rewari have put a ban on the entry of government officials from neighbouring districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/recovery-rate-of-covid-patients-in-haryana-climbs-to-73/story-Rki6OXICXQ0jjAGV6pWH4J.html

29-04-2020||City||Withdraw cut on MSP on damaged wheat grain: Farm unions to Centre||With untimely rainfall resulting in shrivelled grain and lustre loss in the wheat crop, Punjab’s farmers are facing the additional problem of the Centre imposing a value cut during procurement. The value cut to be imposed by the Centre varies between ₹4.81 and ₹24.06 per quintal for shrivelled grains and ₹4.81 for lustre loss on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 1,925 per quintal. The order came on Tuesday evening. “Farmers are being penalised for no fault of theirs. First the delay in procurement due to covid-19, then the untimely rain that caused crop damage and now the cut in value due to shrivelled grain and lustre loss,” claimed Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), adding, “Instead of giving relief, the centre has imposed value cut on damaged yield.” He added that farm unions demanded a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal to compensate for their losses. A Central team had visited Mohali, Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib districts on April 22 to assess if relaxation can be given in procurement norms. The state has 35 lakh hectare under wheat, with total arrival expected at 135 lakh tonne.Baldev Singh, a farmer from Bhadson in Nabha subdivision, said, “The new directions will not only result in financial loss to farmers, but there would be difficulty in selling the yield as well. The farmer is not responsible for damage caused due to untimely rainfall.”Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab president Darshan Pal said, “We condemn the Centre’s autocratic attitude. Farmers will not tolerate any value cut and will launch a stir.”On Tuesday, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh had sought immediate withdrawal of the value cut, despite allowing relaxations in specifications of shrivelled wheat grains and lustre loss, caused by unseasonal rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/withdraw-cut-on-msp-on-damaged-wheat-grain-farm-unions-to-centre/story-ZEDUU3rJz4fUMwp4Md8wVI.html

29-04-2020||Delhi||Sharjeel Imam charged under UAPA||The Delhi Police has booked former JNU student Sharjeel Imam under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act near Jamia Millia Islamia in December last year, said his lawyer. Imam has been booked under section 13 (unlawful activities) of the Act in the case, said his counsel advocate Mishika Singh. The police had earlier charged Imam with sedition, alleging his speech promoted enmity between people that led to riots.“He was arrested in two cases of violence at Jamia on December 13 and 15, 2019, for instigating and abetting the Jamia riots, due to his seditious speech on December 13 and based on evidences collected, IPC sections 124 A and 153 A were also invoked,” said Anil Mittal, Additional PRO, Delhi Police. In its supplementary charge sheet, the police had said serious riots had broken out in consequence of the protest march organised by Jamia students against the amended citizenship law on December 15 last year. The mob indulged in large-scale rioting, stone-pelting and arson, and in the process destroyed several public and private properties while a number of police personnel and people were injured in the riots, the agency said in its final report filed before the chief metropolitan magistrate court. The cases were registered at New Friends Colony and Jamia Nagar Police Stations. In the New Friends Colony case, Imam was arrested for instigating and abetting the Jamia riots, due to his seditious speech delivered on December 13, 2019. “During investigation, on the basis of evidence collected, sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 A IPC (promoting enmity between classes) were invoked in the case,” a police officer said. Imam was arrested from Bihar’s Jehanabad on January 28. He was involved in organising protests at Shaheen Bagh but came into limelight after a video showed him making controversial comments before a gathering at Aligarh Muslim University, following which he was booked under sedition charges. The Delhi Police had also booked him for an “inflammatory” speech delivered on the Jamia campus. Another case was filed against Imam in Assam under the stringent anti-terror law for his remark that Assam could be “severed from India, even if for a few months” as a result of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Police in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh had also lodged FIRs against the JNU scholar over his speech in which he threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the northeast from the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sharjeel-imam-charged-under-uapa/story-pYhWbXWmvVFKHCAq4FdScP.html
29-04-2020||City||Virtual family court passes “interim” order on child’s education||Pune Amid the Covid-19 lockdown, a family court in the city has passed an online “interim” order on April 15, in a divorce case involving the education of the couple’s 10-year-old child.Initially, during the lockdown period, there was no facility for online hearing, but on April 11, the court began setting up virtual hearing as per the directions of the high court.According to advocate Supriya Kothari, her client, a 37-year old woman who works in the IT sector is seeking a divorce from a 43-year-old from Mumbai due to non-compatibility issues escalating since 2016, amid case coming up in the Pune family court in 2019. They have a 10-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son, both of whom were studying in a Mumbai school till 2019. As it was becoming difficult for the woman to commute to Mumbai daily from Pune she had petitioned in the court to admit the children here in Pune.The order delivered on April 15 stated, “The petitioner is permitted to obtain leaving certificate of the daughter with or without consent of the respondent, to transfer the children at Pune.”According to Kothari, “Initially when we began the proceedings, it was mid-session for education for the ten-year-old who was studying in a Mumbai school, while both the children were with her in Pune. When the woman had left the house, the child had six months of school left, hence to made sure that her child completes her school term, the woman asked for permission to the family court for the child to be transferred from Mumbai school to a Pune school, but the family court in Pune did not give the permission and has told to complete the six months of education in Mumbai.”As stipulated by the court, the mother and child made several trips from Pune to Mumbai during the school year completing her year though it was difficult for the mother, who later filed an application to the high court challenging the family court order.The high court, since she had completed a year, informed her that she has to conduct the school procedures before 15 April 2020 in the family court and it has to decide upon the application of schooling.On April 3 this year, the lockdown was further extended and the date was postponed to June 19 which was making things difficult for the mother and daughter. The mother then approached the family court via her lawyer for the application.The family court issued an online notice to the husband, and the family court asked both parties to contact for online counsellors as a last attempt, where there was no settlement. Thus on April 15, an online hearing was held of both the parties and as per order argued the case. All of the parties were online in their respective places, whereupon after the hearing, the order was finally passed in the favour of the woman whereupon her child could now study in Pune, with the father allowed access to his children.“The interim order stated that the Mumbai school has to give school leaving certificate for the child to join in Pune, in what according to the advocate is the first online hearing and order during the Covid-19 lockdown,” said Kothari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/virtual-family-court-passes-interim-order-on-child-s-education/story-LPMEmKz3ttlYawLneNxqSP.html

Ram Avtar Sharma, district education officer, Dadri, told Hindustan Times, “The teachers have been delivering one hour lecture each in the morning (9 am-10am) and evening (4pm to 5pm) for different classes and subjects through the Dadri Radio FM. As many as 14 teachers have delivered lectures in the past one week. These teachers are voluntarily doing their duty. We will release a list of the new teachers on Thursday.”Sharma said that they have been sending the recorded lectures in the WhatsApp groups formed by the government school teachers for those students who missed them.“We have reached out to nearly 2,000 students in the past one week. For the students residing within 20 kilometers radius of the district headquarters, the radio lessons are clearly audible. We have requested the district administration to provide us a local TV cable channel so that we can cover more students”, Ram Avtar Sharma added.Anita Rani , a Hindi teacher, said that she has been teaching grammar to students of classes 6 to 10 via radio.“Initially, students faced a problem with getting their queries cleared during live lectures. After that, they adjusted to the technology. We have been dedicating 40 minutes of our slot to deliver lessons and remaining 20 to take students’ doubts”, she added.Sapna , a student of Class 10 from Sanjarwas village, said that she has been regularly attending her class from 9am to 10am through the radio.“The lectures provided through Dadri Radio FM are beneficial and I am getting my doubts cleared by calling on the radio number. Many of the students are facing problem in receiving education amid lockdown as they do not have radios and internet connection”, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-lockdown-community-radio-whatsapp-have-become-medium-of-education-for-dadri-students/story-X9zpsbhfRviNWn7h8788zK.html

They say they are living under the fear of getting infected with coronavirus as the norms of social distancing are not being observed at these centres.The authorities have kept 428 pilgrims, who have returned to Amritsar in the past three days, at four quarantine centres —Swami Vivekananda Drug De-addiction and Rehabilitation Centre, Princess of Wales Jenana Hospital, quarantine centre, Fatehpur (Chabal Road) and Naraingarh health centre.Rajwinder Singh, who has been quarantined at Jenana hospital said, “The centre is unhygienic and washrooms dirty. Over 60 people have been kept here and it has only 5 washrooms. Social distancing norms are up for a toss here. If we stay in such unhygienic conditions, we are bound to get infected. The health department should send those pilgrims, who have been tested negative for Covid-19, back to their homes.”“We are not being given proper and hygienic food,” said Kulwant Singh, another Nanded returnee at Jenana hospital.“100 pilgrims have been quarantined at Swami Vivekananda centre. I and my family can get infected from other people here,” said Sukhpal Singh.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Vikas Hira said, “The district administration is providing three meals to the pilgrims, besides filtered water, fruits, juice and milk. The centres are being cleaned regularly and washrooms are clean. I have personally visited these centres to take stock of the situation and everything is fine.”95 PILGRIMS QUARANTINED IN SBS NAGAR As many as 95 pilgrims who arrived from Nanded in Shaheed Bhaga Singh on Wednesday were quarantined at government facilities near Balachaur and in Behram town of the district.

Confirming the same, Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said all the 11 patients were asymptomatic. An eight-year-old boy is the youngest among the patients, while a 62-year-old woman the eldest among them. While four are from Samrala, the rest are from Moti Nagar, Neechi Mangli, Sandhu Nagar, Hargobind Nagar, Chander Nagar, Amarpura and Shimlapuri areas in the city.The pilgrims are among 56 and the students are among 25 currently quarantined at the Mother and Child Hospital on Chandigarh Road.Senior medical officer (SMO) of the hospital, Dr Amita Jain, said the samples of 22 students and 18 pilgrims, who are at high risk, were sent for testing at the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), while the remaining to the Rajindra Hospital in Patiala.Following the developments, district health authorities along with the administration and the police conducted an emergency meeting at Bachat Bhawan on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the future course of action.Meanwhile, four buses ferrying nearly 156 pilgrims arrived at the civil hospital in Ludhiana on Wednesday. Health department officials called pilgrims in batches of five and asked them to sit in the buses after collecting their swab samples. Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said the pilgrims will be shifted to a suitable location. Earlier on Tuesday, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had stated that the pilgrims arriving from Nanded will be kept at the Radha Swami Satsang Ghars.TRACING ON On the back foot for having sent the pilgrims and students back to their respective houses after screening them, the health department is now tracking and tracing the people who had come in contact with the 11 patients who tested positive on Wednesday.The administration, which had earlier escorted the pilgrims and students to their homes in taxis and PCR vehicles after the screening, turned up at their homes on Tuesday to take them back to the hospital at Chandigarh Road. Sources said some of the pilgrims and students were reluctant to visit the hospital.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) General Secretary Jeevan Gupta demanded a probe and strict action against the health official concerned “for sending the pilgrims and students back to their houses after conducting a mere health screening”.“The authorities in Ludhiana swung into action only after cases surfaced in Tarn Taran, otherwise the asymptomatic patients, who were tested positive today, would have kept spreading the virus,” Gupta said. However, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said the screening was done as per protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nanded-returnees-students-among-11-test-positive-in-ludhiana/story-FmsF4mmpR24cSSfWWzmLON.html

The process had started earlier this month and setting up of machinery and infrastructure picked up pace last week.On Wednesday, Haryana assembly speaker and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta with deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja visited the hospital to take stock of the lab. Gupta said it is the first real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) lab of the state which is a technique of molecular biology.“The government had decided to open 5 labs for Covid-19 testing in the state, of which the first lab is ready in Panchkula. This lab will prove beneficial for residents of the surrounding areas, too,” he added.So far, the district health department is dependent on Chandigarh’s PGIMER and IMTech lab where samples are sent for testing. Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said the infrastructure for testing lab was prepared in last few days and doctors and staff have been trained in PGIMER, Chandigarh.She said health teams will hold a trial on Thursday with few of the samples and will most likely start testing at the lab from May 1. “In this lab, samples will be tested in three batches.

A senior Shiv Sena leader said that Thackeray expressed unhappiness over politics being played around his nomination.The state cabinet had recommended Thackeray’s nomination for the two vacant seats in the upper house. Over 20 days later, the governor has not processed the recommendation of the cabinet. On Tuesday, a delegation of MVA ministers met Koshyari to urge him to nominate Thackeray.A senior Sena leader said Thackeray decided to dial Modi and directly speak to him after he got indications from Koshyari that he would be consulting the Centre before taking a decision on his nomination. The Sena leader said Thackeray requested Modi to intervene as a political tussle in the middle of Covid-19 outbreak would affect the state’s efforts to control the epidemic. Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid-19 cases among all states.“Uddhav ji discussed the current political uncertainty in the state with the PM. He expressed unhappiness over the politics being played over his nomination as MLC at a time when the state is combating the coronavirus outbreak,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader requesting anonymity.With less than a month left for Thackeray to fulfil the constitutional requirement of getting elected to either of the houses of the state legislature, the alleged delay by the Governor has kept the proverbial sword of Damocles hanging over the CM and his government. Thackeray, who is not a member of either house of the legislature, took oath as the CM on November 28. He could lose the post if he is not elected to the legislature by May 27. The Shiv Sena is also exploring legal options to tackle the current uncertainty surrounding Thackeray’s nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-guv-stalls-uddhav-s-nomination-to-state-council-cm-dials-pm/story-7Zti1VwVMySJlnAFQRi8tM.html

Grewal said 15kg wheat is being given by the government to every blue card holder for free, but the MLA is forcing the people to gather in large numbers outside offices of councillors amid curfew.Talwar, however, refuted the allegations stating that they are trying to put a system in place so that no depot holder should distribute less than 15kg wheat to beneficiaries. He said Grewal was levelling baseless allegations for political mileage.A video of the incident also went viral on social media networks in which Grewal is lashing out at the MLA stating that wheat did not belong to any MLA and residents should not be asked to get in writing from the councillors. In the video, residents could also be seen giving a miss to the social distancing norm. Grewal alleged Talwar was indulging in politics even at this time of crisis when people are already facing a lot of harassment. Residents in the East constituency are being forced to visit Congress councilors’ offices for getting free wheat. Talwar said, “I am ensuring that people of his constituency face no harassment and councillors should keep an eye on the distribution of wheat so that no depot holder distributes less wheat to residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/talwar-and-bhola-grewal-spar-over-distribution-of-ration-video-goes-viral/story-BKX5efeu4j7etAuiNfgNaK.html

Launched last week, the helplines -- 9868396802 or 9868396859 -- were started to address concerns of health care professionals who are in the front-line of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. But in the last five days, the helpline has only received four calls.The psychiatrists had proposed to work in two-hour shifts to attend calls and provide support and counselling to health care professionals, who are at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. The director of IHBAS, Nimesh G Desai, said the low number of calls may be because many health care professionals were not aware of the facility. “The stress during such a time can vary from the mild to severe. We have heard reports of front-line workers taking their lives in some countries. The tele-counselling service is called Samarthan and is aimed at supporting or caring for the carers. The response has been low so far but it may be because it has not been publicised enough. There is only a remote possibility that health care professionals are coping with stress on their own,” Desai said.He said efforts are being made to publicise the initiative through social media and hospitals.sMeanwhile, the Delhi Police have also contacted IHBAS and asked the hospital to help counsel police personnel who are out on the streets enforcing the lockdown. A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said the counselling programme will be for constables, head constables, and other junior personnel. At least 31 police personnel have tested positive for Covid-19, while over 500 are in quarantine currently. There are also at least 150 personnel who are staying away from families and have checked into hotels, because their homes are in containment zones (in and outside Delhi). The Delhi Police have reserved 927 rooms in 67 different hotels across the city for such personnel. Apart from their law and order duty, police are out on the roads managing containment zones, conducting checks, ensuring social distancing and also feeding the hungry in congested areas. Over the last one month, at many police stations across the city, personnel manning containment zones have shaved their heads in the fear of contracting the virus. Senior police officers later assured them the virus doesn’t spread through the hair.Desai said IHBAS will help the police personnel and that they are working out a programme for personnel counselling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/helplines-to-help-covid-front-line-workers-cope-with-stress-get-just-4-calls-in-5-days/story-xfXP9DGS5Xv7zRw1Ae550L.html

Now, they have come out onto the streets demanding they be provided with food, as so far their repeated requests have fallen on deaf ears, they said.Defying the curfew, about 100 families along with their children living in Hem Vihar Phase 1 in Baltana, came onto the streets to protest with a hope that the administration will provide them ration. While protesting, the families took care to ensure they maintained social distance.“We will die of hunger before any virus kills us. There is no food, how do you expect my family to survive?” said Uma Shankar, a construction labourer. Father of two children, Shankar said, “The ration and money my contractor us gave has dried up. How do I feed my family now?”Raghunath, who works as a driver, said, “When my 4-year-old son asks for milk, we mix some flour in the water and feed him. We are five in the family and are eating only one meal a day.”These families, who were earning about ₹400 to ₹500 everyday, have been rendered without work. They are living in rented accommodations.

This jump in cases, in the village with a population of 3,000, sent the Mohali district count soaring to 73.Now under quarantine for 14 days at a centre in Sector 70, Mohali, Saini says people had gradually stopped calling him to check on him. Saini and his cousin, the village sarpanch, who was also found positive, had reportedly defied curfew norms to organise community meals and interact with locals leading to increase in the number of cases. Saini, who owns a tent house and a tile factory, also did not cease the factory operations during the curfew.Gurpreet Singh, a villager, says once immensely popular in the village due to his sociability, the panch has now lost his ground after getting the “super spreader” tag. “He has brought upon himself infamy for spreading the virus in the village,” he adds.Even the sarpanch, who recovered a week back, says she could perceive a change in residents’ attitude towards her, but hopefully things will improve with time. “I feel sorry that our village became infamous. But, we have faith in God. The situation is under control and the good old days will return,” she says.Out of 43 patients from the village, 17 have recovered and been moved to the quarantine centre in Sector 70 Mohali for 14 days.The village continues to be sealed, having been declared a containment zone, with residents’ movement out of their houses completely restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hard-to-shake-off-stigma-says-jawaharpur-panch/story-5gQDeQuWGjRjX2QgI4FCOM.html

29-04-2020||Lucknow||Dispelling rumours, collecting feedback keep 1.60 lakh Asha workers busy||While we know of doctors and cops as frontline Covid-19 warriors, there is another army of healthcare staff which is helping the government fight the war against the virus in an unsung way.Roped in to gather all kinds of feedback, a strong team of 1.60 lakh Asha (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, positioned across the state, has literally become the eyes and ears of the government in the fight against the Covid-19.“Recently we were asked to gather details of Imams of masjids so that they could be asked to appeal to people to offer prayers at home during Ramadan,” said Kiran Yadav, an Asha worker posted in BKT block.“We move out, get exposed to the risk, collect information and forward it to the government through proper channel,” she said while ruing the little remuneration she gets in return.“It comes out to be a maximum of Rs 73 a day, if we complete the entire set of task assigned to us. Will the work come again depends on many things,” she said.They are contract workers employed by the health department under national health mission and paid incentives based on the number of cases – mostly institutional deliveries – that they take care of.Usually, on one delivery, a worker gets Rs 650. If the worker completes all the tasks she is paid Rs 2200 per month.Similar is the story of Kusum Singh posted in Atesua village of Lucknow.“I finish my house chores before 6 am to leave for field to sensitize people about COVID-19. We brave rude behavior of villagers who believe in rumours more than the facts and are very stubborn most of the times,” she said.During the lockdown, since other vaccination has been stopped the Asha workers are left with the task of institutional deliveries and weighing children for which they would be paid not more than Rs 1000 a month.Still, they are busy in sensitizing people about COVID-19 and checking whether people are quarantined properly or not.Where this women work force comes in handy is in collecting feedback and doing ground-level work.Renu, who is a ‘Sangini’ and supervises work of around 26 Asha workers covering around more than two dozen hamlets with a total population of around 25, 000, said, “We have been visiting door to door, listen to their worries, gathering feedback, face different issues and report it to higher authorities.”“We face different kinds of people of strong beliefs. We are the closest part of the state machinery but powerless. Some people ridicule us, some try to demean us,” she added.A few days ago Kusum Singh, Asha worker of Atesua village was confronted by a middle-aged woman when asked to cover the face. “Jab hamne koi paap nhin kiya to mooh kyun chhupaaye. (When I have not committed any sin, why should I cover my face),” She told Asha worker and asked her to leave the house.“Some people will mock us all the time. They call us corona warriors but in the sense of making fun of us. People ridiculed when we wrote these slogans,” said Singh.Belonging to a marginal farmer’s family, another Asha worker, Manju Devi of Chaturpur village of Lucknow said, “When we reach home, we have nothing in hand but a sense of satisfaction that we did our best. But when I see people around, I feel we all deserve better remunerations.”Some of them have adopted innovative ways to reach out to the people by writing slogans on walls, beating drums so that the message to stay safe from COVID19 reach out to maximum people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/dispelling-rumours-collecting-feedback-keep-1-60-lakh-asha-workers-busy/story-qwSzD4jUeXpBTMtLjKj9UI.html

We will implement the final decision by the ward office,” said Divakar Shelke, senior inspector, Dadar police station.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said a decision on allowing fishing will be considered after May 3. “This is a high-risk area and it is not advisable for citizens to crowd either on boats or within the village to sell fish,” said Rajesh Mule, assistant engineer, G-South ward in-charge of operations at Koliwada. Marine conservationists, requested the BMC on Wednesday to allow artisanal fishworkers from the village to fish for their self-consumption. “The community has been earmarked as a ‘red zone’, however with required precautions and guidelines of social distancing they have been requesting resumption of their fishing activity (which occurs only in the intertidal and subtidal region, in low numbers of one to five) and sale (wholesale being sold for local and community consumption),” said Sarita Fernandes, coastal policy researcher and marine wildlife conservationist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/locals-fish-at-worli-koliwada-village-catch-gets-seized-by-mumbai-police/story-jPaUNewtXlcehHguTAOz3J.html
29-04-2020||City||Himachal tourism industry most hit due to Covid-19 lockdown, say stakeholders||The nationwide lockdown imposed to check Covid-19 has dealt a severe blow to Himachal’s tourism industry, which earns the hill-state a significant chunk of its revenue.The tourism and hospitality sector contributes 7% to the state’s Gross Domestic Product.“The hotel industry needs special protection. It was first to close down due to the lockdown and will be the last to open. Tourism is the soul of Himachal’s economy besides being a major employment generator,” said Atharv Chadha, owner of Hotel Ashiana Grand located in Chhota Shimla area.“The sector is in dire need of special status and stimulus package. All industries will start operations soon except the hotels. Hoteliers require deferment of bank loan installments for at least 15 years or they will turn into non-performing assets,” he added.TAX WAIVERS SOUGHTThe Shimla Hotel and Restaurant Association representatives had also called on the chief minister recently requesting him for interim relief.Similarly, Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association has also written to the director of tourism, demanding a complete GST waiver for tourism, travel and hospitality industries for one year and subsidy on commercial fuel and gas for the industry.Hoteliers’ body president Sanjay Sood claimed that currently all hotels in Shimla were operating at 0-30% occupancy rate.“If the lockdown prevails, there will be massive layoffs,” he said, adding that the pandemic had affected businesses and livelihood of thousands of employees.As per government records, there are 3,679 registered hotels in the state with bed capacity of 1, 03,053. In addition to this, there are 2,189 home stays having bed-capacity of 12,181.Last year, a total of 172.12 lakh tourists visited the state, of which 168.29 lakh were domestic and 3.56 lakh foreign tourists.‘GOVT SHOULD PAY WAGES’The industry stakeholders have demanded that for the staff that is beyond the coverage limit of the Employees’ Staff Insurance Corporation (ESIC), the establishments should be allowed to pay only 25% of their salaries, while the government can foot the balance amount with the help of state agencies like Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF).They have also asked the government to pay salaries of employees working in units not covered under ESIC but GST.State should also reduce commercial electricity tariff by about 10% to 20% for a period of five years on the analogy of states of Maharashtra and Punjab, Sood demanded.There is an automatic increase of 15% in the water charges every year which must be deferred for the time being along with municipal taxes.Minimum wages in terms of Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) should not be increased or be fixed for the next two years, he said.‘RELAX LICENSING FEES’Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth said that the excise and taxation department should provide relaxation in licence fee as many hotels and bars had been shut due to Covid-19.“Licence fee deposited for the 2020-21 financial year should be considered from the day hotels and bars will open their operations and no penalties should be imposed,” he said.Seth claimed that the hotel Industry will take at least 12 to 18 months to come back on the rails.‘TAKE STEPS TO AVOID LAYOFFS’Ajay Mahajan, a former Congress legislator and prominent hotelier from Kangra, said that the government should take steps to prevent layoffs in the tourism industry. He claimed that apart from hotels, 200 units operating in adventure tourism, 899 registered photographers, 1,314 guides and over 41,000 taxi drivers were dependent on tourism.He said the government should contribute to the EPF and employee insurance accounts.He also demanded the state government to waive off various water and sewerage charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-tourism-industry-most-hit-due-to-covid-19-lockdown-say-stakeholders/story-VAPUJ6AjbFYnOtNAhkZA2M.html

29-04-2020||Jaipur||Raj govt intensifies counselling of anxious migrant workers stranded away from homes||Rajasthan’s Labour Department has intensified the psychological counselling of stranded migrant workers staying in different shelter homes as many states including West Bengal, Telangana and Bihar have refused to allow their residents to return from other parts of the country, officials said. Stuck in shelter homes for over a month during the nationwide lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic and with some states refusing to facilitate inter-state transfers of people, migrant workers are increasingly being affected by distress, fear and anxiety, they said. “West Bengal and Bihar have refused inter-state transfer of migrant workers whereas other states have agreed. With several leaving shelters for their homes, fear and anxiety has increased among those who are left out. We have intensified counselling to assure them that they will be sent back to their homes soon,” Labour Minister Tikaram Jully told PTI. He said till Tuesday about 3.75 lakh migrant workers stranded in other states registered with the Rajasthan government to return to their homes in this state whereas about 1.25 lakh workers stuck in Rajasthan want to move to their respective states. The Rajasthan government had started registration of migrants and labourers willing to return home on the helpline number 18001806127, eMitra Rajasthan portal, e-Mitra mobile app or at e-Mitra Kisosk. After registration of the workers, the state government would obtain consent from the concerned governments of the registered workers’ states of residence.  About a fortnight ago, the Labour Department had asked the officials in the districts to start counselling of migrant workers. It has now asked them to pay special attention to the counselling of migrants as many have left for their homes and the remaining are developing anxiety. “We knew that such circumstances may arise. So, a fortnight ago I had asked the officials in the districts to start counselling of migrants. Now, there is fear and anxiety in workers who are left out as a few states are not ready to accept inter-state transfer,” said Niraj K. Pawan, Principal Secretary, Labour Department. Pawan, who has a clinical psychology background, said a large number of migrants from Bihar and Telangana are stranded in Rajasthan and want to go back to their homes and do not eat food. In such a case, the department is counselling them and assuring the workers that soon they will also be able to go their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/raj-govt-intensifies-counselling-of-anxious-migrant-workers-stranded-away-from-homes/story-tmJXHv7CuvFiUwLXp6SELP.html

29-04-2020||Mumbai||Student volunteers collect funds to help stray animals during lockdown||After helping provide food and essentials to tribal villages and help senior citizens with their daily needs during the ongoing lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19, college students volunteering with the National Service Scheme (NSS) are now also focusing on the welfare of animals.Students from a few colleges affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU) have been raising funds to provide food and water to stray animals and birds.“Since we have to follow lockdown rules, our volunteers are ensuring that we only step out to help strays and birds close to our residence. Over the past one week most of us have noticed an increase in the number of strays that gather every day for food now,” said Idrish Badgujar, an NSS volunteer and student of RZ Shah College, Mulund. He added that around 18 volunteers from his college have started this initiative in several areas in Mulund and Dombivli.In some cases, students have also been reaching out to animal shelters to help raise funds to provide food for animals. “We started a page on Facebook and Instagram to help raise funds, and the donations have ranged from ₹150 to ₹5,000 by students as well as others. While we are facing trouble, we cannot forget that animals are probably in a stickier situation as they are left with no food during the lockdown,” said Abhish Rege, another NSS volunteer.Over the past few weeks, the state and central government have also been encouraging NSS volunteers to step up and come to the rescue of people in need. Atul Salunkhe, state liaison officer, NSS, government of Maharashtra, said that over 1.4 lakh students across the state have already registered on their official website and are ready to help. “We hope to start a helpline that can reach out to people across the state,” added Salunkhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/student-volunteers-collect-funds-to-help-stray-animals/story-PNamBFHvhIl2EdpdBKKeDL.html

29-04-2020||Chandigarh||At home in Chandigarh, says BJP MP Kirron Kher taking on Congress criticism on absence||Amid the increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the city, the slugfest between BJP and Congress leaders has intensified with city MP Kirron Kher releasing a video on social media, countering Congress allegations about her going missing amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In the six-minute video clip, Kher questioned the timing of the Congress allegations, and said, “I’m in my house in Sector 7, Chandigarh. I am doing all my work on the telephone and even meeting people here.” The trigger for Kher’s outburst were Congress leaders’ tweets. “Lagatar tweet kar rahe ki dokhebaaz hein sansad, yahan par hein nahi sansad, bahar kyu nahi ja rahi sansad. Kya chahete hein aap? Election mein toh mujhe hara nahi pate, corona ho jaye toh mar jaye agla,” she said taking them on. Kher, who said she is diabetic and above 60, asked the Congress leaders, “Are your mothers, wives and daughters going out?”‘WILL RESPOND IN ELECTIONS’“I didn’t even see (former MP Pawan Kumar) Bansal sahab. The person who never made tea at home is now getting photos clicked, showing himself cooking. Is it believable? His white kurta is shining! Where food is being distributed to poor, you people reach there just get your selfies clicked. At least respect the poor,” she said. Addressing Congress leaders, Kher said, “You say I am in Mumbai. I wish I was there because my family is there. I am alone here in Sector 7, while you all are with your families.”“I will respond to you in the next elections. Even after losing twice you are not satisfied. We should not play politics during the current crisis.” On Tuesday, Bansal had also released a media statement and criticised the UT administration’s Covid containment efforts. The Chandigarh Congress has been pointing out that if Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, the UT advisor, deputy commissioner and other officers can hold meetings every day in the war room, then why can’t MP Kirron Kher join in and highlight issues of residents.CHEEKY RESPONSE FROM CITY CONGRESS CHIEFChandigarh Congress president Pradeep Chhabra said, “The local MP has been missing for a month now. Today, when businesses are closed due to the lockdown and people have lost their means of earning, shouldn’t she raise her voice for electricity, water bill and tax exemption for residents?”Responding to Kher’s video, Chhabra tweeted, “But in your video you rightly admitted that your family is in Mumbai and our family is here. Rightly so madam. Chandigarh is our family. We are with our family. We always will be with Chandigarh, our family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-home-in-chandigarh-says-bjp-mp-kirron-kher-taking-on-congress-criticism-on-absence/story-rr364x2S1hlwEUMtUtZQGI.html
29-04-2020||Delhi||A Punjabi gaze on Kashmir||He says that being an outsider gives him a unique perspective. That he can look at things not only objectively but also with a certain degree of empathy. “And then you are able to observe the contrasts and contradictions without being judgemental,” says playwright Atamjit Singh, recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi and Sahitya Akademi awards, whose latest Punjabi play ‘Balde Rahan Chiragh Hamesha’ on Kashmir has now been translated into Hindi and Urdu.The Mohali-based playwright, who had written a play, ‘Tasveer Da Teeja Pasa’, on the politics of terrorism, centred on incidents in Punjab and Kashmir; says that situation in the Valley pushed him to devote his latest work around it.“Kashmir, being close geographically and emotionally, has always fascinated me. And ever since reading up on saints like Lalleshwari and Noor-ud-Din, who are also known as Lall Ma and Nund Rishi, I felt a peculiar attraction towards that land. Many people are unaware that Nund, a Muslim saint, was actually breastfed by the Hindu saint Lalleshwari,” he says.The plot of the play is based on true incidents that took place in a district in Kashmir managed by his writer friend Khalid Hussain, who was a Deputy Commissioner there. Centring on a Hindu boy raised by a Muslim family which never stopped him from practicing his Hindu faith, the script brings forth the protagonist’s dilemma when the graveyard where his Muslim father’s remains are buried is destroyed by a brick kiln owner.Like in his other works, this play too has many historical contexts. However, Singh stresses that no playwright uses history just to retell the past chronicles. Emphasizing that for him history is a root in the soil, and if one follows the roots in the true spirit, there is seldom a fear of going wrong, he adds, “If used imaginatively, history becomes the strength of the plot that can be used to say what the writer wants to. And that is what I have done in ‘Balde Rahan Chiragh Hamesha’.”“For me, the most interesting chapter of the land is on Rinchan, who was the first non-Hindu ruler of Kashmir. Buddhist by his faith, Rinchan decided to come to the fold of the religion of general public, which was Hinduism at that point of time. But the clergy didn’t allow him to do so, thus paving way for him to embrace Islam. However, the play largely concentrates on the post-Independence era including the early nineties when the exodus of Pandits took place. But I must add, a play is never restricted to the history that it refers to, it is and should always be contemporary,” he says.Believing that theatre, or for that matter any other art, cannot be used as ‘antibiotics’, he stresses that a writer’s role is not to treat problems, but identify them. “This play delves into the centuries old history of co-existence followed by the cracks created by politicians. The irony of the situation is that the Kashmir problem actually is not the creation of Kashmiris. Obviously, a work of art that wishes to genuinely touch the hearts and minds of people cannot offer lip-sympathies, but it can for sure be a part of the healing process,” he adds.Known for undertaking long and exhaustive research before writing his scripts, the playwright went to Chicago, known for its libraries for the same. “While writing an earlier play on World War I, translated in English as ‘Come Back from the War’, I found the Chicago Library system extremely useful. For this play, I needed to read up on the politics of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), and was unable to find enough material here. Look at the irony, I had to travel to Canada and America to find material on an Indian subject. This says so much about our own libraries,” he says.Believing that finding the real problem is in itself a part of the solution, he is now all set to write a new play on Diwan Singh Kalepani, a doctor and Punjabi poet, who did monumental work in Andaman and Nicobar Islands before he was hanged by Japanese in early forties for opposing the idea of using a gurdwara as a brothel for Japanese soldiers.“I wanted to visit the islands for my research, but will need to postpone due to the current Covid-19 crisis. And yes, for a long time, I have wanted to write on Sir Ganga Ram whose contribution, in terms of innumerable monumental buildings and institutions that he raised in the city of Lahore in undivided India, has not suitably been recognised by Indians till date. Ironically, he is a better-known person in Pakistan today. But I don’t see an immediate chance to visit Pakistan now considering the strained relations between the two countries,” he concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-punjabi-gaze-on-kashmir/story-NH4PsTuhUhFLpFfxAo01HM.html

They are learning new skills, connecting with their loved ones and preparing for online interviews so that they can land their dream job.In Punjab, as many as 3,091 college students, both graduates and post graduates, have registered themselves for the ‘How to face virtual interview’ webinar that is scheduled for April 30. It is being conducted by speakers from Infosys Private Limited and the webinar will be live for an hour from 3pm on Thursday.It is being organised by National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) under the Punjab Ghar Ghar Rozgaar and Karobaar Mission (PGGRKM). “Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the strategy of companies has shifted from conducting in-person interviews to virtual platforms. To help the students prepare for virtual jobs interviews while staying safe at home, the state government had made the registration free. The webinar will definitely help the college students, who are aspiring to join reputed companies, crack the virtual interviews,” said Navdeep Singh, deputy chief executive officer (CEO) of District Bureau of Employment and Enterprises (DBEE).He said, “In Ludhiana district, around 400 students have registered themselves for the webinar.”“I had intimated all the colleges in the district regarding the event and requested them to tell their students about this event,” he said.Explaining the important points for virtual interviews, Nidhi Singhi, career counsellor with the DBEE, said, “Check the internet connectivity speed beforehand and make sure that the camera is functioning properly.”“One should never make the mistake of taking virtual interviews casually. In fact, more attentiveness is required since we are connecting with another person virtually and that can easily get obstructed due to different technical glitches. Similarly, the room where one appears for the interview should have proper lighting. One needs to be dressed formally, sit straight and speak clearly. Doing proper research about the company and field of work is always important, whether it’s a virtual or a one-to-one interview,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-3-000-students-in-punjab-register-for-webinar-to-learn-interview-skills/story-rbD2Do1aeYwjRFwiY9JklO.html
29-04-2020||City||Ludhiana police seek suggestions for better enforcement of curfew||The Ludhiana district police have sought feedback and suggestions from residents for better implementation of restrictions and to give relaxations to residents during curfew. A message in this regard was posted on their Facebook page on Tuesday night.The message read, “Need your feedback and suggestions on following – Present status of curfew in Ludhiana; Usefulness of volunteers in curfew enforcement; What should be done after May 3 in Ludhiana to handle the situation? How much opening up of curfew can be done?; Whether we should open standalone shops within Municipal Limits in the cities? Will people follow social distancing norms there?; Whether we can open shops in rural areas/villages?; Whether more factories should be allowed to run with safeguards?; How to constructively engage migrant labourers?”In response to the post, around 673 residents came up with different suggestions, ranging from allowing shops to open to increasing restrictions and extending the curfew.A resident, Parminder Singh, former president of the Rotary Club Ludhiana Greater, said the administration can allow the market to open on alternative days and that too area-wise. He suggested shopkeepers should be asked for making less counter sales and laying more focus on home-to-home deliveries. “It will help in reducing rush at the shops,” he said.Similarly, another resident, Samit Jain, also shared the same suggestion and said shops should be allowed to open with one-day gap and that too for a few hours. He added shopkeepers should be also given responsibility of maintaining social distancing. Jain said, in many areas of the city, the situation is under control, therefore, the administration can give some relaxations.Meanwhile, some residents asked the authorities to extend curfew and restriction in the city.Karan Thaman, an advocate, said, “People are still not obeying curfew norms. One can witness rush on roads during morning and evening hours. Only the shops providing essential products should be allowed to operate.”Another advocate, Dinesh Rajput, said, “At present, the situation is under control, but if any relaxation is given at this stage, it can turn out to be dangerous.”Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Deepak Pareek said, “The department will go through all the suggestions and feedback from residents and consider their views while planning the next course of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-police-seek-suggestions-for-better-enforcement-of-curfew/story-N57q3BH4d5hlUQ6z5u2maK.html

Since her family was in quarantine, the body was buried at a local graveyard by police officials after completion of formalities. Head of department, Chest Medicine Government Medical College Srinagar, Dr Naveed Shah said, “It is painful to see the family members not being able to perform the last rites. The woman neither had travel history nor a primary contact. This is what can happen if we don’t follow advisories.” He added that elderly patients with comorbidities are most susceptible and should stay at home.The woman lived in a congested area of the old city which has been completely sealed to contain the spread of the disease.Head of department, Chest Medicine SKIMS Medical College Bemina, Dr Javeed Malik told HT that out of 110 Covid-19 patients admitted in their hospital, only four are in the high dependency unit. “We had two deaths. Both were elderly people with comorbidities and were very sick.”He said a patient who was very sick and was referred from Government Medical College Baramulla has survived after treatment. “Initially, we thought that the 37-year-old patient from north Kashmir won’t survive due to acute sickness but he recovered and has been discharged from the hospital,” Malik said.He said most elderly patients have mild symptoms and are showing signs of recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/authorities-in-tizzy-over-dead-valley-woman-s-infection-source/story-pqldEcJ1RAB7VfBpea1O1J.html

The Union minister said the second section will be a new 65-km stretch, which will take the expressway from Kartarpur to Gurdaspur, from where it will join the NH 44 for the next 180 km stretch to Katra.She said the expressway will take off from Jassur Kheri in Haryana and pass through Ghana-Kalayat in Haryana to enter Punjab near Patran, from where the expressway will pass through Bhawanigarh and Nakodar to Kartarpur and then be bifurcated into two, with one section passing through Amritsar and the other through Gurdaspur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delhi-amritsar-katra-expressway-will-pass-through-amritsar-says-harsimrat-kaur-badal/story-ZaOA8KuXScaEIsPKNFBb2O.html

I try to help them in as many household chores as possible. I even assisted them in unloading the wheat grown on our land into gunny bags,” he added.Indian Hockey player Poonam Malik of Hisar’s Umra village has also been dabbling in harvesting activities at home. “As most farm labourers have left for their homes due to the lockdown, there is no one for reaping the crop. Being from a farming family, I know the process and reap crop using farm equipment. Rest of the time, I practice for my game in a ground near my house.”Unlike the ones at home, hockey goalkeeper Savita Poonia is stuck in Banglore. The Ding village (Sirsa) native said she was maintaining a routine of eating healthy food and doing regular exercise during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bringing-their-a-game-in-lockdown-haryana-s-sportspersons-dabble-in-harvesting-activities-amid-labour-shortage/story-Ds724XUSRpLrclBRC95KdP.html

29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 curfew extended in Punjab till May 17 but shops to open by rotation from tomorrow for four hours||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday announced the extension of curfew in the state by two weeks after May 3, while unveiling steps for limited lifting of the lockdown restrictions, from Thursday, in the non-containment and non-red zones, with strict adherence to Covid-19 safety protocols.Based on the report of the expert committee set up to formulate the state’s exit strategy, and the inputs received from various sections of society, Capt Amarinder Singh said it was necessary to continue with the lockdown restrictions for some more time. The curfew in the state will now remain in force in Punjab till May 17, though limited easing of restrictions will be in place from 7am to 11am every day, starting Thursday.The containment and red zones will, however, continue to remain under total and strict lockdown.In an address to the people of the state, the chief minister said that the situation will be reviewed after two weeks and further relaxations will be announced thereafter if the pandemic remains in control. DCs TO WORK OUT ROTATIONAL SCHEDULEAccording to the limited relief announced by the chief minister, certain shops will be allowed to remain open in some areas by rotation, for four hours every morning, with 50% staff strength. The deputy commissioners have been directed to work out the rotational schedule for the shops that are allowed to be opened in line with the chief minister’s directives, which have come four days after the new home ministry guidelines came into effect.The curfew will remain in place after 11 am, as usual, said the chief minister, appealing to people to be back in their homes by that time, and continue to maintain social distancing.All those stepping out during the relaxation period would have to wear masks and maintain a 2-metre distance from others, he said, adding that the relief has been provided only for the convenience of the people and should not be used for interactions with friends etc.SALOONS, BARBER SHOPS TO STAY SHUTIn urban areas, all stand-alone shops, neighbourhood shops and shops in residential complexes are allowed to be open during this period, as per the new directives, which make it clear, however, that establishments dealing in services such as saloons, barber shops etc. would continue to remain closed.Further, e-commerce companies will continue to be permitted to deal in essential goods only during this period.THOSE RETURNING TO STATE TO BE QUARANTINEDExpressing his government’s keenness to open up the industry, the chief minister urged all those who could accommodate the workers or had workers staying in the vicinity to start opening up, to help revive the state’s battered economy.Referring to the large number of Punjabis stranded in other states due to the lockdown, Capt Amarinder Singh said it was his government’s duty to bring them back but they would have to be quarantined for 21 days. The state had made arrangements for their quarantine in all districts, he said, adding that the problem had aggravated in Punjab due to the large number of NRIs who came home, followed by the attendees of the Nizamuddin event. The state, he said, could not afford to let those coming from outside again let things spiral out of control. The quarantine for those coming home from other states was essential for the protection of the people, he said.IN FOR A LONG-DRAWN BATTLEThe Covid-19 pandemic has so far infected 330 people in the state. “While experts are coming out with different opinions, there seems to be an indication that the coronavirus crisis could continue till July/August, or even September,” said Captain Amarinder, terming it a long-drawn battle.Pointing out that no country had escaped coronavirus, he observed that the disease had claimed lots of lives across the world, with nearly 50,000 people dying in the US, which had reported 10 lakh cases so far. He cited the examples of the UK, Germany and Canada, to underscore the need for continued caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-curfew-extended-in-punjab-till-may-17-but-shops-to-open-by-rotation-from-tomorrow-for-four-hours/story-pIeuoHVFQmvQ5HjMYLkQiP.html
29-04-2020||Patna||‘If students remain stranded in Kota, it’ll affect our chances in Bihar polls’: BJP leader||BJP leader Sanjay Paswan on Wednesday said that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s refusal to facilitate the state’s students return from Kota will hurt the NDA in the upcoming Assembly elections.“What fear is ailing Nitish Kumar that he is not facilitating the return of Bihari students from Kota in Rajasthan? I feel the government officials are misguiding him. The Kota students’ issue will have an effect on the upcoming legislative assembly elections in the state. The family members of these students will think twice before voting for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Nitish should think about this matter again,” Paswan said.RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari said: “Are the chief ministers who facilitated the return of their states’ students from Kota illiterate? Is Nitish Kumar the only one who has read the Disaster Management Act 2005? I feel the BJP will not fight the next election under his leadership.”No. of children may only be 1000 but 1 Lakh families are affected due to it, they have sympathy for these children. If 1 Lakh families have 5 voters each, 5 Lakh votes will be affected. So I request the CM to bring back our children from Kota & Pune: Sanjay Paswan, BJP MLC #Bihar https://t.co/UXSlQF0UhTJDU leader Ajay Alok said: “Those who are raising the demand for the return of the students from Kota are suffering from lack of knowledge about the issue. Chief Minister Kumar had put forward his points in his remote meeting with the Prime Minister recently as to why the state government is not facilitating the return of students from Kota.”“What is the point in making allegations against the Chief Minister if he has made it clear as to why he is not taking steps on this issue? The states which have facilitated the return of their students from Kota should make it public whether they took permission from the centre or not. It might not be wrong to say that those states have broken the law,” he added.Earlier on April 27, Nitish Kumar had said that it is not possible to bring back students stranded in Rajasthan’s Kota until the lockdown guidelines are revised.The Chief Minister made this remark during a video meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the situation arising due to COVID-19.“A large number of students from Bihar are stranded in coaching centers in Rajasthan’s Kota. Some states are bringing back their students. However, since the state is following the lockdown as per the Central government’s guidelines. It will not be possible to bring the students back to the state until the guidelines are revised,” Nitish Kumar said, according to an official statement.Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh governments have facilitated the return of their students from Kota, which houses a number of coaching institutions for students. Maharashtra government has also sent a fleet of buses to bring back its students from there.India is under a nation-wide lockdown which was imposed on March 25 and later extended on April 14 to May 3 to stem the spread of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/if-students-remain-stranded-in-kota-it-ll-affect-our-chances-in-bihar-polls-bjp-leader/story-xM3l5EZeG9X4zwNgF0VFzN.html

29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Rapid testing for Covid-19 with Korean kits to start in Haryana from tomorrow||CHANDIGARH: Haryana will start rapid antibody (blood-based) tests from Thursday to intensify surveillance of suspected coronavirus carriers in the state. The state government will use 25,000 rapid test kits manufactured by a South Korean company, SD Biosensor, at a facility in Manesar, Gurgaon.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently advised state governments to stop the rapid antibody tests using kits procured from certain Chinese manufacturers after some states raised questions about their performance.The blood-based rapid tests are largely used as a tool for surveillance with respect to the formation of antibody in persons exposed to coronavirus. However, it can’t substitute the real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) test.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said rapid test kits are being distributed to all 22 districts of the state. The hotspot districts of Nuh, Palwal, Gurgaon and Faridabad are getting 1,500 kits each, while Panchkula will get 2,000 rapid test kits. Ambala, Rohtak and Sonepat will get 1,000 kits each. Besides, 500 rapid kits each are being allocated to all medical colleges in the state.The rapid antibody test is done in hotspots for surveillance and epidemiological studies.“The real time PCR-based molecular test remains the gold standard frontline test for Covid-19 diagnosis,” Arora said.RANDOM SAMPLINGAccording to a communication by the director general, health services, to civil surgeons, stratified random sampling may also be done for testing various categories of persons in the districts.“For this, 7% of the rapid kits allocated to a district should be used for testing police personnel, street vendors, sanitary staff, media professionals, newspaper vendors and district administration personnel. Also, 7% each of the rapid kits should be used to test health care workers in the field and in the institutions,” the communication said.The ACS, health, said since ICMR guidelines said that rapid tests should not be done indiscriminately, “we will use the test kits in hotspots and containment zones, where a high number of positive cases are detected, and in large migration gatherings, and evacuee centres.”All symptomatic influenza-like illness persons having fever, cough, sore throat and runny nose will be tested in the hotspots, he said.WHAT’S THE RAPID TEST Only an initial screening test; it can’t replace nasal swab RT-PCR test.It’s a supplementary tool to assess the prevalence of Covid-19 within a specific perimeter.ICMR says it should be done in hotspots.The test is only useful if done after a minimum of seven days of onset of symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rapid-testing-for-covid-19-with-korean-kits-to-start-in-haryana-from-tomorrow/story-L9uPpbVwTGGkXYCXhZ8O4J.html

29-04-2020||Lucknow||40K AKTU teachers may get reduced or no salary in April||Nearly 40,000 teachers in 700 private engineering colleges affiliated to Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) will either get no salary or 75% to 50% cut for April, an official said.In March also around 4,000 had not received their salary as many students had not deposited their quarterly installment of fees, said the official.There are about 2.5 lakh students in engineering colleges across Uttar Pradesh.Of these nearly one lakh students are from economically weaker section of the society whose fees are reimbursed by social welfare department of the government directly into students’ account, who in turn pay to their respective colleges.While the social welfare department has reimbursed the amount into bank account of students, many EWS category students, as well of the general class, are yet to pay the fees.Chairman of RR Institute of Technology and Management, Anil Agarwal said, “I have spoken to teachers in this regard. We are paying only 50% for April as we don’t have money because students have not deposited their installment of fees.”An official of Ambalika Institute of Management and Technology said, “The government decision not to give loans to trust, society will hit hard. As students have not deposited fees, we can’t pay full salary. We are working out how to address the problem. But there’s no solution in sight.”More than 150 private colleges have asked the university to give loan from endowment fund as they do not have money to pay teachers’ salary. But the university has rejected their demands and has instead asked them to make arrangements of funds for distributing salary.Vice chancellor of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, Prof Vinay Kumar Pathak said it is a difficult time and the university was trying to convince college management to distribute salary to teachers.“As a vice chancellor it is my duty to ensure that teachers and other staff are paid on time. I have spoken to chairman of colleges to find out ways. The university is going to make provision to get information related to salary payment of teachers,” he said.“On the university portal, the institute will have to update the information related to monthly salary paid to teachers. This will definitely benefit the teachers who are the backbone of the university,” vice chancellor said.On Tuesday, Pathak had interacted with teachers of private affiliated institutions through video conferencing to inquire if they have been receiving salary.Pathak said nearly 10% teachers in private colleges did not receive salary for March yet. The university administration is trying to pay the same.He also informed that the last date to fill the examination form is also being considered to be extended from April 30 to May 10.Controller of Examinations Prof Rajiv Kumar said that keeping in view the lockdown remuneration of teachers of digital evaluation will be paid by the end of this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/40k-aktu-teachers-may-get-reduced-or-no-salary-in-april/story-xaeBd7Fn7PgO2lFL76pLuN.html

All 50-55 sanitary workers of the firm have been sent on 14-day home quarantine. The cleaning work at the airport was now being done by the Patna Municipal Corporation, the source added.A sanitary worker at the airport had initially tested positive for Covid-19 on April 25. Four others tested positive on April 27 after authorities zeroed in on them while tracing the contacts of the first employee. The employee lives in Patna’s Khajpura locality, which has been sealed after it was declared a containment zone.Patna has 39 of Bihar’s 378 cases of the coronavirus disease and two deaths have been reported in the state capital so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/patna-dm-writes-to-airport-director-after-5-sanitary-workers-test-covid-19-positive/story-V6hLHHdY4QGnMsOPWiGsEN.html

29-04-2020||Lucknow||Muslim vendor rebuked in Lucknow: Another BJP MLA, same story||A day after a BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh was caught on camera urging people not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors, another BJP lawmaker rebuked a vegetable vendor on coming to know of his Muslim identity.Brajbhushan Rajput, MLA from Charkhari, in Mahoba, also warned the vendor to not sell vegetables in the area despite the fact that the BJP served a showcause notice to Suresh Tiwari, its MLA from Barhaj constituency in Deoria for a similar behaviour.The incident took place in Vishal Khand area of Gomti Nagar where Rajput lives.“None is allowed to play with Hindu sentiments. I asked for the vendor’s name but he lied. I asked for their identity card which too wasn’t provided. There have been reports of Muslim vendors spitting on fruits and vegetables to spread coronavirus. Naturally there is fear. What is the need for Muslims to cite Hindu names?” the Charkhari MLA said.Asked about the need to ask vendor’s name, the MLA appeared unrepentant and continued to play up the fact that the vendor tried to hide his identity.Udit Rajput, the MLA’s cousin and his assembly representative, felt the entire incident was being blown out of proportion.“Many vegetable vendors were found to be infected with coronavirus and had infected others. Also, there have been videos of many Muslim vendors spitting on fruits and vegetables. We need to be cautious and in a democratic country one is free to decide from whom to buy,” he said. “The vegetable vendor, an elderly person, fumbled when asked for his name. He initially said he was Rajkumar but when the MLA asked in a stern voice, he said he was Habibur Rehman. That’s when the doubt arose,” he said.The BJP had on Tuesday served showcause notices to two of its UP MLAs – Suresh Tiwari, the lawmaker from Barhaj, for a video urging people not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors and to Shyam Prakash, the lawmaker from Gopamau (reserved) assembly segment for asking refund of the amount he gave from his MLA fund and for levelling corruption charges against Hardoi health authorities in purchase of medical equipment.“Our national president had clarified that immediate action will be taken against BJP members who say anything like this. State chief too took immediate action against them. No one has the right to say anything which divides the society,” said BJP leader and UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh.“These are part of a carefully thought out strategy to polarise the society even further. For BJP politics comes first even during coronavirus pandemic,” Samajwadi Party leader IP Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/muslim-vendor-rebuked-in-lucknow-another-bjp-mla-same-story/story-HLVHj9Z3THPEtsviZ8qZdI.html
29-04-2020||Delhi||Items dependent on imports to face shortage in Delhi if lockdown continues: Report||The supply of several items like coffee, diapers, oil and cereals, which are dependent on imports, is expected to face shortage in Delhi if lockdown continues beyond May 3, a government panel said in its report. The panel said items of particular brands such as shampoos, moisturizers, biscuits, sanitizers and cigarettes are in short supply in the city markets. Some of the products of reputed companies may not be available on the shelves, resulting in an increase in sale of small and homemade brands, it said. Earlier this month, Chief Secretary Vijay Dev had constituted an empowered group on facilitating supply chain and logistics management for availability of necessary items, including food and medicines in Delhi in the wake of the coronavirus-induced lockdown. The high-empowered panel, headed by Food and Civil Supplies Commissioner Ankita Mishra Bundela, said all essential medicines are reported to be available. She said there is no report about scarcity of essential medicines, but factories are told to be operating at less than 50 per cent of their capacity. “The distributors may not be able to make supplies of all medicines if the production remains affected at the source level for a long time,” it said. In its first report submitted to the chief secretary, the panel said there is a general shortage of labour for loading and unloading of goods.“The products of some of the prominent Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) are not available at some of the stores, but the goods of alternative brand/homemade brand are generally available,” it said. The nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to arrest the spread of coronavirus has been extended till May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/items-dependent-on-imports-to-face-shortage-in-delhi-if-lockdown-continues-report/story-JqeOSOkdHXVUcdaCUmzW0M.html

29-04-2020||Kolkata||Covid-19: Bengal’s very own Santa Claus secretly providing food packets to poor||For the past two weeks, something strange has been happening every night, in villages on the fringes of Santiniketan in Bolpur town of Bengal’s Birbhum district.Somebody has been leaving packets of food items and other essentials, at the doorsteps of some huts and shanties. And the recipients are always those who have lost their livelihoods in the lockdown, and now count among the poorest of the poor in those villages.So who is this ‘Santa Claus’ and how is he able to identify the dwellings of the neediest? Until recently, no one had a clue. Then one day, somebody spotted the Good Samaritan on his rounds of distributing food and - Shyamal Maji’s cover was blown.Thirty-six- year- old Maji is a private tutor in Bolpur, a man of modest income and hardly well-off himself. Yet for the past two weeks, Maji and his flock of students - all from Bolpur and its environs - have been providing food to helpless people amid the ongoing lockdown due to Covid-19 disease across the nation. But why at night, when nobody can see them?Maji is a reluctant speaker and initially refused to be photographed.“Look, I don’t want any fame and would rather remain behind the wings. These people were mainly wage labourers who are jobless now. They still go out every day in search of work and are home at nightfall. But not all of them would like to stand in a queue for food, as some feel ashamed to seek help from others and would rather go hungry,” Maji said.Maji has been giving tuition since 2006, and gets almost 200 – 250 students each year at his coaching centre. His network of students runs into a few thousands, and since he only teaches high school students and undergraduates, most are adults and many already employed.“I have formed a 10-man team to accompany me on this job every night,” Majji says. “Since my students live scattered all over the area we operate in, they identify the neediest in their respective hamlets. Help pours in from the students themselves. Some are employed, others come from well-to-do-families and they all donate generously. Yet others chip in with whatever they can - sometimes with packets of puffed rice,” he added.The recipients of Maji’s kindness are too poor to afford mobiles themselves, but have told their neighbours that Maji’s food packets are like godsends.“Seventy-year-old Balai Kisku of my village, received a packet one night. He was so elated that we could actually see happiness and a sense of relief writ large on his face. He used to make thatched roofs for huts in the village but has been idle since the lockdown,” said Uttam Das of Bolpur’s Bondanga village. Das discovered only later, that the man behind the generous deed was none other than his own son’s tutor, Shyamal Maji. “It was good to know that Maji helped Kisku and others, without blowing his own trumpet,” Das added. Sixty-year-old mason, Paru Murmu, of the same village was initially reluctant to accept Maji’s packets but once he did, the aid came as a great relief to him too.“The people whom we choose to help are the poorest of the poor. It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to do so, but we would prefer to remain in the shadows and work from behind the wings,” said Taraknath Das, a student on Maji’s team. Each packet that he leaves on doorsteps contains around two kilos of rice, potatoes, some vegetables, cooking oil, salt, puffed rice and a soap.“Sometimes I see people clicking photos while providing relief to poor people. One poor, needy man gets one kilo of rice and 15 persons gather around to click a photo. Is that what you are providing relief for?” Das asked.Shyamal Maji, the tutor setting a worthy example for hundreds of young wards, is himself the father of a four-year-old daughter. He says that it is his wife’s cooperation and encouragement alone, that has given him the courage to help others less fortunate then his own family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/covid-19-bengal-s-very-own-santa-claus-secretly-providing-food-packets-to-poor/story-pjJg0soKVTtpmTYI13OjNL.html

They asked the name of a person who takes bath after a week). When Sandeep asks what did he say.

29-04-2020||Lucknow||Police Mitra donating blood even in lockdown||Photographs and reports of Good Samaritans in Khaki are only just emerging. However, a police group has been on a mission of saving lives for four years now.The Police Mitra, headed by constable Ashish Mishra, has saved thousands of lives by donating blood for the last few years, especially to those belonging to the poor and marginalised sections, who often fail to arrange blood on time. Even during the lockdown, members of the group, mostly policemen, are donating blood to patients in need.“We have provided blood to over 30 patients across the state since the lockdown began. The group includes donors from all walks of life, but mostly policemen, who rush for help as soon as we receive a call from attendants of the patient. Although, most of the policemen are on duty during lockdown, they still take out time to arrange blood, as every minute is important in emergency cases,” Mishra said.However, Mishra and other members often face problems while they are out to help patients in lockdown. Policemen in uniform usually do not face problems crossing checkpoints to reach hospitals or the blood bank, but other volunteers, like social activists, students and common citizens have to explain the reason for venturing out at checkpoints and are often turned back, Mishra said.“It will be of great help if a pass for all members of Police Mitra in the state is issued by authorities concerned,” he said.The Police Mitra regularly organises blood donation camps and a record was made during the Kumbh. Constable Ashish Mishra, social media cell in charge at IG Prayagraj Range office, had been honoured by the DGP for his service to society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/police-mitra-donating-blood-even-in-lockdown/story-tK9qcDwBzXzHHzATt46xEP.html

He alleged that he escaped the civic body’s quarantine facility as it did not provide food to patients and lacked basic amenities like clean washrooms. On Tuesday evening neighbours found the senior citizen sitting helplessly outside his home, which was locked up since the rest of his family members were also quarantined after some of them also tested positive for Covid-19.When locals found that the old man, who had tested positive for coronavirus on April 25, had arrived at his house, they informed the authorities. The matter then reached to Yerawada area corporator Siddharth Dhende who arranged for an ambulance to take away him to isolation facility. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I informed the authorities to immediately rehabilitate the elderly man. I learned that even civic officials were not even aware about that he had disappeared. He was a suspected coronavirus case and was first sent to the Rakshaknagar quarantine facility in Kharadi on April 24. Next day, he was detected positive and he was shifted to Balewadi’s National Institute of Construction Management and Research (NICMAR) facility,” the coporator said.Dhende also expressed concerns regarding the lack of basic amenities in the quarantine facilities and urged the higher authorities to look into the matter. The elderly man’s son, who had also tested positive for Covid-19 arrived with an ambulance and convinced the man to move into the quarantine facility again. The son managed to convince his father after over two hours. The officials said that thankfully the elderly man did not come in contact with anyone else on his way from isolation facility to home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/70-year-old-covid-19-patient-flees-isolation-facility-walks-17-km-to-reach-home/story-dkIrixmmcP272lw1Cf0JNP.html

29-04-2020||Lucknow||Allow azaan, Ghazipur MP writes to Allahabad HC CJ||Afzal Ansari, Member of Parliament, Ghazipur, has written a letter to the Chief Justice of Allahabad high court highlighting the prohibitory order banning azaan (call to prayer) by the district administration.In a letter dated April 26, Ansari claims that an oral order was passed in this regard by the district magistrate prohibiting azaan in the district. He tried to contact several authorities but there was no response. “Everyone is talking about some oral order but its source and authority has not been disclosed,” Ansari said in the letter.It is stated in the letter that everyone has been diligently following the coronavirus induced lockdown and prayers and gathering in mosques or any other religious places continue to be prohibited but azaan was allowed in every mosque throughout the state and other parts of the country.The letter stipulates that all of a sudden from April 24 onwards it was found that the azaan from mosques is prohibited by the local administration and the police said that if anyone dared to make azaan they would be booked under the National Security Act. In light of this, the MP said that since Ramadan was the month of prayers and this time everyone had decided to pray from their respective homes, azaan was essential as it alerts people about the time of prayer, especially at the time of “Sahree and Iftaar”.Praying for directions from the court to allow azaan by only one person ie Moazzin (man appointed at mosque to call for prayers) from the respective mosque within the district, the petitioner avers that doing so would protect fundamental rights of people of Ghazipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/allow-azaan-ghazipur-mp-writes-to-allahabad-hc-cj/story-lwCQPFo9MuLTFHQk8b3LgP.html

Also, there is proper power supply arrangement to ensure the labourers can charge their mobile phones and keep in touch with their families,” said a Shahjahanpur administration official.He said while 300 migrants have arrived in Kheri, those in Shahjahanpur have been kept in various shelter homes. This includes 150 labourers in a facility at Tilhar, 214 in Powayan, 108 in Sadar, 66 in Kalaan and 53 in Jalalabad. Nine labourers from other districts are also quarantined here, with 10 labourers having Covid-19 symptoms kept separately in Kalaan. Their samples will be sent for testing, the official said.Likewise in Kheri, 90 migrants have been quarantined in Mohammadi, 68 in Gola, 44 in Mitauli, 58 in Dhaurahra and 41 in Palia. Medical screening of all labourers was completed at CHCs of respective tehsils, and suspects are being kept separate from the rest.“The labourers have been divided into separate batches and sent to their respective tehsils. Every shelter house will have police for security to ensure no one runs away,” said Shahjahanpur district information officer Alok Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-repatriates-900-migrant-workers-to-shahjahanpur-kheri/story-ZQcBe6sbUPxNnDuhaRK5fP.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana PWD advises against use of ACs in offices to prevent Covid-19 spread||In view of chances of spread of coronavirus in an air-conditioned environment, the Haryana government on Tuesday recommended that air conditioning should not be used in offices or used restrictively.An advisory issued by the public works department (PWD) after consultations with the health department stated that Covid-19 spreads due to droplets and when these droplets mix with dust particles and set on different material, they become all the more infectious.“If the environment of an area is cool and air conditioned, the virus remains there for a longer time. Proper ventilation and increase in temperature reduces the magnitude of virus spread in that particular area. So, air conditioning should be used under strict restriction when absolutely needed. Open window gives better ventilation and is very effective for controlling the transmission of disease. Hence, it is recommended that air conditioning should not be used in offices or be used very restrictively,” said the advisory.It is advisable not to operate centralised air conditioning system in the present scenario because even if the return air ducts are closed, contamination can spread within the room as office spaces are occupied by multiple persons.Allow natural or mechanical ventilation in hospitalsThe PWD has recommended to keep the central air conditioning system non-operational in healthcare facilities and allow natural ventilation by opening windows and doors in quarantine and isolation wards, morgues, waste zone, screening and triage area, staff area, waiting rooms in hospitals. It also recommended mechanical ventilation by using exhaust fans in sampling room, severe and critical cases wards.“In district hospital, where there is sufficient space, natural ventilation should be allowed. Isolation facilities should have large windows on opposite walls of the room allowing a natural unidirectional flow (top to down) and air changes. The principle of natural ventilation is to allow and enhance the flow of outdoor air by natural forces such as wind and thermal buoyancy forces from one opening to another to achieve the desirable air change per hour,” the communication said.Keep ACs on in vacant rooms onlyThe advisory said that for residential use, fans should be operated with windows kept partly open. If an exhaust fan is located at a nearby location, then it must be kept running to exhaust air for better ventilation.Desert coolers are useful in drawing air from outside to ensure good ventilation and windows must be kept open to release the humid air. Portable room coolers that do not draw air from outside are not recommended.Room ACs (windows and split) should be switched on in a vacant room in the absence of people to cool the premises. However, they should be switched off on arrival of people. Ceiling fans should be kept running. Adequate ventilation must be ensured by opening the windows, the advisory said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-pwd-advises-against-use-of-acs-in-offices/story-3UAznLaprzr95CgL2T32BL.html

Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said all patients from the district are asymptomatic. The administration, which had earlier escorted the pilgrims and students to their homes in taxis and PCR vehicles, on Tuesday turned up at their doors to take them to a health facility on Chandigarh Road, after 12 persons who had returned from Nanded, a popular Sikh shrine in Maharashtra, tested positive for Covid-19.Dr Bagga said the reports had been received from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and had been shared with the ICMR.

He said administration had made the arrangements to quarantine all the persons retuning from Nanded.Around 3,000-odd pilgrims had been stranded in Hazur Sahib, one of the five temporal seats of Sikhs, in Nanded district of Maharashtra after imposition of a nationwide lockdown. These pilgrims, which belong to different parts of Punjab, have been returning in batches.SOCIAL DISTANCING GOES FOR A TOSSThough the health department had said that pilgrims based in Moranwali, who returned from Nanded on Saturday, were quarantined as soon as they landed but sources say they first went to the village gurdwara to pay obeisance. On Monday, some panchayat members also went to their residences to offer ‘siropas’ to them. The health workers are now busy identifying their contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/five-more-hazur-sahib-pilgrims-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-punjab/story-5SW2GoOK6BJeHxZpTyKxYO.html

29-04-2020||Education||Patna High Court directs state, Centre to help stranded students in Kota and elsewhere||The Patna High Court on Tuesday directed the Bihar government and the Centre to make all arrangements for the students stranded in Kota (Rajasthan) and elsewhere in the country.The court said it would not be appropriate for it to pass an order on merit of the case without giving the opportunity to the Union of India to file counter affidavit and while a writ of similar nature is pending before the Supreme Court.Hearing a bunch of four public interest litigations (PILs) through video conferencing, the bench of Justice Hemant Kumar Srivastava and Justice Rajendra Kumar Mishra fixed May 5 as the next date for hearing. On May 4, a writ petition filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan is to come up for another hearing before the apex court and the Centre has to file its response.Additional Solicitor General SD Sanjay, appearing for the Union of India, sought a week’s time from the court, saying the Centre was in the process of preparing a detailed protocol for interstate movement of the migrants back to their native places in accordance with the SC order. “Once that is ready, it will be filed in the Patna HC,” he said.Bhushan had filed the PIL urging the apex court for direction to the Centre to allow migrants to return to their home towns and villages after undergoing test for Covid-19 and provide them facilities for safe return. The apex court has sought Centre’s response on that. Advocate General Lalit Kishor, appearing for the Bihar government, reiterated state’s stand made in its earlier reply to the registrar general of the Patna HC. The state government had stated that though it was sensitive to the plight of students stranded outside, bringing them back in the midst of lockdown was not desirable, as it would tantamount to violation of the guidelines issued by the ministry of home affairs and subject them as well as others to undue risk.Four PILs, including one by advocate Ajay Thakur whose representation to the chief justice had evoked response from the government, have been filed in Patna HC in connection with the issue of Bihar migrant labourers and students stranded in different parts of the country.Thakur said that he apprised the court of the problems being faced by the students stranded in Kota and other parts of the country for over a month and how other states were making arrangements to bring back their students and migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/patna-high-court-directs-state-centre-to-help-stranded-students-in-kota-and-elsewhere/story-7E7JlXHlwEw4bM3P8q4qJJ.html
29-04-2020||Education||‘Schools push parents to buy costly books, stationery’||The booklist for the new academic session, released by private schools in the state capital, is putting a strain on the parents’ wallet.Parents of school-going children alleged the school managements were compelling them to buy a good quantity of books of private publishers along with stationaries from the school counters or shops, which could be easily done away with.Sailesh Kumar, whose daughter studies in Class 8, claimed that he had to buy books and stationaries worth Rs 4,800 of which around Rs 1200 was spent on stationary only. “The school counter is offering books along with notebooks and few stationary items. They are not giving us option to buy books separately,” said Kumar.Another parent Neetu Jaiswal, whose daughter studies in class 7, said, “The school has increased number of books to mint money. They prescribe multiple books for each subject, which are expensive and seldom taught in classrooms.”Sunil Verma, father of a class 9 student, complained that the school management is forcing parents to buy reference books along with NCERT books. “Reference books are costlier. All NCERT books of class 9 can be purchased in Rs. 1000 to 1500, but reference books cost around Rs 3000 to Rs 4000,” said Verma.Rekha Shrivastava said, “We have no option but to buy stationaries from schools as they have pre-printed school logos on stationary items which is compulsory item and unavailable in market.” On the other hand, general manager of a private school, who wished not to be identified, said, “We provide books and stationary kit to parents for their convenience. The kit consists stationary items, which are essential for project works and competitions which take place regularly.”C B Singh, president of Association of Independent Schools, said, “Parents are free to buy books from anywhere as per prescribed books list. If any book store or school counter is offering them combined kit, they can refuse and ask for selective items.”Earlier in February, divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal had also issued instructions for all the private schools to upload their fee structure and book list price on their official website by March 31. However, most of the schools have not adhered to his order yet.On Tuesday, the regional deputy director of education Surendra Kumar Sinha, said, “It is violation of Bihar Private School (Fee Regulation) Act 2019, if parents are forced to buy books and stationaries from the school. The parents can lodge complaint through email at rdde.patna@gmail.com. The department will take action against the schools after probing matter.”Sinha added that he had received complaints against several schools and the department was going to serve show-cause notice soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/schools-push-parents-to-buy-costly-books-stationery/story-JjNc5jcJyHZE3ti7Zym4eP.html

In the letter, Nizam has said the state needs a stable government as it is facing a public health emergency.“Article 163 clearly states that the Governor is required to exercise his functions on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. Further, it is important to note that Maharashtra is in a state of a medical emergency and has the highest number of Covid-19 cases. There is every reason to ensure a stable government, as the current one, is in place and at the helm Uddhav Thackeray as MLC and a chief minister. Hence, my client humbly prays that the nomination of Uddhav Thackeray by the state council of ministers pending since April 10 is allowed at the earliest in the spirit of democracy, rule of law and justice,” states the letter. Thackeray, who was sworn in as chief minister on November 28 last year has to get elected to one of the two houses of state legislature within six months, else he will have to resign. In that case, the entire cabinet will have to resign. The six-month period in Thackeray’s case is ending on May 27.Thackeray had planned to contest a by-election to the legislative council, but it got postponed due to Covid-19 outbreak.The governor has powers to appoint people on 12 seats that come from various walks of life such as arts, culture, literature and social service. Of them, two seats are currently vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lawyer-writes-to-president-maharashtra-governor-on-cm-s-mlc-nomination/story-FSvK1AmVna12DG4I7DTw8L.html

29-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi among 15 areas that make up 60% Covid-19 cases||Delhi and 14 districts across the country account for over 60% of all Covid-19 cases reported in India, according to data from the federal think tank Niti Aayog, whose chief executive officer Amitabh Kant says diligent monitoring, and aggressive testing, treating and containment are required to check the spread of the disease. Delhi, which has 11 districts, accounts for 12.62% of all cases in the country as of Monday. Mumbai and Indore feature among the list of the 14 other districts.“Our job is to present the nationwide picture, but it is the state governments that have to take strong, ruthless containment measures, more testing, isolation, and treatment in order to bring the number of cases down,” Kant told HT. “ These are the 15 places that have reported more than 1% of India’s cases and it is here that we have to flatten the curve to win the fight against the virus,” said Kant. There are 33 other districts that have reported over 100 cases each so far, he said.Along with the data, Niti Aayog also presented a weekly trend of the number of cases, which shows that most of the states with these 15 high-case burden areas have started showing a decline other than Maharashtra and Delhi.“However, it is not enough to show a decline over one week, this has to be consistent for three to four weeks to be a correct indication of a downward trend. This is the reason I have also put up Kerala’s trends, which has shown week on week constant decline. We must learn from what Kerala did,” said Kant.Most of the 15 places referred to by the Niti Aayog are big cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad. Experts believe this is mainly due to density of the population in these cities and testing bias.These cities account for a big chunk of cases reported from their respective states – Mumbai accounts for 33% of cases in Maharashtra; Ahmedabad accounts for 66% of the cases from Gujarat; Indore accounts for 49.5% cases in Madhya Pradesh; and Hyderabad accounts for 55.6% of the cases in Telangana.“If you see the bigger cities, the population is dense leading to a faster spread of infectious diseases. Also, when it comes to testing, we have a track record of testing more in the urban areas,” said Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology department at Christian Medical College, Vellore.In Delhi too, the areas with the highest number of cases are those with a high proportion of slums and resettlement colonies.“The analysis by NitiAayog is wrong in considering Delhi as one whole. It is not that entire Delhi is reporting high number of cases, but certain districts are. The districts where this is happening, there are slums and resettlement colonies where maintaining social distancing is not possible,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of public health at Safdarjung Hospital.Experts say that it is community engagement rather than lockdowns that can help bring down the number of cases. “What we need to do is engage with the community, make them responsible for ensuring social distancing and other measures,” said Dr Kishore.Dr John cited the example of Kerala, where authorities were quarantining all those who travelled to the state, whether from abroad or other parts of India. “Maybe the government should have gone into communities in places like Mumbai’s Dharavi and explained about the disease, asked them to start wearing masks a month ago. Cities like Ahmedabad where the population density is lower can still implement these measures, but for bigger cities like Delhi and Mumbai, all the government can do now is firefight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-among-15-areas-that-make-up-60-covid-19-cases/story-DLYOanzKMAtEpgKoiCrDNP.html
29-04-2020||City||Day after dropping them home, Ludhiana quarantines pilgrims, students||After 12 persons from the state who recently returned from Nanded, a popular Sikh shrine in Maharashtra, tested positive for Covid-19, the Ludhiana health department swung into action and sent all 56 pilgrims from the district and 25 students who had returned from Kota, Rajasthan, to a quarantine facility at Mother and Child Hospital on Chandigarh road.Confirming the development, the hospital’s senior medical officer Dr Amita Jain said that samples of all persons who recently entered the state, are being collected and sent for testing. She said they have also been placed under quarantine and decision on the further course of action will be taken after their reports come.The administration, which had earlier escorted the pilgrims and students to their homes in taxis and PCR vehicles, turned up at the homes on Tuesday and took them back to the health facility.Sources said the health department faced mild resistance as some of the pilgrims and students who had barely spent a day at home after remaining stranded for over a month were reluctant to visit the hospital.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal informed that as per the latest protocol of the health department, testing of all persons who returned from Nanded (Maharashtra) and Kota (Rajasthan) was being done and they have been kept in quarantine.Dr Rajesh Bagga said the decision has been taken to identify the asymptotic patients and curtail the further spread of virus.MAJOR REPRIEVE FOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTIn a major reprieve for the health department, 10 primary contacts of the food supply inspector, who is the husband of the Covid positive block development and panchayat Officer (BDPO), tested negative for the virus. Besides, the department received 106 samples and all were found to be negative, stated civil surgeon Dr Bagga.On the other hand, DC Pradeep Agrawal stated that as many as 1,991 samples have been taken in the district so far, out of which reports of 1,670 have been received, and 1,649 samples have been found negative.He informed that 21 samples were found to be positive, that includes 18 from Ludhiana and three from other districts.He informed that five patients have lost their lives, while seven patients have been fully cured after treatment and discharged from hospital.He stated that so far nine (8 from Ludhiana and one from another district) active patients are left in the district. He informed that no positive case have been reported from the district in the last 24 hours.He assured that the health of active patients in the district is improving and second sample of three such patients have been sent, and if that the report is negative, another test would be done after 24 hours (of the second test) and if that report is also negative, then the patients would be discharged from the hospital. He informed that the second sample of the patients is taken after 14 days (when they test positive).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-dropping-them-home-ludhiana-quarantines-pilgrims-students/story-tiPnzS9tmShzUtZJEu1iHJ.html
29-04-2020||City||At 29%, J&K’s recovery from Covid-19 better than national average of 23%||Despite coronavirus infections going past 564 in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, the state is showing a healthy recovery rate with few patients needing ventilator support. In fact, J&K recovery percentage at 29% is more than the national average which stands at 23%, as on Tuesday evening.Experts said this could indicate better immunity or a weaker strain of virus in the Valley. They also said that those who were infected in the Valley did not need ventilator support during their ailment.Of 29,974 Covid cases in the country, 6,868 have recovered, taking the national recovery rate to 23%, while 939 have died, putting the national figure at 3.1%.Till Tuesday evening, J&K had 564 cases, with eight deaths which makes for around 1.41% death rate, and 164 recoveries makes a recovery rate of around 29%.In Kashmir, with 134 out of 507 cases having recovered, the recovery translates into 26.4% and six deaths make for 1.18 %.Dr Salim Khan, head of the department of social and preventive medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, said that people must not panic as positive cases in Kashmir are around 500. He said, “This is due to aggressive testing of contacts of declared positive patients. As of now severe cases from the community coming to hospital is very negligible and the situation shows no cause for alarm, but we still cannott lower our guard.’’Dr Khan, also the nodal officer of Covid-19 team, said that 1000–1500 samples are tested every day, so 20–30 covid cases will show up. Our percentage of positive cases according to number of tests is around 3 to 4%, less than many other states. It also varies from state to state as per testing of samples,’’ he said.Currently every suspicious patient in Kashmir is tested on an urgent basis, he added.Dr Amjid Ali, consultant at GMC Baramulla, which has seen many Covid cases, said there were two possibilities—either the strain of virus is weak or people here have a good immunity. “People in Ladakh and Jammu are more alert to social distancing, and if in we seriously abide by precautions, cases will come down in Valley, too.’’ However, he said that no research has been conducted yet but these are the indicators from the patient records coming to various hospitals and Covid-19 designated centres.Baramulla district , with three deaths, has 67 positive cases so far, and half the Valley’s Covid-19 deaths have been from this district. However, doctors say that most patients admitted in the medical college didn’t need any ventilator support, and 21 patients were discharged after recovery.“Most patients are fine and didn’t require medical intervention other than the required protocol for Covid patients across the country. Despite fresh cases showing up, our recovery rate is very encouraging,’’ said Dr Masood, the medical superintendent of Baramulla Medical College.Medical personnel are optimistic at SKIMS, one of J&K’s biggest hospitals which has admitted the maximum number of Covid-19 patients in Kashmir. “The recovery of patients is a good sign. I think God has been kind to us,’’ said Dr Farooq Jan, medical superintendent at SKIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-29-j-k-s-recovery-from-covid-19-better-than-national-average-of-23/story-tcQ5NznR94SYdGJypmM15M.html

The depleting stocks have posed a threat to the survival of the bovines.The cow shelter is run by a non-government organisation (NGO), Gauri Shanker Sewa Dal, from the past 10 years and is dependent on donations from visitors.The vice-president of the NGO, who manages the cow shelter, Vinod Kumar, said due to the lockdown, there had been a sharp decline in the footfall of visitors which has resulted in fiscal crunch. Also, people used to bring green fodder to feed the cows,” he added.He said around 40 labourers who worked in the shelter were also dependent on donations for their wages.Kumar added, “As few villages of Punjab have completely banned the entry and exit of people, we are unable to contact the fodder suppliers, and new suppliers are selling the fodder on higher rates. However, presently we are borrowing the fodder. But we need to clear the dues after lockdown.”He said they will need the support of administration and people.Presently, the shelter hosts more than 1,000 cows and for each cow, around 25kg fodder, including 15kg green grass and 10kg dry grass, is required per day which brings the total cost to around Rs 70, 000. Despite several attempts, the municipal corporation commissioner KK Yadav could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cows-fight-for-survival-as-chandigarh-s-sector-45-gaushala-faces-fodder-shortage-amid-lockdown/story-lSgo84WN095jQ1erWn9PbI.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s doubling rate increased to 10 days||Mumbai’s doubling rate of cases has now gone upto 10 days, from the doubling rate of 7 days calculated for the city five or six days ago. Doubling rate simply means the amount of time or number of days that are needed for number of cases to double.Additional Municipal Commissioner incharge of the health department Suresh Kakani said on Tuesday, “Mumbai’s doubling rate has gone upto 10 days now, that was once at 4 or 5 days in the initial stages of the outbreak.”Kakani also said that BMC noticed a lot of positive cases emerged from those in quarantine already, that has helped contain the spread, as these people cannot come in contact with anyone in the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-doubling-rate-increased-to-10-days/story-vlg5IaQMtTWC35q43bU2dP.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||Dip in Mumbai’s asymptomatic cases||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) revised its guidelines for testing suspected Covid-19 cases in Mumbai on April 15, with a circular that directed all assistant commissioners not to collect samples from any person not showing Covid-19 symptoms such as cough or fever, the percentage of asymptomatic cases among those who have tested positive has gone down to 35% to 40%, as per data available for April 22. Until mid-April, the number of asymptomatic cases among those who tested positive ranged upto 70% to 80% of the total cases.Through this change in approach, the percentage positivity (number of positive patients emerging from the total number of tests done) of the city increased to 6.7% on April 23, as opposed to 4.5% on April 15, according to the BMC. On April 15, the BMC issued a circular as per Indian Council of Medical Research’s guidelines, directing all assistant commissioners (or ward officers) and lab incharge not to collect samples from persons not showing any symptoms.This circular mandates that testing will only be done for symptomatic persons (who have cough, fever), symptomatic high-risk contacts of Covid-19 positive patients, people over 60 years of age who are high-risk contacts of Covid-19 positive patients whether they are showing symptoms or not, healthcare workers, pregnant women if they are risk contacts of patients, and patients on dialysis and chemotherapy. The circular barred any persons not showing symptoms from getting tested. Meanwhile asymptomatic high-risk contacts of positive patients can get if they develop symptoms, or after careful observation between 5 and 14 days of contact.The civic body’s rationale was to effectively utilize its testing capacity. Until then, the percentage positivity in the city stood at 4.5%. As of April 22, between 35% and 40% of the patients are asymptomatic, and between 40% to 45% of the patients are symptomatic.On the other hand, the BMC scaled up its testing per day. The present average of tests per day rests at 2,200. According to the BMC, number of tests conducted per day increases by 3% daily. On April 17, the BMC conducted its maximum number of single-day tests, at 4200, as of data available on April 22.According to the BMC data, upto March 31, Mumbai conducted an average of 300 tests per day. In the first week of April, this figure increased to 1,000+ tests a day, in the second week of April it increased to 2,000+ a day, and in the third week of April it increased 3,000+ tests a day. On April 1, BMC conducted 1100 tests per day; on April 7 it increased to 1700 tests per day; on April 8 it increased to 2200 tests per day; on April 15 it increased to 2700 tests per day; on April 16 it increased to 3100 tests per day; and on April 22 it increased to 3,700 per day. Approximately 4500 tests are being done in the city per million population of Mumbai.A senior civic officer said, “With focused testing on those who really need it, we are getting better results. We decided not to screen asymptomatic risk contacts of positive patients too soon, to avoid a false negative. Doing a test within the first five days can lead to a negative result, as the virus can take up to 7 days from the day of contraction to show up in a test. They are kept under observation and quarantine.”Daksha Shah, BMC’s deputy executive health officer, said “We are rigourously testing. We are testing high-risk contacts of positive patients, even if they are asymptomatic. According to ICMR guidelines, they are being tested between five and 14 days from the day of contact, for more accurate results. Once you are a positive patient, regardless of whether you are asymptomatic or symptomatic, your high-risk contacts and with comorbidity are tested between five and 14 days.”Sanjay Pattiwar, independent public health consultant, said, “We have to rationalise and use our test resources judicially, as they are depleting. Our priority, or any government’s priority in cases of shortage of supply during such a health emergency should be safeguarding patients, patients’ contacts, health workers, symptomatic, and then asymptomatic, in that order. Asymptomatic patients have lower threat of transmitting the diseases, as they are not showing symptoms such as cough, cold. They have lower scope of throwing the virus out of their bodies. Besides with recent awareness of wearing masks, and personal hygiene, 90% chance of transmission of asymptomatic persons transmitting it is reduced. People now are sensitised, and are careful not to touch their face, or eyes when they go out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dip-in-mumbai-s-asymptomatic-cases/story-NouVBuqDlxRqmXenvlsY0I.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s doubling rate dips below national average for the first time||At 6.64 days, Chandigarh’s Covid-19 cases, for the first time, doubled faster than the national average of 10.2 days on Tuesday.The doubling rate is the average calculated by using growth over the past seven days. This has prompted the UT administration to test each and every symptomatic person in the “affected pockets”.Amid the developments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dialled UT administrator VPS Badnore to take stock of the situation in the city.Apprising Modi about the steps taken to fight Covid-19, Badnore explained how health authorities were dealing with infected patients and others coming from neighbouring states to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16.Badnore also told Modi that the tricity authorities were cooperating and coordinating effectively, it was learnt.According to the Union health ministry guidelines, states and union territories had to calculate the doubling rate on a daily or weekly basis, and in case the rate fell below four, the area was designated a red zone, where curfew and other relaxations were not allowed.Significantly, the city was declared a Covid-19 hotspot by the Central government on April 15 and a “containment” zone on April 18 by the administration. A curfew was imposed in the city on March 24, which will remain in force up to May 3.The problem areasThe administration had also declared three areas in the city, Dhanas Kachi Colony, Sector 30B and Bapu Dham Colony as affected pockets, where strict restrictions on movement have been imposed.As many as 31 cases were reported positive from here, including 16 from Bapu Dham Colony and 14 from Sector 30B.The UT administration would be testing each and every symptomatic person in these areas, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said on Tuesday. Health workers were screening the pockets.On Tuesday, 13 of the 14 fresh Covid-19 positives cases were reported from Bapu Dham (8) and Sector 30B (5).“The outbreak needs to be contained by focusing all our energy and resources in these pockets,” Parida said.Apart from sealing the area, help from local volunteers and leaders would be taken to ensure locals maintain social distancing.“CCTV cameras would be installed and drones used to check if social distancing norms were being followed. Regular police patrolling would also be done,” Parida added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/all-symptomatic-persons-to-be-tested-in-affected-pockets/story-JTB0SXZ4yAS8owsproqnGK.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||Record flamingo numbers may clip wings of golf course project in Navi Mumbai||Close to a record 9,000 flamingos congregating across the Talawe wetlands in Navi Mumbai during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown has put the (golf) ball in the Maharashtra’s government’s court. The choice is between marking the area a conservation reserve or to go ahead with the plan of developing a golf course.The area is government land and its possession is with the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco), which plans to develop a golf course at the site. After the past month — in which the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has estimated that flamingo numbers are 25% more than last year’s owing to lower human activity — the state mangrove cell intends on protecting the Talawe wetlands as a buffer to the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary, said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). “This area is currently government land, but possession is with Cidco. The mangrove cell has asked for a no-objection certificate and sought comments from the planning authority and the district collector on declaring the zone a conservation reserve. Once we get a response, we will finalise the plan. We are also checking whether any peripheral areas were handed over to developers so far,” said Tiwari.According to the Union environment ministry, conservation reserves are protected areas that act as buffer zones or connectors and migration corridors between established national parks, wildlife sanctuaries or reserved and protected forests of India. There are 88 conservation reserves in India across 12 states.The Talawe wetlands are located near the Seawoods NRI housing complex and Training Ship Chanakya (TSC). The area has large stretches of abandoned paddy fields and scrub (200m wide 1.5 km long), which is separated from the seashore by a strip of mangroves (100-200m wide and 1.5km long). The east side is a residential area, while mangroves border the north and south.The overall area suggested for protection by BNHS includes: a 783-hectare foraging area and a 46-hectare core area, which includes the 14-hectare TSC and 21.9-hectare NRI complex. The area has 58 bird species, 33 migratory species, eight near-threatened, two vulnerable, two species protected under schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and four under schedule IV, according to BNHS.Cidco’s plans to develop a golf course have been opposed by environmentalists and residents. “Construction work for 17 buildings with 1,564 flats and 20 offices has already begun towards the landward side as we received a commencement certificate from the state. However, there is no clarity on the fate of the 18-hole golf course construction towards Seawoods, and we are not sure whether it is feasible,” said Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco. “It is our commitment to protect mangroves and wildlife, and we will assist the forest department in their requirements.”Flamingo numbers in the area this year have been much more than of previous years, crossing the 8,500 mark in April 2020, said BNHS. “This is excellent news and should be pursued at the highest level. We congratulate the mangrove cell for taking this proposal forward,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS.“There was already a concurrence from the state wildlife board in 2015 to declare the site as a part of the sanctuary, and the current flock of flamingos is testimony to the need to conserve this zone. More so, this will avoid large congregations near the runway of the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/record-flamingo-numbers-may-clip-wings-of-golf-course-project-in-navi-mumbai/story-XpwFGvQGSBVIRevLubC1iI.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin man jailed for lying about having Covid-19, spitting at police in UK||An Indian-origin London-based man has been jailed for eight months after he spat at police custody staff after lying about having Covid-19 because he was “angry”, Scotland Yard said on Tuesday.Karan Singh, 23, pleaded guilty at the Croydon Crown court to three counts of assault on an emergency worker, use of threatening, abusive, insulting words, behaviour to cause harassment, alarm, distress and possession of a class B drug (cannabis).He was sentenced immediately to four months’ imprisonment. He was also sentenced to an additional four months’ jail, to run consecutively, for being in breach of a suspended sentence – making his total sentence eight months.The police said on March 14, officers were on patrol when they spotted Singh sitting in a car in a driveway in Croydon. Officers recognised Singh as being disqualified from driving and so they approached the car and spoke to him.Singh denied he was disqualified from driving and said he had been given his licence back. As officers were speaking to Singh, they noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from him and the vehicle. Officers asked him about the smell and he admitted to smoking cannabis.As one of the officers began explaining the grounds for a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Singh attempted to start the engine of the vehicle and make off from police. The vehicle stalled and officers were able to detain him.A snap bag of cannabis was found and Singh admitted to having cannabis for personal use. Singh was arrested and when he was taken to a south London police station, he was said to have been verbally abusive to the interviewing officers. Following the interview, Singh became aggressive and said he would not go back to his cell. He had to be physically taken back by a custody sergeant and PC, with a DC and designated detention officer (DDO) also stepping in to support their colleagues.Once at the cell door, Singh continued to struggle with the officers. The officers managed to get him into the cell and when the door was partially closed, Singh spat directly into the custody sergeant’s face. Some of the spit also hit the DDO’s lip and the DC’s cheek.Singh then tried to prevent officers from closing the cell door, during which he told the custody sergeant that he had coronavirus. He was further arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker.Following the incident, he was interviewed behind his cell door for safety reasons. He admitted to spitting at the officers stating he did it because he had been waiting for hours and he “got stressed out”.Superintendent Dan Knowles said: “It is never acceptable to spit at an emergency worker, whether it is during these unprecedented times or not. Singh carrying out this vile act and then lying about having coronavirus was a deplorable thing to do and it caused a great deal of distress for the officers and staff who were just trying to do their job and keep London safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-origin-man-jailed-for-lying-about-having-covid-19-spitting-at-police-in-uk/story-frakTKhXfZCwr7gRcddmnO.html

29-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet ministers visit Raj Bhavan to urge Governor to nominate CM to upper house||A day after the state cabinet had decided to write to Governor to urge him to nominate chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray to the legislative Council at the earliest, a delegation of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers led by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar met Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Tuesday evening at Raj Bhavan. The meeting is seen as a pressure tactic on the Raj Bhavan to take the decision over Thackeray’s nomination to the legislative Council.However, according to sources, the Governor has indicated that he would consult the Centre before taking a decision, which could mean that Thackeray should talk to Delhi to resolve the deadlock. “Milind Narvekar, a close aide of the CM, informally visited Raj Bhavan a couple of times in the past few days. It has been implied to him that Thackeray reaching out to Delhi would clear the decks for his nomination by Governor,”said a Raj Bhavan official. When HT spoke to some senior Shiv Sena leaders, they said the CM would take a call on the matter. With under a month left for Thackeray to fulfil the constitutional requirement of getting elected to either of the houses of the state legislature, the alleged delay by the Governor has kept the proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over Thackeray and the state government. Thackeray, who is not a member of either of the house of the state legislature, took oath as the CM on November 28. He could lose the post if he is not elected to legislature by May 27.“The cabinet has again recommended Uddhav Thackeray [to be nominated]; a letter pertaining to it was submitted to the governor. The group leaders of the three parties of the Maharashtra [Vikas] Aghadi, deputy chief minister and Chhagan Bhujbal met the Governor and yet again requested him to take a decision at the earliest on the recommendations that have made by the cabinet twice,” said Jayant Patil, state minister and Maharashtra president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), who was among the delegation. Patil however, declined to comment if the delay could be politically motivated to create instability in the state.The other minsters who had visited the Raj Bhavan included Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde and Anil Parab and Congress’s Balasaheb Thorat and Aslam Shaikh. Earlier, the polls for the legislative Council were scheduled for April 24. However, they were postponed due to the pandemic, following which the Maharashtra cabinet recommended the Governor to appoint Thackeray as a member of the Legislative Council (MLC) to avoid a constitutional crisis in the state.On April 9, the state cabinet had cleared a proposal recommending Thackeray’s nomination to one of the vacant seats of under the Governor’s quote in the upper house of the state legislature. However, 19 days on, the Raj Bhavan has not taken a decision over the nomination, prompting the delegation to meet the Governor on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-ministers-visit-raj-bhavan-to-urge-governor-to-nominate-cm-to-upper-house/story-D8zATgi3IzHwfUzrgrfgAK.html
29-04-2020||City||Lockdown increased ozone concentration over Punjab: Experts||While the lockdown has brought unprecedented economic miseries to people from all walks of life, it seems have had a positive effect on the environment. Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, the state’s satellite monitoring agency, claims that the lockdown has stalled the climate change momentum due to a drop in carbon emissions.A team of scientists, including Dr Brijendra Pateriya, Dr R K Setia and Anush Kumar, analysed the data shared by the European space agency (Copernicus Sentinel-5P ) on the concentration of atmospheric gases over Punjab from March 1 to March 22, and during the lockdown period from March 23 to April 20, and found a variable effect of the curfew on ozone concentration in Punjab. “It was observed that there was an increase in ozone concentration on March 28 and April 3, as compared to the ozone concentration on March 1, but it decreased on April 14 and had variable effects thereafter. It is an unusual phenomenon. We have not observed such a variation before,” said Dr Setia.Dr Brijendra Pateriya said similar studies had been carried out in China and European countries to check the impact of no carbon emission on environment during the lockdown period. “The results were staggering. There has been a significant drop in nitrogen dioxide, a chemical produced from power plants, vehicles and industrial activity that can be harmful to human health and cause respiratory issues. Besides the considerably negligible carbon emission, what helped was that there was no farm fire recorded during this period,” said Dr Pateriya.The analysis of satellite images also showed that the effect of curfew on average concentration of atmospheric gases was prominent in urban areas more than rural pockets.“During the analysis of images, a significant decrease of 40-50% in concentration of nitrogen dioxide (an air pollutant) was witnessed over major cities across Punjab, including Ludhiana, Amritsar and Jalandhar, as compared to the same time frame last year,” said Dr Pateriya. He added that the drop in emissions and nitrogen dioxide levels could provide a huge respite for people suffering from asthma, bronchitis and other breathing disorders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-stalled-climate-change-momentum-experts/story-brshFFZi5dJGq0VoqJPWmM.html

Spending long spells of time writing and in brainstorming sessions, he realised that the pre-quarantine schedule had taken him away from his core strength of writing.“It has been over a month since the lockdown began and I have come to realise what I was missing! Every weekend, I was in some city doing some show or another. So many hours were spent each day in travel, meetings, functions and other social obligations that you can’t say ‘No’ to. I am rediscovering the writer in me,” said the UPite.The new version of his popular song ‘Teri Mitti’ (Kesari) was released recently. “Thankfully, the music industry has not stopped…so songs are happening. We are working on film ‘Chanakya’, for which (‘Baby’ and ‘Dhoni’ director) Neeraj Pandey and I are jointly writing story-screenplay and dialogues, while I am also writing its lyrics. Starring Ajay Devgn, it will probably be one of the biggest projects in India! It has been two years researching it and now we are giving it a final shape,” said the ‘Teri Galliyan’ writer.Muntashir was about to announce his first film under his production house when the lockdown began. “I won’t be directing the film which is tentatively titled ‘Valle Valle Rasgulley’. Now, we are working on a fresh plan for it. Besides, with Neeraj, I have started another vertical in which we will hunt for talent in the music field from all parts of India and bring them in mainstream films,” he said.Writing from 11 am to late into the night is keeping him busy. “I am writing, holding meetings and music projects on video calls. Besides, thankfully, we have help at home, so it is a bit easy but we have divided the work at home so that the workload is shared. We are doing our own things, which were earlier done by others. So, I believe this phase has taught us a lot, made us value every work and to be compassionate,” he said.The writer is also planning to bring the next edition of his debut book ‘Meri Fitrat Hai Mastana’. “There has been a lot of demand for my next book. I am working on the second part of my book and am trying to put it in the stands by January next year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/i-am-rediscovering-the-writer-in-me/story-HkEXnKtor0YDzq3ikgLqTM.html

Following the threats, she wrote an application and we granted her 24-hour security cover, he said.Meanwhile, the state criminal investigation department (CID) has taken over the probe under additional director general of police (ADGP) Atul Kulkarni and a contingent of armed riot control police and State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) is scouring the nearby jungles to arrest more accused, said Singh. Singh on Tuesday has also transferred around 35 policemen for their inaction during the lynching incident.The police are also using four drones to identify the accused hiding in the jungles bordering the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-sarpanch-gets-armed-police-protection/story-9ycH5jdZYNLKqU18gR1MIJ.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Compulsory 21-day quarantine of Punjabis returning to state||After several Nanded returnees tested positive, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday announced a compulsory 21-day state quarantine for all those returning to the state from other places to check the spread of coronavirus.“All pilgrims returning from Nanded and students and labourers coming from Rajasthan will be stopped at the border and sent to government quarantine centres to ensure that they do not mix with other people for 21 days,” the CM said during a five-hour video interaction with Congress MLAs on the Covid-19 and lockdown situation even as the count of positive cases rose to 336.He said after the NRIs and Tabligi Jamaat, the latest threat of the spread of the disease in the state was on account of the pilgrims who were coming back from Gurdwara Hazur Sahib in Nanded (Maharashtra). Another large Jatha is expected to return to Punjab on Wednesday. He said Radha Soami Satsang deras would also be used to quarantine people whose return was being facilitated by the state government.‘RELAXATIONS WITH RESTRICTIONS SOON’Amarinder also said the government could go for certain relaxations with restrictions and precautions in the coming days based on the report based on the report of the expert committee formulating the state’s Covid-19 curfew/lockdown exit strategy. On Monday, the CM had, in a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, requested him to allow opening of small shops, businesses and industries in all areas except containment zones.The CM also sought feedback from the Congress legislators who spoke sequentially starting from Pathankot. A number of MLAs voiced their concerns and advised the government not to lift the curfew in any kind of hurry in hotspots and other areas where new cases have been surfaced. There was a consensus among them that curfew should be extended for another 15 days and restrictions implemented strictly in such areas.Advising extreme caution in lifting restrictions, the MLAs also suggested that borders should remain sealed not just around the state but also among the districts and around the villages. They also opined that Covid-19 patients should be hospitalised and treated within their own district, to limit outside contact and exposure.Balachaur MLA Darshan Lal wanted state’s borders to be strictly sealed to prevent infected cases coming in from other places. A few MLAs also advocated financial relief for farmers and industry, particularly micro, small and medium enterprises and electricity bill waiver for poor. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar suggested allowing industries in rural areas to operate at night to prevent workers from mixing. On the issue of lifting of lockdown, he also urged caution, while emphasising the need to flatten the curve but not flattening the economy.The issue of shortage of testing facilities, ventilators, relief ration kits etc were raised by many legislators, including Amit Vij and Joginder Pal, MLAs from Pathankot and Bhoa, calling for more sampling. Some MLAs also suggested to make books available to government school students as they could not all attend online classes, with many of the poor not having smart phones. They called for free internet use and free of cost health facilities for the people amid this unprecedented crisis. ‘ALLOW MIGRANTS TO RETURN TO HOME STATES’Another concern expressed by some Congress MLAs was regarding lakhs of migrant labourers who wanted to return to their home states. “As we are making arrangements to bring Punjabis from other states, migrant workers should also be allowed go back since most of them do not have any work as most industrial unit are shut. We have tens of thousands of migrant workers in the district. There have been several instances of migrants not following social distancing,” said a legislator from Jalandhar.However, the chief minister made it clear that his government would make all efforts to retain and care for the migrant labourers, whose return was now being facilitated by various states. “We need to look after them so that they do not leave Punjab, where they are needed to help out in the procurement operations as well as the industries that we are gradually opening up,” he said.Hoist national flag to protest Centre’s ‘bias’, says JakharThe Punjab Congress has asked all people in the state to hoist the national flag atop their houses on May 1 to protest against the Centre’s “discrimination” against non-BJP ruled states in extending financial support in the fight against coronavirus. The party would demand an immediate relief of ₹20,000 crore from the Centre.The idea was mooted by Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and seconded by chief minister Amarinder Singh at a video interaction held by the latter with party MLAs. Amarinder put the government’s monthly revenue loss at ₹3,360 crore as a result of the pandemic-induced curfew. The state would end up with a loss of almost ₹50,000 crore in a year but had received no help so far from the Centre to tackle the crisis, he added.The state government’s latest estimate of revenue loss is considerably higher than the figure of ₹22,000 crore given by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal in a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee constituted to take stock of the financial implications of Covid-19 pandemic.“The event, coinciding with May Day (Labour Day), will serve to underscore the right of Punjab to central aid in this unprecedented crisis,” said Jakhar, adding, “The party will organize the national flags for all those participating in the May 1 event”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/compulsory-21-day-quarantine-of-punjabis-returning-to-state/story-zLdKgq1dw9swXrLfnNAMyM.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||Activities on video calls to keep children from slums in Mumbai occupied during coronavirus lockdown||“What super powers will you use to defeat coronavirus? Would you like to share a story with the cloud:” these are some of the questions that six to eight-year-olds in some of the densest slums and neighbourhoods of the city in M ward are answering on their worksheets.At a time when parents all over the world are finding activities to engage children during the lockdown, there are also children living in informal settlements with no means to access any open area. With an intention to help such children cope with the anxiety of the outbreak and the ensuing lockdown as well as to provide an outlet to their growing minds, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) through its Transforming M-ward Project is engaging with around 800 children in Janata Nagar, Jai Ambe Nagar, Bhim Nagar, Indira Nagar and Vashi Naka areas of these suburbs. “The lockdown has been especially difficult for the children who live in single-room houses in dense settlements. Keeping them indoors has been quite a challenge for the parents,” said Sabah Khan from the Transforming M-ward project.Through its Saksham study centres, the members of the project are finding innovative ways to keep the children occupied amid the lockdown. All the activities are done via WhatsApp or video calls.“We have divided the children into three groups according to their age. There are 15 teachers who engage with the children through worksheets, videos and group calls. Initially, we had limited it to two activities per week, but the children have responded so well that we are planning to increase the number,” said Srishti Jaitley, a counsellor from Transforming M-ward Project. The children are also given ideas to make toys out of waste, engage in reflective thinking, write and paint about their experiences on the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/activities-on-video-calls-to-keep-children-from-slums-in-mumbai-occupied-during-coronavirus-lockdown/story-NJ3U73TLT7QDNAzTfmoAmL.html
29-04-2020||Mumbai||BJP writes to governor, accuses state govt of trying to gag media||Former chief minister and the Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday alleged that the state government was creating an emergency-like situation in Maharashtra through its attempts to gag and intimidate the media.A BJP delegation led by Fadnavis met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to demand accountability for the state’s action against mediapersons including city police’s 12-hour-long questioning of Republic TV’s editor Arnab Goswami on Monday. Fadnavis, along with the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Pravin Darekar, submitted a letter to the governor complaining that the government was trying to impose emergency-like conditions by creating fear among journalists and editors.“Arnab Goswami was questioned for 12-and-a-half hours at a police station over a televised debate. The same police have allowed seasoned criminals to roam around free. Any kind of criticism on social media against the government is also leading to police action these days. This amounts to an attempt to gag the free media, and thus creates dangers for functioning democracy,” said Fadnavis.The police recorded Goswami’s statement on Monday in connection with a police complaint filed against him by state power minister Nitin Raut for making controversial remarks in the Palghar lynching incident and against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. The charges against Goswami include provocation to cause riot, creating enmity between two communities, malicious intent to outrage religious feelings and defamation. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant, however, said, “Fadnavis’ complaint and standing by Goswami only show that BJP protects a section of media that tries to communalise and spread hatred in the society. During the BJP regime, several journalists and editors were hounded for doing their job, hence the party is in no position to talk about freedom of media.’’The letter by BJP leaders said in the recent past, action had been taken against several media persons including the arrest of Marathi news channel ABP Majha’s reporter Rahul Kulkarni over the crowding of migrant labourers at Bandra. It also cited the threat by state home minister to file a police complaint against a Times Now senior editor.Kulkarni was arrested for writing a news report that railway authorities were mulling to release outstation trains to allow migrant labourers to go home, which the police linked to the overcrowding at Bandra.The letter also pointed out the state government’s stance against door-to-door delivery of newspapers despite a clean chit from the country’s top most health authorities and cited it as a move against independent print media.The leaders asked the governor to take a serious note of these instances and demand a response from the state government.Fadnavis was accompanied by former ministers Vinod Tawde, Ashish Shelar and city chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-writes-to-governor-accuses-state-govt-of-trying-to-gag-media/story-ZSZv6CVDPm3FjsBtNp0BTP.html

Though she was asymptomatic, her samples were taken soon after the delivery as per the health department directions, and she tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.Before her test result came, she was discharged from the hospital. She had left to her maternal home in Lohka village falling under Patti sub-division on Saturday night.Senior medical officer (SMO) Kawar Harjot Singh said, “She was discharged after the delivery as she was asymptomatic. She didn’t meet any suspected person, or any person who had foreign travel history.”Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Anoop Singh said they have again taken the woman’s samples for re-testing. “We doubt her report as she is asymptomatic. We have sent her samples to Amritsar government hospital for testing again. Her baby’s samples have been sent too,” he said.Two CHC staff members who came in close quarters with the woman have also been isolated, the SMO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/infected-new-mother-tested-again-in-tarn-taran/story-xinHvYVThFplVB4TleVyKL.html

Two of them tested positive for Covid-19 and were subsequently admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra, while the remaining were home quarantined for 20 days, following which they were arrested. The two who tested positive are currently under home quarantine till May 8.Deputy commissioner of police Abhishek Trimukhe (zone 9) said, “The foreign nationals were sent to judicial custody on Tuesday. We have informed the Indonesian consulate about the developments.” The accused will be kept in a special cell at Arthur Road Jail, said an officer from Bandra police station.“Due legal process will be adopted and they will be deported as any other foreigner with a criminal case registered against them. But since flight operations have not resumed because of the pandemic, they will be kept in India for the time being. They will be deported soon after flight operations resume,” said a senior police officer from the Foreigners and Regional Registration Office (FRRO).The accused were arrested on April 23 under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 304 (ii) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without the intention to cause death), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease that is dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Soon after the accused were sent to judicial custody, their lawyer Ishrat khan moved an application seeking bail claiming that sections 307 and section 304 (ii) were not applicable in the case. Khan also said the accused were also booked under charges of misuse and fabrication of passport which were false. The court asked the prosecution to file a reply, and set the bail plea for hearing on May 4.Mumbai Police had earlier issued an advisory asking people who had attended the religious meet at Delhi to come forward, failing which an FIR would be registered against them.During inquiry, Mumbai Police learnt that the group of 12 people had come to India on February 29 to attend the meet, and came to Mumbai on March 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-indonesian-nationals-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-may-4/story-JS7iUYeVrA8JdcmgGvsQEK.html

The ventilator is essential for the treatment of severe cases of Covid-19. Hospital staff claim technicians are afraid to visit the hospital to install the devices for fear of contracting the infection. St. George Hospital has been turned into a 300-bed hospital that is dedicated to Covid treatment.Over the past two weeks, St George Hospital has received 67 ventilators. To ensure the equipment functions smoothly, the hospital has also increased the oxygen capacity in their intensive care unit. However, only 16 ventilators are functional at present. “ Covid patients are being referred from Sir JJ Hospital to us. Most of these patients are serious and require immediate ventilation. But due to the delay in installation, patients are being left only on oxygen supply,” said a doctor from St George Hospital, on condition of anonymity.Dr Akash Khobragade, superintendent of the hospital, said, “These ventilators are procured in groups. In the beginning, we got 20 ventilators, then 15 and later another 30. So some of them are yet to be installed, which will be done soon.”However, hospital staff say technicians are refusing to visit St George Hospital for fear of infection. “People are scared even to step inside the ward despite being given PPE [personal protective equipment],” claimed a doctor.There are 100 patients of Covid-19 receiving treatment at St George Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-16-of-67-ventilators-at-mumbai-s-st-george-hospital-functional/story-t30Dhs1nTaZxi7xnU4JTuM.html

Thackeray called for strict punishment for the perpetrators of the “heinous” crime and said the incident should not be given a communal colour.“I spoke to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji over phone and expressed concerns over the heinous murder of two sadhus in UP’s Bulandshahr. I told him we are with you against this incident. Just the way we acted strongly in such a case, I wish you would do the same and bring the accused to justice. However, I appeal to you that the incident should not be given a communal colour,” Thackeray said.Adityanath had called his Maharashtra counterpart after two sadhus were lynched in Palghar district earlier this month. The state home department subsequently booked over 100 people in connection with the case. The government had also dismissed any communal angle in the incident. However, BJP leaders had suggested the killing was intentional.Sena leader Sanjay Raut tweeted on the killings, warning against giving it a communal twist. “Terrible! Killing of two saints, sadhus at a temple in Bulandshahar, UP, but I appeal to all concerned to not make it communal the way they tried to make Palghar, Maharashtra incident (sic),” tweeted Raut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bulandshahr-killings-thackeray-calls-up-cm/story-NqITACI6m4erh5rh8SbvkI.html
29-04-2020||Entertainment||‘If I feel anything is wrong, I will say without getting intimidated!’||Actor Aniruddh Dave feels being worldly and compassionate is taxing these days. “Not just this, it’s extremely difficult to candidly tell people how you feel about certain things happening in the country. Your opinion gets scrutinised immediately and you are questioned on social platforms. I am very vocal about what I think is right! If I feel anything is wrong, I will say without getting intimidated,” says ‘Shorgul’ actor over phone.Last seen in a TV daily, ‘Patiala Babes’, Dave was in Lucknow on an extended shooting schedule for one of his upcoming OTT series in March. “It was a hectic schedule and we shot at various locations in the city. All was well till we left for Mumbai for a break and then lockdown was imposed so the shoot got postponed. The major portion has been shot and only patch work is left. Also, I feel extremely content to have signed series for web shows as after the lockdown is over it will take months to bring people to theatres.”Dave is busy with an anthology he is working on as a producer for television. “We were all set to launch the series in April but now my production team has decided to work on it after a couple of months. I am making most of the quarantine days having video meetings with my writers and production team almost every day. Also, we have decided to start whatever little we can in coming months though it will be difficult to shoot in the times of social distancing.”After being part of films like ‘Chhoriyan Chhoron Se Kam Nahi Hoti, ‘Pranaam,’ and others, Dave wanted to take up more films. “This year I decided to produce a TV show and take up more film projects. I have done too much TV and I am content with my body of work. Whatever films I did were offered to me without any effort from my end so I had decided that it was time to put my efforts and get good films. But, I think, my plan has been put on hold as films won’t happen so soon. Gladly, I signed an OTT series that will be out soon. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/if-i-feel-anything-is-wrong-i-will-say-without-getting-intimidated/story-Ezr23B5hcXqpKCPDluInwO.html
29-04-2020||City||1 coronavirus-positive person infected 3-4 people, reveals analysis by Tata Institute of Fundamental Research scientist||One Covid-19 positive individual in Mumbai is likely to have infected three to four people during the first 15 days of the nationwide lockdown, according to an analysis by a scientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) based on a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery (SEIR) statistical model. While the lockdown was put in place to reduce the number of people that one Covid-19 positive person can infect (denoted by R0), the analysis attributes a rise in cases to areas of high population density, where it is not possible to maintain physical or social distancing. R0 close to 1 means one individual will infect one or less than one person thereby containing the spread of the virus.Sourendu Gupta, theoretical physicist at TIFR, who undertook this analysis, said if Covid-19 cases are confined to certain geographical structures within Mumbai, the possibility of a “second wave” surge of cases in areas where housing density is lower cannot be ruled out. “Even when the lockdown ends, we have to be careful because infection may have unevenly spread through the city with some parts highly affected and some others which are not. Care therefore needs to be taken to ensure infection doesn’t spread uncontrollably into less affected areas. For that more testing is necessary,” said Gupta. “What happens in the second half of April will determine how safe we are in lifting the lockdown.”Inference drawn from SEIR on the number of infected Mumbaiites from fatality counts between March 31 and April 14 has projected that the doubling rate of the infection was 5.7 days. This means if Mumbai recorded 100 cases in one day, that number rose to 200 in five days and 1000 in 15 days.Similarly, the doubling time for fatalities during the same period is 5.3 days which according to the analysis can be compared to the doubling time during the early days of the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan before the imposition of a quarantine.Gupta said it will take two weeks for the toll to jump ten-fold if the current doubling time continues for fatalities. That’s 100 or more deaths every day - similar to the peak number of Covid-19 deaths in New York City. “In the hypothetical cases discussed here, Covid-19 wards in the city would have to deal with several hundred admissions a day with care periods for each case ranging up to two months. Again, using the estimates given above, these rates would be reached in two to four weeks if the rate of growth of the epidemic does not come down,” states the manuscript of the study published in ArXiv, an open-access archive by Cornell University.Currently, the number of Covid-19 positive tests is likely to be a small fraction of the total number of infected – one out of 750 cases of infection. “More tests have to be done especially when the government is thinking of unlocking the city. In the first two weeks after the lockdown ends, we need to be sure the infection is not spreading without knowledge.”If the doubling rate of the infection doesn’t change, the statistical model puts the likelihood of the first Covid-19 cases in Mumbai as early as December 20, 2019 and February 1, 2020 – with January 15 as the median point for ‘seeding of the epidemic’ – affecting individuals with a travel history to China where the outbreak had already begun.“The first fatalities (in Mumbai) due to this cryptic spread of COVID-19 would not have happened before mid-February. It is certainly possible to check municipal records of deaths in February to see whether any excesses over the same month in previous years are visible. If there is a statistically significant signal, it would support the idea of early cryptic seeding of COVID-19 in Mumbai,” states the study. Shankar R, retired theoretical physicist, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, who was not involved in the study, said the only way to estimate the number of infections is via the death toll. “In a large population, huge number of people who have not been tested carry the infection and we don’t know the actual numbers,” he said.Meanwhile, the national growth rate of confirmed cases of those infected with the novel coronavirus has been on the decline since the nationwide lockdown on March 25, finds the data analysis team of the Indian Scientists’ Response to COVID-19, a voluntary group of more than 400 scientists. The team stated that fresh outbreaks can significantly alter the scenario and therefore cautioned against any extrapolation based on current data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-coronavirus-positive-person-infected-3-4-people-reveals-analysis-by-tata-institute-of-fundamental-research-scientist/story-juepLvRuJWpr6HDMbbsuZO.html

SEC has recommended appointment of administrators for the bodies. Generally, municipal commissioners are appointed as administrators till new bodies are elected.SEC had, in third week of March, announced to postpone the election procedure for these corporations, district councils, municipal councils and gram panchayats in view of the pandemic. “According to the constitutional provisions, the 5-year term of any elected local body cannot be extended. It was reiterated by the Supreme Court last year when terms of a few district councils were extended in the absence of fresh elections (by previous government). We have, last week, written to rural and urban development departments for appointment of administrators for these bodies,” said Kiran Kurundkar, secretary, SEC.Arvind Kumar, principal secretary of rural development department, said, “We have already appointed extension officers as administrators for gram panchayats. We are seeking legal opinion if they can be replaced with other authorities, either from administration or representatives of political parties, as the extension officers are overburdened. In district councils, only chief election officers (CEOs) can be appointed as an administrators.”Mahesh Pathak, principal secretary of urban development department, said, “We have issued the orders of appointing the administrators for municipal corporations, municipal councils and nagar panchayats effective from the day after the 5-year term of the elected bodies come to an end. Aurangabad commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey will take over from Wednesday, and commissioners of two other corporations will do the same once the terms end of their respective bodies.

With this the total number of positive patients who had returned from Nanded has reached 11. In Tarn Taran, a 60-year-old man and his grandchild tested positive for Covid-19. They are residents of Khemkaran, said Taran Tarn civil surgeon Dr Anoop Kumar. Now, there are eight Covid-19 cases in the district.The two patients were part of a group of 11 persons who returned from Nanded in a tempo-traveller on Sunday. All 11, belong to Khemkaran—a gram panchayat that falls under the Bhikhiwind sub-division—and its two adjoining hamlets, were tested on Monday after their driver was tested positive in Maharashtra.On Monday, five men from Sursingh village of the district had also tested positive. The five had returned from Nanded a week ago.

29-04-2020||Lucknow||BJP MLA show-caused for comments on Muslim vendors, in video||Suresh Tiwari, BJP MLA from Barhaj constituency in Deoria district, was on Tuesday seen in a video clip telling people not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors to avoid contracting coronovirus.The clip has now been widely shared on social media, triggering a controversy.Taking note of Tiwari’s comments, the BJP served a show-cause notice to him and asked him to explain why action should not be initiated against him. “On the instructions of party chief Swatantra Dev, party general secretary Vidyasagar Sonker has issued notice to Suresh Tiwari ji and asked him to explain his conduct and why action shouldn’t be initiated against him,” said BJP’s Manish Dixit. Party spokesperson Chandramohan said the BJP had nothing to do with the statement. “The party’s motto is ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ -- something that all of us need to follow,” Chandramohan said.In the video, Tiwari is seen saying: “One thing you all should keep in mind. I am telling you openly. Do not buy vegetables from Mias (Muslim vendors).”When contacted, Tiwari admitted that he made the remark, but clarified that he did so as a precautionary measure to protect people from getting infected with coronavirus after several of them had complained to him about the alleged role of Tablighi Jamaatis in spreading the deadly virus.“On April 18, I was distributing masks among people in Deoria when I came across complaints from some of the people, who expressed fear that Tablighi Jamaatis were spreading infection in Deoria. Many of them were worried that Muslim vendors were infecting veggies with saliva from their mouths. As responsible MLA, I asked them (people) not to take the law into their hands to deal with situation but simply stop buying vegetables from them. Tell me what wrong I have done if I have said such things,” Tiwari said.Tiwari’s remark drew sharp reaction from the Congress, with its UP chief Ajay Kumar Lallu flaying him and blaming his party for spreading hatred even at the time of the current pandemic.“At a time when the country is reeling under severe crisis of coronavirus, BJP leaders are busy fanning hatred. It’s a shameful act which has exposed the real face of BJP. The Tablighi Jamaatis, who are being blamed for spreading coronovirus, have set an example by offering to donate their plasma to cure patients. I am confident the countrymen will put up a united fight against Covid-19 by neglecting such comments,” Lallu said.(WITH PTI INPUTS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bjp-mla-show-caused-for-comments-on-muslim-vendors-in-video/story-39rxEJTBcqyStEOObOXU4O.html

29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab sees decline in percentage of + cases against total tests done||Despite speculation that the number of Covid-19 cases in Punjab could be less because of low testing, the state has witnessed a decline in percentage of positive cases against the total tests done.An analysis of the figures issued by the health department reveals that on April 4, the state’s percentage of positive cases against the total tests done was 4.1%. Of the 1,585 tests conducted till then, 65 samples were found positive.On April 12, the figures dipped to 3.6% with state registering 135 positive cases out of 3,760 test results. On April 20, the ratio further fell to 2.9% with 191 positive cases out of 16,518 test results.On April 27, the figure came down to 2.6% when the state crossed 330 positive cases out of 12,663 test results.The health department considers the decline in the ratio a ‘positive sign’. “We have done comprehensive testing in the past one week. In only three days between April 25 to April 27, a total of 4,703 samples were taken across the state from our flu centres. Of these, 1500 samples were taken from green zones, out of which 800 suspects were symptomatic. Interestingly, most of the results have been found negative, which shows there is no tangible community transmission and most of the cases are related to contact histories,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, department’s official spokesperson for Covid-19.“Had there been any community spread, it should have reflected in the ratio of positive patients against the tests done. We have increased our testing from 300 daily in the first week of April to 1,500-2,000 daily since last week,” he said.LAL PATH LABS APPROVED FOR TESTING IN PUNJABMeanwhile, additional chief secretary Vini Mahajan said in a Tweet that privately owned ‘Lal Path Labs’ has also been approved for testing in Punjab.Besides, two more labs in the state are likely to start conducting tests for coronavirus soon. These will include one lab each at the Christian Medical College (CMC), Ludhiana, and Guru Ram Dass Institute of Medical Science and Research, Amritsar.“The state government has aggressively pushed the case of the two institutes with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and once the approval comes, the state’s capacity will get a further boost,” said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-sees-decline-in-percentage-of-cases-against-total-tests-done/story-9CSGFlcU0cRrB6JaBVRcXP.html

He said that procurement had been severely affected across state. Sukhbir, who had visited Jalalabad grain market, said mandis are clogged as wheat is not being lifted in the absence of gunny bags. He said farmers are complaining that procurement agencies are rejecting wheat even if it has slight moisture content. He asked the CM to take up the issue with FCI, and direct state agencies not to harass. He said of 54 lakh MT wheat procured, only 29 lakh MT tonnes had been lifted, and only 30% payment due to farmers had been released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-blames-govt-for-tardy-lifting-of-wheat/story-VoTGWaiAE7maqXhR0qxQBN.html

The standard of the kits was for protection from H1N1/ SARS.Awasthi said that at the time of start of Covid pandemic there was a shortage of PPE kits so the government sent those (H1N1/SARS) kits to the medical colleges. After the purchase of kits for protection from Covid, the state government withdrew all H1N1/SARS kits that were dispatched to medical colleges earlier. The H1N1/SARS kits were used by doctors in various medical colleges and there was no report of infection.

29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Wheat arrival in full swing, Punjab faces storage crisis||The arrival of wheat in the mandis of Punjab is in the full swing with 66 lakh tonne of crop having already reached the grain markets, but the state government hardly has any covered space for storage of the produce.The entire 135 lakh tonne of wheat expected to be procured this season will go for storage in open over the plinths as the godowns in the state are brimming with rice and wheat of the previous seasons. The produce will be vulnerable to damage as it will be exposed to the vagaries of weather for being stored under the open sky.As per the norms of Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central agency for movement of foodgrains for public distribution system (PDS) in the entire country, wheat kept in CAP (covered area plinth) storage rots three times faster than wheat stored in covered godowns.The FCI’s policy recommends shifting of wheat kept in CAP storage within six months and that of covered godowns within two years. Wheat stored in silos (steel containers) has shelf life for over three years.The state godowns are brimming with rice and wheat despite the fact that the movement of foodgrains from Punjab to recipient states is going on at a fast pace amid the lockdown imposed in the country in the last week of March in the wake of Covid-9 outbreak.Everyday 15 to 50 goods trains chug into the state to transport foodgrains to the recipient states. Taking the daily average of trains at 30, around 75,000 tonne of foodgrains are moved out on daily basis.During the past 35 days, around 20 lakh tonne wheat and rice have been moved out of state, but still the state has not sufficient space to accommodate the arrivals of the current season.Due to lack of sufficient space, wheat would go for storage in rice shelling mils and the mandis which have covered sheds.As per figures procured from the state food and civil supplies department, 102 lakh tonne rice is currently stored in covered godowns. Besides, 70 lakh tonne wheat of the previous two rabi seasons (2018 and 2019).Also, the 40 lakh tonne paddy, which is under processing and will yield at least 26 lakh tonne more rice, will be stored in the godowns.‘ALTERNATIVE SPACE FOR STORAGE IDENTIFIED’ Additional chief secretary Viswajeet Khanna, head of the state committee on harvest and procurement, said alternative space for wheat storage has been identified and the stacking of foodgrains has started.Meanwhile, 20 lakh tonne wheat of the current season has already landed in the CAP storage.Currently, there is 155 lakh tonne storage capacity in covered godowns in Punjab, in which the state agencies store 10% more than the capacity. The CAP storage capacity in the state is 100 lakh tonne where silos have 5.75 lakh tonne capacity. A move to create more storage of 33.5 lakh tonne in the state was stalled due to the countrywide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wheat-arrival-in-full-swing-punjab-faces-storage-crisis/story-pyzSuJdAv3g8JMY2mbP7BK.html

The construction company, with which he was working, refused to send the body to his village, claiming that he was tested coronavirus positive, posthumously.However, the family alleged that the company is using coronavirus as an excuse for saving expenses to send the body to India. The family has sought the intervention of the Union government in bringing the body to Ludhiana. The deceased, Balwinder Singh, 37, a resident of Balliewal village, had gone to Dubai six years ago where he was working as a carpenter with the company. Sarpanch Manjit Singh, cousin of the deceased, said they had received a call from the company on April 16 informing them that Balwinder had died in an accident during work.He said, “According to the company, he was working on the 10th floor of a building and the chain of the crane, which was lifting him, suddenly snapped and he came down crashing on the ground. His head crashed on the floor and he died on the spot. The company officials told them that they are making arrangements to send the body to Ludhiana, but they did not.” “On Saturday, a company official informed us that Balwinder was tested Covid-19 positive posthumously and they cannot send the body to India,” said Manjit Singh.“We refuse to believe this. They themselves said that he died in an accident during work. Now, they are saying that he was tested coronavirus positive after his blood samples were taken posthumously. It is just an excuse because they do not want to send the body back,” alleged Manjit Singh. Balwinder Singh is survived by old parents, wife and three children -- two daughters (aged 6 and 4) and a two-year-old son.His wife, Rajwinder Kaur, said his salary for 2-3 months was also pending with the company. Her father-in-law works as a labourer and due to lockdown, the family has no source of income. “Everyone in the family is depressed and we want the body of my husband back to see him for the last time and pay him our last respects,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-man-dies-in-dubai-firm-says-can-t-send-body-as-he-tested-covid-19-positive/story-dQAGtoc3GQu6o29BobsfrM.html

29-04-2020||City||Work at Jagraon Bridge likely to begin today in Ludhiana||Put to a halt after imposition of curfew in the state, work on the Jagraon Bridge project is expected to commence from Wednesday as the municipal corporation (MC) has received permission from the district administration to start the construction.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal gave the permission on Tuesday on the condition that the construction company and the MC would ensure that all the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs, state government and district administration are adhered to. Further, the construction agency has to ensure that necessary precautions are taken by the labourers as well.Passes, to be issued to the labour and the staff of the construction company, will be valid only for working hours and the MC will have to maintain a record of the issued passes. If it is found that the guidelines are not being followed, permission for construction would be cancelled without any notice.MC superintending engineer HS Bhullar said, “The MC has received permission to commence work on the project on Wednesday. Instructions have been issued to the contractor to adhere to norms and follow all the guidelines issued by the government and the administration.” Bhullar added, “We cannot fix any deadline for the project as the contractor might face problems in getting construction material during curfew.” Under the project, the MC has to increase the width of approach roads to the ROB (from the Gurdwara Dukhniwaran side towards Durga Mata Mandir) by three metres, which will allow the roads to be linked to the newly constructed railway over bridge (ROB) bow-string girder.The MC had commenced work on January 30 amid the claim that it would be completed by April 14. The construction company was expected to meet the deadline, but the project was put to a halt after the announcement of lockdown on March 23. In July 2016, the Railways had closed one leg of the bridge, leading to disturbance in the traffic movement in the city, following which, residents had been pressuring the administration to expedite the reconstruction of the bridge. Residents have also observed three ‘death anniversaries’ of the bridge in the past as a symbolic protest against the authorities. SMART CITY PROJECT KICKS OFF The Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) will also commence work on four projects, including ROB/RUB project on the Pakhowal road railway crossing (deadline August 25); waterfront development along the Sidhwan Canal (July 28); carcass utilisation plant (June 30); development of the Malhar Road as smart road and retrofitting of the Sarabha Nagar market (May 24).The authorities said the projects might miss the deadlines as over a month has elapsed after the work was stopped due to curfew. Uncertainty also looms over the 24x7 water supply project in the city as the World Bank had given time till March 31 to the MC to find a location for setting up the treatment plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/work-at-jagraon-bridge-likely-to-begin-today-in-ludhiana/story-1YRXL8foHMwGJfndw3C1TJ.html

Meanwhile,the total number of containment zones in Delhi touched 100 on Tuesday after the Delhi government announced one new containment zone in Shaheen Bagh area of southeast district. The newly made containment zone includes 10 houses in D-block of Shaheen Bagh. This is second containment area in Shaheen Bagh. Earlier on April 16, the city government had declared gali number-6 of Abul Fazal Enclave in A-block of Shaheen Bagh as a containment zone.A containment zone is a complete quarantine zone and no one is allowed to step out even to buy essential goods such as milk, vegetables, fruits, etc. All the entry and exit points and even the internal lanes are barricaded in the containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/11-relatives-of-lok-nayak-dietician-test-positive-for-covid/story-n4S5d42MfLvTvjNXdLowFL.html
29-04-2020||Delhi||Govt allows district admins to regulate movement of plumbers, electricians||The Delhi government on Tuesday allowed district administrations to enforce the latest lockdown relaxation — allowing self-employed electricians, plumbers and water purifier servicemen to operate in the city — as they deem fit.The government clarification comes at a point where residents demanded a safety protocol, including thermal screening, to authorise such workers.“The Delhi Police has been sent the order issued yesterday (Monday) and they are complying with it. There is no common protocol in place on how they are being allowed to operate. We have decentralised decision making on this and left it to the respective district administration to enforce it in the manner they deem fit,” a media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said.Nidhi Srivastava, district magistrate (Central), said, “We will issue passes as and when they apply. The same applies to private clinics, veterinarians and other such services that have been allowed.”However, such workers in the North East district will not require passes, said district magistrate (DM) Shashi Kaushal. “In my district, most of these providers are available in the neighbourhoods. Curfew passes are required when people have to travel long distances for work. In the case of electricians, plumbers, etc., working within a colony or within three to four blocks should not be a problem,” said Kaushal.Delhi Police spokesperson MS Randhawa acknowledged the measures in North East district. “These service providers will be allowed to work even without the movement passes. But still, we would request them that it will be better if they get an e-pass made,” said Randhawa.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that to ensure that others do not start stepping out, posing as workers, they will be questioned. “If we come across any suspicious person, our men can call the house the service provider is going to and can confirm his name and profession with them. But, we will ensure no such worker is harassed. Also, when most of the hardware and electrical stores aren’t open yet, there will be less demand for such workers,” the officer said.Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city, however, said they will not be able to stop the entry of service providers to their colonies, after the government’s order.BS Vohra, president, the federation of East Delhi RWAs, said that at the subdivisional magistrate (SDM) level, the administration should fix a schedule for thermal screening of the service providers in the area before they are allowed to work. “We are issuing an advisory, asking service providers to wear protective gear, such as masks and gloves, while entering the premises,” said Vohra.Pramod Kumar, 36, an electrician, who runs his business taking assignments over the phone, said the news brought him much relief, as he had already run out of his modest savings and had to take a loan from his friends to buy rations.Although still wary of catching the infection, he said he cannot afford to sit at home anymore. A resident of East Delhi’s Dallupura, he cycles to nearby Vasundhara Enclave or sometimes travels on foot to attend to customers.“Except for air-conditioner (AC) servicing, I do all the electrical work. I didn’t get any calls for work so far, but I will get in touch with customers, whose works were left incomplete, because of the lockdown,” said Kumar, who has a family of four dependent on his income.However, some workers said they will gauge the situation before starting work as they do not want to risk their lives.Mukesh Kumar, 27, an electrician, who also owns a small shop in Rohini Sector 15, said that he is yet to reopen and will only attend to urgent works. “It has been difficult to manage, as the sources from where we used to get hardware stocks are all closed. But, I think being alive and healthy is more important. I have decided to not open the shop until the lockdown is lifted,” said Kumar.Self-employed service providers are not registered with the government or home service companies. They are daily wagers found in almost every colony and most live on a call-by-call basis. There are no official numbers as they are part of the large unorganised workforce in the Capital, but a senior Delhi government official said their numbers in the city could be around 30,000 to 40,000.Unlike registered autorickshaw drivers or taxi drivers, they are also not eligible for the one-time financial support of ₹5,000 provided by the Delhi government.HC Gupta, president, the federation of Ashok Vihar RWAs, said they have asked residents to avoid getting their ACs serviced till at least the lockdown is lifted. “Residents, on their own, are avoiding calling for such services unless there is an emergency. The government should have set a mechanism or at least check the medical history of service providers who will enter a residential complex. The current scenario poses a risk of spreading the Covid infection,” said Gupta.Atul Goyal, president of the United Residents Joint Action (URJA), an umbrella body of 2,500 RWAs, said that more clarity is needed in the government order. “How do we know that the service provider is not coming from a hot spot? At the ward level, the authorities must designate people and allow only such providers who are coming from green zones so that there is minimised risk of spreading the infection,” said Goyal.A senior government official clarified that these relaxations will not apply to any of the 100 containment zones in the city.The order on relaxations issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev on Monday night also allowed interstate and intrastate movement of medical and veterinary personnel, scientists, nurses, paramedical staff, lab technicians, midwives and other hospital support services, including ambulances. It stated that air travel for such persons will also be allowed.After receiving feedback that several private clinics, pathological labs and dispensaries in Delhi have been shut due to confusion over the lockdown rules, the Monday order also called for the opening of such facilities across the city.The government-run shelter homes will now admit new inmates. “So far, since the lockdown, the homes were not allowed to let outsiders in. Now that the order has come, they will be open to accepting those in need depending on the capacity,” said a senior Delhi government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-allows-district-admins-to-regulate-movement-of-plumbers-electricians/story-HQwibcnG6qUOFweS6IBV1L.html

A panel of business committees and experts in their respective fields, from all over the world, have taken these sessions to help Dawoodi Bohra businesses.The training sessions and webinars have been organised by Al-Tijaarat Al-Raabehah, the business development department of the community. The online training sessions take place on a mobile application and include one-one-one counselling sessions. The recording of the webinar is uploaded on social media platforms.

Approximately 60-70% of the community in the city run small and big businesses.“In a phase such as this, we do not know what is going to come next. As a result, we want businessmen to be prepared,” said Mukarram.Fakhruddin Fatehpurwala, who trades in industrial hardware, said, “We know that people might face problems to pay for products. In a situation such as this, we were told that we could also opt for barter system. Currently, I am also strengthening the presence of my company online.” Fatehpurwala also said he is now looking into developing new products that he can introduce once the lockdown ends.“The response amidst the community members has been phenomenal. We want the members to understand that as entrepreneurs, they can find alternate options and keep their shops running even from home, instead of just wasting their time,” said Mohammed Sabuwala, one of the trainers.There are approximately 1 lakh Dawoodi Bohras in and around Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/digital-marketing-finance-lessons-a-click-away-for-dawoodi-bohra-community/story-T4JqXDCjP8yHK4BjZP9d6H.html

29-04-2020||Gurugram||Confusion, snarls at Delhi-Haryana border on day 1 of Covid-19 travel curbs||The Haryana police on Tuesday stepped up surveillance along the state’s borders with Delhi a day after state minister Anil Vij ordered sealing of all entry and exit points with the national capital in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases there.Over 200 people were stopped from crossing the border into Gurugram at Sirhaul for the want of papers and police said they will book those who have no valid reason to travel from Wednesday them instead of sending them back. The number of barricades was increased and police said they checked each claim of commuters to ensure that only those involved in essential services were allowed to cross borders in accordance guidelines governing the lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread.Police said they would earlier take a few seconds to clear border crossings and only stopped suspected vehicles. But on Tuesday, the police insisted on checking documents of each commuter before allowing them to cross over and this resulted in traffic congestion and long queues at the Sirhaul border.There was much confusion among commuters over the heightened surveillance and many started early to cross the border before the deployment was increased.Rajeev Singh, a daily commuter from Ghaziabad who works in a bank, said he started at 5 am from his home as his friends and colleagues told him that the borders would be sealed after 9 am. “I could not sleep and five of my colleagues and I planned to enter Gurugram before the border was sealed. We had even got our clothes and other stuff to shift to a friend’s place as we thought we would not be allowed to return home.”Another commuter, who works at an IT firm, said messages were circulated on social media saying the Gurugram-Delhi border will be closed and even the emergency services will not be allowed. “I had to request one of my relatives to allow me to stay at his house for a few days as it is mandatory for us to go to the office or else I will be fired,” said Akhilesh Kumar, who is from Delhi’s Pitam Pura.Gurugram police commissioner Mohammad Akil said they have deployed 35 personnel for each shift at all the 11 borders crossings. He added thermal scanners have been issued to all police posts and pickets and the personnel manning them have been asked to check temperatures of those entering the city from Wednesday. “We are taking all precautionary measures and are restricting travel to contain the coronavirus spread,” he said.He said safety gear has been provided to the personnel. “Directions have been issued to them to remain at a distance and not to touch anything without wearing masks.”Tents were put up at all police posts along the Delhi-Gurugram border to ensure the personnel could rest after their shifts get over. Medical teams were carrying out their regular checkups. The personnel wore gloves, masks, and glasses.Akil said anyone found travelling without necessary authorisation will be booked under section 188 (disobedience to order by a public servant) of the Indian Penal CodeVij said at least 15 people, who tested positive for the disease in Haryana recently, had contracted it in Delhi. He added the state has put in place emergency measures to prevent the Covid-19 spread. Vij said the situation in the state is under control and that Haryana has the country’s highest recovery rate of over 71%. “We have only allowed essential services and imposed stricter restrictions on those coming in from the national capital. It is important for us to save the state for the next 20 days till the situation comes under control. Until then, we should not open the borders,” he said.The Union health ministry on Tuesday said Haryana has reported 296 Covid-19 cases and three fatalities. Of the 296, 183 have been discharged. There was a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in Gurugram last week when 51 cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/confusion-snarls-at-delhi-haryana-border-on-day-1-of-covid-19-travel-curbs/story-ZfhR7c7Y2n4KdhFx4fGhSK.html
29-04-2020||Gurugram||2.84 lakh quintal wheat procured since April 15; registration of farmers on state government portal resumes||To ensure the smooth procurement of wheat and mustard in Gurugram, the Haryana government on Monday reopened registrations for farmers on its‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal to help them sell their crops.Earlier, registrations on the portal were only open till April 19. The portal— www.fasalhry.in—enables farmers to directly upload the details of their crops which are then bought by the government.The district administration said that till April 19 over 7,000 farmers from Gurugram district had registered on the portal. Most registrations were from Pataudi block where at least 2,860 farmers had shared their details, while 2,572 farmers had registered from Farrukhnagar on the portal. Farrukhnagar, Pataudi and Sohna blocks are prime agriculture belts in the district. Farmers in the areas mostly grow wheat, mustard, and seasonal vegetables.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, also said from between April 15 and April 27, a total of 2.84 lakh quintal wheat was procured by the administration in the district. On Monday over 9,110 quintals of wheat were procured in Farrukhnagar, over 26,100 quintals were procured in Haileymandi, 2,850 quintals in Khor, and 2,100 quintals in Sohna, The administration had also purchased 2,360 quintals of mustard in Farrukhnagar, 5,440 quintals in Haileymandi, and 2,060 quintals in Sohna on Monday.Khatri said that adequate arrangements had been made for the procurement of these crops at the mandis (wholesale markets) in all blocks and all norms for physical distancing were being followed. “These markets are regularly disinfected, and masks and sanitizers are given to farmers, traders and all others here. Helpdesks have also been set up to share information with farmers,” he said.Officials said after collecting information of registered farmers from the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal, a detailed roster is prepared for procurement of crops and on the basis of which farmers are called to the mandis with their produce. The information is shared by sending SMS and phone calls. The farmers bring the produce as per the roster so that there is no confusion and there is no large gathering at the mandis, they added. Haryana government has already announced life insurance of ₹10 lakh for all persons working in the mandis including farmers, commission agents, labourers, contractual and regular government employees. To smoothen the procurement process, the state government had announced the setting up of 2,000 mandis across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/2-84-lakh-quintal-wheat-procured-since-april-15-registration-of-farmers-on-state-government-portal-resumes/story-fky971bI2r3rvTW7XIdrTP.html
29-04-2020||Noida||Husband, in-laws arrested for woman’s death in Noida||A man in his late twenties was arrested by the Noida police on Tuesday along with three of his family members in connection with the death of his 25-year-old wife on Monday night after the woman’s family alleged that she was killed for dowry.The incident was reported from a village under the Phase 3 police jurisdiction. According to the police a call came in to the helpline around 11.15pm about the death of a woman.“A team was rushed to the spot and the body of the woman was taken into custody after which it was sent for an autopsy. She had been found hanging from a fan in her house,” deputy commissioner of police, women safety, Vrinda Shukla, said.The police first informed the woman’s brother about the incident, following which he came to Noida from Ghaziabad. According to family members, the couple had gotten married in November 2019.“They both worked for the same company in Noida. He was her manager and they got married five months ago after both families agreed to the match. Things were fine in the beginning, but problems related to money and the lack of dowry soon arose. She had been mentally troubled because of this for some time now,” the woman’s maternal uncle said.After the body was sent for an autopsy, the woman’s mother filed a complaint with the police based on which a case was registered against the husband, his parents and younger brother at the Phase 3 police station under sections 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the dowry prohibition act.“Based on the family’s complaint, the suspects have been arrested while the autopsy report is awaited. All due legal action is being taken,” the DCP said.The police also said that prima facie it seemed to be a case of suicide. However, there were a few injuries on the body and until the autopsy report arrived, it would be difficult to say whether this was a suicide, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/husband-in-laws-arrested-for-woman-s-death/story-TQFkcff4HFyBIjN668wlGJ.html
29-04-2020||Noida||Only 31% paid power bills of March in GB Nagar, discom collects just 10% of total monthly revenue||The lockdown announced to control the Covid-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the cash flows of the discom in Gautam Budh Nagar district. This otherwise highest electricity revenue generating district in Uttar Pradesh is now faced with dismal collections. Only 31% consumers have paid their electricity bills of March 2020, and the discom has collected less than 10% of its power revenue last month.Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said despite launching several awareness drives asking consumers to make online payments of electricity bills, the revenue collection has dwindled in the district. “Of the ₹146 crore electricity bills of March 2020, we have so far collected around ₹14 crore, which is even less than 10%. Of the 1.57 lakh consumers who had been served their electricity bills, only 49,000 consumers have made the payment of their bills so far, which is approximately 31%,” he said.Singh also said before the lockdown, the average monthly revenue collection in the district was ₹300 crore. “The revenue collection and consumption have drastically come down after the lockdown. Before lockdown, over 70% consumers used to pay their electricity bills online, contributing more than 80% of the overall power bills in the district,” he said.The chief engineer further said apart from domestic consumers, even industrial and commercial consumers have shown a lukewarm response in paying their power bills. “We have 9,386 industrial and 27,791 commercial consumers in the district. Most of them are either closed due to the lockdown or have meters on their premises. As we have not been able to send them their bills, we have been launching awareness drives for them, to pay their bills according to rough estimates, going by previous months’ consumption, to keep the dues from mounting . But, these awareness drives, too, don’t appear to have made an impact,” he said.Singh also said the PVVNL is making all efforts to encourage consumers to pay online as they can’t go to any billing counters during the lockdown. “We have made all arrangements to ensure uninterrupted power supply these days. Consumers won’t have to pay additional charges if they are paying online as these additional charges levied by the bank will be paid by us. We have also launched a round-the-clock helpline number -- 1912 -- for consumers to call in case of any inconvenience,” he said. It may be noted that the Centre has issued directions to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to provide a moratorium on payments for three months to discoms, but with few takers for 40% of the electricity in the discoms’ supply kitty, it is leading to a huge loss of revenue for discoms. From November 2019 onwards, the power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments from discoms in most states, including Uttar Pradesh. The discoms have legally binding contracts, especially with big companies, which draw electricity in large quantities, with provisions for the latter to pay even when they don’t draw power from the grid. But, in the current scenario, which is a force majeure, the discoms may not be able to enforce those provisions as the failure to draw electricity is entirely based on factors beyond the control of companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/only-31-paid-power-bills-of-march-in-gb-nagar-discom-collects-just-10-of-total-monthly-revenue/story-boFDiJ9TuLVZNsXpgjifOO.html
29-04-2020||Noida||Noida to issue fresh tenders to finish pending electrical work at stuck projects||The Noida authority on Tuesday said it will prepare a report on all pending electrical works at different sites by May 3 so the process of hiring contractors to finish new and unfinished projects is complete without further delay.The Noida authority chief executive officer Ritu Maheshwari on Tuesday reviewed the status of electrical works at different project sites with the electrical department staff. “We have directed the engineers to conduct a ground survey and prepare budget estimates of all the electrical works that needs to be done at different project sites in the city. Once the survey report and budget estimates are ready, the authority will issue tenders to select the successful contractors to finish the electricity-related work,” said Maheshwari.Works at many upcoming projects such as underpasses on Shahdara elevated road, an under-construction administrative building in Sector 96, an upcoming district hospital in Sector 39, Sector 5 parking, and other projects are stuck after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 to curb the spread of coronavirus. In these and many other such projects, the authority needs to hire contractors who can finish electrical work on schedule after all the construction related work is over. The Noida authority CEO has issued directions that after the surveys are ready, the tendering process should be issued immediately and the work should be allotted to contractors within a week.The authority wants to wrap up all procedural work within May so that work on the ground can start by June (if the lockdown is not further extended), said officials.Apart from this, the CEO has directed the electrical department to prepare a report on all dysfunctional street lights. The authority plans to replace them with LEDs. “Once we have an estimate of non-functional street lights from all sectors and villages, the authority will start installation or repair of all these street lights at all places at the same time,” a Noida authority, requesting anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-to-issue-fresh-tenders-to-finish-pending-electrical-work-at-stuck-projects/story-RoTWiVRyklxunNCOGS614N.html

29-04-2020||Pune||Auto drivers in Pune reduced to penury amidst lockdown||Autorickshaw drivers in Pune who have been forced to give up their daily income due to lockdown are facing severe financial crisis as they are sitting idle inside their houses. Movement of all vehicles except those engaged in supply of essential services and commodities have been banned by the state government to prevent the spread of Corona virus.There are one lakh in the city. While a section of the drivers own their autorickshaws, the others drive the autorickshaw and pay the owner a daily fee of Rs 250 per shift for a day.Pune Rickshaw Panchyat president Nitin Pawar said that the situation is grim for over a lakh auto drivers in the city in absence of daily income. “ Their financial position is precarious and there is a need for strong backing from the government to support this large section of the society which has become unemployed due to the lockdown.”Amol Gaikwad, an auto driver from Yerawada, said, “I have been sitting idle inside my house with no income. I have to look after my old parents, wife and two kids. The daily expenditures are mounting and it is becoming difficult to survive. Moreover, there is no help coming from either the municipal corporation or the district collector’s office which is making our life difficult.”Gaikwad who used to earn Rs 300 - 400 per day said that he has to pay the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) of Rs 4,000 for the auto. “I have defaulted on the last month payment and same will happen for this month. The banks are also harsh and not giving us any reprieve during this crisis ,” he said.Auto driver Ismail Shaikh , of Kondhwa is a diabetic who has eight members of the family to look after. “ We are in a deep crisis and don’t have any financial backing or assistance from the state government. Since the lockdown is in force, we can’t do any other job except auto driving. I am a diabetic and require daily medicine. Earlier, I used to earn Rs 300 on daily basis and same used to utilise for supporting the household. Now, whatever little I had saved is getting over and situation is not far when we will starve as no help is forthcoming from the government ,” he said.Khadki auto driver Kisan Gaikwad said “ I don’t have any money left to buy grocery and essentials. My situation has been reduced to that of a beggar due to penury. We dont have any future left if the lockdown continues ,”Pune Rickshaw Panchyat President Nitin Pawar said that the situation is grim for over a lakh auto drivers in the city in absence of daily income. “ Their financial position is precarious and there is a need for strong backing from the government to support this large section of the society which has become unemployed due to the lockdown.”He said the Panchayat was doing all it could to provide grocery and other essentials to autodrivers to whatever extent possible. “But still nothing can make up for their daily income. Their future appears to be grim and strong steps of financial help are the need of the hour ,” he said. He further demanded that the government extend cash benefit Rs 8000 per month for three months and ration for three months in the form of state package to the auto drivers.

29-04-2020||Pune||Social distancing is a luxurious myth in Pune slums||There is no sliver of space in Prakash Salve’s house for social distancing. The 40-year-old man lives with his family in a small room at Tadiwala road slum.A spot check by HT on Monday to congested slum areas like Tadiwala road, Patil Estate, Lakshminagar and Lumbininagar revealed that social distancing is not a realistic expectation here. Families with 4-6 members live in a space whose hallway does not allow for two people to stand shoulder-to-shoulder.Salve who had just come out of his home to see why the people have gathered said, “There is a lot of rush in the area simply because the heat does not allow for a comfortable isolation.” When asked where his house was, he walked 4-5 steps and stopped, pointing towards his residence - a tin-roof structure that emanated heat. The luxury of social distancing was clearly not for him.The special police officers (SPOs) appointed by the Pune police are providing support to people living in slums.“We have identified 48 lanes on private road and groups of lanes in Tadiwala road. There are 20 SPOs who work as leaders with multiple subordinates. There is a group for vegetable delivery, meat and eggs, food grains, and medicines. There are lane-wise groups where the placed orders are recorded. So the SPOs will go to the houses, take the money - mostly through Google Pay - and place the orders. The appointed leaders collect the money and give it to the sellers,” said assistant police inspector Amol Kale of Tadiwala police outpost in the jurisdiction of Bundgarden police station.“There are people on the streets, true. But it is much less than what it used to be four-five days ago,” says Raju Kamble, one of the SPOs.According to API Kale who manages the SPOs, there are hardly 35-40 policemen for the settlement of over 1 lakh people.The scenario was similar in at Patil Estate which has a population of a few thousands.“The aim is to ensure that if the infection has spread, it remains inside the micro-clusters like these places. The help will reach inside. The SPOs are force multipliers since police cannot possibly reach everywhere,” said joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve.Some of the people in the congested areas, who are willing, will also be provided accommodation in shelters which the PMC is in process of identifying, said Joint CP Shisve.The crime branch, led by additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale, are in the process of recruiting more SPOs. The police aim to reach a strength of over 5,000 SPOs in the next two-three days, according to Morale. The crime branch is also in the process of making an explainer video for dos and donts and safety tips for SPOs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/social-distancing-is-a-luxurious-myth-in-city-slums/story-Jxy948Zd3PUGtesskcPnzI.html
29-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Giving support to the needy in Marathi film industry, others||Businessman Punit Balan has been extending support to various needy sections of society, including people in the lowest rung in the Marathi film industry.What exactly are you doing in this crisis?As a business group, we are trying our level best to reach out and help people in need. We are distributing basic grocery to needy people, we have reached more than 15000 people so far and it is continuing non-stop, we are distributing essential things, like distributed masks and gloves to the frontline people like the police, doctors. We are also organising tests for the Metro Medical Foundation across the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, covering all the police Chowkis. Then along with Marathi film director/ actor Praveen Tarde, we have set up a fund and paid them month’s salary for all the technical staff on the set of Mulshi Pattern, we have paid everyone their salary in their account and also given them ration kits, besides donating Rs 5 lakh rupees to the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Chitrapat Mahamandal, so that we can look after 250 people working behind the scenes on sets in all capacities. We also help police by providing them with water bottles to withstand the heat while they are on duty. We are also taken cognisance of the Tamasha artiste and are helping them financially and with the help of Sahayadri Hospital and the Mayor of Pune, we are aiming to reach as many people across the city and district as we can.How does your day begin and roll out?My day begins with exercise, I love to exercise and it is one thing that I do follow diligently. I exercise along with my wife Janhvi within the house. Once breakfast is done, I get down to making calls, video conferencing and then visit our distribution centre in Manikchand House, then look at whether our volunteers are maintaining social distance and everyone is taking care before venturing out to distribute.What precautions are you taking?COVID-19 is a communicable disease and I make sure not just I but my entire staff and volunteers use mask, handgloves, and we have enough sanitizers across all the offices, centres, cars as well as in home. It is compulsory to use them before going out or coming in to any of the premises. To follow a complete regime, I eat only home cooked food, mostly proteins and eat before 6.30 pm.What is your view of the Covid-19 situation in Pune?This is the first time that PMC is dealing with such a epidemic on this scale and I applaud them for their quick deicsions and trying to work with many groups and centres in a streamlined fashion. They will be loopholes but the management seems to be working well so far. It is after all teamwork on the frontline with doctors and police putting in all their efforts to control it.What gaps do you see in health and relief work?My fear is that people are simply not understanding the enormity of the epidemic and this can be seen with rising figures despite lockdown. With so many people coordinating, between centres, volunteers and administration, what is required is people’s participation and leaving aside religious sentiments and traditions for the time being to work together as a team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/giving-support-to-the-needy-in-marathi-film-industry-others/story-R9GRmGWkiRjPheaR5Uq4qM.html

However, this time around the owner has not given wages to around 200 workers,” said Mohammed Akbar, a resident of Doda. “While the mill is functioning, the owner has refused to give us our wages that vary from ₹9,000 to ₹13,000. Today when we insisted upon getting our wages, the mill management threw us out and threatened us,” Akbar added.Another worker, Puran Singh Gurjar, from Madhya Pradesh, also made similar allegations. “We haven’t been given wages for three months. We were not even provided food amid this lockdown and today they threw us out because we demanded pending wages. We were treated like prisoners,” said Gurjar.The manager of Nicer Paper Mill at Maroli, Rajinder Singh, said the mill was facing a financial crunch due to lockdown and promised to clear pending wages by Wednesday.SSP Shailendra Kumar Mishra, police chief of Kathua district, said there were 50 or so workers who were protesting. He said, “Following protests outside the mill, a police party reached the spot and heard out the agitating workers. The mill owner was also summoned and the matter is sorted. The mill has given an assurance to retain all workers and none of them will be sacked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-paper-mill-workers-protest-over-pending-wages/story-nZ1710u67vZ1t5VEqUDdrI.html
29-04-2020||Bangalore||Siddaramaiah suggests allowing liquor sale in green districts of Karnataka||Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday suggested the Karnataka government can allow sale of liquor in green districts that have no active cases of COVID-19, with certain restrictions.The Leader of Opposition in the Assembly also demanded that the state government announce a “special package” for unorganised sector workers, street vendors and autorickshaw drivers, among others, all daily wagers whose lives are affected by lockdown.“Merely because there is an economic slowdown in the state, I don’t recommend that alcohol should be allowed to be sold. But, wherever there are green districts, they can open (liquor shops) with certain restrictions, I think that they can do,” Siddaramaiah told reporters in response to a question.There are 14 districts in the state that are categorised as green, they include- Yadgir, Raichur, Koppal, Haveri, Davangere, Shivamogga, Chitradurga, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Hassan, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar, Ramanagara and Kolar.Despite pressure to kickstart economic activities to boost the state’s finances by allowing sale of liquor and excise department too suggesting regulated sale through state-run MSIL outlets, the Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa led government did not go ahead with it, following the Centre’s guidelines and as it may lead to crowding at shops. Siddaramaiah also demanded that a special package needs to be announced for unorganised sector workers, street vendors and autorickshaw drivers, among others.Alleging that the government has failed to control the spread of coronavirus, he said it is the government’s responsibility to take care of the basic needs of those from the unorganised sector, whose lives have been impacted by the lockdown.“It is the duty of the government and they should do it immediately. The package should also be announced. I will hold discussions with leaders of other opposition parties like JD(S), CPI, CPI(M) and BSP in this regard and also on trouble faced by farmers,” he added.Alleging discrimination in supply of food packets and ration kits, Siddaramaiah said it was being supplied properly only in constituencies represented by BJP legislators.“Politics is being played out in supply of food materials to the needy, keeping corporation elections in mind... We don’t want to do politics at this point in time as there is lockdown. If things continue to be the same after the lockdown ends, we will protest on the streets,” he said.Siddaramaiah on Tuesday interacted with representatives of autorickshaw and cab drivers, street vendors, barbers, unorganised workers organisations, among others, to understand the difficulties faced by them during lockdown and to know whether help from the government has reached them.He said most of them don’t have work and it has become difficult for them to lead their normal lives.They raised several issues like auto and cab drivers being unable to pay road tax and EMI, he said, adding that he would write a detailed letter to the Chief Minister in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/siddaramaiah-suggests-allowing-liquor-sale-in-green-districts-of-karnataka/story-pjdEtGSC5bBRS2BFY2FolN.html

29-04-2020||City||CCI buys 41% of 2019’s cotton produce of south Malwa||With the purchase of one lakh quintal raw cotton from south Malwa districts after it resumed operations two weeks ago, the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has bought about 41% of the total cotton produced in 2019.According to official data, about 44,000 quintal cotton has been procured from Fazilka and 41,000 quintal from Mansa district since April 14. The central agency is estimated to have bought cotton worth Rs 54 crore after it resumed procurement on April 14. Cotton purchase was suspended after curfew was imposed in Punjab on March 23 due to Covid-19 outbreak.Officials say that despite the pandemic, CCI has successfully purchased 41% of total cotton sold in the south Malwa market this season. Procurement is still on at different districts and about four lakh quintal more is expected to be purchased in the coming weeks.“The CCI started procurement in October last year after private players were paying farmers less than the MSP. By March 21, when purchase had to be suspended, CCI had disbursed Rs 850 crore to cotton growers. For purchase from April 14 onwards, CCI has already paid Rs 25 crore to farmers and the process to clear dues of Rs 29 crore is on,” said a CCI official, pleading anonymity.State cotton coordinator Rajnish Goel said that till March 21, 37.11 lakh quintal was purchased in Punjab and CCI had bought 14.40 lakh quintal cotton at the MSP (minimum support price). Rest of the produce of 22.50 lakh quintal was purchased by private players.“A section of farmers was still holding back cotton stock so the state government decided to resume purchase amid curfew. CCI was granted permission to start purchasing cotton from Mansa on April 14. Later, Fazilka, Muktsar, Bathinda and Faridkot were also covered. Purchase is being done amid strict adherence of medical protocol issued in view of the pandemic,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cci-buys-41-of-2019-s-cotton-produce-of-south-malwa/story-DHRdHsuu1LuHT1yRP4dvdL.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s GMCH doctors flag safety issues, seek testing for all||After three junior doctors tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), resident doctors from the department of anaesthesia at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, wrote a letter to the hospital authorities highlighting the “apathy of the department towards the staff posted in various operation theatres (OTs) and intensive care units (ICUs)”.“On April 24, an OT attendant (name hidden) was tested positive and some of the residents posted on duty were being refused testing for SARS-CoV-2 (Covid) on baseless criteria like “not shaking of hands” and “not sharing of meals” completely discounting all logic and disregarding the spread via fomites and aerosols,” said the letter, adding that “the authorities were refusing to test resident doctors because they “do not have a high grade fever”.In the next three days, three doctors of the same department were tested positive. The doctors sought an “explanation” as to why so many resident doctors of the department were posted despite less patient footfall and clear guidelines exhorting departments to decrease the number of doctors being exposed daily.“Time and again our pleas of reducing the number of residents (of anesthesia department) in various duty areas have fallen on deaf ears. Vague and unscientific justifications have been given for the excess number of residents in the duty spots. No considerations were given even to pregnant and lactating mothers in the department and they were all placed at the same risk,” the letter said, asking why despite Chandigarh being a red zone, patients coming for emergency surgical interventions were not being tested for Covid.Stating that residents in emergency OT had no access to sanitisers, the doctors added that they were fighting the war against the global pandemic, but “placing us under unnecessary risk is never justified”.They urged the head of department to make a roster such that least number of residents are called for duty, besides arranging the necessary equipment. After every seven days continuous duty, residents should be given 14 days off, the doctors urged.Dr Pradeep Atter, a resident at the department, said they met the head of the department, Dr Sukanya Mitra, regarding the letter and said that ‘their issues had been addressed’ and ‘they are satisfied as she has ensured testing of all residents of the department.”Dr Mitra, however, refused to comment saying she is not authorised to talk to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chanidgarh-s-gmch-doctors-flag-safety-issues-seek-testing-for-all/story-HSVmQMqetC0PQxvQDIQqdN.html

There are 800 badminton players from the city who train at PDMBA under 25 coaches. Nine courts are always packed with players and coaches during any season.PDMBA is making sure that players stay fit and fresh during the Covid-19 pandemic by conducting Facebook live sessions, sharing different techniques with coaches over WhatsApp or sharing Past Masters of Indian Badminton series articles penned by Shirish Nadkarni with players.“Life must go on and we are ensuring that people associated with the sport spend the time learning a lot of new things,” said Ranjeet Natu, honorary secretary of PDMBA.“We first started by sharing articles of Past Masters of Indian Badminton series which will enhance the knowledge of young badminton players. The articles give information about all badminton greats from our country starting from Nandu Natekar to Pullela Gopichand,” said Natu.Keeping coaches updated with the new techniques and coaching skills has always been PDMBA’s top priority. “The association has created a WhatsApp group of coaches wherein various coaching techniques are shared,” said Natu.“We will also be conducting Facebook live seminars with eminent personalities from different fields. It will start with Dr Atul Biniwale on sports nutrition and physical fitness. He is also the vice-president of PDMBA, then, Gayatri Vartak, a sports psychologist, will also be conducting a session and Dr Prassana Pathak, a physiotherapist will hold a session on rehabilitation and prevention of injuries,” explained Natu.PDMBA is also getting ready for the post Covid-19 phase and are all set to upgrade the modern sports complex.“I hope badminton action starts by end of May, since it is not a body contact sport. However, we will still ensure all precautions are followed. We will be setting up sanitisation chambers and will also purchase thermal temperature monitors,” added Natu.Summer camps were cancelled due to the lockdown and PDMBA had planned an inter-club league which was scheduled for the third week of May. “We all were eagerly waiting for the inter-club league, but unfortunately we have to postpone it,” added Natu.PDMBA is also donating Rs 1 lakh each to PM Cares Fund and the chief minister’s relief fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/we-hope-badminton-sessions-can-resume-by-end-of-may-says-pdmba-honorary-secretary-ranjeet-natu/story-n4W7bvQtAs4c8EWh0srs8H.html
29-04-2020||Pune||Pune’s Sassoon hospital awaits ICMR approval for plasma therapy||Pune: While Sassoon General Hospital is awaiting permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to start plasma therapy on patients, the Union ministry of health on Wednesday clarified that the treatment should be used only for research and trial purpose and not on patients.Earlier, state health minister Rajesh Tope had said that Centre has granted permission to start plasma therapy in government hospitals in Maharashtra following which Pune district administration prepared a list of donors though few of them expressed reluctance to offer plasma. While the central health ministry has approved the usage of plasma therapy to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra, every hospital needs an official permission from the ICMR to begin the treatment process.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “We are in final stages of approval before we can start the process of plasma therapy. We have prepared a list and are convincing people to donate their blood for treatment of others. Some people had refused to donate blood which is their right. As soon as the official paper work is over, we can start with plasma transfusion for critically ill patients.”Most of those identified by the district administration as donors are those who recovered in the first batch during March. One of the person recovered from Covid-19 from that batch said requesting anonymity, “It is true that PMC officials called me for plasma therapy, but I haven’t made up my mind.”On Monday, Pune-based businessman Avinash Bhosale donated a plasmapheresis machine used to separate plasma from blood of a cured patient. The machine can be put to use only after approval from the ICMR. Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “For the treatment of critically ill patients, we are awaiting approval from the ICMR for use of plasma therapy. A plasmapheresis machine has been donated to Sassoon which would be used to start the therapy.”At Delhi, on Wednesday, Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, ministry of health said, “Plasma therapy is being experimented, however no evidence that this can be used as a treatment. National level study is launched by ICMR to study the efficacy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sassoon-awaits-icmr-approval-for-plasma-therapy-amid-centre-s-caution-over-its-use-for-covid-treatment/story-Te4GAGXHT1IjPq1vDKDW4O.html
29-04-2020||City||Ludhiana administration cancels licences of 7 arhtiyas for flouting orders||The market committee has cancelled licences of seven arhtiyas who were caught selling vegetables and fruits during night hours at the sabzi mandi near Jalandhar bypass on days declared closed by the administration.As per officials, the licences were cancelled on Tuesday following the recommendations of committee chairman Darshan Lal (Laddoo) Baweja. Committee secretary Deepak Sharma said the arhtiyas whose licences had been cancelled included Walia and Sons, Nitish Fruit Company, Shivam Trading Company, Laksh Trading Company, Ashok Kumar and Company, Chaman Lal-Prem Nath and Om Prakash-Pradeep Kumar. Baweja said they had received complaints that some arhtiyas were involved in illegal operations during night hours and closed days.For reducing rush at the market amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the administration had decided that arhtiyas could visit the mandi only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and sell vegetables and fruits to ward vendors from 4am to 10pm everyday at designated sites. No street vendor will be allowed to enter the market.However, videos showing the arhtiyas selling vegetables to street vendors during night went viral. The Basti Jodhewal police had also arrested four vendors, who had purchased vegetables from the market during night hours on April 17.Following investigation, notices were served on the arhtiyas seeking reply. It is the first time that strict action has been taken against the arhtiyas for violating the norms.ARHTIYA ASSOCIATION OPPOSES ACTIONCondemning the action against arhtiyas, Arhtiya Association president Gurkamal Singh Ilu said, “Cancellation of licences is a wrong decision as arhtiyas were only transporting fruit, as allowed by the market committee. No sale or purchase was being made in the market and the union will raise the matter after all the arhtiyas, who have been home-quarantined, resume work.”50 ARHTIYAS HOME- QUARANTINEDAfter district mandi officer (DMO) Jasbir Kaur had tested positive in the middle of April and following suspicions that virus victim ACP Anil Kohli had also contracted it while he was deputed at the mandi, the administration and the health department have home-quarantined around 50 arhtiyas working in the sabzi mandi, said Gurkamal Singh.Sub-inspector Arshpreet, her driver ASI Sukhdev Singh and the gunman of Kohli had also contracted the virus while they were deputed with ACP Kohli.FOUR TRUCKS IMPOUNDED FOR UNLOADING BANANAS ILLEGALLYBaweja said committee officials have confiscated four trucks, owners of which were illegally unloading bananas in the market. Truck owners had got the permission to unload the fruit in Amritsar, but they were unloading the same in Ludhiana. The trucks would be released after charging penalty from owners, the officials added.A large number of residents visited the market for purchasing vegetables and fruits on Tuesday also defeating the purpose of social distancing. Further, a large number of residents also gathered at the sites, earmarked in every ward for ward-wise suppliers to provide vegetables and fruits to street vendors for onward sale in the city. The administration had earlier announced that no individual resident would be allowed to purchase vegetables at these sites.Baweja said currently the mandi was operating only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays to ensure social distancing. However, when the market opens on these days, crowds of people defeat the purpose of the move. He said he would urge the deputy commissioner to open the market for at least six days a week, and ban the entry of street vendors to the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-operations-at-sabzi-mandi-ludhiana-market-committee-cancels-licences-of-seven-arhtiyas/story-hYzwGAcjNwQOJpxL0UiIcK.html
29-04-2020||Pune||HSC, SSC Board seeks passes for evaluators to ensure timely results||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) has appealed to the state government to provide special police permits to evaluators of answer sheets of Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and State Secondary Certificate (SSC) exams held in February and March.With the country under the lockdown for over a month now due to the Covid-19 pandemic, only people covered under essential services such as doctors, policemen, select government and medical staff among others are allowed to move out on duty.The board in its appeal said that if the answer sheets are not evaluated within the stipulated time, it could lead to the delay in the results which are usually scheduled to be released in the first week of June.“Currently, 80 per cent of HSC and around 60 per cent of SSC answer sheets are been checked and rest are remaining. Teachers who are checking the papers need to submit their answer sheets to their respective divisional board offices, but due to the lockdown they have not been able to go out. Specially in the rural parts teachers are having issues of coming outside their homes and submit the answer sheets. So, we have demanded that in each district, four centres should be opened where teachers can submit the answer sheets,” said Ashok Bhosale, secretary of MSBSHSE.“Our efforts are going on to complete this paper checking and evaluation procedure within the time and for that we have sent a proposal to the state government requesting them to allow teachers out for this official work. Teachers should be given necessary permission passes so that they won’t face any police action,” added Bhosale.This year around 17 lakh students have appeared for SSC exams across the state, out of which 9 lakh answer sheets have been checked. For HSC around 14 lakh students has appeared out of which 11 lakh answer sheets have been checked. Every year normally in the first week of June HSC results are declared and within next one week SSC results are declared by the state board. HSC exams were held from February 18 to March 18 and all the exams of HSC from different streams – Arts, Commerce and Science - were completed. The SSC exams were scheduled from March 3 to 23, but the last paper of Social Science part II (Geography) was cancelled by the state education department due to Covid-19 pandemic. Also, the vocational subject exams of SSC which were to be held between March 24 to April 4 were cancelled. Both the HSC and SSC exams were held across nine divisions of MSBSHSE - Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Konkan, Latur, Aurangabad, Amravati and Kolhapur. No decision has been taken about the marking system for the cancelled Geography paper. The ‘Best of Five’ formula may be implemented this year and the average scores will be declared, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/hsc-ssc-board-seeks-passes-for-evaluators-to-ensure-timely-results/story-fQIrMwI8kLReyR3ueIA9nK.html

The southern state’s districts have been divided into four colour-coded zones—six red zones, including Bengaluru and Mysuru, five each in orange and yellow, and 10 green with zero cases of Covid-19.According to the containment guidelines released by the Union health ministry for large outbreaks, an area from where either one person has tested positive on or after April 11 or which has at least 50 contacts of a Covid-19 patient living in the same place, can be declared as a coronavirus hotspot or containment zone.Only one district in Karnataka, Bengaluru Urban, was more than 15 active Covid-19 cases on March 25, when the country went into lockdown mode. Mysuru and Belagavi were added in the red zone halfway through April and three more districts of Vijayapura, Bagalkot and Kalaburagi were put on the list on Monday.The last three districts were in the orange zone with 6-14 active cases in mid-April. Districts like Kodagu, Davanagere and Udupi that were in yellow zone with one to five cases at the beginning of the lockdown are now in green with not a single active case. They have joined 10 other districts which have not reported a single case of Covid-19 throughout. Several areas in the state’s capital of Bengaluru have been identified as containment zones where the government has ordered complete lockdown and aggressive restrictions to avoid further spread of the disease. Eight new cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Karnataka, taking the total number of infections in the state to 520, the state health department said on Tuesday. This includes 20 deaths and 198 discharges.Out of eight new cases, six are from Kalaburagi and all are contacts of a person, who already tested positive. Among them four are women.Of the fresh cases is a man from Bengaluru Urban, who was in contact with those in containment zone of BBMP Ward-135; and the other from Gadag, who has a history of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI).Eight districts from the state have now been identified as Covid-19 hotspots or containment zones.• Bengaluru Urban• Mysuru• Belagavi• Dakshina Kannada• Bidar• Kalaburugi• Bagalkot• DharwardThese 10 districts are in the category of green zone:• Chamrajnagar• Chikmagalur• Hassan• Haveri• Kolar• Koppala• Raichur• Ramanagar• Shimoga• Yadgiri• Kodagu• Davanagere• Udupi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/covid-19-how-karnataka-added-6-red-zones-from-1-in-a-month/story-B4V7hQASi09YUijCnvkrzH.html

Nine tribes, including Korwa, fall under the PVTG.As per the 2011 Census, Korwas in the state are merely 35,606 of the total 3.29 crore population.Chanchala did her schooling from a government primary school in Khudram where her father Vigan Manjh is a teacher. She studied there up to class 5 and then took admission in Navodaya School in Garhwa where she did her matriculation.Resident of Ranka in Garhwa district, Chanchala, then came to Ranchi and did diploma in Electronics from Birla Institute of Technology (BIT), Mesra and BTech in Electronics and Communication from Birsa Institute of Technology (BIT), Sindri.“My father always wanted to see the Korwas shine as the backward tribe is still described as ‘hunter gatherer’. He always inspired me to ‘light a candle of progress’ in our tribe and he also encouraged me for cracking JPSC,” said Chanchala.She cleared preliminary exams of JPSC in 2016 and made it to JPSC Mains in 2019. In between, she also cracked Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission exam in 2018 and is currently posted as wireless sub-inspector in Ranchi.On her JPSC rank, the 28-year-old said, “I do not know about the ranks, as JPSC declared only the role numbers of the candidates who cracked the exams. However, I got selected in the administration department.”Eldest among four siblings, Chanchala wants to improve the education standard of her tribe so that they could get benefit of all government schemes. “Literacy rate of Korwa tribe is very poor. If we want to uplift the living standard of the tribe, quality education will be the key. This will help in awareness and avail the benefits of various government schemes,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/jpsc-result-2020-jharkhand-girl-from-most-vulnerable-tribe-bags-sixth-rank-in-civil-services-exam/story-jpV33evCo5XuzYcFhVAZIM.html
29-04-2020||Chandigarh||With 14 new cases, Covid-19 count doubles in four days in Chandigarh||In the biggest single-day spike in Chandigarh, the number of Covid-19 cases surged to 59 with 14 new patients confirmed positive on Tuesday.With this, the total count has more than doubled in four days from 28 on April 25 to 59 on April 28. The number of active cases is 42. The spike is being attributed to two pockets, Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26 and Sector 30, both of which account for 50% of the city’s cases.The new cases include five family members of a 38-year-old man from Bapu Dham Colony who tested positive on Monday and was a contact of the 30-year-old operation theatre (OT) attendant of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, who triggered the spike. His wife, aged 36, three daughters aged 18, 16 and 13, and son, aged 10, are now infected.Another 47-year-old woman, 24-year-old man and 15-year-old boy from the same locality have also tested positive. A 33 -year-old man from Sector 33B — also part of the same chain of transmission — has also been found infected.SECTOR-30 CASES IDENTIFIED DURING SURVEYThe remaining five cases, reported from Sector 30, were identified during the health department’s house-to-house survey. They include a woman, aged 53, and a man, aged 62, from one household in Sector 30B. The other three are women aged 23, 27 and 35, from three different households. They have 28 contacts who have also been sampled with test results are awaited.Meanwhile, family members of the two doctors from GMCH-32 have tested negative. Both the doctors, residents of sector 49 and 21, were tested positive on Monday.The chain of transmission starting from the 30-year-old GMCH-32 employee who tested positive last Friday has infected 23 people till now. It includes at least five members of his family, six healthcare workers in GMCH-32 besides other community contacts in the congested Bapu Dham Colony. Surprisingly, the source of infection still remains a mystery.Sector 30 is another worry for health authorities with one in every four cases reported in Chandigarh since March 18 from that area. While the source of infection of only two cases reported in early April has been traced, what is worrisome is that the new cases are scattered around the locality with no definite source identified.Devinder Singh Babla, area councillor of Sector 30, has also written to the Chandigarh administrator, VPS Badnore stating that one common pattern amongst new cases reported today was their regular visits for checkups to GMCH-32.Hindustan Times has not been able to verify the claim.He also requested that more than 5,000 people living in the Sector-30 EWS Colony be screened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-new-covid-19-cases-in-chandigarh-take-ut-corona-count-to-50/story-1ZJaPYwEEZK9yYUBg1PocL.html
29-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 lockdown: Curbs at 4 red zones in Delhi likely to be eased by May 3||By May 3, when the nationwide lockdown is scheduled to end, at least four containment zones in Delhi are likely to become eligible for scaling down of containment measures, according to government data.Under the guidelines of the Union health ministry, containment measures in the red zones can be “scaled down if no secondary laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 case is reported in the geographic quarantine zone for at least four weeks after the last confirmed test has been isolated and all his contacts have been followed up for 28 days.”Delhi currently has 99 containment zones. Delhi government on Monday announced two new containment zones, taking total tally to 99 from 97. The newly added containment zones are Pillanji village in New Delhi district and affected areas — Nirankari Gali, Nakshtra Gali, Nala Boring Gali, Ravan Wali Gali, Jameela Masjid Baoli, dargah gurudwara wali Gali, Thane wali gali and Terminal Gali — in South district, near Mehrauli. The containment zone in south Delhi was formed after two persons engaged in food distribution had tested positive. The Pillanji village was declared containment zone after five Covid-19 positive cases were reported from the area between April 17 and April 25.Till date, one red zone has been de-contained in Delhi. Last Friday, the government scaled down containment measures in East Delhi’s Mansara Apartments, exactly 28 days after the first and only case of Covid-19 was recorded in the zone.The four containment zones that are likely to become eligible for scaling down of containment measures are Mayurdhwaj Apartment in IP Extension, Vardhman Apartment in Mayur Vihar, the sealed portion of lane number 4 in Krishnakunj Extension, and four blocks of Dilshad Garden. While the first three come under the East Delhi revenue district, the fourth comes under the Shahdara revenue district.In the four of them, the last case of Covid-19 was recorded between April 1 and April 5, which essentially means they will become eligible for reduced containment measures between April 29 and May 3, provided no fresh case is recorded in the next few days.Health department officials in the two districts said that the situation in all four zones is under control and the probability of further local transmission of the virus is close to none.Similarly, at least three more containment zones are likely to become eligible for relaxations by May 10. The areas are — Shahjahanabad society in Sector 11 of Dwarka, Deenpur and Ashok Nagar. While the first two come under South West Delhi revenue district, the third comes under West Delhi.In Shahjahanabad society and Ashok Nagar, no fresh case or any case of local transmission was recorded since the first case was reported and the areas were sealed on April 8, said government officials, adding that Deenpur witnessed local transmission, the latest having been recorded on April 12.“We have conducted community tests in all three of these red zones and the results were favourable. The results suggested that transmission did not occur,” a senior official of the health department said.Containment zones are areas in which all routes are sealed and residents are directed to maintain strict quarantine. Door-to-door health checks are conducted periodically and sanitisation is scaled up. Community tests are conducted in these areas. All shops are closed and the district administration ensures doorstep delivery of essential goods on a daily basis. The size of the zone may range from a part of a lane to a cluster of several blocks of a locality. The area contained is directly proportional to population density and scale of an outbreak among other factors.A senior official said that after the zones are de-notified, barricades would be removed and shops selling essential goods around them would be allowed to open. However, residents are still recommended to stay indoors and undergo health check follow-ups under the protocol for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/curbs-at-four-red-zones-likely-to-be-eased-by-may-3/story-3J1D6aqPzAGk5lwNm8B6BI.html
29-04-2020||World||Russia slams US arguments for low-yield nukes||The Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday rejected U.S. arguments for fielding low-yield nuclear warheads, warning that an attempt to use such weapons against Russia would trigger an all-out nuclear retaliation.The U.S. State Department argued in a paper released last week that fitting the low-yield nuclear warheads to submarine-launched ballistic missiles would help counter potential new threats from Russia and China. It charged that Moscow in particular was pondering the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons as a way of coercion in a limited conflict — an assertion that Russia has repeatedly denied.The State Department noted that the new supplemental warhead “reduces the risk of nuclear war by reinforcing extended deterrence and assurance.”The Russian Foreign Ministry sees it otherwise.The ministry’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, commented on the State Department’s paper at a briefing on Wednesday, emphasizing that the U.S. shouldn’t view its new low-yield warheads as a flexible tool that could help avert an all-out nuclear conflict with Russia.“Any attack involving a U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), regardless of its weapon specifications, would be perceived as a nuclear aggression,” Zakharova said. “Those who like to theorize about the flexibility of American nuclear potential must understand that in line with the Russian military doctrine such actions are seen as warranting retaliatory use of nuclear weapons by Russia.”Zakharova cast the U.S. deployment of low-yield warheads as a destabilizing move that would result in “lowering the nuclear threshold.”U.S.-Russian differences on nuclear arms issues come as relations between Moscow and Washington are at post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis and the accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. 2016 presidential election.Last year, both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.The only U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control agreement still standing is the New START treaty, which was signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify the compliance.Russia has offered to extend the New START that expires in February 2021, while the Trump administration has pushed for a new arms control pact that would also include China. Moscow has described that idea as unfeasible, pointing at Beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its much smaller nuclear arsenal.In a statement Wednesday marking the 10th anniversary of signing the New START, the Russian Foreign Ministry hailed the treaty as an instrument that helps ensure predictability in the nuclear sphere and reaffirmed Moscow’s offer to extend it without any preconditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slams-us-arguments-for-low-yield-nukes/story-nlwMwZZLJ9PFeiQPyBpodL.html
29-04-2020||World||Remdesivir shows ‘clear-cut’ effect in treating coronavirus: Anthony Fauci||A major new study proves that the antiviral drug remdesivir is effective in saving people with serious cases of COVID-19, top US doctor Anthony Fauci said Wednesday.Fauci, speaking at the White House, said “the data shows remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.”This proves “that a drug can block this virus,” he said, comparing the discovery to the fight for AIDS therapies four decades ago.Fauci said a smaller Chinese study released separately on Wednesday showing no benefits from remdesivir was “not an adequate study.” Full NIAID statement on remdesivir trial results: pic.twitter.com/bsnDQGVnPaFauci, the top US scientist for infectious diseases and a key advisor on President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force, said US pharmaceutical giant Gilead was in talks with the government to get an early release of remdesivir for the neediest cases.That would mean seriously ill patients, because the study only examined people already hospitalized, rather than those with mild or early symptoms, he said.As a veteran of the race to find therapies during the HIV/AIDS crisis starting in the 1980s, Fauci said the results reminded him of early breakthroughs during that era.“It was reminiscent of 34 years ago in 1986 when we were struggling for drugs for HIV and we had nothing,” he said.“It’s opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating” patients.Fauci stressed that the US study is reliable, unlike the “underpowered” version published in The Lancet after research in Wuhan, China.“It is the first truly high-powered, randomized placebo control trial,” Fauci said.He said the Food and Drug Administration would begin by making remdesivir “easily available to those who need it,” but a mass market release would need more complex approval.“The FDA, literally as we speak, is working with Gilead to figure out mechanisms to make this easily available to those who need it,” he said.The FDA will work “very expeditiously” on wider approval.Trump called the study “a beginning” and “a very positive event.”The study by China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China, published earlier in The Lancet, found that remdesivir “did not provide significant benefits over placebo.”The Wuhan study was conducted in 237 COVID-19 patients, half of whom were given remdesivir. The other half were treated as a control group and given standard antibiotics. The mortality rate was the same in both groups, around 14 percent of each.“I don’t like to pooh-pooh other studies, but that’s not an adequate study and everybody in the field feels that,” Fauci said.sms/ft||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remdesivir-shows-clear-cut-effect-in-treating-coronavirus-anthony-fauci/story-deJLJLTQMTyJyorClcAT5L.html
29-04-2020||World||Data on Gilead drug raises hopes in pandemic fight, Fauci calls it ‘highly significant’||A top U.S. health official said Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir is likely to become the standard of care for COVID-19 after early results from a key clinical trial on Wednesday showed it helped certain patients recover more quickly from the illness caused by the coronavirus.Preliminary results from a U.S. government trial show that patients given remdesivir had a 31% faster recovery time than those who received a placebo, results hailed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, as “highly significant.”Gilead earlier on Wednesday said remdesivir helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19 in the government-run trial, and provided additional data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of illness, sending its shares up more than 7%.“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear cut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recover. This is really quite important,” Fauci told reporters at the White House, likening it to a moment in 1986 “when we were struggling for drugs for HIV and we had nothing.”“This will be the standard of care,” Fauci predicted, adding, “The FDA, literally as we speak, is working with Gilead to figure out mechanisms to make this easily available to those who need it.”The closely watched drug has moved markets in the past few weeks following the release of several studies that painted a mixed picture of its effectiveness, and Fauci cautioned that the full data still needs to be analyzed.President Donald Trump during a White House meeting greeted Gilead’s reports as good news.Interest in Gilead’s drug has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, and doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in severe cases, until a preventive vaccine emerges.“There’s now enough data to support consideration of access under an emergency use authorization by FDA,” former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter.Gilead provided information on two clinical trials. The study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, met its main goal of helping patients with a range of severity of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Those results have been highly anticipated because it compares how patients who received remdesivir fared versus those given a placebo, meaning it should definitively demonstrate whether the drug provides benefit.“It is the first truly high-powered randomized placebo-controlled trial,” Fauci said.The trial’s lead researcher told Reuters on Friday that full results could come by mid-May.‘GLIMMER OF HOPE’Despite the excitement, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, global fellow at The Wilson Center in Washington, DC, said more information is needed.“While a new study offers a glimmer of hope that ... remdesivir has an effect against COVID-19, determination of its benefit for the general population must await release of pertinent details to evaluate the study’s findings and scientific analysis comparing them to other studies of the drug that have shown mixed results,” he said in a statement.Gilead also provided data on a study in severe COVID-19 patients it has conducted in dozens of medical centers, which does not have a placebo comparison but tested the drug given by intravenous infusion under five-day and 10-day regimens.In that 397-patient trial, Gilead said 62% of patients treated early with remdesivir were discharged from the hospital, compared with 49% of patients who were treated later in the course of the infection.Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey in a statement said a five-day regimen, “could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir.”Also on Wednesday, results were published by the Lancet medical journal of a trial conducted in China that concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients’ condition or reduce the pathogen’s presence in the bloodstream. Gilead said previously that those findings, released inadvertently by the World Health Organization last week, were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O’Day earlier this month said the company was prepared to donate 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to hospitals dealing with severely ill patients. Regulatory approval of the drug would also clear the way for commercial sales.Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host’s immune system.The company is also studying the drug in patients with less severe COVID-19, but those results are not expected until later next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-on-gilead-drug-raises-hopes-in-pandemic-fight-fauci-calls-it-highly-significant/story-PNiW5M4qtJ7Jh0YqisJ9VN.html
29-04-2020||World||Antiviral remdesivir showed ‘no significant benefit’ in virus patients||Treating coronavirus patients with the antiviral drug remdesivir showed no “significant clinical benefits” in the first randomised trial of its kind, according to research released on Wednesday.In a study among more than 200 Covid-19 patients in Wuhan, China, published in The Lancet, doctors found no positive effects of administering the drug compared with a control group of adults.The findings were released after US pharmaceutical giant Gilead, which makes remdesivir, said a separate large-scale trial with the drug had showed positive results.“Unfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,” said Bin Cao from China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in China, who led the research. “This is not the outcome we hoped for.”The Wuhan study was conducted in 237 Covid-19 patients, half of whom were given remdesivir. The other half were treated as a control group and given standard antibiotics. The mortality rate was the same in both groups, around 14 percent of each. However those patients who required ventilators spend far less time on the devices than the control group -- an average of seven days compared with an average of 15 days.“No significant differences were noted between the groups in duration of oxygen support, length of hospital stay, or time to discharge or death,” the study said.The authors said the trial has several limitations, including the fact that it was stopped prematurely when patient numbers dropped too low to continue as Wuhan got a grip on the outbreak. But they called for further randomised trials of the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiviral-remdesivir-showed-no-significant-benefit-in-virus-patients/story-vNaAUVxJZ6falVR86Ry4TN.html
29-04-2020||World||Singapore reports 690 new Covid-19 cases, mostly foreign workers||Singapore on Wednesday reported 690 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of Covid-19 patients, a vast majority of whom are foreigners, to 15,641, the health ministry said.Out of the 690 fresh cases, six are Singapore citizens or permanent residents while the rest of them are foreigners with work permits residing in dormitories, it said.“We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the press release that will be issued tonight,” the ministry said. “The main increase today continues to be for work permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing,” said the ministry.A total of 19 of the new cases were work permit holders (foreigners), living outside dormitories, it said. It said that the total number of coronavirus cases in the country stands at 15,641. Of the new cases, 63 per cent are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing, the ministry said. Twenty two of the 1,714 confirmed cases are still in hospitals and are in critical condition. Most of the rest are stable or improving. A total of 62 more Covid-19 patients were discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Wednesday, it said.To date, 1,188 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. So far, a total of 12,183 of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories - about 3.77 per cent - have tested positive, putting the spotlight on their living conditions, according to reports.Fourteen people have died to date from complications due to the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.Meanwhile, a media report said that the local transmission of the coronavirus in the general community has been low, at least up until the middle of March, based on findings by researchers from the Covid-19 research group at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).This shows that Singapore’s contact tracing efforts have been effective, according to three studies by the NCID that are among the first of their kind in the world, according to The Straits Times report.However, this also means that immunity rates are low and much of Singapore’s population remains susceptible to the virus, NCID executive director Leo Yee Sin told reporters on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-reports-690-new-covid-19-cases-mostly-foreign-workers/story-vNc9scKhfQGIXWDYC3MOXO.html

29-04-2020||World||California food for seniors plan could run out of money soon||California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first-in-the-nation plan to pay for and deliver three meals a day to vulnerable seniors during the coronavirus crisis has less than two weeks to launch before federal funding runs out, government documents show.It wasn’t clear how many, if any, cities and counties would be delivering meals in substantial numbers by May 10, when money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency is set to end. Also unclear is how much FEMA has budgeted for the program, though it told The Associated Press there is no preset limit.FEMA says it will cover three-quarters of the cost of preparing and delivering the food made by local restaurants, which could quickly soar into tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in the nation’s most populous state, which has 5.7 million seniors. The state, cities and counties would pick up the rest of the cost, but local governments would also get an infusion of cash from sales taxes they collect on the meals.To keep the federal money flowing, the Newsom administration must give a “detailed justification” for continuing the so-called emergency feeding program, FEMA said in an April 10 letter.“While it is anticipated that, upon successful program execution, the state will request an extension, there is no guarantee it will be granted,” the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services acknowledged in a planning document.Without an extension, FEMA said it would cover costs “necessary to end these services in an orderly manner” for 15 days beyond May 10.Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said the state had not submitted a request for an extension and would review the program before deciding.“The number of meals served will depend on the number of counties that decide to participate,” he said in an email.California requested the program in a letter to FEMA on April 1 and got approval nine days later. Newsom didn’t announce it and provide details on its scope until two weeks later.Newsom gave no hint of the tight timeframe for financing when he unveiled the program Friday. Also, while predicting that over a million seniors could benefit, he didn’t illuminate a key element for qualifying for $66-a-day meals: Recipients must be unable to purchase groceries and cook themselves.It isn’t clear how cities and counties could quickly determine who fits that criteria. They also are just beginning to figure out what restaurants would cook the meals and how they would be delivered.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti spoke hopefully Monday of having the first meals delivered by taxis next week, building off an existing food-delivery program. He didn’t estimate how many people could be served.Los Angeles County, the nation’s largest with 10 million residents, and neighboring San Bernardino County are developing plans, with no estimate for when they might be ready.California Pizza Kitchen was among the restaurants hoping to get a chance at preparing the meals, calling it “exciting.” But it said it was waiting for more details to determine if it would apply.At Nightbird in San Francisco, owner Kim Alter said in an email that the restaurant is “working to be a part of this.”“No word yet as to how it will play out,” Alter said.The meal plan was announced as Newsom and other state officials have started discussing easing stay-at-home orders imposed last month to deter the spread of the virus.Newsom has said the restrictions will likely last longer for people 65 and older because they are at greater risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.To be eligible for the meal program, seniors must either live alone or with one other person who is eligible. They can’t earn more than $74,940 per year, or $101,460 for a household of two, and they must have documented exposure to the coronavirus or be at high risk of exposure. Anyone already getting money from other federal food programs would be ineligible.Along with getting isolated seniors free, nutritious food, the intent was to generate income for cities and counties and steer business to restaurants devastated after sit-down dining rooms shuttered. The meals can’t include sugary drinks or high-salt options.Jot Condie, who heads the California Restaurant Association, predicted that virtually any restaurant could qualify, from high-end steakhouses to small mom-and-pop diners. The group previously said as many as one-third of the state’s restaurants might never reopen.“For a restaurant that qualifies this will be ... the only predictable business that they have,” Condie said. “It’s three meals a day to a set population.”Chris Hoene, executive director of the nonprofit California Budget & Policy Center, which advocates for low-income people, said that even if it takes a few months to get the meals to vulnerable seniors, “the need is still going to be there.”“We are a big state. And whenever we put new systems in place, it always takes more time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-food-for-seniors-plan-could-run-out-of-money-soon/story-vV4Tfza7aS63dxG1Q9EWEK.html
29-04-2020||World||Pence flouts guidelines on masks, US toll goes past Vietnam War||Vice President Mike Pence toured a medical facility in Minnesota Tuesday without a face mask or covering. He and the White House coronavirus task force that he leads have so assiduously canvassed Americans to wear in public places where social-distancing rules are impossible to follow.The vice-president, who has been a staid and amiable contrast to his flamboyant and scrappy boss, interacted with healthcare workers, officials and and patients, who all wore masks, as is the policy at the facility, Mayo Clinic, which said in a tweet, since deleted, that Pence had been told about it. Pence defended himself telling reporters later, “As vice president of the United States I’m tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus. He added that he wanted to to look workers and researchers “in the eye and say thank you”.At around that time, the number of reported and confirmed Covid-19 infections in the United States crept past the million-mark. And by Wednesday morning it had gone up to 1.01 million, with 24,385 new cases in the last 24 hours. Fatalities over the same period went up by 2,096 to 58,368, to cross another grim milestone. The novel coronavirus has now killed Americans than the 58,220 who perished in the Vietnam War. Face masks or coverings have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and repeatedly endorsed by Pence and the task force to prevent transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic people, specially in public places where the six-foot rule is difficult to observe.Pence’s boss, President Donald Trump has been leery of masks from day one and, as he touted questionable cures and therapeutics such as disinfectants most recently, clearly rejected it for himself. It is only a recommendation and “I don’t see it for myself”, he said announcing the measure on April 3, .Many states, specially the hardest hit such as New York and New Jersey, have since made face coverings mandatory in public places, such as grocery stores. pharmacies.Face coverings and social-distancing rules will be required increasingly as states begin reopening businesses and are expected to be continued for the foreseeable future.As the United States seeks to find a way out of the crisis, it has found itself confronting, for the first time during the epidemic, the prospect of food shortages. President Trump on Tuesday used his war powers under a cold-war era law to order meat processing companies to stay open and keep the food supply chains intact and running. At least 20 plants have closed in recent days due to high incidence of infections and deaths among their workers, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.“The food supply chain is breaking,” John H. Tyson, chairman of the board at Tyson’s, one of the country’s largest meat processors, wrote in a full-page newspaper ad in multiple publications Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pence-flouts-guidelines-on-masks-us-toll-goes-past-vietnam-war/story-74BDjFbrGT45MIt9UmyalJ.html

29-04-2020||World||Israel marks its Independence Day under coronavirus lockdown||Israelis celebrated their Independence Day at home Wednesday amid a nationwide lockdown aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.The national holiday, which honours the creation of Israel after the end of the British Mandate in 1948, is usually a festive occasion, with people heading to the beach, hosting barbecues and watching fireworks.This year, however, the government has banned public gatherings and ordered people to remain within 100 meters (yards) of their homes unless they require medicine or have other vital needs. Public transportation has been shut down and police are manning roadblocks to prevent travel.The Israeli air force devoted its annual fly-by to health workers, with four planes crisscrossing the nation and performing aerial acrobatics over hospitals and medical centers.President Reuven Rivlin hosted an annual televised event in which the president usually presents awards to soldiers. This year, the awards ceremony was postponed and the event was reconfigured as an online, star-studded tribute to medical workers and security forces, with performances by famous musicians and comedians but no live audience.In a video message, Rivlin thanked Israelis for their “resilience.”“I wish us all a happy and healthy year in which we can enjoy every moment of Israeli normality that we all miss so much,” he said.Wednesday is also the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau, a Nazi death camp. In honor of the occasion, the orchestras of the Israeli military and the U.S. Navy’s European command played the Israeli national anthem for Abba Naor, a Holocaust survivor in his 90s who lives in Israel.The performance was made via a Zoom call, with each musician and the two conductors performing remotely. Naor, calling in from his home, stood for the national anthem and then thanked U.S. forces for liberating the camp and saving his life.Israel has reported more than 15,700 cases and at least 210 deaths from the coronavirus. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, but can cause severe illness or death, particularly in elderly patients and those with underlying health problems.Israel imposed sweeping restrictions on movement and ordered most businesses to close in mid-March. It has recently begun easing those restrictions as the rate of new infections appears to have stabilized.The Independence Day lockdown is set to be lifted Wednesday night. Most shops will then be allowed to reopen, provided they meet regulations on social distancing and hygiene. People are required to wear masks in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-marks-its-independence-day-under-coronavirus-lockdown/story-jfcbUPKSOrRlQV9vOZRZYK.html
29-04-2020||World||What you need to know today about the virus outbreak||With many U.S. states lifting their restrictions according to their own timetables and needs, Americans are facing a bewildering multitude of decisions about what they should and should not do to protect themselves and their neighbors.Is it safe now to join the crowds at the beach or go out to eat at a favorite restaurant? To visit the elderly parents you haven’t seen in nearly two months? The less-than-satisfying answer from the experts is: It depends.WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY:— The U.S. economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate last quarter as the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the country and began triggering a recession that will end the longest expansion on record.— A coronavirus vaccine is still months or years away, but groups that peddle misinformation about immunizations are already taking aim, potentially eroding confidence in what could be humanity’s best chance to defeat the virus.— In cities around the world, public transport systems are the key to getting workers back on the job and restarting devastated economies, yet everything from trains to buses to ferries to bicycles will have to be re-imagined for the coronavirus era.— It starts with pulling on head-to-toe protective gear. Then comes a brisk walk down a hospital corridor, triple-gloved hands pushing a rattling anesthesia cart toward a door that leads to a frightened patient, gasping for air. Hundreds of times every week during this pandemic, doctors and nurses treating critically ill COVID-19 patients steel themselves for a procedure that remains anything but routine.— Seniors are at greater risk from COVID-19, and they now face added anxiety due to delays obtaining Medicare coverage. The delays stem from the closure of local Social Security offices to protect workers and the public during the pandemic.— China, taking a step toward a return to business as normal, announced that its previously postponed national legislature session will be held in late May.___WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.Here are the symptoms of the virus compared with the common flu.One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off.You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.TRACKING THE VIRUS: Drill down and zoom in at the individual county level, and you can access numbers that will show you the situation where you are, and where loved ones or people you’re worried about live.___ONE NUMBER:— 1,000: The number of coronavirus-related deaths in India, which has shelved a plan to give the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to thousands of people in Mumbai’s crowded slums to prevent coronavirus infections.IN OTHER NEWS:— TOKYO-VACCINE — An IOC official disagrees with suggestions by some scientists and doctors that a vaccine for Covid-19 is needed to hold the Tokyo Games next summer.— VIRUS OUTBREAK-TENNESSEE — Tennessee tourist spots like Casey Jones Village in Jackson have taken a financial hit since nonessential businesses closed in March as part of the response to the new coronavirus outbreak. But there’s hope for the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-you-need-to-know-today-about-the-virus-outbreak/story-xG6Q75KGFqN4I4G6AZDnwI.html

29-04-2020||World||Covid-19 triggers collateral damage fears, 18,000 UK cancer patients may die||Focussing on population infected by coronavirus and suspending treatment of cancer patients in the UK could lead to death of over 18,000 infected by the malignancy, experts forecast, as the country moved to widen groups eligible for testing of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The move by UK is being seen as part of efforts to reach a target of 1 lakh tests per day, in order to tackle the pandemic that has claimed 21,678 lives so far and infected 161,145 people nationwide.Hospitals have seen a major drop in non-coronavirus patients, prompting health officials to appeal to the people to continue to access the National Health Service as they did before the pandemic struck. Hospitals have restructured facilities to cater to Covid-19 and other patients.According to campaign group Macmillan Cancer Support, nearly 18,000 people with cancer in England could die as the pandemic has forced hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care. Cancer should not be ‘the forgotten C’, it said.Research by the group shows that an extra 6,270 people in England recently diagnosed with cancer could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915.Alvia Lai, of the University College London who led the research, said: “Our findings demonstrate the serious potential for unintended consequences of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which may negatively impact on patients with cancer and other underlying health conditions.”The UK-wide death toll from coronavirus was set to increase substantially when the government begins releasing figures across all locations, not only from hospitals, from Wednesday. Thousands more have reported died in care homes, hospices and private homes.Health secretary Matt Hancock announced that groups eligible for coronavirus testing will be extended to those over 65 years old and those who work outside the home. All NHS staff, hospital patients, care home workers and their elderly residents would be able to book tests even if they did not have symptoms, he said.The expansion of eligibility is expected to be a key factor in plans to ease lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-triggers-collateral-damage-fears-18-000-uk-cancer-patients-may-die/story-DVZOzVCk2vRpMwcfNEA8gI.html
29-04-2020||World||UN human rights expert accuse Myanmar army of fresh abuses||The UN’s human rights expert on Myanmar has called for a new investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity during recent fighting in the Southeast Asian country as she approaches the end of her appointment. Yanghee Lee, whose formal title is special rapporteur, accused Myanmar’s military of “inflicting immense suffering” on ethnic minorities in Rakhine and Chin states, where the government is battling the Arakan Army, a well-armed and well-trained guerrilla force representing the Buddhist Rakhine minority. “While the world is occupied with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Myanmar military continues to escalate its assault in Rakhine state, targeting the civilian population,” Lee said in a statement issued Wednesday in Geneva. She accused the military of “systematically violating the most fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights,” and said its conduct toward civilians “may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.” Lee, a South Korean whose term ends this month, has been a sharp critic of Myanmar’s military since her appointment in 2014, focusing especially on human rights abuses against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine state. In August 2017, the military -- known as the Tatmadaw -- launched what it called a clearance campaign in northern Rakhine state in response to attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group. The campaign forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. Security forces were accused of mass rapes and killings and burning thousands of homes. The International Court of Justice in the Netherlands agreed last year to rule on charges of genocide lodged against Myanmar. U.N. agencies and human rights organizations have extensively documented atrocities. Myanmar’s government says it acted justifiably and denies any major abuses. Lee linked the current situation in Rakhine and Chin to the government’s actions against the Rohingya, for which no senior officers have faced justice and token punishments were given to a handful of low-ranking security personnel. “Having faced no accountability, the Tatmadaw continues to operate with impunity. For decades, its tactics have intentionally maximized civilian suffering; we all know what they did to the Rohingya in 2017,” Lee said. “They are now targeting all civilians in the conflict area, with people from Rakhine, Rohingya, Mro, Daignet and Chin communities being killed in recent months. Their alleged crimes must be investigated in accordance with international standards, with perpetrators being held accountable.” The Arakan Army, which says it is seeking self-determination, has engaged in increasingly fierce combat with government forces since late 2018. Lee said government air and artillery strikes in recent weeks have killed and injured scores of adults and children. “More than 157,000 people have been displaced, and hundreds including women and children killed and wounded since the conflict started,” she said. Lee was also critical of the Arakan Army, which she said “has also conducted its hostilities in a manner that has had negative impacts on civilians, including kidnapping local officials and parliamentarians.” She added that the guerrilla force had declared a unilateral cease-fire, citing the need to combat the spread of Covid-19. “The focus of all authorities, including security forces, should be on dealing with the Covid-19 crisis,” Lee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-human-rights-expert-accuse-myanmar-army-of-fresh-abuses/story-dlLhdaVPMW8qbbMlxoCLiJ.html

29-04-2020||World||China sets May date for Parliament in Beijing in show of post-Covid confidence||China will hold its most important political event, the annual session of its rubber-stamp Parliament in the third week of May after postponing it for more than 10 weeks because of the Covid-19 outbreak, official media announced Wednesday.The reconvening of the Two Sessions, as it is known here, on May 21 signals that China has effectively brought the outbreak in control.The decision to allow thousands to come to Beijing from across China is a show of confidence by the Chinese government as it tries to show to the world its success in containing the virus. Official news agency, Xinhua said China would begin its annual Two Sessions meeting on May 21, when thousands of delegates to the National People’s Congress (NPC), the legislature, as well as to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top political consultative body, gather in the capital for around 10 days.The sessions are usually held early March.The upcoming session, however, could be shortened, a separate state media report said, quoting Parliamentarian delegates.During the choreographed meeting, about 3,000 national legislators from across China gather in Beijing to review work reports from the Communist Party of China-led central government as well as the country’s highest courts and the budget including for national defence for the year ahead.The announcement was made as Beijing health authorities said on Wednesday that the Capital’s emergency response level to Covid-19 would be lowered from the first to the second level from Thursday.On Wednesday, the Chinese mainland reported reports 22 new confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 21 imported cases, and 26 new asymptomatic ones in the past 24 hours.No deaths from the disease has been reported from the disease for nearly two weeks, health authorities said.China-Australia spatMeanwhile, the ongoing diplomatic tussle between China and Australia seem set to deepen with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying it was “entirely reasonable” for the world to ask for an international assessment into the origins of the pandemic.The coronavirus first emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before spreading to rest of China and the world: Until Wednesday it had killed more than 2 lakh people, sickened over 3 million and battered the world economy to its worst state in several decades.Morrison’s call for an international inquest has been aggressively opposed by Chinese diplomats who have said Australia should stop resorting to “petty tricks”.On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in Canberra, said on its website that details of a call between the Chinese envoy and Australian officials had first been “obviously leaked by some Australian officials” and it needed to set the record straight.“The Embassy of China doesn’t play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate,” an embassy spokesperson said in the statement.Chinse state media has strongly criticised Australia’s stand.Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the nationalistic Global Times said on Chinese social media that Australia was always making trouble.“It is a bit like chewing gum stuck on the sole of China’s shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off,” Hu wrote.China is Australia’s largest trading partner and Canberra has accused Beijing of economic coercion after the Chinese ambassador threatened a boycott of Australian goods and universities by Chinese citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sets-may-date-for-parliament-in-beijing-in-show-of-post-covid-confidence/story-NWrg3FHNFUv3mb3wvF9HVJ.html

In most places, some shops will open on May 11, and socializing will be permitted in outdoor cafés, bars, as well as services in churches and mosques at one third of their capacity.Territories that by that point keep the epidemic at bay will be granted further relaxation of restrictions in restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums by the end of May. Preschools will reopen then but only for parents who need to work, since in-classroom education won’t resume until the new school year in September.Barring any worsening of the outbreak, capacity in venues will be increased toward mid-June and beaches will open before gradually settling into a “new normal” that will allow domestic travel. International travel still needs to be sorted out by the European Union, Spain says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-reports-325-new-covid-19-deaths-total-deaths-cross-24-000/story-hRmOu2WhHIztBVrI0f70SO.html
29-04-2020||World||Suicide bomber kills 3, injures 15 in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul: Report||A suicide bomber on Wednesday targeted a base belonging to Afghan special forces on the southern outskirts of the capital, Kabul, killing at least three civilians and wounding 15, officials said.The government blamed the Taliban for the attack, which took place a day after the country’s defense minister and the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan visited the facility.The bombing happened outside the base for army commandos as civilian contractors working in the facility waited outside to get into the base, said a military official, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to the media about the attack.Tareq Arian, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said the site of the bombing was in the Chahar Asyab district and blamed the Taliban for the attack, calling it a crime against humanity.“The target was likely the base itself, but the bomber failed to reach his target and instead killed innocent civilians,” Arian said.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but both the Taliban and the Islamic State group are active in Kabul and its surroundings and have repeatedly struck military and civilian targets.On Tuesday, the Afghan defense minister, Gen. Assadullah Khalid, and the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Gen. Scott Miller, visited the base, known as Army Commando Corps, praising achievements of the Afghan commandos and their dedication in defending the country.Also Wednesday, a sticky bomb attached to vehicle detonated elsewhere in Kabul, wounding three civilians, according to Firdaus Faramarz, spokesman for the Kabul police chief. No one claimed responsibility for that attack.The Taliban have continued to attack security outposts, even as the U.S. and NATO proceed with a full troop withdrawal that is set to be completed next year under a deal signed at the end of February between the U.S. peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, and the Taliban.On Sunday, Khalilzad called on the country’s feuding political leaders to set their differences aside to combat the coronavirus pandemic and advance the stalled peace agreement signed with the Taliban.He said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, who each declared himself the victor in September’s election, should “put the interest of the country ahead of their own” during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last week.He urged the government and the Taliban to carry out a prisoner exchange that was part of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. The agreement had called for the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 government personnel held by the insurgents.To date, Ghani has released 550 detainees based on age, vulnerability to the virus and time served behind bars. The Taliban have not said if those released are among the prisoners referred to in the agreement. For their part, the Taliban have freed 60 prisoners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-bomber-kills-3-injures-15-in-afghanistan-s-capital-kabul-report/story-frJ4VNc3kv8GOjuEzWfLaN.html

Despite all of this, a blessing came to us,” he added. And so, CovidMarie it was.Weeks earlier, two mothers in southeastern India had had similar ideas, apparently encouraged by a doctor in the hospital where their babies were delivered.One was called Corona Kumar and the other Corona Kumari.“I told them this would help create awareness about the disease and remove the stigma around it,” said S.F. Basha, the doctor. “To my surprise, they agreed.”Not to be outdone, a migrant-worker couple in India’s northeast stranded thousands of kilometres from their home in the desert state of Rajasthan decided to name their child Lockdown.“We named him Lockdown remembering all the problems we had to face during this tough time,” local media reports quoted the father Sanjay Bauri as saying.Tupas, the father of baby Covid Marie, said that while he had fielded criticism on social media for his unorthodox choice, he would not be swayed.“She might experience bullying, but I’ll just teach my daughter to be a good person,” he said.“We didn’t have second thoughts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-corona-and-lockdown-the-newborns-named-amid-virus-pandemic/story-nd42ihdj33Fq2ZYtBtdd5N.html

The route taken by the US warship, which also earlier crossed the Taiwan Straits, prompted strong response and reaction from China.“The US’ provocative actions seriously violated international law and related norms, seriously violated Chinese sovereignty and security interests, and intentionally increased regional security risks,” a statement posted on the military unit’s WeChat social media account quoted Li Huamin, a command spokesperson, as saying.Referring to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Li added that the incident could have “…easily caused an accident, and is against the context in which the international community is making concentrated efforts to fight the pandemic and the common will of countries in the South China Sea to safeguard peace and stability in the region”.“We urge the US side to focus on the epidemic prevention and control on its homeland, contribute more to the international fight against the pandemic and immediately stop military actions against regional security, peace and stability,” Li said.According to the US-based non-profit US Naval Institute, the The FONOP (freedom of navigation operations) from the Japan-based USS Barry closely follows the destroyer transiting the Taiwan Strait twice this month.“A day after Barry’s April 22 transit, the Chinese (aircraft carrier) Liaoning Carrier Strike Group also transited the Taiwan Strait. In addition to the presence operations, the destroyer has been active in the South China Sea operating with guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill (CG-52) and amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6) off the coast of Malaysia near an ongoing dispute over mineral exploration between Malaysia and China,” the USNI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/focus-on-covid-19-at-home-beijing-to-us-after-expelling-us-warship-from-south-china-sea/story-NdLhhq4Rcqx6AFbI4I0BcM.html
29-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Disrupted access to contraceptives could result in 7mn unwanted pregnancies, says UN||Ongoing lockdowns and major disruptions to health services during the COVID-19 pandemic could leave 47 million women in low and middle-income countries unable to use modern contraceptives, leading to seven million unintended pregnancies in the coming months, according to data released by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners.The agencies estimate that the number of women unable to access family planning or facing unintended pregnancies, gender-based violence and other harmful practices, could “skyrocket” by millions due to the crisis.“This new data shows the catastrophic impact that COVID-19 could soon have on women and girls globally,” UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem said on Tuesday. “The pandemic is deepening inequalities, and millions more women and girls now risk losing the ability to plan their families and protect their bodies and their health,” Kanem said.As a clear view of the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is only beginning to take shape, experts estimate that the human cost could be extraordinary. The economic and physical disruptions caused by the disease could have vast consequences for the rights and health of women and girls, the new analysis by the UNFPA and partners noted.Globally, around 450 million women across 114 low and middle-income countries use contraceptives, the study said.“Significant levels of lockdown-related disruption over 6 months could leave 47 million women in low- and middle-income countries unable to use modern contraceptives, leading to a projected 7 million additional unintended pregnancies. Six months of lockdowns could result in an additional 31 million cases of gender-based violence,” it said.The pandemic is also expected to cause significant delays in programmes to end female genital mutilation and child marriage, resulting in an estimated two million more cases of FGM over the next decade than would otherwise have occurred. These delayed programmes, on top of growing economic hardships globally, could result in an estimated 13 million more child marriages over 10 years. There also will be 31 million additional cases of gender-based violence during the same period, with a further 15 million more cases expected for every three months the lockdowns continue.These figures – produced in collaboration with partners Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University (USA) and Victoria University (Australia) – are rough estimates. The analysis said while a great deal is still unknown about how the pandemic, and the response to it, will unfold around the world, the projections offer an alarming view of the future that could confront women and girls if efforts are not urgently made to secure their welfare and ensure their rights.COVID-19 is having an enormous impact on women and girls as health systems become overloaded and facilities close, or provide a limited set of services which they need. At the same time, many women and girls also are skipping important medical check-ups for fear of contracting the virus, the study said.Disruptions to global supply chains could lead to significant shortages of contraceptives, it said, while gender-based violence – already on the increase due to the pandemic, is expected to rise still further as women are trapped at home for prolonged periods.The UNFPA is working with governments and partners to prioritise the needs of women and girls of reproductive age during the pandemic.The agency is focused on strengthening health systems, procuring and delivering essential supplies to protect health workers, ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services, and promoting risk communication and community engagement.“Women’s reproductive health and rights must be safeguarded at all costs. The services must continue; the supplies must be delivered; and the vulnerable must be protected and supported,” Kanem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-disrupted-access-to-contraceptives-could-result-in-7mn-unwanted-pregnancies-says-un/story-JrZI1lVs5EU99chIn0mA7O.html
29-04-2020||World||Over 2 lakh H-1B workers could lose their right to be in US by June||Manasi Vasavada has less than three weeks left before she loses her legal right to be in the country. The dental practice in Passaic County, New Jersey, where Vasavada, 31, has worked for almost two years closed its doors in mid-March due to Covid-19. She has been on an unpaid leave of absence ever since. Vasavada is in the country on an H-1B visa, a temporary visa program designed for people with specialized skills. H-1B recipients can only remain in the country legally for 60 days without being paid. Her husband Nandan Buch, also a dentist, is in the country on an H-1B visa that expires in June. They have been watching the days tick by with growing fear.There may soon come a point when the couple can’t stay and can’t go: India, their home country, has closed its borders indefinitely. They also have a combined $520,000 in student loans from the advanced dental degrees they completed at U.S. universities, which would be nearly impossible to pay back on the salaries they would earn in India. The stress has caused Buch, also 31, to start losing his hair. Neither of them is sleeping well. “Everything is really confusing and dark right now,” said Vasavada. “We don’t know where we will end up.” Also Watch | Donald Trump signs executive order, suspends issuance of green cards for 60 daysAs many as 250,000 guest workers seeking a green card in the U.S.—about 200,000 of them on H-1B visas—could lose their legal status by the end of June, according to Jeremy Neufeld, an immigration policy analyst with the Washington D.C.-based think tank Niskanen Center. Thousands more who are not seeking resident status may also be forced to return home, he said. About three-quarters of H-1B visas go to people working in the technology industry, though the exact levels vary year by year. Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs in the last two months, but workers on visas are vulnerable in ways native-born workers aren’t. H-1B visas, for instance, are tied to a specific location and employer who commits to paying the recipient a minimum salary. Furloughing recipients, reducing their wages, and in some cases allowing them to work from home violates visa requirements. H-1B workers who are terminated have 60-days to find another job, transfer to a different visa or leave the country. Even if they don’t lose their jobs, workers can find themselves in a dilemma if they can’t get their visas renewed during this period of disruption.The visa crisis is causing “a catastrophe at a human level and an economic level,” said Doug Rand, who worked on technology and immigration policy in the Obama administration before co-founding Boundless Immigration Inc., a company that helps people navigate the immigration system. H-1B workers often have families who also rely on their jobs for authorization to stay in the country, including children who may have spent their entire lives in the U.S. “It’s just a mess,” Rand said. In a letter sent to the State and Homeland Security departments on April 17, TechNet, a lobbying group whose members include Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, joined a coalition of trade groups calling for relief for foreign-born workers. The letter requested a delay in work authorization expiration dates until at least Sept. 10. “Without action, these issues will lead to hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs and have profound negative economic effects,” the letter read.The tech industry is crucial to supporting offices working remotely, helping doctors provide telehealth services and keeping students learning at home, said Alex Burgos, senior vice president of federal policy and government relations at TechNet. ‘We’ve seen the administration extend tax filing deadlines,” he said, and similar flexibility in visa programs makes sense “because no one here is at fault in any way.”The Trump administration has not responded to the letter. A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson declined to say if the agency would extend visa deadlines but said it may provide special support for people affected by circumstances beyond their control when requested. The administration has taken a consistently hard-line stance on immigration and foreign-born workers. The number of non-immigrant visas issued in 2019 declined for the fourth consecutive year, to 8.7 million from 10.9 million in 2015, according to the State Department. Last month, the department closed embassies and consulate operations with little guidance to those who risk falling into illegal status. In-person services at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, have been suspended since March 18 and won’t resume until June 4 at the earliest, a 78-day gap in service. On April 20, President Donald Trump tweeted that he planned a temporary ban on all immigration to protect American jobs; the following day he announced an executive order blocking most people coming from outside the U.S. from receiving green cards for 60 days. This raised the threat of further disruptions for companies who employ many foreign-born workers. On the day the president announced his executive order, Luis von Ahn, co-founder and chief executive of the language-learning startup Duolingo Inc., posted a message on Twitter saying a green card ban would force the company to move jobs abroad. Von Ahn is an immigrant from Guatemala, and one-fifth of Duolingo’s 250-person staff are on H-1Bs or other visas. The company plans to boost staff by 50% to keep up with a spike in usage that corresponds with the pandemic. “We have definitely felt the practical impact of processing delays,” said Duolingo spokesman Sam Dalsimer. ‘There’s also a psychological impact on employees whose futures and abilities to remain here are even more uncertain than ever.’ In one case, Duolingo has been trying to hire an engineer who was recently let go from another tech company. The worker is in the U.S. on an O-1 visa, which is designated for individuals with extraordinary ability. Now with added pandemic delays, Duolingo estimates he’ll have to wait 6 to 9 months for his visa and work authorization. In the meantime, he can’t work for the company or leave the U.S.The companies facing the hardest decisions, though, are those reducing staff in response to the pandemic. Some are choosing to furlough U.S.-born workers and fire foreign employees whose visas require them to be paid. Others are choosing to keep H-1B workers on staff to maintain their legal status, while firing U.S. workers. There’s risk in either approach, because employers who treat workers differently based on their immigration status expose themselves to potential discrimination lawsuits, according to immigration and employment lawyer Rebecca Bernhard, partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP. For some workers, a stable future in the U.S. suddenly seems distant. Shawn Noronha, a 23-year-old Australian living in San Francisco, was let go from his job at a fintech startup, in January. He found a new position with an enterprise software startup willing to sponsor his visa. But before he could get to an Australian consulate to update his paperwork Covid-19 hit. Noronha changed his status from a working visa to a tourist visa, which gives him until the end of June to stay in the U.S. He is spending his free time baking, taking walks and learning Python, a programming language. But without a regular paycheck he’s eating into his savings. The recent tweets from President Trump about tightening restrictions on immigration have him questioning his choice to migrate to the U.S. ‘It’s made me think, have I made the right choice?” said Noronha. “Should I just go back home and maybe chase the American dream later on in life?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-200-000-h-1b-workers-could-lose-their-legal-right-to-be-in-us-by-june/story-HY2BiCMeBzAIAtaqpDIVtN.html

While there is nothing wrong it in, what makes Becca Brown’s move interesting is the fact that she has refused to donate any of these to healthcare workers in the UK, saying the government should have been more prepared.Brown’s story has been reported in every major Brtish publication. She lives in Portsmouth, about 100 kilometres from London, and has amassed £2,500 worth of medical equipment.Brown’s collection includes simple 500 surgical masks, military style face masks, shoe covers, face shields, surgical gloves and other medical items.She is using some of these vital equipment to paint on, saying it makes the “perfect canvas”, according to British media.In her defence, Brown says she has an elderly aunt to look after due to which she stockpiled these medical equipment to avoid unnecessary trips to shops, according to media reports.The UK, meanwhile, came together on Tuesday for a minute’s silence in the honour of hundreds of healthcare and other workers who have lost their lives on the frontline of the coronavirus fightback across the country.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who just recovered from a severe coronavirus attack, led the tributes with UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak at 10 Downing Street for the National Health Service (NHS) and other key workers across care homes and public transport.So far, 82 staff members of the UK’s National Health Scheme (NHS) are known to have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, including many with their roots in India.“Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The UK government has announced a new time-bound insurance scheme for the families of such public sector healthcare workers who lost their lives while on duty during the pandemic, worth 60,000 pounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-woman-has-stockpiled-covid-19-kits-worth-2-500-says-won-t-donate-to-healthcare-workers-report/story-JBgCXhasK9F1xXK0l2wKFN.html
29-04-2020||World||Canada plans to ease Covid-19 lockdown restrictions||Even as Canada has crossed 50,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection, the Government has released new guidelines for gradual easing of restrictions across the country.The Government also published new projections for the toll the pandemic is having. The new short-term modelling forecasts that by May 5, the country will record between 53,191 and 66,835 cases and between 3,277 and 3,883 deaths.Those numbers on Tuesday night were at 50,015 and 2,859, respectively. At the same time, public health authorities pointed out to a pattern of slowing of coronavirus-related caseload, with the doubling rate now at 16 days against three days earlier.However, officials warned that the country could be beset by a second wave of infections if people were careless about safety precautions like social distancing going ahead. During his daily media briefing, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “The measures we have taken so far are working. In fact, in many parts of the country, the curve has flattened. But we are not out of the woods yet.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Federal Government has worked out guidelines with provincial and territorial administrations about the path ahead. According to a statement from the PMO, they “agreed to a set of common principles for restarting the Canadian economy, based on shared understanding and appreciation of what science and experts are telling us.” It also acknowledged the importance of restarting the economy through “a gradual approach that protects the health of Canadians” while ensuring “public health capacity for future waves of the virus.”Different jurisdictions will take different routes and time frames for this process, “in order to ease restrictions, reflecting the specific circumstances” of each province or territory. “Our priority is keeping all Canadians safe, while getting back to normal as much as we can,” Trudeau noted. Among the main principles for the criteria and measures required before easing is undertaken is that “Covid-19 transmission is controlled, so new cases are contained at a level that our health care system can manage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-plans-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown-restrictions/story-zl9IMqn2OY0KklhGprOmhP.html

The list, it says, is not comprehensive, but contains 200 names which are available in the public domain.There are 735 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Senegal and nine deaths, according to World Health organisation (WHO).Africa has so far recorded 22,239 positive cases of Covid-19, according to WHO. From zero case on March 1, the continent saw over 1,000 daily Covid-19 positive cases in the last few days of April.Based on a provisional modelling, the WHO had said earlier this month that coronavirus cases in Africa could shoot up to 10 million within three to six months.The worst affected country in the continent is South Africa. However, infections there have slowed after it began a strict lockdown, but other nations - like Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Algeria - have seen higher than average fatalities.The WHO is working with authorities there to improve patient care and reduce fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senegal-working-on-1-testing-kit-for-covid-19-say-reports-as-number-of-cases-in-africa-cross-22-000/story-1QXofDXeNatYs7aySCGzTJ.html
29-04-2020||World||How human sewage could be a silver bullet in tracking Covid-19||Since the beginning of the epidemic, researchers across the world have been tracing the spread of the coronavirus through waste water and sewage. From the first outbreak in China, several scientific studies have picked up the clear presence of Covid-19 in patients’ stools.Testing human sewage could now become a key way of tracking the pandemic’s spread -- and a precious early warning system for a feared second wave.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageResearchers have found genetic traces of Sars-Cov-2 -- as the virus is officially known -- in waste water in toilets, sewers and sewage farms from Brisbane to Paris and Amsterdam.These discoveries pose “no risk” to public health, insisted Luca Lucentini, water quality director at the Italian Institute Superior of Health (ISS), after several tests came up positive in Rome and Milan.Experts say drinking water in countries with strict treatment procedures is also safe.While the presence of the virus in faeces does not mean that it can be transmitted through them, being exposed to effluent “could pose a health risk,” warned researchers Willemijn Lodder and Ana Maria de Roda Husman from the Dutch Centre for Infectious Diseases Control in a paper in The Lancet.The centre reported late last month that it detected genetic material from the virus in waste water in Amsterdam.Precisely followed deaths’But the pair also insist that waste water could a precious “data source, indicating if the virus is circulating in the human population”.It could even allow experts to “track the virus”, French virologist Professor Vincent Marechal of the Sorbonne university in Paris told AFP.In a study of waste water in Paris -- which has yet to be validated by other scientists -- Marechal and his team found that the rise in levels of genetic material from the virus in water “followed precisely the number of (coronavirus) deaths”.Marechal is now call for a national waste water warning system in France which might help “anticipate a second wave” of the virus. Given the large number of coronavirus cases that have little or no symptoms, waste water testing could signal the presence of the virus even before the first cases are clinically confirmed in areas untouched by the epidemic or where it has ebbed. Click here for Covid-19 updates“That would allow barrier measures to be put place and give us time, a key element with this epidemic,” Marechal added.Such a system has already worked against other viruses.In a study published in 2018, researchers showed how polio being detected in waste water in Israel in 2013 gave time for a vaccination campaign to be launched, which meant no child was paralysed by the disease.Call for global test network For the Sars-Cov-2, waste water studies in several countries are still at an early stage. But some scientists are enthusiastic about their potential.“It could be used as an early warning tool for pandemic surveillance,” Dr Warish Ahmed, of the Australian public research agency CSIRO, told AFP.Having found the virus in waste water in Queensland, he said it could also be a key indicator to show if lockdown and other measures were working. “Access to this type of data could underpin... a surveillance program to identify areas where there is evidence of Covid-19 outbreaks, without requiring testing of all individuals,” Dr Warish added.He said although it was a “cost effective way of tracking community-level infection”, he warned that it should be used “in combination with other measures, such as the testing of individuals.”Its relative cheapness would also make it useful for countries that “don’t have the technical or logistic means to test the carriers” of the virus, Marechal said.He has called on the World Health Organization to set up a worldwide waste water virus detection network, which would help combat other killer diseases beyond beyond Covid-19.“It could be essential in Africa,” he said. “To protect a population, you have to safeguard water quality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-human-sewage-could-be-a-silver-bullet-in-tracking-covid-19/story-XVyRVhKyOrNeEM4TgYN4bN.html

China, where the pandemic began, has registered 4,633 deaths from the virus among 82,858 cases.Authorities have relaxed social distancing restrictions, but have maintained strict quarantine rules on those coming from abroad or other parts of the country to ward off a second wave of virus cases as summer approaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-congress-to-convene-next-month-after-postponement-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak/story-ZbjHX1VJwiKXnW3yHFPLsJ.html

He has also indicated that the US may be looking at “a lot more money” in damages from China than the USD 140 billion being sought by Germany from Beijing for the pandemic.Leaders of the US, the UK and Germany believe that the deaths and the destruction of the global economy could have been avoided, had China shared the information about the virus in its early phases.“It’s in 184 countries, as you hear me say often. It’s hard to believe. It’s inconceivable,” Trump told reporters at White House Tuesday. “It should have been stopped at the source, which was China. It should have been stopped very much at the source, but it wasn’t. And now we have 184 countries going through hell.” The virus, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in mid-November, has killed more than two lakh people and infected over three million globally. The largest number of them are in the US: nearly 59,000 deaths and over one million infections.The massive outbreak in the US has put Trump under increasing pressure from American lawmakers to decrease US dependence on Beijing and they have also sought compensation from China.Senator Ted Cruz and his colleagues have urged Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to support the development of a fully domestic supply chain of rare earths and other minerals that are critical for manufacturing defence technologies and supporting national security.“It is clear that our dependence on China for vital rare earths threatens our US manufacturing and defence-industrial base. As the October 2018 Defence Industrial Base Report states: ‘China represents a significant and growing risk to the supply of materials deemed strategic and critical to US national security.’ [...] Ensuring a US supply of domestically sourced rare earths will reduce our vulnerability to supply disruptions that poses a grave risk to our military readiness,” the Senators wrote.The US is 100 percent import-dependent for rare earths as well as 13 other metals and minerals on the US Government Critical Minerals List and more than 75 percent import reliant for an additional 10 minerals.Congressman Brian Mast on Tuesday introduced a legislation to hold China accountable for its “coronavirus deception”. The resolution would empower the US to withhold payments on debts owed to China equal to the costs incurred by the US in response to COVID-19.“China’s total lack of transparency and mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has cost tens of thousands of lives, millions of jobs and left untold economic destruction. Congress must hold China accountable for their cover-up and force them to pay back the taxpayer dollars that have been spent as a result,” Mast said.Cruz, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced his intention to introduce a legislation to cut off Hollywood studios from assistance they receive from the Department of Defence if those studios censor their films for screening in China.This legislation is part of Sen. Cruz’s comprehensive push to combat China’s growing influence over what Americans see and hear, which includes legislation targeting information warfare from the Chinese Communist Party across higher education, sports, films, radio broadcasts, and more.Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera and Congressman Ted S. Yoho, both members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will lead a bipartisan virtual Special Order to highlight the importance of US global leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.“If we abdicate our place as a leader in global health, there is another country eager to take the reins. China has not been subtle in asserting itself on global health issues, and often not for the benefit of other nations. China’s recent coronavirus debacle should be evidence enough that their communist regime cannot be trusted to lead with accountability, transparency, or pragmatism, traits that are essential when fighting widespread disease,” Yoho said.“As for how China would fare as a global health leader, look no further than the disastrous initial response by the WHO to coronavirus, one that was clearly influenced by Beijing. Information was slow-walked, warnings from nations like Taiwan were ignored at crucial turning points, and cooperation with outside health experts was spurned until it was too late. And it has resulted in the largest public health disaster the world has seen in over a century,” he said.In an interview to Fox News, Senator Marco Rubio alleged that if China had acted when those warnings were being made, instead of silencing the people that were talking about it, they could have limited the spread.“So there was no doubt that that was a deliberate decision made on their part. The one way to hold them accountable is to do what we should be doing anyway. That is moving the means of production to become less and less dependent upon them. What you’re going to see after this pandemic is that more and more countries are going to prioritize their healthcare manufacturing capabilities and other industries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-again-slams-china-over-coronavirus-outbreak-says-184-countries-going-through-hell/story-x9Ess1llidCTisn7rjxWjP.html

The largest number of them are in the US: nearly 59,000 deaths and over one million infections.The massive outbreak in the US has put Trump under increasing pressure from American lawmakers to decrease US dependence on Beijing and they have also sought compensation from China.Senator Ted Cruz and his colleagues have urged Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to support the development of a fully domestic supply chain of rare earths and other minerals that are critical for manufacturing defence technologies and supporting national security.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“It is clear that our dependence on China for vital rare earths threatens our US manufacturing and defence-industrial base. As the October 2018 Defence Industrial Base Report states: ‘China represents a significant and growing risk to the supply of materials deemed strategic and critical to US national security.’ [...] Ensuring a US supply of domestically sourced rare earths will reduce our vulnerability to supply disruptions that poses a grave risk to our military readiness,” the Senators wrote.The US is 100 percent import-dependent for rare earths as well as 13 other metals and minerals on the US Government Critical Minerals List and more than 75 percent import reliant for an additional 10 minerals.Congressman Brian Mast on Tuesday introduced a legislation to hold China accountable for its “coronavirus deception”. The resolution would empower the US to withhold payments on debts owed to China equal to the costs incurred by the US in response to Covid-19.“China’s total lack of transparency and mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak has cost tens of thousands of lives, millions of jobs and left untold economic destruction. Congress must hold China accountable for their cover-up and force them to pay back the taxpayer dollars that have been spent as a result,” Mast said.Cruz, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced his intention to introduce a legislation to cut off Hollywood studios from assistance they receive from the Department of Defence if those studios censor their films for screening in China.This legislation is part of Sen. Cruz’s comprehensive push to combat China’s growing influence over what Americans see and hear, which includes legislation targeting information warfare from the Chinese Communist Party across higher education, sports, films, radio broadcasts, and more.Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera and Congressman Ted S. Yoho, both members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will lead a bipartisan virtual Special Order to highlight the importance of US global leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic.“If we abdicate our place as a leader in global health, there is another country eager to take the reins. China has not been subtle in asserting itself on global health issues, and often not for the benefit of other nations. China’s recent coronavirus debacle should be evidence enough that their communist regime cannot be trusted to lead with accountability, transparency, or pragmatism, traits that are essential when fighting widespread disease,” Yoho said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “As for how China would fare as a global health leader, look no further than the disastrous initial response by the WHO to coronavirus, one that was clearly influenced by Beijing. Information was slow-walked, warnings from nations like Taiwan were ignored at crucial turning points, and cooperation with outside health experts was spurned until it was too late. And it has resulted in the largest public health disaster the world has seen in over a century,” he said.In an interview to Fox News, Senator Marco Rubio alleged that if China had acted when those warnings were being made, instead of silencing the people that were talking about it, they could have limited the spread.“So there was no doubt that that was a deliberate decision made on their part. The one way to hold them accountable is to do what we should be doing anyway. That is moving the means of production to become less and less dependent upon them. What you’re going to see after this pandemic is that more and more countries are going to prioritize their healthcare manufacturing capabilities and other industries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/184-nations-going-through-hell-as-covid-19-wasn-t-stopped-at-source-says-donald-trump/story-D49QalY9ja1yFeUxF3QTYJ.html

At the same time, the State Department official said that list of those to be repatriated from India is now not very clear as a number of them say no at the last minute.“We’re getting to the point in India where the yet-to-be-repatriated list is not as clear as it was two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, we had a list of folks and we were pretty sure if we called folks they’d show up at the airport and say, “Yes, please.”,” he said.“We’re now getting to the point on that list we’re having to make multiple calls for individual seats because people are deciding no, they’d just as soon ride it out where they are. So I’m not really willing to say what the number of people yet to be repatriated from there is just for that reason,” Brownlee said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The United States, he said, is still tracking a handful of cruise ships around the world with US citizen crew members. “Some of those ships are still looking for docking permissions, and others have docked.

We were rebuffed,” Pompeo said in a statement on Tuesday.“The Chinese government wouldn’t let it happen, indeed just the opposite of transparency. They kicked American journalists out and denied access to American and other Western scientists at the time that it was frankly most critical that we understand what was going on there,” he said.US officials were part of the WHO expert team delegation that travelled to China. “Upon arrival, the delegation travelled in groups to several locations, but Americans were not among those who travelled to Wuhan,” a State Department spokesperson said.The US, the spokesperson said, continues to engage with the WHO to insist that the organisation undertake substantive reform and encourage it to play its mandated global coordination role.“As Secretary Pompeo has repeatedly said, the United States supports multilateral organizations. We simply insist that they fulfil their missions, including demanding full transparency and information sharing and a willingness to speak the truth and hold member states accountable when they fail to comply,” the spokesperson said in response to a question.The United States provided USD400 million to the WHO in FY-2019, including funding from the Department of State, USAID, and other US government agencies, including Department of Health and Human Services.“FY 2020 is still underway. Previously obligated funding is not impacted by the current 60-90 day halt and review on new funding,” said the spokesperson.“The review process is under development, and will include all relevant US government departments and agencies,” said the spokesperson in response to a question.Meanwhile Senators Chris Murphy and Ed Markey, both members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday called on Pompeo for answers as to why key public health positions based in China were eliminated and why warnings of safety and management concerns at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were not taken seriously.“Understanding what happened at the WIV is critical to keeping Americans safe. We urgently need to fully understand the origins of this pandemic because the next pandemic will not wait,” they wrote.“Indeed, if COVID-19 did accidentally escape from this lab, we need to understand what happened and how this could have been prevented, and work with the World Health Organisation to ensure the security and safe management of sensitive bioresearch laboratories,” the senators said.“Even if the COVID-19 pandemic originated naturally through animal-to-human transmission, as many scientists believe, the State Department cables suggest the risk of a new virus emerging from a laboratory due to lax safety procedures or other accidental release remains high,” they wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rebuffed-us-efforts-to-contain-coronavirus-pompeo/story-9H2eZBhCoJRXP5HdLoGqPM.html

29-04-2020||World||Trump to order meat processing plants to remain open amid Covid-19 pandemic||President Donald Trump said he will take executive action Tuesday to order meat processing plants to stay open amid concerns over growing coronavirus cases and the impact on the nation’s food supply.The order will use the Defense Production Act to classify meat processing as critical infrastructure and mandate plants stay open to prevent a shortage of chicken, pork and other meat on supermarket shelves. Unions fired back, saying the White House was jeopardizing lives and prioritizing cold cuts over workers’ health.More than 20 meat packing plants have closed temporarily under pressure from local authorities and their own workers because of the virus, including two of the nation’s largest, one in Iowa and one in South Dakota. Others have slowed production as workers have fallen ill or stayed home to avoid getting sick.The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million food and retail workers, said Tuesday that 20 food-processing and meatpacking union workers in the U.S. have died of the virus. An estimated 6,500 are sick or have been exposed while working near someone who tested positive, the union says.As a result, industry leaders have warned that consumers could see meat shortages in a matter of days. Tyson Foods Inc., one of the world’s largest food companies, ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and other newspapers Sunday warning, “The food supply chain is breaking.”“As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,” it read.Tyson suspended operations at its pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa after a slew of infections, and Smithfield Foods halted production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after an outbreak infected 853 workers there.The 15 largest pork-packing plants account for 60% of all pork processed in the U.S., and the country has already seen a 25% reduction in pork slaughter capacity, according to UFCW.A senior White House official said the administration was trying to prevent a situation in which a “vast majority” of the nation’s meat processing plants might have temporarily closed operations, reducing the availability of meat in supermarkets by as much as 80%.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before its release, said the White House was also working with the Labor Department to provide enhanced safety guidance for meatpacking workers. That will include trying to minimize the risk to workers who may be prone to serious complications from the virus, including strongly recommending those over the age of 65 and with preexisting conditions stay home.The five-page order, which was developed in consultation with industry leaders including Tyson and Smithfield, is designed, in part, to provide companies with additional liability protections in case workers get sick.Trump on Tuesday described the issue as a “legal roadblock.” The order, he said, would “solve any liability problems where they had certain liability problems and we’ll be in very good shape.”But UFCW International President Marc Perrone said that more must be done to protect the safety of workers.“Simply put, we cannot have a secure food supply without the safety of these workers,” he said in a statement, urging the administration “to immediately enact clear and enforceable safety standards” and compel companies to provide protective equipment, make daily testing available to workers, and enforce physical distancing, among other measures.Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said the administration should have acted earlier to put safety measures in place.“We only wish that this administration cared as much about the lives of working people as it does about meat, pork and poultry products,” he said.And Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, which represents 3,000 workers at the JBS meat processing plant in Greeley, Colorado, said the order “will only ensure that more workers get sick, jeopardizing lives, family’s income, communities, and of course, the country’s food supply chain.”The administration is working with companies to help them secure protective equipment, like face shields and masks, and ramp up testing, the official said.Protecting workers at meat processing plants can be especially challenging. They typically employ thousands of people who often work side-by-side carving meat, making social distancing all but impossible. Some companies have been working to reduce infections by checking workers’ temperatures, staggering breaks and altering start times. Owners said they have also done more to clean plants, slowed production lines so workers can spread out, and added plastic shields between workstations.When outbreaks have happened, local public health agencies have pushed in some cases for temporary closures so they can limit wider outbreaks in communities and conduct mass testing to determine who is carrying the virus. Some plants have also briefly closed for deep cleaning and to install new safety measures.Yet concerns about working conditions persist and have led some to walk off the job. In central Minnesota, some workers at the Pilgrim’s Pride poultry plant walked out Monday night to protest the company’s record on worker safety.Mohamed Goni, an organizer with Greater Minnesota Worker Center, said workers have complained the company is not sharing information about sick colleagues, has not implemented social distancing on the line, and that workers who were sick returned after just two or three days, and some workers who developed symptoms were not allowed to leave when they asked to go home.“The company refused, saying there would be a shortage of workers,” Goni said, adding that 80% to 85% of the plant’s workers are Somali.“They have other family members living with them — elderly, children, people with underlying conditions. So if one of them brings that to their homes, it’s going to be more worse and a more serious problem,” Goni said.Cameron Bruett, head of corporate affairs for JBS USA and Pilgrim’s, said in an email that employees are never forced to work or punished for an absence due to health reasons.“We will endeavor to keep our facilities open to help feed the nation, but we will not operate a facility if we do not believe it is safe. The health and safety of our team members remains our number one priority,” Bruett said.In South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem has said she hopes to see a reopening plan for Smithfield this week, but sidestepped questions Tuesday about whether she agreed with Trump’s order, which might have prevented the Sioux Falls plant from shutting down if it had been in place earlier.“We need to keep (plants) running, but we also need to protect people,” Noem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-order-meat-processing-plants-to-remain-open-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-X0MDSd1gwIf5MiGbqiKOZI.html
29-04-2020||World||US first country with over 1 million Covid-19 cases, death toll over 58,000||The number of people infected by the coronavirus in the United States crossed one million and the fatalities jumped to nearly 59,000, but several states initiated the process to reopen their economies amidst signs of decline in both new cases and deaths.“We continue to pray for the victims as well as for those Americans who are grieving their lost ones and their loved ones. There’s never been anything like this. We suffer with one heart but we will prevail. We are coming back, and we’re coming back strong,” US President Donald Trump said at the White House during his remarks on the Paycheck Protection Program.The US on Tuesday became the first country in the world to have more than one million cases of coronavirus. It accounts for nearly one-third of the 3.1 million cases globally.With nearly 59,000 deaths, the US also accounts for one-fourth of the over 213,000 global fatalities.“Now that our experts believe the worst days of the pandemic are behind us, Americans are looking forward to the safe and rapid reopening of our country,” Trump said.“Throughout this ordeal, millions of hard-working Americans have been asked to really make tremendous, tremendous sacrifices. It is sacrifices like nobody thought would even be possible; nobody thought we would ever be talking about something like this,” he said.In California, Governor Gavin Newsom outlined the phased reopening of his state.“We are not going back to the way things were until we get to immunity or a vaccine. We will base reopening plans on facts and data, not on ideology. Not what we want. Not what we hope,” he told reporters.More than 1,800 people have died due to coronavirus in California so far. Schools and colleges, he said, could start in July-August.California and Washington were among the first two states to impose stay-at-home order. Now more than 95 per cent of the country’s 330 million population are under stay-at-home order.Texas Governor Greg Abbott has also announced first phase reopening of the state.Tennessee on Monday allowed reopening of restaurants and later this week retail outlets could resume their businesses.Pennsylvania has announced three-phase reopening of the state beginning May 3.States like South Carolina, Oregon, Oklahoma, Ohio, have announced phased reopening of their economies. The state of Utah Tuesday announced relax restrictions and offered a mask to its residents.In New York, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, non-essential businesses are ordered to stay closed till May 15. New York along with other states including New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island and Massachusetts have announced to coordinate reopening.Responding to questions, Trump said the US has done more testing that any other country in the world. “We’re doing more testing than any other country in the world by far… So, we’re going to show more cases because we’re doing much, much more testing, double than anybody else,” he said.Trump said he relied on experts, who apparently went wrong on this.“We were listening to experts and we always will listen to experts. But, the experts got it wrong. A lot of people got it wrong. And, a lot of people had no idea it would be this serious,” he said.“I listened to experts. I’ll tell you what. I did something that the experts thought I shouldn’t have done. I closed down our country and our borders. I did a ban on China from coming in, other than US citizens, and we did very strong checks on even our US citizens,” he asserted.The United States, he said, is opening up again.“I think it’s going to be very, very successful. I think that third quarter, it’s obviously a transition quarter, but I think it’s going to be okay, maybe better than okay. Then I think fourth-quarter will the great and I think next year is going to be a tremendous year for this country,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-country-with-over-1-million-covid-19-cases-death-toll-nears-59-000/story-JV22YIfQy1xwnr9HYU94TO.html

Why would I do that?” Trump told reporters at the White House.The president cannot unilaterally change the date of the ballot but Biden raised concerns last week that Trump may try to do so.“Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” Biden said during an online fundraiser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hillary-clinton-endorses-joe-biden-s-white-house-bid/story-52ciVzwhmBGHCJDLdJNWDI.html

The report, based on data from the WHO and Imperial College London, said the IRC estimates cases in the range of 500mn to 1bn, leading to deaths in the range of 1.7mn to 3.2mn, in 34 conflict-hit nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-billion-could-be-infected-by-coronavirus-aid-group-report/story-vfVVIGQU4jwmCbmCcTx31I.html
29-04-2020||World||Pak gets 4 more months to deliver on terror financing watchdog FATF plan||Pakistan on Tuesday got a four-month reprieve for meeting a deadline set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to counter terror financing as the multilateral watchdog announced a temporary suspension of its activities because of the Covid-19 crisis.However, the Paris-based organisation said in a statement that there would be no let-up in its efforts to fight money laundering and terror financing, and that it would actively monitor the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on measures to counter illicit financing.The move had been widely anticipated as officials of FATF and affiliated regional groups have been unable to make visits to countries such as Pakistan to monitor the implementation of action plans and other programmes because of travel restrictions imposed around the world to prevent the spread of the pandemic.Pakistan has been on FATF’s “grey list” of “monitored jurisdictions” since June 2018 for failing to counter terror financing, especially by groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Taliban, al-Qaeda and Haqqani Network. A FATF plenary meeting in February had warned Pakistan that it had failed to meet all deadlines for a 27-point action plan, and given the country four more months to implement it.The FATF’s statement said the watchdog had “decided on a general pause in the review process for the list of high-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action and jurisdictions subject to increased monitoring, by granting jurisdictions an additional four months for deadlines”.“Thus, the FATF is not reviewing them in June,” the statement said, adding the organisation’s plenary had agreed to “temporarily postpone all remaining FATF mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines”.Though FATF posted an updated assessment calendar, Pakistan wasn’t among the countries for which details have been finalised so far. The FATF said the calendar would be updated as the situation evolves.The statement further said: “Despite the decision to temporarily postpone the above-mentioned process deadlines due to the current force majeure situation, the FATF will not let up its efforts to fight money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing, and will continue working with all jurisdictions in its global network to ensure an effective implementation of its standards.“The FATF is actively monitoring the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on measures to combat illicit financing. We remain vigilant to the threats posed by criminals and terrorists who may seek to exploit this period to further their criminal objectives.”The gravity of the Covid-19 crisis globally and consequent measures adopted by countries, such as confinement and travel restrictions, are making it impossible for countries and FATF teams to conduct on-site visits and in-person meetings, the statement said.“This situation has significantly impacted countries’ ability to actively participate in mutual evaluation and related follow-up processes. The FATF Plenary acknowledges these severe challenges that countries face at this difficult time,” it said.Pakistan’s performance was to be assessed at review meetings to be held in Beijing during June 21-26. The review is now expected to be done in October.During its assessment at its plenary meeting in February, the FATF concluded that all deadlines for Pakistan’s action plan “have expired” and the country had “largely addressed” only 14 of the 27 points in the action plan.FATF had warned Pakistan that if its action plan is not fully implemented, it would face the possibility of being moved to the list of monitored countries, commonly known as the “black list”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-pakistan-gets-4-more-months-to-implement-terror-funding-watchdog-fatf-s-action-plan/story-bC4OsMf7oduz821RSmG1rO.html

The higher education regulator also said examinations in colleges and universities can be held in May and June with July being the month of summer vacations. The next academic cycle can begin in August for second- and third-year students and in September for freshers, it said. Generally, academic sessions end in colleges and universities in May-June and new sessions begin in July-August. Education institutes have been shut down across India since March 25, when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to stop the spread of Covid-19.In guidelines issued on Wednesday after long deliberations, UGC said if the previous semester’s result is not available, particularly in the first year, 100% evaluation of students may be done on the basis of internal assessments.The internal evaluation process can be continuous, mid-semester or it can be any method that gauges a student’s progression, UGC said, adding that the guidelines are “advisory” in nature and an individual institute will have to chart its own course based on its circumstances. Universities may also adopt efficient and innovative modes of examinations by reducing the time from three hours to two hours, it said. But students should be informed well in advance (at least one week before) about the conduct of examinations and other related activities.The regulator, however, said students who want to improve their grades should be allowed another opportunity whenever circumstances allow. It said there should be a grievance redressal mechanism set up by universities. UGC will establish a help line for monitoring grievances.Universities, colleges and schools across the country have been closed and exams postponed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, and it was later extended till May 3.Where it is difficult to hold exams, universities can give 50% weightage to internal evaluation and the remaining 50% to the performance in the previous semester, the UGC guidelines said. The period of lockdown will be treated as “deemed to be attended” by all students.The universities may conduct practical examinations and viva voice examinations through Skype or other apps. In some cases, practical examinations may be conducted during ensuing semesters, the guidelines suggested. UGC also suggested giving a six-month extension to M.Phil and PhD students.Universities will follow a six-day-week schedule. Students will be given exposure to laboratory assignments or practical experiments through virtual laboratories.UGC has also recommended that universities should prepare e-content/e-lab experiments and upload the same on their websites. They have also been asked to strengthen the mechanism of mentor-mentee counselling. They should also develop virtual classroom and video conferencing facility, and all teaching staff should be trained with the use of the technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ugc-issues-new-guidelines-to-keep-academic-year-on-track/story-FI4xRaYmw6DIalagQaA8kL.html

IPS officer Avinash Kumar, who is among the officers facilitating the return of students from Kota, said so far, 1,000 students from Odisha have registered with the local authorities at Kota. Of the 975 students coming back on Thursday, most are from Jharsuguda and Sundargarh districts.The state government has advised these students to strictly adhere to the lockdown and quarantine guidelines after arriving in their respective home districts. Over 2,500 Odia students have been stranded in Kota after the national lockdown was announced last month to contain the spread of the Covid-19 disease.A few days ago, a large number of students from Odisha stranded at Kota had appealed to chief minister Naveen Patnaik to ensure their safe return to the state. Congress legislature party leader Narasingha Mishra had also urged the chief minister to take immediate measures to bring back the students from Kota. Even BJP leader Bijoy Mahapatra had urged the government to bring back the stranded students in Kota, Bangalore and several other states.“How long will they wait without food and with mental strain? Students need immediate attention of the government,” Mohapatra had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/975-odia-students-stranded-in-rajasthan-s-kota-to-head-home-soon/story-92pzCp3AMk2Wu4imzKuWQI.html
29-04-2020||India||In Gujarat, high Covid-19 cases in four cities takes steep toll on state revenue||Amid the nationwide lockdown, the economy of Gujarat has been badly affected as about 91% of the Covid-19 cases in the state have come from the four metro cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodra and Rajkot which are major contributors in the state revenue.Till Wednesday, 4,082 coronavirus cases were reported from the state out of which 3,423 cases have been reported from these four cities which is 90.72% of the total. Ahmedabad has reported 2,777 cases, Surat-601, Vadodra-270 and Rajkot-58.The official estimate of the loss is yet to come, however, as per experts only these four cities contribute around 40% in the state’s revenue and around 40% of commodities across the country are exported from these four cities.A top official of the state government on condition of anonymity said that these four cities are a major contributor in the revenue of the Gujarat government. “One thing is for sure that the state’s gross state domestic product (GSDP) is witnessing a sharp decline as around 20,000 industries which falls under these remained shut for the initial 21-days of the lockdown. From April, some factories have been permitted but they are not working at full strength,” the official said.He added that the average monthly GSDP is around Rs 1.15 lakh crore to 1.25 lakh crore. “The expected decline must be around Rs 80,000 crores due to lockdown,” said a senior official.Shailesh Patwari, former president of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) said that each of these cities make a major contribution not only in the economy of the state but country as the tax collected from them goes into accounts of both the state as well as the Centre.Patwari said that Ahmedabad is the pharmaceutical capital of India. There are around 1,000 chemical and pharma industries and 200 engineering companies.“The turnover of the pharmaceutical and chemical industries is a minimum of Rs 1,200 crore per month. Similarly, the turnover of these engineering units is also around Rs 15,000 crore per month. So with these numbers, one can predict how much Ahmedabad has suffered due to the lockdown,” the former GCCI president said.Talking about Surat, Patwari said that around 90% of the diamonds are exported in the country from the city.“There are around 400 diamond units in Surat which have a monthly turnover of Rs 4,500 crore and similarly there around 1,500 small and large textile units which contribute around Rs 1,500 crore per month. After lockdown, work across these industries has been stalled,” added Patwari.Similarly, the ball bearing companies in Vadodra have a turnover of Rs 100 crore per day and the automobile and irrigational pump producing units Rs 1200 crore per day.“The positive indicator from these two cities are that most of the industries are located outside the limits of municipal area which have begun operating a few days back with certain permissible limits,” said the former GGCI president.Purvin Mariyankari, director, Ahmedabad Export-Import Development Association (AEIDA) said that on April 20 the government gave permission to industries located outside municipal limits to resume work, as per the guidelines, and as a result, many industrial units have started operations.Meanwhile, secretary to the chief minister on Wednesday said that the chief minister has instructed the district collectors to ensure that people do not face the problem of potable water during summer. He instructed the District Collectors to personally look into the matter and asked them to ensure a sufficient supply of water beforehand.“Further, all the broken hand pumps should be immediately repaired. The CM also gave clear instructions to ensure health and hygiene in the area in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” Kumar said.Director-General of Police Shivanand Jha said that for the convenience of the farmers in rural areas, technicians involved in fitting or repairing of borewells for farming will be able to travel without passes as long as they carry their driving licences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-gujarat-high-covid-19-cases-in-four-cities-takes-steep-toll-on-state-revenue/story-LvsqzPepm1LlAd8ykdlKGI.html

29-04-2020||India||Health ministry launches app for testing labs to avoid duplication of sampling data||With discrepancies in reporting of sample testing data found from certain labs, the Union health ministry on Wednesday launched a dedicated real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mobile based application, for labs to fill the data at the point of sample collection.“It is an app for collection centres to fill data at the point of sample collection, to minimize error in reporting real time data to the government authorities. It was seen that the data was being duplicated as it was sent separately to various authorities involved such as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), state government etc. Now just one time entry will help reach the information everywhere, which will also save time and reduce other errors such as addresses, names etc,” a health ministry spokesperson said.This application is linked to the main data base operated by the health ministry that will automatically keep updating it.Director General of ICMR, Dr Balram Bhargava, who is responsible for overseeing Covid-19 testing, said, “The app has been made functional and needs to be put to use immediately.”So far, a total of 7,695 people have been cured, which takes India’s current total recovery rate to 24.5%. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 31,787.In the past three days, the doubling rate is 11.3 days in the country. “…although global mortality rate is around 7%, India is having a mortality rate of around 3%, and around 86% of fatality of people with co-morbidity. Only 0.33% patients are on ventilators, 1.5% patients are on oxygen support and 2.34% patients are in ICU, which reflects the quality of care being provided across the country. In case of any further eventuality, the country is well equipped with isolation beds, ventilators, PPE, masks etc.,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.A present, 288 government laboratories are working along with 97 private lab chains, with around 16,000 sample collection centres, and testing around 60,000 samples per day. The government is working to increase the testing capacity to 1 lakh tests per day within the next few days.Health secretary, Preeti Sudan, held a review meeting with states through video conferencing on Wednesday, and discussed the functioning of the systems dashboard, Covid-19 portal, apart from releasing the RT-PCR application.The health secretary again directed states that medical treatment to non-Covid-19 patients should not be denied, and essential care such as dialysis, cancer treatment, diabetic care, anti-natal care for pregnant women and those suffering from cardiac ailments and other chronic conditions must continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-launches-app-for-testing-labs-to-avoid-duplication-of-sampling-data/story-HjPqRFdOk7f98xJziQ5qXO.html

The Union Home Ministry also said it has reviewed the Covid-19 situation in the country and found that tremendous gains were achieved during the lockdown and new guidelines will be issued soon, giving considerable relaxations to many districts from May 4. In an order, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said on Wednesday that buses shall be used for transport of such groups of stranded people and these vehicles will be sanitised and will have to follow safe social distancing norms in seating. The order, however, did not specify whether a person or a family can travel in a private vehicle, and if allowed, under what conditions.New guidelines to fight #COVID19 will come into effect from 4th May, which shall give considerable relaxations to many districts. Details regarding this shall be communicated in the days to come.#Corona Update#StayHomeStaySafe @PMOIndia @HMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA“Due to lockdown, migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons are stranded at different places. They would be allowed to move,” he said in an order issued to all states and union territories. The order comes into immediate effect. Listing the conditions, the ministry said all states and union territories should designate nodal authorities and develop standard protocols for receiving and sending such stranded persons. The nodal authorities shall also register the stranded persons within their states and union territories, it said. In case a group of stranded persons wish to move between one state and union territory and another state and union territory, the sending and receiving states may consult each other and mutually agree to the movement by road. The moving persons would be screened and those found asymptomatic would be allowed to proceed, according to the Home Ministry. The states and union territories falling on the bus transit route will allow the passage of such persons to the receiving states and union territories, it said. On arrival at their destination, they would be assessed by the local health authorities, and kept in home quarantine, unless the assessment requires keeping them in institutional quarantine, the order said.They would be kept under watch with periodic health check-ups, it said. All those people who avail the opportunity will be encouraged to use ‘Aarogya Setu’ app through which their health status can be monitored and tracked. The home secretary issued the order in his capacity as the chairperson of the National Executive Committee under the Disaster Management Act. The Home Ministry also said the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on home quarantine should be followed by the authorities concerned. Separately, the Ministry announced that the new guidelines to fight Covid-19 will be issued effective May 4, which shall give considerable relaxations to many districts and the details regarding this shall be communicated in the days to come. “MHA held a comprehensive review meeting on the #lockdown situation today. There’ve been tremendous gains & improvement in the situation due to lockdown till now. To ensure that these gains are not squandered away, the lockdown guidelines should be strictly observed till 3rd May,” the Home Ministry spokesperson tweeted. The decision of the central government to allow movement of migrant workers, tourists, students and other stranded people will be a big relief to several lakh people who are stranded in different parts of the country. Several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Punjab, Assam, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, have brought back thousands of their students and tourists stuck in different parts of the country by bus. However, most of the migrant workers, tourists and other people continue to stuck in their places of work or shelter homes. While Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Assam, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh brought back their stranded students fron Kota in Rajasthan, Punjab has brought back stranded pilgrims from Maharashtra, besides students from Kota. A group of around 360 stranded people of Rajasthan is also being brought back from Assam. While transporting these students, pilgrims and other people, the states have used buses and other vehicles. There have been at least three protests by migrant workers in Surat in Gujarat in recent weeks as they have been demanding passage to their home states. A few hundred people had also gathered about a fortnight ago in Bandra in Mumbai after being influenced by rumours that trains would ply to North India. However, the Bihar government has been seeking the strict implementation of the lockdown, saying that people should remain wherever they are during the entire period of the lockdown. While announcing the lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said people should remain wherever they are. In the beginning of the first phase of the lockdown, thousands of the migrant workers had started moving by foot from cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad to their respective places, creating a humanitarian crisis. This led to the Home Ministry directing the state governments not to allow the migrants to move, arrange shelter homes for them and provide them food. The government has already allowed industrial activities in rural areas with conditions. Similarly, apart from the shops for the essential commodities, standalone business establishments of non-essential goods were also allowed to open during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-ministry-says-relaxations-will-be-given-to-many-districts-from-may-4/story-dwmpBit8WhSuZJI7nkVGIL.html

In another development, the government has stopped giving information on the total number of samples collected in the state for the past three days prompting public health experts to demand comprehensive data from the government daily.Out of the total 173 positive cases reported in the past 24 hours 104 cases were reported from Indore alone. Indore’s tally rose to 1,476. A total of 65 people have died of Covid-19 in Indore.In the state capital Bhopal which is the second worst hit district in the state, 35 cases were reported in the past 24 hours to take its tally to 483. Fourteen people have died of Covid-19 in Bhopal. At least 12 of the deceased had survived the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy.Rachna Dhingra of Sambhavna Trust said, “At least 13 of the 14 deaths reported in Bhopal were of Bhopal Gas Tragedy victims. The state government and the central government should immediately swing into action to protect the lives of tragedy survivors.”The third worst hit district by Covid-19 is Ujjain with 127 cases and 23 casualties. Out of 31 districts affected by the disease, there are 12 such districts which have the number of Covid-19 patients in double digits.Public health experts Amulya Nidhi and SR Azad in a joint statement said, “It is alarming to see that the death rate in Madhya Pradesh is the highest in the country. India’s Covid-19 mortality rate is 3.21%, whereas the fatality rate in Madhya Pradesh is more than 5%. The death rate has been stagnant at around 5% for the last 2 weeks. The death rate in Delhi is 1.62%, Maharashtra 4.29%, Gujarat 4.79%, and in Rajasthan 2.11%. In the last 3 days, there have been deaths in 3 new districts namely Khandwa, Raisen and Ashoknagar.”Demanding a comprehensive bulletin every day the statement ssid, “The state government bulletin has stopped providing the total number of test samples and pending test results since April 27. Till April 26, there were 8,439 pending test results. A lot of patients have been waiting for numbers of days for their test results. But now, as there is no data being given on pending test results and availability of test kits, there is no transparency around the testing situation of MP.”The additional chief secretary of health Mohd Suleman could not be reached for his comments.However, a department official who did not want to be named said, “The health minister Narottam Mishra himself has gone on record saying that there would be a jump in the number once or twice and then the situation will improve. As far as the data of total number of samples is concerned it’s not to hide from the public but the department is getting information from the districts in a piecemeal manner, hence it’s difficult to give a clear picture as to how many samples have been collected across the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-in-madhya-pradesh-crosses-2500-casualties-mount-to-173/story-vRvT3v6Ifctx4YManGlYML.html

He further said with intensive virus containment efforts being mounted across the country and results visible on the ground, one may hope for a normal schedule,” said the functionary quoted above.Since the imposition of the lockdown on March 25, Naidu called 241 members of the Upper House, including those retired and re-elected recently. He also spoke to former presidents Pranab Mukherjee and Pratibha Patil, and former prime ministers Manmohan Singh and HD Deve Gowda. “He also spoke to several governors, besides some chief ministers enquiring about the Covid-19 situation in respective states. This is his ‘Mission Connect’ during the confinement,” said the person quoted above.With the coronavirus pandemic spreading in India and large parts of the country under lockdown, Parliament’s Budget session had to be cut short by almost a fortnight.Many opposition parties that time urged the government to adjourn the session as cases of Covid-19 began to increase and after it was reported that Lok Sabha MP Dushyant Singh had to come to Parliament after attending a party where singer Kanika Kapoor, who tested positive for the infection, was present.

It has prepared a six-month long economic rehabilitation plan involving Rs 1.52 lakh crore. The task force headed by the state finance secretary has prepared the plan and it is now being examined by the state government,” Banerjee said, without divulging further details.Banerjee had earlier urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spend at least six percent of the GDP to fight the crisis and announce a National Economic and Health Package worth Rs 10 lakh crore for the state governments. The state has also been demanding its due of Rs 50,000 crore. The chief minister said that around 2500 people from Bengal who are stranded at Kota in Rajasthan were being brought back in 101 buses. It will take three days for them to reach Bengal.The government is also planning to allow stand-alone shops to reopen from Monday. Economic activities such as construction work, certain factories and public transport are also expected to start in districts that come under a ‘green zone’ the chief minister said. The local police will do a survey and decide on which shops could be reopened. Eight districts of the 23 districts in Bengal are in the green zone while four are in the red zone. “The Centre had asked states to allow shops to reopen while at the same time asking them to strictly maintain the lockdown. There is a lack of clarity. We had approached the Centre and are waiting for clarity,” she added.Coming down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party, without naming the saffron party, for repeatedly attacking the Trinamool Congress-led government on various issues, Banerjee said that they were like vultures, which wait for people to die so that they can make an issue out of it and play politics.“I am also a human being. I am not getting any sleep. I am having severe headache since yesterday. Whom shall I tell all these things to? We are doing overtime and double duty. I condemn those who are resorting to such things,” she addedBanerjee also challenged the BJP leaders to come down to the streets and sweep the roads and clean hospitals.“Keep the roads and hospitals clean. Work like Florence Nightingale. Stay beside Covid-19 patients and help the health department and police,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-preparing-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-economic-rehabilitation-plan-mamata-banerjee/story-7ZtMkUlHmcTThWhQTdizkI.html
29-04-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi hosts video show on Covid-19, Raghuram Rajan is his first guest||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi is gearing up to launch a series of video-dialogues with public intellectuals, and the first to feature in this series is renowned economist and India’s former Central bank governor Raghuram Rajan.The dialogue with Rajan, which is over an hour long, includes a detailed discussion on the state of the economy and how to revive it in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The discussion has been done in English via video-conferencing, Congress functionaries told Hindustan times. Congress’ social media head Rohan Gupta told Hindustan Times that Gandhi will be speaking to Rajan and the video will be launched tomorrow. “He (Gandhi) will be speaking to Raghuram Rajan. The discussion is about the fallout of coronavirus crisis and how it will impact the economy. They also discuss how to convert it into an opportunity,” Gupta added. “This is the first in a series of videos dialogues that Gandhi will be conducting with intellectuals, including public health specialists and activists working on the grass root level across the world,” a Congress functionary said. The dialogue is pre-recorded and will be disseminated by the Congress on social media over the next couple of days. “This is different,” said a second Congress functionary. “He (Gandhi) is not talking about the BJP at all. The entire conversation revolves around the state of the economy.” The two discuss solutions that may be viable in the ‘post-Covid world’, the second functionary added with the primary issue being the economy of the country.“States are facing huge losses,” said the first functionary. “The issue of loss of revenue, GST payments not coming in, all play a part in the discussion.” A slew of changes in the party has recently been interpreted by many Congress leaders as a sign of Gandhi’s return to presidency. Most recently, Congress interim chief Sonia Gandhi constituted an 11-member consultative group under former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s leadership to deliberate on matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic and to formulate the party’s views on them.The group also includes Rahul Gandhi, Randeep Singh Surjewala, KC Venugopal, P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari, Jairam Ramesh, Praveen Chakravarty, Gaurav Vallabh, Supriya Shrinate and Rohan Gupta. This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has become a member of a party panel since he stepped down as the Congress chief last year.

These include 9,515 pregnant women, 10,007 senior citizens, 16,276 students, 56,114 who lost their jobs, 57, 436 relatives and 1. 25 lakh others,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday.He said the state has made all arrangements for them and is waiting for the Union government to send aircraft to evacuate them. There are also reports that three Navy warships are ready in Kochi for the mass evacuation.But the number of people waiting for evacuation is a new worry for Kerala which is fighting hard to tide over the Covid-19 pandemic.Kerala had initially expected two lakh people from Persian Gulf countries but the latest numbers show that the figure could double in the coming days. Since most of those waiting to return are blue collar workers the state has requested the Centre to foot their airfare but is yet to get a reply. Stranded Indians have been mounting pressure on the government to be allowed back into the country.There are at least 18 lakh Malayalees working in Persian Gulf countries and in 2018-19 their remittances were Rs 88,000 crore, the highest foreign remittance in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-braces-for-huge-influx-of-expatriates-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-hKdqRCoSz7RRimeBv1MJpK.html

29-04-2020||India||Bihar rejoices as Centre clears decks for migrants’ return||The Union home ministry’s order on Wednesday allowing migrant workers, tourists, students and other people stranded amid the lockdown in different parts of the country to return to their respective destinations with certain conditions has cleared the decks for return of migrants from Bihar in other states.Bihar’s Additional Solicitor General SD Sanjay said the Union home ministry’s order would now be submitted in the Patna High Court which is scheduled to hear on May 5 a bunch of four public interest litigations (PILs) seeking direction to the Bihar government for the evacuation of stranded students.The Centre’s order gives hope to students as well as migrants to return home from states where they have been stranded since the lockdown began.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the decision of the Centre with regard to stranded migrant population, including students, was a welcome step and in keeping with state’s request. “The Centre has taken a positive decision on our request. This will help a great deal in bringing back the interested migrant population stranded in different states. Following the Centre’s guidelines is in the interest of everyone. Bihar government has always followed the directions issued under the Disaster Management Act,” he said.Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah for accepting the state’s request to have a standard protocol for stranded migrants.“The matter was also raised by chief minister Nitish Kumar during PM’s video conferencing with CMs. The CM wanted go-ahead from the Centre. Now, the order will help Bihar bring back students and other stranded anywhere,” he added.LJP MP Chirag Paswan was quick to thank home minister Amit Shah for relaxing norms to ensure return of migrants, while RJD claimed that its relentless demand for return of migrants had borne fruits. Leader of Opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav said that now the migrants should be brought back at the earliest.Nitish Kumar had so far refused to evacuate students from Kota. He had said that the state was strictly adhering to the central guidelines on the lockdown, and it will not be possible to evacuate anybody until the Centre amended or issued fresh directive in this regard.The MHA order says that in case of inter-state movement, “the sending and receiving states may consult each other and mutually agree to the movement by road”.“The moving persons would be screened and those found asymptomatic would be allowed to proceed. Sanitized buses with social distancing among passengers shall be used for transport of group of persons,” says the order from home secretary Ajay Bhalla.The states/UTs on the transit route will allow the passage of such persons to the receiving state and on arrival such passengers would again be assessed by the local health authorities and kept in home quarantine, unless the assessment requires them to keep them in institutional quarantine.“They will be kept under watch required to undergo periodic health checkup. They may be encouraged to install Araogya Setu App for regular tracking,” says the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-rejoices-as-centre-clears-decks-for-migrants-return/story-hwutfs6nKEgDKYsi9i5XLN.html
29-04-2020||India||After HC setback, Kerala brings ordinance to deduct employees’ salary||A day after the high court stayed its decision to cut employees’ salaries, the Kerala government on Wednesday decided to bring an ordinance in order to make the deductions at a time it is fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Announcing this, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said extraordinary situations need extraordinary actions. “You can’t call it a salary cut. We have made it clear that the amount collected in five instalments will be repaid once the economic condition of the state improved,” he said. The move came a day after the high court stayed Kerala’s decision to deduct the salary of government employees for six days every month for the next five months (totalling 30 days) as part of efforts to raise funds for fighting Covid-19.The government decided to take ordinance route after it got legal advice that an appeal against the HC decision will delay the whole process and some of the critical sectors such as health will suffer. Now, governor Arif Mohamad Khan will have to give his assent to the ordinance. “All are undergoing a difficult situation. So it is natural that employees will also be a part of the process. We have deducted 30% salaries of ministers, MLAs, board chairmen and others for one year,” said the CM.State opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala decried the latest move and said the government was taking revenge on employees after it suffered a serious setback in the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-hc-setback-kerala-brings-ordinance-to-deduct-employees-salary/story-N8IRPyvnLBaxDQpuRfIPuJ.html
29-04-2020||India||Rising Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan no cause for worry, says Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan’s Covid-19 cases which have breached the 2000-mark is not a cause of concern since the state government is working round-the-clock to ensure not a single positive case remains undetected, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Wednesday.The total number of coronavirus cases in Rajasthan stands at 2,364 with 51 deaths, according to Union Health Ministry data. “There is no need to worry if the total number of Covid-19 cases rise. The state wants that nobody with the disease should go unnoticed,” Gehlot told news agency PTI.The chief minister also informed about the various measures taken by the state government to control the spread of the disease, mitigate the problems of those severely affected by the nationwide lockdown and the huge impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Rajasthan’s economy as well as on tourism.The state’s revenue is dwindling in the wake of the nationwide lockdown and the Centre is yet to act on Rajasthan’s demand to release outstanding GST arrears, Gehlot said.The veteran Congress leader also asked for special trains to take migrant workers stranded at different places in the country to their homes.“I urged the Centre to put in place necessary mechanisms to take the migrant workers home. The Centre should run special trains to transport them to their native places.” On the state being lauded for effectively controlling the disease in Bhilwara, Gehlot said the containment model was successful in the textile town as it is not densely populated and the administration had acted swiftly. He said the containment strategy in other regions of the state, where a large number of Covid-19 cases have been reported, is taking time due to the dense population.Bhilwara became a coronavirus hotspot after three doctors and nine nursing staff of a private hospital tested positive.“We introduced strict containment strategies in hotspot areas. The ‘Bhilwara model’ was adopted in Jaipur, Kota and other hotspot areas of the state. It becomes more difficult to control the spread of a disease in densely populated areas,” he said.Gehlot cited the example of Jaipur’s Parkota area (Ramganj locality) where the population is higher than Bhilwara. “In this region, many families reside in one house. So we divided the region into 30 clusters and conducted testing… a reason why there are more number of cases there,” the CM explained.The three-time chief minister and senior Congress leader also urged the Centre to provide quality rapid testing kits and other essential equipment. Many states, he said, are battling the problem of not having enough safety paraphernalia.“We had got rapid testing kits from the ICMR, but stopped using them after they turned out to be faulty. The state has increased the number of PCR tests,” he said.The chief minister also said that Rajasthan had received praise for its containment strategy in the recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers via video conferencing held on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rising-covid-19-cases-in-rajasthan-no-cause-for-worry-says-ashok-gehlot/story-Bk1qKQflOFfATuRl4ehyJM.html
29-04-2020||India||India under lockdown: Mother holds baby in arms for first time 15 days after birth||At the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border, Sofia Marin Banu glanced down at her precious bundle of joy in her arms for the first time on Wednesday, 15 days after the baby girl was born in a hospital in Nagercoil.Amid the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown,officials of Kerala and Tamil Nadu witnessed the emotional reunion of mother and child at Kaliyikkavila.The healthy newborn was handed over to Marin by medical staff of the private Erankulam Lisie Hospital where the child underwent a complicated surgery for a serious heart problem soon after her birth through cesarean section at a Nagercoil hospital.Her heart problem was diagnosed during pregnancy and the parents wanted the delivery at the private hospital at Ernakulam which is known for handling such cases.According to hospital sources,doctors had said the baby was due on April 30,but the woman developed labour pains much earlier and delivered the child at the Nagercoil hospital in Tamil Nadu.The baby born with complex heart disease (d- transposition of great arteries) was reunited with the mother after the surgery, hospital sources said here. Effective coordination by the Kerala and Tamil Nadu government officials removed all the blocks created due to the Covid-19 lockdown and the child was taken to Ernakulam in an ambulance immediately after her birth on April 14 for treatment, sources said.“It was a very complicated surgery. We kept the child in complete isolation during the course of treatment,” Ebin Abraham, a Lissie hospital staff, told PTI.The surgery was conducted by a team of doctors led by cardiothoracic surgeon Sunil G S and pediatric cardiologist Edwin Francis.The infant’s father had accompanied the baby in the ambulance for the treatment but he was quarantined in a separate room in the hospital and was not allowed to see the child directly.He, however, saw his child through video call.This is Marin’s third child.“Certainly it was an emotional moment for Marin, who was in Nagercoil.But we could not see the emotions on her face as she was wearing a mask to protect herself from novel coronavirus infection when she received the baby from us,” said Abraham who witnessed the reunion at the border.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office, Ernakulam District Collector S Suhas and Tamil Nadu government intervened to facilitate the smooth journey of the ambulance carrying the child soon after her birth at the Nagercoil hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-under-lockdown-mother-holds-baby-in-arms-for-first-time-15-days-after-birth/story-nEKKd4HY1DqVE4Gc46OVWP.html
29-04-2020||India||In a fortnight, India sees drop in Covid-19 hotspot districts||The number of Covid-19 hotspot districts in India as on Wednesday morning has come down to 129 from 170 a fortnight ago, but in the same period the number of infection-free districts or green zones too decreased from 325 to 307, according to official sources.During this time, the number of non-hotspot districts, also known as orange zones, increased from 207 to 297, they said.The Centre had on April 15 classified districts into three categories.Those with high load of Covid-19 cases or which have a high growth rate of the disease are marked as hotspots or red zones, while those with considerably fewer cases of the respiratory infection fall in orange zone or non-hotspots. Districts with no Covid-19 cases are categorised as green zones.However, a red zone or orange zone district can be demarcated as green zone if no new coronavirus case is reported from those places for 28 and 14 days respectively.On April 15, the Centre had declared 170 districts across 25 states and Union Territories as coronavirus hotspots. Of these, 123 were hotspot districts with large outbreaks and 47 with clusters. It had also said 325 districts had not reported any coronavirus case because of actions initiated at field level.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said that 80 districts in the country have not reported any new case of Covid-19 in last seven days while 47 districts have not registered any fresh case in the last 14 days.Also, 39 districts have not reported any instance of the infection in the last 21 days and 17 districts have not registered any new case for the last 28 days, he had said.The government has already identified 15 districts in nine states, including Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat, as having “high case load”. Of these, seven -- Hyderabad (Telangana), Pune (Maharashtra), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Mumbai (Maharashtra) and Delhi show particularly high case volumes.Other high case load places that are “critical” in the battle against Covid-19 include -- Vadodara (Gujarat), Kurnool (Andhra Pradesh), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Jodhpur (Rajasthan), Agra (Uttar Pradesh), Thane (Maharashtra), Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and Surat (Gujarat).“These 15 districts are critical in our battle against Covid-19. Of them 7 show particularly high case volumes. India’s success in battling Covid-19 is dependent on them. We must aggressively monitor, contain, test, treat in these districts! We must win here,” Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant tweeted on Monday.A senior health ministry official said the doubling time of coronavirus cases in India was three to 3.25 days before the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 and now it is 10.2 to 10.9 days. The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 1,007 and the number of cases climbed to 31,332 in the country on Wednesday, according to the Union Health Ministry.The highest number of confirmed cases in the country are from Maharashtra at 9,318, followed by Gujarat at 3,744, Delhi 3,314, Madhya Pradesh 2,387, Rajasthan 2,364, Tamil Nadu 2,058 and Uttar Pradesh 2,053. The number of Covid-19 cases has gone up to 1,259 in Andhra Pradesh and 1,004 in Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-fortnight-india-sees-drop-in-covid-19-hotspot-districts/story-nj0gH9VO4NOG8MXPspf2WN.html
29-04-2020||India||Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik asks people to help in caring for migrants post lockdown||With Covid-19 cases in Odisha rising to 125 as three more people with travel history to neighbouring Bengal tested positive, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday sought help from the people in taking care of the 6 lakh plus migrant workers returning to the state.On Wednesday, a 60-year-old man from Keonjhar, a 34-year-old man from Deogarh and an 18-year-old woman in Jharsuguda district had tested positive.Odisha’s Covid-19 tally doubled from 61 to 125 in just 10 days. The state government has sealed the West Bengal border stopping road communication on 57 routes as 50 of the 125 positive cases had a Bengal connection.With 6 lakh plus migrants registering themselves on the state Covid-19 portal for returning to Odisha after the lockdown ends on May 3, the chief minister in a video message this afternoon said there is no need to panic as Odisha can evade the danger by remaining careful.“Earlier, people with foreign travel history were the major challenge for us. Odisha was the first state to have started registration for foreign returnees as part of precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19. With cooperation of people, we controlled the situation. Later, people who had returned from Nizamuddin posed as a challenge for the state and we successfully tackled the situation. Now, West Bengal returnees have emerged as the third challenge as among them 50 people have tested positive so far,” he said.Patnaik said the coming days are significant for the state as fellow Odia citizens from most infected states of the country like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan and West Bengal are due to return to Odisha. “They are our own. One remembers his or her mother and motherland during the time of crisis. They are our children, brothers and sisters. Taking care of them is our responsibility,” Patnaik said.Odisha has so far kept 1.72 lakh quarantine beds ready in 7125 temporary medical centres organized in about 7000 gram panchayats and 125 urban local bodies. However, officials concede that the number of quarantine beds are going to fall far short of the requirement and may lead to law and order problems if all the 6 lakh migrants converge in Odisha soon after the lockdown ends.Keeping this in mind, Patnaik said people need to be alert, keep patience, and opt for registration of people returning from outside and support the state government in keeping them in quarantine. “Through this they, our families, our villages and our society will stay healthy. A slight negligence can lead to a great danger. It is a matter of life and death as the problem may increase a 100 times due to carelessness of 10 per cent people,” he said, adding that the situation in Odisha due to the Covid-19 outbreak is better than other states.Patnaik’s message came hours before a group of 400 migrant workers from Surat in 8 buses were due to arrive in Ganjam district this evening. The workers engaged in cloth embroidery factories boarded the buses on April 27 and 28 using their own resources even before the Odisha government arranged buses for their transportation. The state government is planning to bring back Odia migrant workers stranded in Maharashtra and Gujarat in buses and keep them in quarantine in temporary medical centres for 14 days at least.Meanwhile, the district collector of Ganjam on Wednesday appealed to the people of the district not to roam around temporary medical camps where returnees from other states are being quarantined warning them of stringent action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cm-naveen-patnaik-asks-people-to-help-in-caring-for-migrants-post-lockdown/story-dmbG5SJUvUVw4PmHPlMUeI.html
29-04-2020||India||BHEL resumes operations in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar a month into lockdown||The Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), one of the prominent public sector undertakings (PSU) in Uttarakhand resumed its operations on Wednesday after about a month amid the lockdown, officials said.The development came a day after chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat held a meeting with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to discuss the revival of Industrial activities in the state. The two units of BHEL including Heavy Electrical Equipment Plant (HEEP) and Central Foundry Forge Plant (CFFP) had received permission from the Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar on Monday to resume operations.Operations resumed with less than half the total workforce in adherence to the government guidelines amid Covid--19 pandemic. Employees who have been called for duty will work on two shifts so that social distancing norms are strictly followed.BHEL manufactures gas turbines, turbo generators, condensers and related auxiliary while its CCFP plant primarily makes large size castings, forging of steel alloys and super critical grade steel.According to BHEL officials both the factory units, workplace, administrative blocks and equipment were thoroughly sanitized before the operations resumed. Sanjay Gulati, executive director of BHEL’s Heavy Electricals Equipment Plant (HEEP), Ranipur said that as per the guidelines of Central government and the district administration, BHEL has opened its twin plants. Gulati said, “Through indigenously developed portable electrostatic disinfection machine, the whole BHEL township including hospitals, factories, guest houses, administrative blocks, parks and roads are also being disinfected on a regular basis.”Earlier on Tuesday, CM Rawat held a meeting with CII and other state industrialists to discuss the measures for economic activities and industrial operations in the state which have been largely affected by the lockdown caused by the pandemic. Rawat said, “The state is gradually resuming the industrial activities for revival of the economy. Under the initiative, we have started a single-window system to give permission to industries and factories to resume operations. Since April 20, we have given permission to about 1,171 industries to resume operations mainly in Haridwar and Rudrapur which host major industrial areas of the state which together comprise about 1000 factories.”The CM had also said that at least 1,884 factories related to pharmaceutical and food processing sectors were already operational in the state. Bigger units like ITC, HUL, Nestle and others have already resumed their production. “Those from the automobile industry like Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors are soon going to start their production,” Rawat had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhel-resumes-operations-in-uttarakhand-s-haridwar-a-month-into-lockdown/story-dio5ZkvfKIAVLPoPSwvdEI.html
29-04-2020||India||Indian Red Cross creating database of potential plasma donors for Covid trials||The Indian Red Cross Society is starting a dedicated database of people who have recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) , and who can therefore be potential plasma donors for convalescent plasma therapy (use of blood from the recovered patients to treat severely sick patents) which can be done under the clinical trial mode.The therapy isn’t approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research as a regular line of treatment and the health ministry said on Tuesday that it can only be done as a trial, with requisite clearances from regulators.Still, the Indian Red Cross’ blood bank has already started receiving queries from relatives of Covid-19 patients looking for plasma from a recovered patient. The society plans to online counselling of shortlisted recovered patients to encourage them to donate their plasma for the study.“In a day or two, the Red Cross of India will begin psychosocial counselling of shortlisted recovered Covid-19 patients to prepare them as plasma donors. Our job is to look through the pile of recovered patients, and screen those who could be potential plasma donors. Once shortlisted these people will be counselled by our experts,” says Dr Vanshree Singh, director (blood bank), Indian Red Cross Society.The society plans to speak to hospitals to get details of patients who recovered in past one month. After they get the list, it will be narrowed down further to those who will be eligible to donate, and the final list will be recommended to the government.“Ideally we will be looking at the recovery time of 28 days, but anything over 14 is good. Our regular blood donation criteria will apply along with the fact that they should have completely recovered from Covid-19. Eligible donors have to be between 18 and 50 years (of age), with no co-morbid conditions such as heart, kidney disease, diabetes, etc. Even women can donate but not those with more than one children as their antibodies don’t work. Unmarried women who fulfil other criteria can also donate,” said Dr Singh.The Red Cross will forward the list of shortlisted possible donors to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi because the actual donation will only happen in a hospital setting.“These people need to be bled in the intensive care unit (ICU) settings because in a stand-alone blood bank one can’t provide the kind of medical support that these people might require. So, the blood donation has to be done in a hospital,” Dr Singh said.The Red Cross will be sharing the database only with approved government facilities.As convalescent plasma therapy has shown promise in helping very sick Covid-19 patients recover, various countries including India are conducting trials to know its true potential as a treatment .Hospitals and research facilities can enrol patients as part of a clinical trial after receiving necessary approvals from the drugs controller general of India.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan last Tuesday held a video meeting with the Indian Red Cross Society and asked it to contact recovered patients and encourage them to donate blood . However, health ministry has made it clear that the treatment is to be conducted only as part of a trial with the requisite permissions.A section of experts say if the therapy has shown promise then clinical trials can be skipped to save time.“I have been arguing for plasma therapy without a clinical trial, as it is safe to give as compared to other medicines. However, it is critical to properly document the results,” says Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department, CMC Vellore.Dr Dharma Choudhary, a senior specialist in bone marrow transplant in India isn’t so sure: “It is a crude way of giving immunoglobulin, which are virus specific antibodies, with a belief that it will probably give some protection. I’d say it will be better than giving a placebo to a dying patient with no hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-red-cross-creating-database-of-potential-plasma-donors-for-covid-trials/story-NIVWE9NKAUb2n07B2QVSqK.html

But since they are not fully recovered, it won’t be possible to bring them back by road,” he said.This Sunday, 391 students who were studying in various institutes in Kota were brought back in 17 buses covering a distance of nearly 2,000 km. While the students paid for the journey, the state government provided 8 police officials to accompany them and facilitate their journey.“We are in talks with the civil aviation ministry and private airlines to try and evacuate these patients and their relatives. At this moment it seems we will not be able to do it before May 3, but our efforts are on,” Sarma said.Most of these 859 patients are stranded in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Vellore. The state government has already provided them Rs 25,000 each as financial aid.Sarma informed that plans are also underway to bring back people from the state now stranded in Uttar Pradesh and other northeastern states.“We will have to undertake this exercise in a very careful manner so that the present scenario in Assam doesn’t aggravate,” he said.Assam has recorded 37 positive Covid-19 cases till Wednesday. While 1 patient has died, 29 have been discharged and 7 are still under treatment.Besides financial aid to patients stranded outside, the state government has paid Rs 2,000 each to 2.15 lakh workers from the state who are stranded in other states and 1000 USD each to 52 persons from the state stranded abroad.Since April 25, the state government has allowed inter-district movement of people stranded across Assam due to the lockdown. This window will be available till May 2.Till Wednesday, nearly 49,000 persons have used their own vehicles to avail this benefit while more than 20,000 others have been transported free of cost by 1274 buses belonging to Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-plans-to-fly-back-859-patients-stranded-outside-the-state/story-L6qtZjci7AuT1FOg9lIJ1M.html

You’ve just shown what every Mizo heartbeat means when it comes to the term ‘Tlawmngaihna’,” Chief Minister Zoramthanga tweeted.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts! You've just shown what every Mizo heartbeat means when it comes to the term "Tlawmngaihna"!@CMOTamilNadu@NDTVTamilCinema#selflessheroes #tlawmngaihna pic.twitter.com/TVwnAQWoTjLalremsanga had recently completed a course in hotel management and was waiting to collect the certificate, and hoping to start a career in an induustry which held great promise before the coronavirus sank it into an unfathomable abyss.But fate willed otherwise and his body was found outside his rented apartment.Despite the authorities in Chennai suggesting that Lalremsanga be buried at a cemetery there, Malchhanhima could not bring bring himself to accept the idea of leaving his 28- year-old friend miles and miles away from home.It was then that ‘Tlawmngaina’, the Mizo code of ethics, which espouses the moral of self-sacrifice for the common good, showed him the way. He had made up his mind. His friend’s lifeless body will not remain in the bowel of earth in faraway land.The Mizoram government and the Chennai Mizo Welfare Association stepped in.“The body was at the mortuary of a hospital and we were thinking of ways to transport it to Mizoram amid the lockdown. Two ambulance drivers saw our plight and came forward to help us, saying they had earlier been to Assam as lorry drivers,” Chennai Mizo Welfare Association secretary Michael Lalrinkima told PTI.The drivers, however, insisted that somebody from Mizoram accompany them. Malchhanhima volunteered.And then began Lalremsanga’s journey homeward, embalmed and enshrouded, in an ambulance with his caring friend and the two good samaritans--Chinnathanbi and Jeyanthiran--through deserted highways and bleak landscapes on April 25.“The thought of my friend being buried far away from his home troubled me. My father, a preacher, also encouraged me to accompany the mortal remains of my friend withstanding the difficulties of the journey,” Malchhanhima, a native of the remote Hmawngbu village in south Mizoram’s Lawngtlai district, told PTI.He said they were stopped by police at several places and would travel long hours at a stretch without food as most highway eateries were shut. When they would find one, they were asked to wait outside and collect the packaged food which they ate inside the ambulance.Before reaching Mizoram on Tuesday, after a four-day back-breaking and emotionally draining journey, they were screened at Vairengte check-gate on the state’s border with Assam.Once in, the pervasive sombreness of the occasion lifted momentarily, when people greeted and thanked them for bringing back Lalremsanga home, among his own people, before he joined the invisibles.Malchhanhima has been put under quarantine for 14 days at a designated facility, while his friend Lalremsanga rests in everlasting peace at a cemetery near his home in Aizawl’s Model Veng.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-cm-praises-man-who-travelled-3-000-km-with-friend-s-body/story-jvYxESJREQf6EN52kRo1iN.html

29-04-2020||India||Stranded migrant workers, students can go home. MHA sets the ground rules||A month after millions of people, mostly migrant workers were stranded without work in different parts of the country, the Union home ministry on Wednesday finally allowed states to repatriate them to their respective states.The central government has, however, so far refused to run special trains to take them home as demanded by some states such as Maharashtra.They would have to travel in buses.The only condition that the home ministry has imposed for such inter-state travel is that the government of states, from where these people begin the journey and the government in the destination state, should clear the trip.Besides, only people who do not have symptoms of Covid-19 would be allowed to travel. They would also be subject to health check ups by health authorities of states which they cross.Several states such as Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh had already started bringing back people from other places though the central guidelines till this evening did not permit such travel. This had put chief ministers of states such as Bihar under immense pressure.Nitish Kumar, who has been battered by the opposition in his state for sticking to the rulebook, had insisted that he would not take any step that violated the central guidelines and had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to order the home ministry to set the ground rules for this trip. Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik had made the same request at last week’s interaction of chief ministers with PM Modi.It will be a mammoth task working out the logistics of arranging thousands of buses to what state governments have estimated would imply transporting five million workers.On arrival at their destination, “such persons would be assessed by the local health authorities, and kept in home quarantine, unless the assessment requires keeping the persons in institutional quarantine. They would be kept under watch with periodic health check-ups. For this purpose, such persons may be encouraged to use the Aarogya Setu app through which their health status can be monitored,” the home ministry’s guidelines said.Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla’s order on Wednesday is in contrast to the Centre’s stand before the Supreme Court just a few days earlier when it told a three-judge bench led by Justice NV Ramana that “there is no necessity” to shift the migrant workers from their place of occupation to their home in villages.“Their daily needs are being taken care of wherever they are working and the daily needs of their family members are being taken care of at their respective villages,” the status report filed by the Centre had said.That is not how many migrant workers perceived their status. Besides, there As HT reported earlier in the day, disquiet and anger was simmering in the shelter homes where the workers have been located since the end of March.Sometimes, it spilled over to the streets. As it happened in Gujarat’s Surat this week when migrant workers clashed with police personnel.Tuesday’s violence was the third incident reported from Surat involving out-of-work migrant workers since the lockdown was imposed last month to check the Covid-19 spread.There have been numerous instances of migrant workers walking hundreds of kilometres to reach home. Some succeeded.Pinky, 29, was caught in Rajasthan. She and her family - they worked at a cloth mill in Bhilwara - were on their way back to Uttar Pradesh last month when they were stopped by the police. They have been living at Jaipur’s Gandhi Nagar shelter home since March 29. She told HT that she just wanted to see her four-year-old daughter back home in UP’s Etawah.One reason the Centre had been reluctant to let migrant workers head back home in a hurry is that the absence of workforce in states such as Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana would come in the way of industrial units getting started again..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-centre-allows-stranded-migrant-workers-students-and-tourists-to-go-home-sets-ground-rules-for-travel/story-vIikaLtRikGQdcmvCHR1wL.html

In order to tackle it, we have prepared a list of austerity measures,” health and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.The government had decided earlier that there will be a 30% cut in salaries of Governor, Chief Minister, ministers and MLAs from April. From now there will be a 25% cut in the salaries of chairman, vice-chairman of PSUs and government boards and corporations.However, the government has decided not to cut salaries of its employees for the month of April. But instead of paying it on the first of every month, this time it will be paid on the eighth day of the new month.“No new scheme or project will be implemented without prior approval of the finance department and establishment expenditure for the first four months of the financial year, from April to July, will be reduced from 20% of the budget allocation to 10%,” Sarma said.There will be no industrial reimbursement to factories for the first four months of the financial year, no new vehicles to be purchased by government departments without approval of CM and no conferences, workshops, seminars, functions or fairs held till July.“Except Governor, CM, Chief Justice and other judges of the High Court and the chief secretary, no one will be allowed to travel in executive class. Government employees won’t be allowed 5-star hotel accommodation when they travel outside the state,” Sarma said.Foreign travel and training for government employees will not be allowed except for those funded by the Centre or foreign agencies. Similarly, there will be no allocation of MLALAD funds for the first four months of the financial year.Giving details of how the crisis has affected Assam’s economy, Sarma informed that while GST collections for April 2019 was Rs 932 crore, this month the figure was just Rs 193 crore — a drop of 80% in collection.Likewise, revenue collection from sale of liquor dropped from Rs 65 crore in March this year to just Rs 6 crore in April. Tax collection from sale of petroleum products dipped from an average of Rs 340 crore per month to just Rs 60-70 crore this month.The state government needs Rs 3,600 cr every month to pay salaries, pension and interest on loans.“As it is a developing scenario, we will take additional measures in coming days and weeks depending on how the situation unfolds. I believe we will be able to come out of this crisis (without much damage), but we need generous help from the Centre,” Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-functions-or-5-star-hotel-stay-assam-cuts-costs-to-fight-covid-19/story-zHDUl7dIfno2wvoo6FyzHL.html

29-04-2020||India||Former Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar appointed PESB chief||Former finance secretary Rajiv Kumar was on Wednesday appointed as the chairperson of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB), the government’s headhunter for top level posts in public sector undertakings. Kumar, a 1984 batch IAS officer of Jharkhand cadre, retired as finance secretary in February this year. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved his appointment as the PESB chairperson for a period of three years, according to a Personnel Ministry order. The PESB does top level recruitments in central public sector enterprises. Kumar will succeed Kapil Dev Tripathi, who has been recently appointed as the Secretary to President Ram Nath Kovind. Kumar has been credited with bringing in key reforms in banking and bureaucracy during his stints in the finance ministry and the Ministry of Personnel. He steered the banking and financial sector through the severest crisis. Kumar took over as the Secretary, Department of Financial Services in September 2017 when most of the public sector banks including the State Bank of India were in losses. He was designated as the finance secretary in July 2019 by the government. Known for taking bold decisions, Kumar brought in fundamental changes in the banking sector and played a crucial role in merging 10 public sector banks into four, officials said. He was also instrumental in brokering peace between the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that resulted in the smooth transfer of Rs 1.76 lakh crore of the central bank’s surplus to the exchequer last year, they said. During his two-and-a-half year stint as Financial Services Secretary, several policy decisions were taken to promote responsive and responsible banking, the officials said. A massive Rs 3 lakh crore recapitalization of banks was undertaken during his tenure. Before joining the finance ministry, Kumar was the Establishment Officer (EO) in the Personnel Ministry.He played a key role in bringing in a 360 degree appraisal system for promotion and empanelment of senior bureaucrats during his stint in the Personnel Ministry. Kumar was also instrumental in streamlining the promotion and appointment process done by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), they said. Incidentally, a compendium of guidelines pertaining to board-level appointments in the Central Public Sector Enterprises was issued by Kumar when he worked as the EO in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-finance-secretary-rajiv-kumar-appointed-pesb-chief/story-N2TglT1pT8RK7sgGG8c1TO.html
29-04-2020||India||Minority medical colleges have to admit students on NEET scores, rules SC||The National Eligibility Entrance Test, or NEET, the single entrance exam for all medical colleges, will apply to minority institutions providing medical courses, the Supreme Court ordered on Wednesday.The top court ruled that there would be no exception to the law that lays down uniform entrance exams for all graduate and post graduate medical courses.“The rights available under Article 30 (of the Constitution which secures the right of religious and linguistic minorities to run educational institutions) are not violated by provisions carved out in Section 10D of the MCI Act (Medical Council of India Act) and the Dentists Act and Regulations framed by MCI/DCI,” the three-judge bench comprising justices Arun Mishra, Vineet Saran and MR Shah.As a single entrance examination to medical and dental colleges, NEET was first introduced in 2013. But this exam was scrapped by the Supreme Court within a few months. A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court revisited this verdict and restored it in 2016.Over 15.9 lakh students have registered for this year’s entrance exam to study medicine across the country.Christian Medical College, Vellore, which used to hold its own entrance exam, had challenged the NEET route for admissions, arguing that it violated the institution’s minority rights enshrined under Article 30.The institute had insisted that its selection process was designed to select candidates who would be willing to serve in the country’s rural areas, not just cities. For this reason, it said, they had heavily subsidised the medical course.The three-judge bench, however, reasoned that NEET was introduced for better administration in view of several instances of maladministration by several private colleges.“The regulatory measures are intended for the proper functioning of institutions and to ensure that the standard of education is maintained and does not fall low under the guise of an exclusive right of management to the extent of maladministration,” the judges ruled.In its verdict, the bench led by Justice Arun Mishra also set aside challenges to NEET by private medical colleges, deemed universities, and state governments who wanted to hold their own entrance tests for admission to MBBS and BDS courses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neet-only-admission-test-for-medical-courses-applicable-to-minority-institutions-also-rules-supreme-court/story-fvv6vOAFBsXXY8tHaIoHkN.html

As the period for custody ended, the two were again produced before the special CBI court on Wednesday afternoon. The agency probing Yes Bank fraud case sought extension of their custody for further investigation.The agency pleaded that they only got one day after their arrest to interrogate them on various aspects of the loans and debentures obtained from Yes Bank during the tenure of Rana Kapoor, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Yes Bank. The prosecution also claimed that the accused have not cooperated in the questioning and they need more time to unearth the conspiracy.The plea was objected by the defense lawyers Amit Desai and Subodh Desai submitting that the custodial interrogation of the two is not required. It was argued that the case is based on banking transaction and money trails, documents of which are available with the agency. They also submitted that everything is available in the form of record hence the accused need not be sent to CBI custody in times of Covid emergency.The court after considering the arguments from both the side has extended the CBI custody of the two brothers for two more days till May 1.According to the CBI FIR, between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), which is till date not redeemed. It is further alleged that Yes Bank had sanctioned loan to RKW developers, where Dheeraj is a director and the whole amount was siphoned off by Kapil. CBI has alleged that in return, Wadhawan allegedly “paid kickback of Rs 600 crore” to Kapoor and family members in the form of loan to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-bank-fraud-cbi-custody-of-kapil-and-dheeraj-wadhwan-extended-till-may-1/story-lxB48AA9gjneCXpx9Y9J5I.html

CBSE earlier declared that it would conduct exams in 12 important subjects for Class 12. Exams for 17 other subjects for classes 10 and 12, which could not be held in communal violence hit north-east Delhi, will also be conducted.“Recently, there has been a lot of speculation regarding CBSE Board exams. The board’s decision to take exams for 29 subjects of class 10 and 12, stands the same. There is no change in position of conducting board exams. Therefore, exams will be conducted,” Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE’s controller of examinations said.The clarification came amid uncertainty over when the exams will be conducted, leading to speculations that the exams will be done away with in a one-time arrangement. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday his government has asked the human resource development ministry to evaluate and promote students of classes 10 and 12 on the basis of their scores in internal exams. “We are prepared to conduct board exams for classes 10 and 12 pending due to the lockdown in wake of the Covid-19 situation in the country. The exams will be conducted for 29 subjects crucial for promotion and admissions to undergraduate courses, at the first possibility. The students will be given at least a 10-day notice before exams are conducted,” a senior HRD ministry official said.“States have been asked to start the evaluation process for the exams already conducted and have been advised to facilitate evaluation of answer sheets. The CBSE will also issue instructions for marking or assessment of non-important subjects not included in the list of 29 subjects,” the official said.The Bihar board has already announced results for three streams of class 12 and is in the process of evaluation of class 10 exams. The Uttar Pradesh board is yet to begin the evaluation and will take a call in this regard soon.According to HRD ministry officials, as of now there are plans to conduct competitive exams including JEE and NEET in June for admissions to engineering and medical colleges. For other undergraduate admissions, the University Grants Commission (UGC) is working on an alternative calendar for the new academic session.Universities and schools across the country have been closed and exams postponed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.Later, a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, and it was later extended till May 3. The board was not able to conduct exams to classes 10 and 12 on eight examination days due to the coronavirus outbreak. Further, due to the law and order situation in northeast Delhi, the board was not able to conduct exams on four examination days, while a very small number of students from and around this district were not able to appear in exams on six days.CBSE has already announced that it will not be conducting any exams for students in foreign countries.“There are several CBSE schools located in 25 countries (which too are affected by Covid-19)…Under such circumstances, it is felt that the board will not be in a position to hold differential sets of exams for each of these countries,” the official said.

An assistant sub-inspector Sangappa received minor injuries and a police vehicle was partially damaged.On receiving the information, additional police forces from Sangareddy, led by Superintendent of Police S Chandrashekar Reddy and DSP Sridhar Reddy rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control.The SP pacified the agitators and assured them that their issues would be resolved at the earliest. He took a delegation of the workers to the district collector M Hanumantha Rao for talks.The workers complained that their company had not been paying wages to them for the last two months. The collector directed the company representatives to pay the pending wages by Thursday evening in their accounts.The collector also advised the company to begin work with the material available, strictly observing the physical distance norms and supplying the workers masks and sanitisers.The collector said the workers had grown restive as they had been held up on the campus without work for a long time. He said works should begin in a small way to keep them engaged.The workers, most of them from Bihar and Jharkhand, had been brought to the site by the construction major Larsen and Toubro to work on the construction of buildings on the IIT campus nearly six months ago.Following the nationwide lockdown, they had been held up at the construction site itself. They were alleging that the company had not been paying them wages for the last two months.On Wednesday, the workers who did not have even essentials to feed their children, began leaving the campus for their native places, as they were vexed with the lockdown and lack of wages. However, the Sangareddy police prevented them from coming out of the campus saying that the lockdown was in force.The agitated workers picked up an argument with the police asking how long they should bear with uncertain conditions, insisting they be allowed to go back to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-injured-as-migrant-workers-protest-for-wages-near-iit-hyderabad/story-7nTdn4csWDbEitxv58ymTN.html

Patnaik said Odisha will create history in controlling the spread of coronavirus if people cooperate with the state government and adhere to its guidelines. “The Covid-19 situation in Odisha is now well under control. The next few days are going to be extremely challenging and crucial, but there is nothing to be afraid of,” he said in a video message. “A large number of Odia brothers and sisters will return from states like the worst-hit Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan and neighbouring West Bengal,” the chief minister said. Their arrival will lead to detection of more Covid-19 cases, but the situation can be kept under control with cooperation from people, he said. Patnaik said people should assist the state government in ensuring that all returnees are registered and placed under quarantine. “This will ensure that the returnees and their families remain healthy, as also our villages and our society. A little bit of carelessness and negligence might put everybody in danger. This is a matter of life and death,” he said. The chief minister cautioned that laxity on the part of even 10 per cent of people will lead to escalation of the situation by 100 per cent. Patnaik added that out of the 122 Covid-19 patients in the state, 50 had recently returned from West Bengal. “Looking after West Bengal returnees has also become a major challenge for the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-situation-in-odisha-well-under-control-cm-naveen-patnaik/story-HAOvujpYqC6ti5POGmVTPO.html

Watch web series on over-the-top (OTT) media offerings or any other programme of your choice on TV or online,” said Khemani, who works for a multi-national company (MNC).He tested Covid-19 positive after his return from the US on March 17. He and his wife had gone to New York on March 6.“We got ourselves tested for Covid-19 on our return from the US. I tested Covid-19 positive on March 21. Fortunately, my wife tested negative. I got myself admitted to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida for treatment,” he said.“The GIMS authorities took good care of me and followed all prescribed guidelines. The rooms were properly sanitised every three-four hours. I was on a healthy diet and doctors were supportive and inspirational. They encouraged me to do 15-minute yoga daily and urged me to think positively,” he added.Khemani believes that if detected early, patients can recover from Covid-19. “Proper precautions need to be taken for 14 days. The mantra is to stay isolated, maintain social distancing norms, use personal protective equipment (PPE) kits such as mask, hand sanitiser and chances are high that you will recover in two weeks,” he said.Khemani cites his own example to urge others not to worry about the pandemic. “Most of the patients are recovering. There’s no need to panic. I was released by the GIMS on March 30, and I’m happy to be back with my family. However, I’m taking all the precautions such as self-isolation even after I returned home,” he added.Khemani’s cousin Dr. Rohit Gurnani, who works in Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University (KGMU), had advised him to stay calm via several video-conferencing calls while he was undergoing treatment at the GIMS. He considers that he could recover quickly because of his family’s support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-survivor-stay-positive-says-noida-based-it-professional-after-recovering/story-9ZLctlBx8cUXgcseFtUBBJ.html
29-04-2020||India||BPCL may have to let go Nashik plot held illegally for 55 years||Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) will have to forego a 14,550 square feet plot in Nashik, belonging to the family of late Champalal Vithuram Jajoo, which it had illegally occupied for over 55 years, after a single bench of the Bombay high court turned down an appeal filed by the public sector undertaking to retain the plot.The bench of Justice Dama Sheshadri Naidu was critical of BPCL’s numerous attempts to appeal, and thereby prolong the legal battle, when it said, “If law cannot give you what you seek, litigation will. The appellant (Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited), it seems, strongly believes in this and proves it right, too.”The comment came because of the conduct of BPCL which held on to the plot with an unregistered lease deed by prolonging litigation. According to law, BPCL with an unregistered deal could have held on to the property only for 30 days.The issue started in February 1965 when BPCL, which earlier was Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distribution Company of India Limited, secured a 20 year lease for the property for Rs 3,900 per year but did not secure a registered lease deed. Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distribution Company of India Limited was nationalized by the central government to form Bharat Refineries Limited, before renaming it as BPCL.In 1977, the plot owners filed an eviction suit to recover the plot from BPCL for erecting unauthorized permanent structures, change of user and for unlawfully sub-letting the plot. In March 1985, a trial court dismissed the suit and later an appeal filed by the owners was also dismissed. The owners filed a writ petition which was also dismissed in 1998.In May 1998, the owners issued a notice of possession to BPCL and sought their eviction on the grounds of bona fide requirement, arrears of rent and permanent construction and filed a civil suit which they won. BPCL was unsuccessful in its challenge to the civil suit in 2005, and subsequently filed a second appeal in 2014 for which the Bombay high court ruled that the appeal was not maintainable in 2016. But BPCL once again filed another appeal in 2018.“All the while it holds on to the property,” noted Justice Naidu and said, “Now the PSU has been a tenant for 55 years on the strength of an unregistered lease deed, which legally entitled the lessee to be a tenant for only 30 days,” the judge added. “In other words, it is supposed to be a tenant for 30 days; that is all it gets as a lessee under an unregistered lease. But BPCL continues as a lessee for 55 years. Law gives it 30 days, and litigation stretches it to 20,075 days,” said the judge and dismissed the appeal filed by the public sector undertaking for securing extension of the lease.By another order, also pronounced on Monday, the judge also upheld the orders passed by a civil judge junior division at Nashik in September 2005, evicting BPCL and one of its retailers from the plot.Justice Naidu noted that first of all the unregistered lease conferred no rights on BPCL. Besides, the PSU has already got the extension beyond 20 years - the period it prayed for in the suit, despite losing the suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bpcl-may-have-to-let-go-nashik-plot-held-illegally-for-55-years/story-v1cfeqKnEWV3MixdYIhfgI.html
29-04-2020||India||India green-lights UAE, Kuwait request for ex-military doctors, nurses||The government has given an in-principle approval to requests from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to send Indian doctors and paramedics to help the two Gulf countries fight the Covid-19 pandemic, a top government official told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.Kuwait was the first one to seek Indian medical assistance earlier this month when Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah called Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Indian Air Force had then flown a 15-member military rapid response team.As this team was wrapping up - it returned on Monday - New Delhi received the request for more medical teams. “They were very impressed with the rapid response team,” an official said.By this time, senior government officials said, another request for Indian healthcare personnel had come in from the United Arab Emirates. There are also similar requests pending from Mauritius and Comoros, the archipelago off Africa’s east coast Comoros, that are battling the disease.Other Gulf countries have also sounded out New Delhi that they would need Indian medical assistance and are expected to send formal requests shortly.In response to these requests, the top official said, “an in-principle decision has been taken to allow retired military doctors, nurses and technicians to travel to UAE and Kuwait to begin with”.For Comoros and Mauritius, the government has okayed short-term deployment of the military’s rapid response teams. These self-contained teams comprise military doctors, nurses and other paramedics.The foreign ministry and the armed forces are still working out the mechanics of how the medical teams for Kuwait and UAE would be constituted.“Retired military healthcare professionals - doctors, nurses, lab technicians - who are ready to take up this assignment, can opt to help the Gulf countries,” the official said.On an average, a top military official told Hindustan Times, about 100 doctors, 30-40 nurses and a few hundred paramedics retire from the Army Medical Corps every year.Since it would not have been possible to spare serving government doctors at this time, the decision attempts to address the urgent needs of the Gulf countries without compromising with the healthcare requirements of people in India.PM Modi and Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, who have received numerous requests for Indian assistance from Gulf countries over the Covid-19, had earlier ordered officials to prioritise approvals to their requests for dispatch of millions of paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine tablets.So far, 45 million hydroxychloroquine tablets and 11 metric tonnes of HCQ’s active pharmaceutical ingredients have been cleared to be shipped on a commercial basis to six Gulf countries, Bahrain, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Another 22.7 million units of paracetamol were also cleared for Kuwait and the UAE before the government lifted export controls on the medicine on 17 April. Some more consignments of paracetamol were subsequently cleared for the two countries, apart from Iraq and Yemen.Medical Assistance to Gulf countriesUAE - 428 lakh HCQ tablets, 10 tonnes of HCQ active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), 220 million paracetamol tabletsKuwait - 7.7 million paracetamol tablets, injections etcBahrain - 15 lakh HCQ tabletsJordan - 0.5 tonnes of HCQ API Oman - 10 lakh HCQ tabletsQatar - 80,000 HCQ tabletsSaudi Arabia - 0.52 tonnes of HCQ APIOfficials suggest India had gone out of its way to cater to the requirements of the Gulf countries at this crucial juncture, gestures that have been warmly reciprocated by the West Asian countries. Like when the UAE was packing off immigrants from every other country following the outbreak of the pandemic, India requested Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to go slow with repatriating Indian nationals because the state governments didn’t have the infrastructure to deal with the influx.This request was accepted though around the same time, the messaging to the rest of the world was that the government could impose restrictions on return of workers later from countries that don’t evacuate their nationals.“It is in this context”, a foreign ministry official said, “that the unseemly controversy over a cabinet note in Kuwait should be seen”. The document, which spoke about Muslims being targeted in India, was leaked around the same time that Kuwait was requesting India to make an exception and send Indian doctors and healthcare professionals.It was an effort by vested interests - possibly linked to pro-Pakistan elements in the kingdom - to influence the narrative around India’s deepening ties with Gulf countries. In any case, a minister in the Indian government said, even at meetings of the Union Cabinet in Delhi, all issues and topics under the Sun are discussed. “That does not mean that the view being discussed reflects the stand of the government,” he said.Officials underline how the concerns referred to in the Kuwaiti document echoed the narrative that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had been trying to build for some time.Foreign minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi had promptly weighed in, calling for a coordinated effort against coronavirus. “Unfortunately, what we’re seeing is that though this virus respects no borders, it doesn’t differentiate between ethnicities or religion — yet in India [...] they’re in the grip of Islamophobia,” he said, according to a report in Pakistan’s newspaper Dawn’s website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-green-lights-uae-kuwait-request-for-ex-military-doctors-nurses/story-fc6THXnkTBVLTSMRgZbhdL.html

To discourage such a trend, the police in Kerala’s Wayanad have imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on people caught littering the streets with masks.“We will fine offenders Rs 5000 and if they fail to cough up the fine we will register a case against them under the relevant provisions of the Epidemic Act which carries a maximum punishment of five years in jail. We need to discourage littering so a heavy fine is required. Attitudinal change is a must in such trying times. People will have to rise to the occasion,” said Wayanad’s superintendent of police E Rajaram.Health experts say dumped masks could facilitate super spread of Covid-19. In Wayanad, shops which do not provide hand sanitizers or soaps for customers will also be booked. They will have to cough up Rs 1,000 for the first offence and Rs 5,000 for a subsequent offence.Leading the battle against Covid-19 in Wayanad is a young collector, Dr Adeela Abdulla (34) who is also a qualified doctor.“Wayanad is an ecologically sensitive district that has more than 70% forest area. So we have to be strict. In pandemic days, masks are part of our life but at the same time we need to know how to use and dispose of it,” said the 2012 batch IAS officer who took many proactive steps in conjunction with the district police chief to make Wayanad a green zone.“My district shares borders with two states, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. So we have to be strict as people cross over from both sides. There is no compromise on masks. Not Covid-19 alone, it can check other respiratory tract infections also,” she said.Wayanad is represented by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the Lok sabha.Taking a cue from Wayanad many local bodies in the state said they will give enough lessons to the public on how to wear and dispose of masks. They said many firms have started designer masks to suit all occasions but no lessons are imparted on wearing and removing masks.“We have seen after wearing masks people adjust it with their hands frequently. This defeats the very purpose,” said a civic body member. Kerala recorded 485 cases of Covid-19 out of which 359 have recovered and four have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-in-wayanad-pay-rs-5000-as-fine-for-not-wearing-masks/story-h8XnTToPUgifAoIwzMCgWJ.html
29-04-2020||India||Bengal tutor and his students distribute food packets among needy||For the past two weeks, something strange has been happening every night in villages on the fringes of Santiniketan in Bolpur town of West Bengal’s Birbhum district.Somebody has been leaving packets of food items and other essentials at the doorsteps of huts and shanties. And the recipients are always those who have lost their livelihoods in the lockdown prompted by the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and now count among the poorest of the poor in their villages.So who is this donor and how is the person able to identify the dwellings of the neediest? Until recently, no one had a clue. Then one day, somebody spotted the Good Samaritan on his rounds distributing food. Shyamal Maji’s cover was blown.Thirty-six-year-old Maji is a private tutor in Bolpur, a man of modest income. Yet and for the past two weeks, Maji and his flock of students — all from Bolpur and its environs — have been providing food to helpless people. But why at night, when nobody can see them?“Look, I don’t want any fame and would rather remain behind the wings. These people were mainly wage labourers who are jobless now. They still go out every day in search of work and are home at nightfall. But not all of them would like to stand in a queue for food, as some feel ashamed to seek help from others and would rather go hungry,” Maji said.Maji has been giving tuition since 2006, and gets almost 200 – 250 students each year at his coaching centre. His network of students runs into a few thousands, and since he only teaches high school students and undergraduates, most are adults and many already employed.“I have formed a 10-man team to accompany me on this job every night,” Maji said. “Since my students live scattered all over the area we operate in, they identify the neediest in their respective hamlets. Help pours in from the students themselves. Some are employed, others come from well-to-do-families and they all donate generously. Yet others chip in with whatever they can — sometimes with packets of puffed rice,” he added.The recipients of Maji’s kindness have told their neighbours that Maji’s food packets are like godsends.“ Seventy-year-old Balai Kisku of my village, received a packet one night. He was so elated that we could actually see happiness and a sense of relief writ large on his face. He used to make thatched roofs for huts in the village but has been idle since the lockdown,” said Uttam Das of Bolpur’s Bondanga village. Das discovered, only later, that the man behind the generous deed was none other than his own son’s tutor, Shyamal Maji. “It was good to know that Maji helped Kisku and others, without blowing his own trumpet,” Das added. “The people whom we choose to help are the poorest of the poor. It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to do so, but we would prefer to remain in the shadows and work from behind the wings,” said Taraknath Das, a student on Maji’s team. Each packet that he leaves on doorsteps contains around two kilos of rice, potatoes, some vegetables, cooking oil, salt, puffed rice and a soap.“Sometimes I see people clicking photos while providing relief to poor people. One poor, needy man gets one kilo of rice and 15 persons gather around to click a photo. Is that what you are providing relief for?” Das asked.Maji, the tutor setting a worthy example for hundreds of young wards, is himself the father of a four-year-old daughter. He says that it is his wife’s cooperation and encouragement alone, that has given him the courage to help others less fortunate then his own family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-tutor-and-his-students-distribute-food-packets-among-needy/story-5krm7y523Pzws0A7MTACfJ.html

A rare talent and a brilliant actor, his diverse roles and remarkable performances will remain etched in our memories. A big loss to the world of cinema and millions of film lovers. Condolences to his family & admirers.Khan died on Wednesday after being admitted to Mumbai’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital with a colon infection.The death, after a prolonged battle with cancer, was confirmed by a spokesman who said Khan was surrounded by family at the time.“He fought the many battles that came with it,” the spokesman said in a statement, referring to the diagnosis of Khan’s rare cancer in 2018.Irrfan Khan was among the first Indian actors to make a consistent mark in Western cinema, following in the footsteps of crossover pioneers such as Saeed Jaffrey, Roshan Seth and Om Puri.Born Sahabzade Irfan Ali Khan in the western desert state of Rajasthan, in a family with no ties to cinema, the actor recalled in interviews that as children, he and his siblings were not allowed to watch movies.The only exception was when a visiting uncle took them to the theatre.Khan made his screen debut in the Academy Award-nominated 1988 drama “Salaam Bombay!,” a tale of Mumbai’s street children. He later worked with directors Mira Nair, Wes Anderson and Ang Lee.Khan in 2018 was diagnosed with a rare neuroendocrine cancer and underwent months of treatment in the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/irrfan-khan-s-performances-will-remain-etched-in-our-memories-president-kovind/story-Tmc2Ui057LnrUvQGZ8D81L.html

Even when they are transported, that temperature level has to be maintained so that they do not degrade.The teams have also recommended the need for deploying more field staff for house-to-house survey in containment zones as well as strengthening of passive surveillance in buffer zones so that asymptomatic cases are not missed out.The teams have also recommended maintaining of a separate triage area in hospitals for segregation of the mild, moderate and severe patients of coronavirus infection, which they said, were not followed in many places.They have also recommended training of healthcare workers in IPC practices and clinical management of mild, moderate and severe as per the national clinical guidelines.Interaction with many of them revealed that they are unaware of the guidelines to be followed while handling a Covid-19 patient and this is a “serious concern,” the sources said.As many as 15 places including Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad have been identified as “high case load” by the government.Out of these 15, seven districts show particularly high case volumes, like Hyderabad (Telangana), Pune (Maharashtra), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Mumbai (Maharashtra) and Delhi.The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 1,007 and the number of cases climbed to 31,332 in the country on Wednesday, according to the Union Health Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-s-teams-find-several-hospitals-fail-to-meet-infection-control-practices/story-lUeBfKiPff4rMmgivVpuxN.html

The incident occurred at Chhevari village under Ramgarh police station of Kaimur district, when the SDM, SDPO, and other officials reached the spot to open a sealed PDS shop.The villagers attacked the officials because they opposed the officials’ move to open the PDS shop, which was sealed last week on charges of malpractices. Dilnawaz Ahmad, superintendent of police (SP), Kaimur district, rushed to the troubled spot and brought the situation under control. The police have registered a case against seven named and 50 unidentified attackers. They have been booked under Section 148 (rioting) and Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). They have also been charged for the violation of the ongoing nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were initially enforced for 21 days from March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, under the National Disaster Management Act. The district police authorities have arrested seven people, including the husband of Chhevari panchayat head, Harendra Ram. “Ram is accused of leading the mob. The other assailants have also been identified, and they will be arrested soon,” SP Ahmad said.The district administration had sealed two PDS shops in the village last week in the presence of SDM Shiv Kumar Raut, marketing officer Hemendra Kumar, and the police last week following the locals’ complaints about the dealers’malpractices.On Tuesday, SDM Raut, SDPO, district supply officer (DSO) Prabhat Kumar Jha reached the village with the police in a bid to settle the dispute over the dealers’ alleged malpractices. The officials announced that the licence of one of the PDS shops had been cancelled, and a dealer from an adjacent village has been entrusted with the responsibility to run it. However, the officials gave a clean chit to the second dealer, which irked the villagers and demanded the closure of both the PDS shops. Soon, they gheraoed the officials and started pelting stones at them.“Many PDS dealers in Kaimur district are indulging in rampant corruption for long. This has been a cause for resentment among the poor villagers, who are primarily dependent on the PDS for their survival. Tuesday’s violence was an outburst of their pent-up anger and frustration,” said Vijay Yadav, district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-attack-police-over-opening-of-pds-shop-in-bihar/story-rXM4BHpd8dzVLlh8Khm4vI.html

29-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Centre asks all employees to download Aarogya Setu app||The central government has asked all its employees to download the Aarogya Setu app and commute only after they have been marked “safe” or “low risk” in a move to reducethe risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The order, issued by the department of personnel and training on Wednesday, has instructed all employees, including outsourced staff to download the app. Joint secretaries (administration) across departments have been asked to ensure that the directions are strictly followed. The Aarogya Setu app will determine the risk, based on Bluetooth proximity (‘recent contact with infected person’) to assess whether an official is at ‘high risk’. Those marked as ‘high risk’ will have to skip office for 14 days. The directions come just a few days before May 3, the scheduled date to lift the lockdown. While ministries are still waiting for clarity on whether the full workforce has to return to offices, they are taking preventive measures such as sanitisation and thermal screenings to reduce the risk of being infected. The app, one of the government’s flagship initiatives to fight the coronavirus pandemic, has been downloaded by nearly eight crore users so far after being launched on April 2. It has been dogged by privacy concerns, with many critics saying there is no clarity on where the data collected is stored, and if it is stored for posterity. “There are many problems with the app. There is a privacy concern and a cybersecurity one. All the information is stored on a backend server. There may be a possible security threat,” lawyer Apar Gupta said. “People who are working with the government, their movements will be tracked at all times. The only form of restraint is the privacy policy which may be changed anytime,” Gupta added. Independent security researcher Srinivas Kodali said the app collects “information but doesn’t provide essential information.” “The app has security features, yes. It is an experiment with a good aim that may fall flat. The question remains how is data used and who has access to the data collected. The essential problem is a trust deficit when it comes to the government. It is a surveillance app,” Kodali said while speaking to HT. Moreover, Kodali added the app doesn’t work unless a majority of people download it.According to Arnab Kumar, program director and a member of the Aarogya Setu core team, “the benefit of the app lies in its ability to automatically contact trace”. The app collects the name, phone number, sex and travel history of the person over the last 30 days. According to sources in NITI Aayog, the data is stored for around 45 days after which it is deleted if a person is not at risk.“Security and privacy concerns have been paramount while designing the app. Each phone number is assigned a unique id and once someone is found Covid-19 positive, the app traces other unique ids the person has come in contact with,” Kumar said. “Using Bluetooth-enabled technology we can determine the time and distance the persons maintained and thus, warn others who may be at risk,” he added. Kumar added that the data is stored with the government and accessible to only those who are directly involved in battling the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-centre-asks-all-employees-to-download-aarogya-setu-app/story-N0imeC28KBQ9TiijveYNhO.html

29-04-2020||India||Nagaland levies Covid-19 cess of Rs 5 per litre for diesel and Rs 6 for petrol and motor spirit||Nagaland has followed in the footsteps of two other states in the north-east -- Assam and Meghalaya – that imposed coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cess on petroleum products last week.In a notification issued on Tuesday, Sentiyanger Imchen, the additional chief secretary and finance commissioner, Nagaland, stated that the Covid-19 cess would be Rs 5 and Rs 6 per litre of diesel, petrol and other motor spirits, respectively.“In exercise of powers conferred by sub-section 3 of section 3A of the Nagaland (Sales of Petrol and Petroleum Products including Motor Spirit and Lubricant) Taxation Act, 1967, the Governor of Nagaland is pleased to notify than in addition to the existing rate of tax and cess, Covid-19 cess shall be levied,” said the notification that came into effect from Tuesday midnight. On April 21, Assam had hiked the price of petrol from Rs 71.61 to Rs 77.46 per litre and that of diesel from Rs 65.07 to Rs 70.50 per litre. “Due to a decrease in international oil prices, it will affect the amount Assam gets as royalty for oil from ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) and Oil India Limited. This increase in prices is an attempt to cover some of the losses, maybe Rs 50 crore in 30 days. This is a temporary measure and there will be a rollback once the Covid-19 crisis gets over,” Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said. On April 21, Meghalaya, too, had increased its taxes on petrol and diesel. Now, a litre of petrol and diesel costs Rs 74.9 and Rs 67.5, respectively, in the state. Meghalaya government has also decided to levy 2% as sales tax surcharge on both petrol and diesel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-levies-covid-19-cess-of-rs-5-per-litre-for-diesel-and-rs-6-for-petrol-and-motor-spirit/story-Lw9VhGJ0taHAk4cqj2Ei3L.html
29-04-2020||India||P Chidambaram spotlights MSMEs concern on paying April wages, advises govt||Former finance minister P Chidambaram on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide Rs 1 lakh crore wage protection assistance to 6.3 crore Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to help them pay wages and salaries to 110 million people engaged in these MSMEs for the month of April.And for non-MSMEs, he said the government should announce a “Paycheque Protection Programme” on the lines of the steps taken by the United States.“This is not a legislation but a financial assistance package,” Chidambaram said, addressing the press through video-conferencing.“It is bewildering that there has been absolutely no financial package or assistance announced for businesses since the onset of Covid-19. The government may have the luxury of time but the MSMEs do not. They need to know right away whether they will be helped to stay afloat and thereby pay salaries and wages to those dependent on these businesses,” he said.“Tomorrow is the last working day of the month. More than 12 crore people of India are waiting with bated breath. They want to know if they will be paid their salaries and wages for the month of April. There is palpable tension and rising uncertainty among the working people of India and their families,” Chidambaram said.According to the annual report of the MSME ministry, the senior Congress leader said 11 crore people are engaged in 6.3 crore MSMEs and most of them would not have worked a single day in the month of April because the entire country was in a lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic. “How will these people feed themselves and their families without an income? These 11 crore people’s livelihoods are in danger now because most of the employers are unable to pay wages and salaries. The businesses have had no sales this month and their payments to their vendors are also stuck, leaving the vendors also in distress,” he said.“Large swathes of the private sector are faced with what economists call an extreme liquidity shock. Furthermore, these businesses are also unsure about their future. They do not know whether they can continue their businesses or will be forced to shut down permanently. The time to make bold decisions to save the MSMEs is now. If businesses do not see hope, they will decide to close,” he added.The government has to step in today to protect 110 million Indians and give hope to 6.3 crore MSMEs, Chidambaram said, adding the Congress has submitted a proposal with specific, well thought out and concrete suggestions to help them.“We urge the Prime Minister to look at that proposal and immediately announce Rs 1 lakh crore wage protection assistance to MSMEs to help them pay wages and salaries for the month of April, and also Rs 1 lakh crore credit guarantee fund for MSMEs that will help them to go to the banks and borrow money,” he said.Elaborating on the ‘Paycheque Protection Programme’, the former finance minister said according to the income-tax department, there are roughly 10 million people with a salary income of less than Rs 3,50,000 a year or Rs 30,000 a month.“Assuming an average salary of Rs 15,000 a month for these 1 crore people, the total cost comes to Rs 15,000 crore for the month of April. This is not a large sum to protect the livelihoods of 10 million people who have filed tax returns and paid taxes in the past, and can be easily found. The government must announce a Paycheque Protection Program right away to protect the salaries of these 1 crore employees.”The Congress also suggested waiver of employers’ contributions to the employees provident fund (EPF) and employees state insurance (ESI), on a temporary basis, for the next three months, he said, adding this will assist in reducing the payroll costs of employers and retaining the workforce.“Time is of the essence. In the absence of a clear signal of assistance from the government during these extremely difficult times, the private sector will be forced to resort to large scale retrenchments and layoffs which will devastate livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people,” Chidambaram said.“We urge the Prime Minister to step in urgently and announce an assistance package to protect the wages and salaries and pay cheques that are due in the next few days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/p-chidambaram-spotlights-msmes-concern-on-paying-april-wages-advises-govt/story-rmsjh02XhStGAt2n8ZDRYI.html
29-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Kerala to bring ordinance to cut employees’ salaries for mobilising funds||Miffed by Kerala High Court order that stayed the state government’s decision to deduct six-day salary of all its employees in the next five months as a temporary measure, the State Cabinet on Wednesday decided to float a new Ordinance - which will enable it to defer payment of salary up to 25 per cent, said a State Minister.Soon after the weekly cabinet meeting, State Finance Minister Thomas Issac told the media that the government has decided to come out with Disaster and Public Emergency Special Provisions Act which will give it the power to defer payment of salaries, up to 25 per cent of all state government employees.“This is not against yesterday’s high court order, instead we have abided by it. We are not going to go in appeal against stay order. The State government is using the provisions in the Act. The provision in the Act is clear as it says this can be done when a health emergency or a disaster strikes. The Centre has declared the pandemic as a health emergency,” said Issac.“Some people like leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala is yet to gauge the situation what the state is presently undergoing. Anyone is free to go in appeal against the new Ordinance. The salary of April month will be paid in May after completing the procedures,” added Issac and said they will stick to defer six days salary, that they originally proposed.Incidentally, it was the various Congress-led staff unions that had approached the court over the “arbitrary manner in which employees had been forcibly directed to contribute to the CM Covid Relief Fund”.The court on Tuesday pointed out that salary is an employee’s right and they have no clue of how the government will use this donated money.However, the court said that the state government could go in for an appeal, if it wished.Incidentally, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Issac had first demanded a contribution of one month’s salary each from all state government officials towards the Relief Fund, but the move was shot down by the opposition parties.Feeling snubbed, the Vijayan government then went ahead and announced that they have no other way but to defer six-day salary for the next five months. It too came under heavy criticism from the opposition staff unions which approached the court.Now all eyes are on the Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on what position he will be taking with regard to the new Ordinance and if he decides to seek additional information or goes in for legal advice, there is likelihood that the payment of salaries for April, might get delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kerala-to-bring-ordinance-to-cut-employees-salaries-for-mobilising-funds/story-ngAswChktYfLWO3GxHDk7O.html

The navy is prepared to send three warships to bring Indians back,” the sources said.As reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spelt out the ground rule for the evacuation plan --- India’s blue collar workers stranded abroad will get the first seats in the special flights that will be run by the government to get them home.Students stranded in different countries will be next, followed by everyone else including Indians who were travelling for work, or pleasure.The navy’s solitary landing platform dock (LPD), the INS Jalashwa, has a displacement of 16,950 tonnes. Formerly known as the USS Trenton, it was bought from the United States 13 years ago. The navy also has a fleet of five smaller amphibious warships with a displacement of 5,600 tonnes, and even smaller 1,150-tonne landing ship tanks.The navy’s plans to build four LPDs in the country to scale up its amphibious warfare capabilities as part of a $3-billion project has not made any headway so far. Earlier, Reliance Defence had teamed up with French shipbuilder DCNS, while L&T partnered with Spanish state-owned company Navantia to build the warships in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-warships-on-standby-to-evacuate-indians-from-the-gulf/story-lZHlmkc5JxkwNOKy4bWndI.html

It’s a heartwarming gesture from a martyr’s wife and that too only a month after she lost her husband to a Maoist attack. We’re proud of her,” said Deepak Jha, superintendent of police (SP), Bastar.Radhika’s good turn has touched a chord among the officials in the tribal-dominated Bastar district.“We tried to impress upon Radhika that instead of donating Rs 10,000 to the CM’s Relief Fund, she could have deposited the money in her son’s account. But she insisted that there are many kids like her son, who’re going without food because of Covid-19, and this meagre sum can come in handy for them. She told us that her late husband always stood for such causes,” said Abinash Mishra, a probationary Indian Administrative Officer (IAS), who was present when she donated the money.The Bastar Police authorities have made a short video clip on her selfless deed.However, she is unfazed by the adulation. “I donated a fraction of what I had received as compensation from the government after my husband was martyred. My late husband always used to help people during their hard times.

In a series of tweets on Tuesday night, Sitharaman stressed that the government is pursuing wilful defaulters, and has filed 9,967 recovery suits and 3,515 first-information reports (FIRs) against such offenders.Her remarks came a day after the opposition Congress party alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had written off loans worth Rs 68,607 crore due from top 50 bank loan defaulters, including Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya. Citing a right to information (RTI) reply from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to activist Saket Gokhale, the Congress also alleged that the NDA government waived off loans worth Rs 6.66 lakh crore between 2014, when it came to power, and last September, and asked for a response from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sitharaman.In her reply, Sitharaman said the Congress “attempted to mislead people in a brazen manner”, adding that it’s typical of the party that resorts “to sensationalising facts by taking them out of context”.She pointed at what she called the Congress’s failure to play a “constructive role”, launching a fresh attack on former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who has sought to corner the government over the issue of wilful defaulters.“@INCIndia and Shri. @RahulGandhi should introspect why they fail to play a constructive role in cleaning up the system. Neither while in power, nor while in the opposition has the @INCIndia shown any commitment or inclination to stop corruption & cronyism,” Sitharaman tweeted.She said scheduled commercial banks wrote off Rs 145,226 crore between 2009-10 and 2013-14, when the Congress-ruled United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power. “Wished Shri. @RahulGandhi consulted Dr. Manmohan Singh (who was then the prime minister) on what this writing-off was about,” she said.Referring to media reports and quoting former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, she said a large number of bad loans originated in the period 2006-2008 in the Congress rule, and “too many loans were made to well-connected promoters who have a history of defaulting on their loans...”Sitharaman gave details of the cases involving Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya. “Nirav Modi Case : Immovable and movable properties worth more than Rs 2387 Crore attached/seized.(Attachment Rs 1898 Crore and Seizure Rs 489.75 Crore). This includes foreign attachments of Rs 961.47 Crore. Auction of luxury items for Rs 53.45 Crore. He is in prison in the UK.”“Mehul Choksi Case: Attachments of Rs 1936.95 Crore including foreign attachment of Rs 67.9 Crore. Seizure of Rs 597.75 Crore. Red Notice issued. Extradition Request sent to Antigua. Hearing for declaration of Mehul Choksi as Fugitive Offender is in progress.”“Vijay Mallya Case : Total value at the time of attachment was Rs 8040 Crore and of seizure was Rs 1693 Crore. Value of shares at the time of seizure was Rs 1693 Crore. Declared fugitive offender. On extradition request by GoI,UK High Court, has also ruled for extradition.”But Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala was not satisfied. In a series of tweets, he asked whether the RTI reply of RBI stated the facts and questioned why the government was wrting off “bank loans of absconders and frauds”. “And @nsitharaman ji, Cleaning the Banks of people’s money by writing off loans of absconders & fraudsters is not called ‘cleaning the system’. ... It’s called weakening the entire Bank architecture fiscally & imprudently, if not maliciously,” Surjewala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-rahul-gandhi-should-introspect-sitharaman-hits-back-on-wilful-defaulter-row/story-fAcJwq4DHUF7gX0LoUxgiN.html

May his work always be remembered and his soul rest in peace,” Kejriwal tweeted out. Khan, 53, breathed his last on Wednesday at Mumbai’s Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. The actor was being treated for colon infection at the hospital. Khan’s spokesperson released a statement on his admission to the hospital on Tuesday. “Yes, it is true that Irrfan Khan is admitted to ICU at Kokilaben in Mumbai because of a colon infection. We would keep everyone updated. He is under doctor’s observation. His strength and courage have helped him battle and fight so far and we are sure with his tremendous willpower and prayers of his well wishers, he will recover soon,” the statement read.Khan was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumour, a rare form of cancer, in the year 2018. He left for London for the treatment and returned last year to shoot for Homi Adajania’s ‘Angrezi Medium’ which released last month. The actor returned to London and came back last year in September after his treatment. The actor lost his mother, Saeeda Begum, on Saturday in Jaipur. “’I trust, I have surrendered,’ these were the some of the many words that Irrfan expressed in a heart felt note he wrote in 2018 opening up about his fight with cancer. And a man of few words and an actor of silent expressions with his deep eyes and his memorable actions on screen. It’s saddening that this day, we have to bring forward the news of him passing away. Irrfan was a strong soul, someone who fought till the very end and always inspired everyone who came close to him. After having been struck by lightning in 2018 with the news of a rare cancer, he took life soon after as it came and he fought the many battles that came with it. Surrounded by his love, his family for whom he most cared about, he left for heaven abode, leaving behind truly a legacy of his own. We all pray and hope that he is at peace. And to resonate and part with his words he had said, ‘As if I was tasting life for the first time, the magical side of it’, read the statement released on the actor’s demise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-of-the-most-exceptional-actors-of-our-time-kejriwal-condoles-irrfan-khan-s-death/story-96x0JVfg9JOVVcnPA9cyzN.html

29-04-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 lockdown, family forced to carry asthma patient on handcart; declared dead on arrival||The family of an asthma patient put him on a handcart when the ambulance did not turn up, but failed to save his life with policemen on the way to hospital and doctors there allegedly ignoring his plight. Both police and medical authorities denied their alleged negligence which the family said led to the death Monday of vegetable vendor Satish Agrawal, who lived in curfew-bound Faithagadi in Kota’s Rampura area. Agrawal was carried about half the way to MBS Hospital on the cart from which he sold vegetables, before a private ambulance arrived. His son Manish on Tuesday said when his father suffered an asthma attack at 11.30 am the family made several calls for an ambulance. “As none of the ambulance services responded, I put my father on his vegetable cart and started for the hospital over two and a half kilometres away from home,” he said. “Though policemen on the way removed barricades at various intersections on the curfew-bound road, none of them thought of helping us and rushing my father in a police vehicle to the hospital,” Manish told PTI. “After Manish had covered over a kilometre till Nayapura circle on the way to MBS Hospital, I somehow managed to hire a private ambulance,” another relative said. “Even at the hospital, we were made to shuttle from one room to another and to a makeshift clinic outside the hospital building before doctors eventually attended on him and declared him dead at 2.30 pm,” he said. MBS Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Naveen Saxena, however, refuted the allegation. “Satish Agrawal was brought to the hospital in a collapsed condition and a doctor immediately examined him in room 125 and declared him brought dead,” he said. “Sometime later, the family members of the victim, however, said the patient’s heart was still beating, following which Dr Lokesh Suwalka re-examined him and conducted an ECG,” Dr Saxena said. “The medical staff did not delay in the treatment,” he asserted. On the unavailability of an ambulance, he said the service is managed by the chief medical and health officer. The officer could not be contacted for comment. Kota’s Assistant Superintendent of Police Dilip Saini too rejected the family’s allegation about policemen ignoring the plight of the patient being carted to a hospital on a handcart. “It is hypothetical to say that the policemen did not help. The policemen in the area did not have any vehicle or an ambulance, which could have been summoned only from a hospital or the ambulance service numbers 104 or 108,” said Saini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-lockdown-family-forced-to-carry-asthma-patient-on-handcart-declared-dead-on-arrival/story-PFGW38g7S67sQnNpgb2G5H.html

It’s biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” he said. The watchdog has also recommended that the US government should impose targeted sanctions against Indian government agencies and officials responsible for religious freedom violations, freeze their assets in the United States and ban them from entering the country. India, which was on the commission’s Tier 2 list of countries to be watched in 2019, was among the 14 countries that the USCIRF asked the US state department to designate as CPC over increasing assaults on religious minorities.Nine countries—Myanmar, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan—were designated as CPCs in December 2019. Five others included India, Nigeria, Russia, Syria and Vietnam, USCIRF said.It could not be immediately ascertained if the recommendation were binding and whether the Trump administration would indeed accept those meant for the US government.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misrepresentation-reached-new-levels-india-rebuffs-us-religious-panel-s-report/story-HGXGOyFcqkiwLqoPWTUPaO.html

In Pritchett’s words, India is “a nation-state in which the head, that is the elite institutions at the national level remain sound and functional but this head is no longer reliably connected via nerves and sinews to its own limbs.”  A new book the author and journalist Shankkar Aiyar takes the argument one step further. Aiyar’s new book, The Gated Republic: India’s Public Policy Failures and Private Solutions argues that the failure of India’s public sector to deliver on its most essential functions has created a massive gap, which the private sector has had no choice but to fill.On this week’s episode, Milan Vaishnav (Director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) speaks with Aiyar about the causes and consequences of the proliferation of India’s “gated republics,” what the COVID19 crisis reveals about the Indian state, and whether democracy is part of the solution or part of the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shankkar-aiyar-on-the-proliferation-of-india-s-gated-republics/story-jh6vLmIcxXSv7jczh9v0cM.html

The quarry had started operating after government eased lockdown norms for roads and house construction works.The deceased have been identified as Bhakta Parida, Namita Naik and Pankaja Dash. While Bhakta was a resident of Bikrampur village in Khollikote area, Namita and Pankaja were staying in Tanganapani village at the outskirts of Berhampur city.Police reached the spot and sent the bodies to a hospital for post-mortem. A case of culpable homicide have been registered in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-daily-labourers-in-odisha-killed-in-stone-quarry-mishap/story-VC3WCe8oeMDvMifd10H4lI.html
29-04-2020||India||2 drivers traverse 3,000 km to bring back body of Mizo youth from Chennai to Aizawl||The rain failed to deter many in Mizoram’s capital Aizawl on Tuesday who came out to thank two ambulance drivers Jeyanthiran and Chinnathambi. The duo had driven nearly 3,450 km from Chennai to Aizawl carrying the body of a Mizo youth, Vivian Remsanga, who died in Chennai.“Against all odds. 3,000 plus km of hardship and struggle won’t dampen the spirit of resting the tragic earthly remains of Vivian Remsanga by his friend Raphael AVL Malchhanhima along with Jeyanthiran and Chinnathambi, both from Tamil Nadu. Mizoram salutes you,” Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga tweeted on Tuesday.Malchhanhima was Remsanga’s friend, who also undertook the journey in the ambulance.“Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You have just shown what every Mizo heartbeat means when it comes to the term ‘Tlawmngaihna’,” the CM said.Loosely translated, ‘Tlawmngaihna’ is a Mizo code of conduct that urges everyone to be hospitable, kind and helpful. It was on full show in Aizawl as people, maintaining social distancing norms, handed traditional shawls, shirts and more to the two drivers. Photos and videos of the ambulance arriving at Aizawl soon went viral.Twenty-eight year old Vivian, who graduated from a Chennai-based hotel management institute in February this year, expired in the city on April 23 due to a heart attack. His body was found by the Adyar police.“Cause of death was not Covid-19 or physical assault. We were able to trace his family back to Mizoram. Fortunately, we found an ambulance which was willing to take the body back,” said PC Michael Lalrinkima, general secretary of Mizoram Welfare Association, Chennai.“The ambulance, which charged around Rs 2 lakh for the trip, started past midnight on April 24 and reached Aizawl this afternoon. Vivian’s friend, Raphael, decided to accompany the body,” he added.There have been two other instances of people from Tripura, who were undergoing treatment in Chennai, returning back to their state in ambulances during the lockdown. Earlier this month, a couple journeyed over 3,000 kilometres to their hometown at Udaipur in Gomati district, 50 kilometres from Agartala.On Monday night, another ambulance from Chennai reached Kamalpur in Dhalai district of Tripura carrying the body of a 72-year cancer patient. The deceased, Mukul Chandra Dhar, had gone to Chennai in February for treatment. But when the lockdown started, Dhar decided to return, accompanied by his son and a relative. However, Dhar expired on the way.(With inputs from Priyanka Deb Barman in Agartala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-drivers-traverse-3-000-km-to-bring-back-body-of-mizo-youth-from-chennai-to-aizawl/story-9mnMh7v8yWdZ65IaidqFpI.html
29-04-2020||India||Plasma therapy is not a proven treatment: Govt||Plasma therapy, increasingly being seen as a magic bullet to cure critically ill Covid-19 patients, should only be done as a trial, and with all requisite approvals -- and not as a regular line of treatment, according to the Union health ministry.The therapy involves transfusion of antibody-rich plasma, a component of blood, from recovered patients of Covid-19 into those who are critically ill with the disease.Hospitals across several states have applied for permission to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for permission to start plasma therapy. As of Tuesday night, there were 7,761 recovered patients in India, some of whom have already donated plasma. On April 14, Max Healthcare’s Saket hospital, which had the permission on compassionate grounds, used plasma therapy on a Covid-19 patient in one of the first such instances in the country.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“ICMR is doing a pan-India study to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent therapy in critically ill Covid-19 patients, and until they come out with specific guidelines on it, no one should use it as a treatment modality for Covid-19 patients as it could not only be harmful but is also illegal,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry.ICMR, earlier this month, came out with a detailed document on the study model using plasma therapy, which has shown promise in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“It has been tried in China and other countries, and we wanted to see how it works in our population. Those who will be transfused convalescent plasma will be given( it) in a study mode. One should understand it is not to be given to everyone as a treatment modality. There is not adequate evidence yet on its efficacy, so there’s a need to generate more data. Those who want to be a part of this trial will have to seek Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation’s (CDSCO) approval,” said a senior ICMR official who asked not to be named. “ICMR currently has not approved plasma therapy. It’s approved in India only for trial and research purposes,” said Agarwal.ICMR, in its circular, said: “Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) is an experimental procedure for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Hospitals and institutions planning to provide this modality of treatment should do so in a clinical trial with protocols which are cleared by the Institutional Ethics Committee. The protocols should be registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India, and approved by Drugs Controller General of India, Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, and mechanisms to report adverse and serious adverse events to the CDSCO should be put in place.”The circular also asked health facilities interested in becoming trial sites to apply.The two main hospitals for trials that have already been approved as ICMR sites, and have begun trials about a week ago, are Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) and Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), both in Delhi; the two have recruited a total 20 patients for the study which will last three months.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi has also started receiving plasma donations to start trials. Other hospitals that want to administer plasma therapy to critically ill patients will need permission from CDSCO. The primary aim of such studies and trials is to check the proportion of patients remaining free of mechanical ventilation in both groups (those given convalescent plasma therapy and those not). The second one is to monitor, among other things, mortality in both the groups, duration of hospital stay, duration of intensive care unit stay, requirement of vasopressor (medicine to treat severely low blood pressure in critically ill patients) and days free of dialysis.Currently, no effective treatments are available for Covid-19. Convalescent plasma from recovered patients contains antibodies against Covid-19 , which may be beneficial for severely ill patients.As part of the study, doctors collect up to 500 ml Convalescent Plasma from a recovered patient after 14 days of recovery (and after two consecutive COVID-19 negative tests using the polymerase chain reaction test). Plasma collected from one recovered person can be given to two patients.“Delhi needs to have a bank of around 200 Covid-19 plasma donations; we cannot wait for a donation when a sick person comes to the hospital. Anybody who has recovered from the infection — meaning two consecutive samples have tested negative — and has completed two more weeks of quarantine can donate plasma. People who have recovered can donate plasma every seven to ten days,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, ILBS.All trial patients will receive either standard treatment (supportive therapy) with random donor plasma or convalescent plasma and standard treatment.Some hospitals have also sought permission to begin clinical trials at their hospital. “We have received an approval from the drugs controller of India for conducting clinical trials using plasma therapy for moderate to severe Covid-19 patients admitted at Max Healthcare. We got this approval yesterday and so far no patients have been enrolled in this study. Any further administration of this will be under the approved study,” said a spokesperson for Max Healthcare.The hospital administered convalescent plasma to a critically ill Covid-19 patient , who was on ventilator, on April 14. It sought and received approval on compassionate grounds.The patient recovered and was recently discharged. “…but it is important that we also understand that plasma therapy is no magic bullet. During the patient’s treatment at Max Hospital, Saket, other standard treatment protocols were followed and we can say that plasma therapy could have worked as a catalyst in speeding up his recovery. We cannot attribute 100% recovery to plasma therapy only, as there are multiple factors,” Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director – Max Healthcare, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-is-not-a-proven-treatment-govt/story-tWjSE5oNMixGXiOLvCJ1IM.html
29-04-2020||India||Virus may keep coming back every year: Experts||China’s top scientists on Tuesday said that Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), cannot be stopped and will continue to cause seasonal infections like the flu. The seasonal flu kills between 300,000 and 650,000 people around the world every year, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates.“This is very likely to be an epidemic that coexists with humans for a long time, becomes seasonal and is sustained within human bodies,” said Jin Qi, director of the Institute of Pathogen Biology at China’s apex medical research institute, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, according to Bloomberg News.Several scientists, including Anthony Fauci, the director of US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have said the new coronavirus is likely to cause seasonal peaks of infections in winter.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coveragePublic health experts in India agree that the Sars-Cov-2 is here to stay. “The virus is sure to be around because it has a high transmission rate and many asymptomatic people and those with mild disease remain undiagnosed but spread infection. Diseases spread by asymptomatic carriers are difficult to contain as everyone needs to use protection, which becomes difficult to sustain at the population level over a long period,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar.People with Covid-19 are the most infectious during the first week of symptoms, with 44% infections spread by those not obviously sick, according a study published in Nature Medicine on April 15, which explains why it is spreading faster than other coronaviruses, like Sars-CoV, which caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars). Sars-CoV directly enters the lungs and swiftly causes serious respiratory symptoms, leading to the person being hospitalised and isolated soon after getting infected. This limits the chances of the virus replicating in the throat and spreading to others. “These are two different viruses (Sars-CoV-2 and Sars -CoV), so their behaviour will be different. The host virus interaction properties are different. In Sars, there was only lung infection and it could spread when the infected person coughed, but in the case of Sars-CoV-2, the infection begins in the upper respiratory tract so you can infect even if you talk. The virus is in the nasopharyngeal fluid, which mixes with saliva, so you can infect when you sing, speak or shout. Silent transmission is common in this disease. So screening at airports for temperature was appropriate in case of Sars, but not for Sars-CoV-2,” said Dr Jacob John, veteran virologist and professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College.Sars-CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory tract before moving down to infect the lungs, which leads to people shedding huge amounts of the virus through coughing in the first week of symptoms, according to a study published in the journal Nature on April 1.“Its high infectiousness is one part of it but it will become seasonal because it will continue to infect people who don’t have immunity against it. How it will behave will be difficult to predict because all virus mutate, but it is difficult to predict what the impact of mutation will be on virulence and transmission,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research. “Everyone who gets infected and recovers develops immunity but to stop infections from recurring, we need long-lasting neutralising antibodies. We don’t know how long-lasting antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 are, but if we get a good vaccine that gives long-lasting immunity, then perhaps we can eradicate it...,”added Dr Kant.There are seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, four of which cause mild cold-like symptoms that are sharply seasonal and appear to transmit similarly to influenza, according to a study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Using data from the decade-long US Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation study, the researchers found most coronavirus cases were detected between December and April/May, and peaked in January/February. Only 2.5% of the cases occurred between June and September, according to the study.“A second wave is likely in November but by then countries would have gone though the first wave and health systems would have time to recover. In the post-Covid-19 world, social distancing, face masks and hand washing will also become a social reality until we get a vaccine,” said JVR Prasada Rao, former health secretary, Union ministry of health and director general, NACO.Hot weather is unlikely to have much of an impact, said Chinese scientists. “The virus is heat sensitive, but that’s when it’s exposed to 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes and the weather is never going to get that hot,” said Wang Guiqiang of Peking University First Hospital.“We have to wait and watch to see how the weather will affect the seasonal transmission of Sars-CoV-2,” said Dr Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virus-may-keep-coming-back-every-year-experts/story-x0btbvgjpR6bQZu5LeA6qN.html
29-04-2020||India||Covid cases climb to 31,000, spike puts deaths over 1,000||The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in India crossed the 30,000 mark on Tuesday while that of fatalities due to the pandemic exceeded 1,000, as the country maintained a precarious grip on a disease that officials fear could peak over the next couple of months.According data disclosed by state health departments, the total number of Covid-19 infections across India was 31,329 and deaths 1,007 on Tuesday, which recorded the biggest single-day jump in fatalities. Tuesday’s 74 deaths surpass the previous high -- 54 fatalities recorded on Monday -- by a significant margin.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe latest 10,000 infections came over a period of 7 days – a day less than it had taken for the tally to go from 10,000 to 20,000 – with Maharashtra and Gujarat continuing to report some of the biggest spikes even while under a lockdown that has disrupted everyday life at an unprecedented scale.The two states have a doubling rate for infections at 8.3 days and 8.8 days respectively. The overall doubling rate for the country is 10.8 days, down from 4 days at the beginning of the month.“If you look at some of the countries where cases are high, you will see twenty countries with the combined population as of India’s have 84 times more coronavirus cases,” said Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal at the government’s routine briefing on the crisis. But the outbreak appears to be turning particularly serious in the country’s financial capital Mumbai, which accounts for close to 6,000 of the 9,318 cases across the state as on Tuesday. Of the 393 new cases in the city, 41 were reported in Dharavi, a slum neighbourhood regarded as one of the most densely populated places in the world with close to a million residents.In Gujarat, 226 new infections were recorded on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases to 3,774 – behind Maharashtra’s 9,318 and ahead of Delhi’s 3,314.Globally, there are now close to 3.1 million who have been infected and roughly 213,000 of them have died due to the illness. At 57,000 fatalities, the United States is the hardest hit country followed by Italy (27,000 deaths) and Spain (23,000 deaths).India’s top health officials said the coming days will be the most crucial in determining which trajectory India follows, since some of the lockdown measures will be relaxed in areas that have not been hit hard by the disease. “The most important thing now to focus on is putting in place aggressive containment measures in identified hot spots, or what we call red zones, so that these (infections) don’t leak into green zones,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Guleria added that these measures will need to be paired with “aggressive behavioural change in terms of maintaining hand hygiene, wearing a mask, following cough etiquette” as a way of life for Indians. “The moment will come when we will have to lift lockdown, so we will have to prepare our strategy focusing on areas from where no cases have been reported and that can be opened up for commercial activities, and to ensure the red zones are converted to orange and then green zones,” he said.“We should manage to successfully segregate the zones, only then we can say the curve has truly been flattened, and will continue to remain that way,” he added. Flattening the curve refers to the strategy of bringing down new infections to match health care capacity, an approach particularly crucial for a disease like Covid-19 that has spread like wildfire in countries that dithered on announcing tough measures. The measures have also meant mounting economic losses. Financial analysts Moody’s Investors Services said in an assessment released on Tuesday that the near shutdown of economic activity could bring down India’s GDP growth rate to 0.2% in the current calendar year. “There are significant downside risks to our forecasts in the event that the pandemic is not contained and lockdowns have to be reinstated. Even without longer-duration lockdowns, a self-perpetuating dynamic could take hold, resulting in large-scale destruction of businesses and entire sectors, as well as a structurally high unemployment rate, a permanent loss of human capital, and persistent malaise in consumption and investment,” the rating agency said in its Global Macro Outlook update.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cases-climb-to-31-000-spike-puts-deaths-over-1-000/story-nThJOwdwG7tFkqRzBzAhWL.html
29-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India crossed the 30,000 case-count for Covid-19. On Tuesday night, the country’s tally stood at 31,329 cases, 1,007 dead, and 7,761 recovered.This comes exactly a week after it crossed the 20,000 mark. On April 21, the count was 20,004 cases, 644 dead, and 3,778 recovered.The country crossed the 10,000 mark on April 13; the count on that day was 10,444 cases, 355 dead and 1,191 recovered.The number of cases in India continues to grow, but the curve is not, by any stretch, an exponential one. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIndia has been testing more — 716,733 tests as on Tuesday — but the testing protocol is still skewed towards direct and indirect contacts of infected people. Still, the increased testing has already helped reduce the proportion of those testing positive to those tested (by around 0.6 percentage points, according to NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant). That is bound to happen as the number of tests increases.The actual proportion of people infected is likely to be even lower than the current 4.1% (a number put out by the NITI CEO) — just as the actual number of people infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, is likely to be much higher. Indeed, with almost seven out every 10 people infected being asymptomatic (as of a week ago, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research), it would be surprising if it weren’t. Still, no one in the government, NITI, or the Indian Council of Medical Research will accept this — perhaps because they think it makes the country look bad.It doesn’t.As this column has repeatedly pointed out (citing worldometers.info ), 97% of the cases in the world are mild and India is no exception.The real number to worry about is the fatality rate as measured by the proportion of those who die to those testing positive, and also the overall number of deaths. Given that the actual number of cases in India is definitely higher than the reported number, the country’s fatality rate is certain to be lower than the 3.17% it was on Monday night. This number is much lower than the global fatality rate of 6.9%, although that proportion is skewed by the high death rates (all double digits) in countries such as Spain, Italy, France, the UK, and Iran. Even in the US, which accounts for almost a third of all cases, the number is a high 5.6%. To be sure, the same logic that applies to India, applies to these countries too — their actual fatality rates will be much lower.While it’s important to keep fatalities down to a minimum, this writer isn’t suggesting that we stop looking at the number of cases. Given that Covid-19 infects and kills in clusters, it is imperative that India gets its response right in regions with a high prevalence of the disease. On Tuesday, NITI pointed out that around 60% of Covid-19 cases in India are from 15 districts, with seven accounting for 47%. Three cities, Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad account for a third.India’s ability to deal with the situation in these three cities will prepare it for the challenge ahead — at least till a vaccine for the virus is discovered (the Oxford candidate continues to make good progress and if the trial is successful, the world could have a vaccine by September). A team of Chinese scientists has said that it believes the Sars-CoV-2 virus will not vanish the way the Sars-CoV virus, which caused Sars, did, but return in waves, much like the common flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-pQxY1cBenNNCTj5NTWHkWJ.html
29-04-2020||India||Domestic makers of rapid kits in a fix as ICMR halts their use||Local manufacturers of antibody based rapid testing kits (RTKs) for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), whose kits were validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and approved by the Central Drugs Standard Organisation (CDSCO), seem to be grappling with a sense of uncertainty as they are yet to receive any orders from the ICMR. To make matters worse, on Monday, ICMR asked states to return RTKs sourced from China after its field assessment found them to be showing too much variation in results -- and while doing so, did not say anything at all about its future plans regarding RTKs. To be sure, some states had been directly trying to source RTKs, including from some domestic manufacturers.  CDSCO has approved RTKs made by six local companies. Antibody tests are done using a person’s blood, and results are available in 30 minutes to an hour as opposed to the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests that take about five hours. Still, the latter are the gold standard for diagnosis of Covid-19; the antibody tests are largely used to measure prevalence of a disease, according to experts. ICMR , on April 11, invited a techno-commercial offer for procurement of 4.5 million RTKs, with a tight deadline. However, even those who were not rejected by the council are yet to hear from it. “We applied for the tender, and even though our bid wasn’t rejected, we are yet to hear from them. It is a little confusing. They haven’t placed orders yet. The states somehow seem more proactive in their approach, and we are also getting several export queries,” says Prateek Mittal, director, marketing, Medsource Ozone Biomedicals Pvt Ltd.“This uncertainty will be counterproductive to cost efficiency. The cost can come down at even half the volumes given to the Chinese,” he added. ICMR placed an order for 550,000 RTKs with two Chinese companies; these are the kits it has now asked states to return. Medsource is approved by both ICMR and CDSCO to manufacture rapid tests kits, and has started production; its peak capacity is 115,000 kits in a day.“We can ramp up but since there is no clarity on procurement right now we don’t want to do that just yet. In these difficult times we are making investments but this uncertainty is quite challenging,” said Mittal.Gurugram-based SD Bio Sensor, another company with requisite approvals, is also waiting to hear from the research body as the manufacturers say their first priority is to produce for ICMR.“ ICMR has taken samples of our kits for further testing, and we are waiting to hear from them. We are sure though that our sample will pass the test as our company has already been exporting kits to US/UK etc. About 80% of the manufacturing already happens in South Korea and we just finish the product here,” said Punit Kumar, deputy manager, regulatory affairs.The company can make 100,000 RTKs a day and can scale it up to double the quantity. “We have about 300,000 kits already in our warehouse, and even Haryana procured about 25,000 of our rapid testing kits. Let’s see what ICMR says,” he added.Even the government-owned HLL Lifecare is yet to receive an order from ICMR. “We have 2 lakh rapid test kits ready, and can produce one lakh kits in a week,” said an official at the company who asked not to be identified.Surat (Gujarat) based Voxtur Bio Ltd, another approved company, has begun production with a capacity of manufacturing 10 million kits in a month. Two of the six companies, Vanguard Diagnostics and ImmunoScience India, are still in the process of beginning production. “We did not apply for the ICMR tender because of the strict timeline for deliver,” said Atul Tarde, CEO, ImmunoScience India.“The tender is open for all, and those who qualify will get an equal opportunity,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, the spokesperson for ICMR. Experts believe it makes sense to encourage local manufacturing. “Stop relying on China; we should encourage Indian manufacturers,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-makers-of-rapid-kits-in-a-fix-as-icmr-halts-their-use/story-R0F0oGJisyWDy9JsfIOC4M.html
29-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: States assess mild cases to begin home-isolation||After the Centre on Monday released guidelines allowing mild or pre-symptomatic coronavirus cases to be home-quarantined, state governments have been directed to start assessing patients. Medical officer in state Covid-19 hospitals and district surveillance officers will take a call on whether a patient should be isolated at home. A patient with mild or pre-Covid-19 symptoms will be allowed home quarantine provided he or she lives in a place that allows strict isolation without having to intermingle with the rest of the family and a caregiver is present p 24*7 who is in direct touch with a nearby Covid-19 hospital.Under the guidelines, the patient would have to agrees to his or her health condition monitored, and report by telephone to the district surveillance officer on a daily basis, among other preconditions.The patient will have to sign an undertaking of strict compliance with the do’s and don’ts. Experts say there was no need to wait this long for letting asymptomatic patients to be isolated at home.“I am a big believer of keeping mildly infected {people} at home. It should have been done much earlier as in about 90% of the cases I would say symptoms are self-limiting, which means these will get better on their own. However, regular telephonic contact is a must so that at anytime if the patient’s condition deteriorates then they can be rushed to the nearest hospital,” says Dr T Jacob John, former head of virology department at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.As per the assessment made by the medical officer, a patient is categorised as very mild or mild, moderate or severe, and admitted to a Covid care centre, a dedicated Covid health centre or a dedicated Covid hospital.A Covid care centre, for mild or asymptomatic patients, is a facility created in hotels, hostels, lodges and even makeshift structures. “Instead of these facilities, a pre-symptomatic patient will be allowed to remain at home. But the patient has to strictly adhere to the norms,” said a senior health ministry official.The caregiver of the patient, and close family contacts, will have to take the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic under the supervision of a medical officer.Downloading the Arogya Setu app and keeping it on at all times is a prerequisite for allowing home isolation for positive cases.Meanwhile, Union health secretary Preeti Sudan on Tuesday turned tough on hospitals which are turning away non-Covid patients, or insisting on them getting a Covid-19 test done before treatment. “All health services should remain functional during the lockdown,” Sudan wrote in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-states-assess-mild-cases-to-begin-home-isolation/story-dUo59CfOyCpfU4pz164TNJ.html
29-04-2020||India||Govt leverages MGNREGS to strengthen rural infrastructure||The sharp focus on creating individual assets in MGNREGS over the years has presented the government an opportunity to leverage the flagship job scheme in this pandemic when millions of migrant labourers are stuck at home.Just two types of activities—construction (on individual land) and sanitation works—are earmarked for 69% of the total work under MGNREGS for this financial year, government data has shown. “These activities”, according to a rural ministry official, “perfectly suits us to allot work to large number of workers and meet a demand surge as constructing a house or a toilet requires hardly one to three workers.”The construction activities on individual land are mostly for building houses for the poor under PMAY(G). MGNREGS beneficiaries can work for up to 90 days to build a house and as a part of the Swachh Bharat programme, there is a boom in construction of toilets and waste management in rural India.As per the latest data on work status for FY20-21, 50% of the work under MGNREGS is for construction of individual properties and 19% are sanitation-related. There is also heavy demand for water conservation and renovation of traditional water bodies. The Union rural development ministry wants to complete 4.8 million houses in this year.Last week, union rural development and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar met his state counterparts through a video conference to discuss how to scale up key flagship schemes such as MGNREGS, the rural housing scheme, rural roads programme and the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).Tomar told the states that the resources should be used to “strengthen rural infrastructure, create employment in rural areas and facilitate diversification of rural livelihoods.”The government has already released around ₹36,000 Crore to the States/UTs in the current financial year, including ₹ 33,300 Crore under MGNREGS to quickly pay all dues and help states start new work in this financial year.Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra pointed out that the government needs to step up its activities to maximise the MGNREGS potentials. “There are 2.5 lakh gram panchayats in India. Work couldn’t have started in all GPs due to Covid restrictions and containment zones.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-leverages-mgnregs-to-strengthen-rural-infrastructure/story-nDjwDIKbun1fp6fGgWjcXL.html
29-04-2020||India||Kerala-made Covid testing kit awaits approval two weeks on||A Covid-19 testing kit developed at Thiruvananthapuram’s Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCIMST) has been awaiting approval for two weeks from regulatory bodies, scientists involved in the development said on Tuesday. Experts have underlined that the approval should be speeded up as India needs to ramp up testing to effectively deal with the pandemic when the Centre has asked states to return the rapid test kits sourced from China. The Centre’s move came on Monday days after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) evaluated the Chinese kits after huge variations in their results were reported.The scientists said the kit is less expensive and more accurate than the polymerase chain reaction testing kits. They said the kit is called ‘Chitra Gene LAMP N’. Scientists called it “highly confirmatory” for the Covid-19 diagnosis and added the kit detects the N-Gene of the SARS CoV 2, which causes the disease. “Sree Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, an institute of national importance, of India@DST, has developed a diagnostic kit that can confirm #Covid 19 in two hours at a low cost,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted on April 18. Experts have underlined that regulatory agencies across the world have eased processes and that the ICMR should follow suit. “Mere lockdown would not do any good. We have to speed up tests during these days,” said former Christian Medical College (Vellore) principal Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who represents Thiruvananthapuram in Parliament, has criticised regulatory bodies for delaying the approval for the kit developed at SCIMST. “Many imported Chinese kits are found to be faulty... rather than clinging on to technicalities... the ICMR should give permission to indigenously developed kits,” he said in a Facebook post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-made-covid-testing-kit-awaits-approval-two-weeks-on/story-jNDfASgM58cAB05jhE3QqJ.html
29-04-2020||India||China says unfair to label its test kits faulty||China on Tuesday expressed concern about the Indian Council of Medical Research’s decision to stop using rapid antibody testing kits made by two Chinese firms, saying their products meet quality standards and are exported to many other countries. “The quality of medical products exported from China is prioritised. It is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as ‘faulty’ and look at issues with pre-emptive prejudice,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement .The statement came a day after ICMR, which plays a key role in advising authorities engaged in the fight against Covid-19, said state governments should stop using rapid antibody testing kits from Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics after several states found huge variations in the results, and after its own field assessment exercise. Ji said: “We are deeply concerned with the evaluation results and the decision made by ICMR.”Both Wondfo and Livzon, she said, have clarified that their testing kits had been certified by China’s National Medical Products Administration, meet the quality standards of China and importing countries, and have also been validated and approved by ICMR through the National Institute of Virology (NIV). “The Covid-19 antibody rapid test kits produced by these two Chinese companies have been exported to and well recognised in many countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America,” she added.Ji further said Beijing hopes New Delhi “could respect China’s goodwill and sincerity, strengthen communication timely with relevant Chinese companies based on facts, and resolve [the matter] reasonably and properly”.She said there are strict requirements for the storage, transportation and use of rapid antibody testing kits. Ji described viruses as a common enemy of mankind and said China will continue to support India’s efforts in fighting Covid-19, strengthen medical and health cooperation, and jointly work to overcome difficulties to safeguard the safety of people in both countries.India has placed orders for hundreds of thousands of testing kits and millions of PPE kits with Chinese firms. However, several state governments reported wide variations in the results produced by kits from Wondfo and Livzon.The ICMR stressed in a statement issued on Monday that rapid antibody testing kits should be used only for surveillance, and said it evaluated the kits from Wondfo and Livzon in field conditions. “In view of this, states are advised to stop using these kits and return them,” the statement added.A separate Indian government statement said orders from the two Chinese firms were cancelled as their kits were “underperforming”. Wondfo reacted to ICMR’s decision by saying it was “surprised and disappointed” as its “one of the first tests to receive an import licence from India, and has been validated and approved by the ICMR through NIV||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-says-unfair-to-label-its-test-kits-faulty/story-v37UbLIMGkUtdX61cuWkDM.html
29-04-2020||India||Museums, zoos, science centres take the online route||With no visitors because of the Covid-19 lockdown, science centres, zoos, and museums across India are opening up their galleries and enclosures through virtual means for the people to see them while staying at home.While some are hosting live streaming of animals 24x7, others are allowing people to take virtual walk-throughs of the museum galleries. Others are organising sky observation programs, where visitors can log in to observe celestial events like the Super Pink Moon, which appeared on April 8.Last week, the Alipore Zoo in Kolkata, the oldest in India, launched an app to help people take virtual tours. People can have panoramic view of the zoo, check photos and videos in enclosures with a voice-over option to know more about a particular animal they are interested in.The Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai was the first in India to start live streaming of animals in their enclosures almost two years ago. Its webpage is now getting almost 60,000-80,000 views daily. “The page views have increased several times because of the lockdown. We now have live streaming of 14 species. There are 180 cameras installed in the zoo and animal enclosures. For the lockdown, we have added an extra feature in which we focus on one animal at a time. Say for example, an elephant enjoying a shower,” said Sudha Ramen, deputy director of the zoo.Even though the pan-India lockdown had started on March 25, almost every zoo and museum had closed down much before that.The Indian Museum, the oldest and largest multi-purpose museum in India, is going to launch a virtual walk-through very soon, said its director-in-charge Arijit Dutta Choudhury. The museum has a mummy which is 4,000- year-old. “For now, people can see some of the most important collections, some of which are a few thousand years old,” he said.And it is not just the galleries and enclosures. Science museums and centres are also holding live shows and competitions too. “The lockdown came as a new challenge for the National Council of Science Museums which has a network of 25 science museums and centres spread across the country. We decided not only to make people aware of coronavirus but also started organising various online programs and activities to connect with the visitors,” said SN Singh, spokesman. Since the lockdown began, various science museums and centres have opened their galleries online. There have been panel discussions on Covid-19, celebrations of commemorative days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/museums-zoos-science-centres-take-the-online-route/story-9QE8pgrFeXxKWe2rWgrGLP.html

The ministry of external affairs organises the pilgrimage to Mount Kailash in Tibet each year through two different routes -- Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand and Nathu La Pass in Sikkim. The north-eastern state announced last week that it will not host the pilgrimage this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Kumaun Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVM) officials, who take care of the yatra route through Uttarakhand, said they might not have enough time to remove snow deposits from the pilgrimage route. “With rain and snowfall continuing intermittently on many stretches of the yatra route since December, it could take more than a fortnight time to remove the snow deposits”, said a KMVN official said on condition of anonymity. Another official of the nodal agency said they still haven’t been informed by the central government about whether the yatra is scheduled for this year or not. “No agency involved in preparation of the yatra had been given any sort of instructions by the Union ministry this year. So there is uncertainty whether the yatra will be held this year or not,” the official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kailash-mansarovar-yatra-shrouded-in-uncertainty/story-f5IUBx38MTmyoYYdAbl0KK.html
29-04-2020||India||Two priests killed in UP’s Bulandshahr||Two priests of a Shiva temple in Bulandshahr’s Pagauna village were found murdered on Tuesday morning.Hours later, the police said it had arrested a youth in connection with the case.“We have arrested Murari aka Raju, a Dalit man, on charges of killing two priests. The accused is a habitual drug (bhang) addict. He has confessed to his crime and described the killing as “Bhagwan ki Ichchha” (wish of God),” said Atul Kumar Chaube, circle officer of Anoopshahar police area. “The accused had no enmity with the sadhus but a few villagers claimed he had an altercation with them over a chimta (tongs) which was stolen a day before.” The bodies of Jagdish aka Rangidas, 55, and his disciple Sher Singh, 46, have been sent for the postmortem. “A wooden staff was used in the killing and no cut wounds were found on bodies. The accused has confessed that he used a wooden staff to kill the sadhus,” said Bulandshahr district magistrate Ravindra Kumar. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has sought a detailed report from senior officials .Village head Dinesh Kumar said the police’s version is unreliable as the bodies bore cut wounds, which appeared to have been inflicted by some sharp-edged weapon. Local Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders also did not find the police claims convincing. “Can a drug addict kill two middle-aged sadhus using a wooden staff?” asked VHP leader Rajkumar Dunger while accusing the police of diverting the issue by dragging a Dalit into it.The incident comes more than a week after two sadhus and their driver were lynched by a mob outside Gadhchinchale village, 110 kilometre from Palghar in Maharashtra. They were attacked on the suspicion of being child-lifters.The opposition leaders attacked the ruling BJP over the incident. Congress general secretary in charge of UP, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said the case should not politicised. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke to Yogi, expressing his concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-priests-killed-in-up-s-bulandshahr/story-dYmlgAVNi6sN3VrNOAidWK.html
29-04-2020||India||Give $1trn for green recovery: Prakash Javadekar to developed countries||Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar has called for a grant of $1 trillion to developing countries immediately for a green economic recovery in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.He said this at the 11th session of the Petersburg Climate Dialogue on April 27 and 28. The event was co-chaired by Germany and the UK, and witnessed the participation of 30 countries. The aim was to facilitate discussions among high-level government officials over measures that could pave the way for a green recovery from the current economic crisis.Javadekar stressed making climate technology open source, or made available at an affordable cost. “Covid-19 has taught us that we can survive on less. The world must think of adopting more sustainable consumption patterns in line with requirement of sustainable lifestyles, as was first mooted by PM Narendra Modi at the Paris Conference of Parties (2015).” He added that the world has an opportunity to accelerate renewable energy and create jobs in the sector.India and other developing countries have been demanding action on a pre-2020 commitment of developed nations of mobilising $100 billion by this year for mitigation and adaptation. In a webinar organised by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences on April 22, Javadekar said: “In 2009, the world had agreed that developed countries will mobilise $100 billion every year for climate adaptation and mitigation. Its been 11 years and the amount is $1 trillion now. Where is the money? There is no money on the table.”At the Petersburg Dialogue, UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said in a video message: “The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the fragilities of our economy to shocks such as disease or climate disruption. Countries have committed to enhance their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and longterm strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This commitment must be maintained. G20 countries must lead by example.”The Petersburg Dialogue is crucial because the UN climate negotiations (COP26) to be held in Glasgow has been deferred in view of Covid-19. Countries were to submit enhanced NDCs in line with the Paris Agreement at Glasgow. Only four countries have submitted updated NDCs while 181 countries haven’t updated their NDCs. Without ambitious NDCs, the global average temperature is expected to rise by 3-5 degrees C over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.Most scientists and environmentalists are worried about a rebound effect of the current economic crisis with economies investing in polluting sectors to come out of the slowdown. “I am concerned about global economic crisis than I am about delaying this year’s COP. If the economy tanks, climate action may be delayed in the interest of getting people back to work. I hope we put people back to work in green energy and technology, sectors that will result in lasting change,” Rob Jackson, Professor, Stanford and Chair, Global Carbon Project, told HT in an interview earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-1trn-for-green-recovery-prakash-javadekar-to-developed-countries/story-D3I5rGGU7XuvogOwhGdaSN.html
29-04-2020||India||India slams USCIRF report claiming it targets minorities||The government rejected on Tuesday a recommendation by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) that the Trump administration add India to a list of countries seen as systematic and egregious violators and sanction Indian government agencies and officials responsible for it.The USCIRF cited the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslim refugees fleeing persecution, and “nationwide campaigns of violence against religious minorities” as its reasons.“We reject the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report. Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new,” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. “But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels... We regard it as an organisation of particular concern and will treat it accordingly.” The commission has recommended that the US designate India a “Country of Particular Concern” for “engaging in...religious freedom violations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slams-uscirf-report-on-religious-freedom-violations/story-FqbIafgWH4MkkQR68QMp1O.html
29-04-2020||India||Elgar Parishad case: NIA expands scope of its probe||Expanding the scope of its probe into the December 2017 Elgar Parishad conclave, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has started looking at whether the 11 activists arrested in the case were involved in raising funds (for anti-national activities), brainwashing educated youth in urban centres, made international visits to get support from different organizations abroad, launched misinformation campaigns against the government , and met with overground Maoist leaders, two officials familiar with development told HT.The probe by NIA also focuses on student leaders in various universities and non-government organizations that extended support to the activists.Nine activists, Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira and Sudha Bhardwak were arrested and chargesheet by Pune Police in 2018 in the case while two others, Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha were arrested earlier this month by NIA. Most are currently in judicial custody. “While Pune police has already filed two charge sheets in Bhima Koregaon incident, our probe focuses on unearthing the whole network of activists and frontal organizations working with them including student unions, youth organizations, lawyers’ groups, tribal bodies and NGOs. The source of funding, both in India and abroad, different events/activities organized by them will be identified and stopped,” said the first official.Senior advocate Mihir Desai, who appears for Teltumbde and Gonsalves said: “All the charges are false and baseless. Pune police too has been saying this for two years that they are looking at larger conspiracy but there was no mention in its charge sheets.”Advocate Rohan Nahar, who appears for Varavara Rao and Rona Wilson, said: “The police and now NIA are going on a wild goose chase...there is no case at hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-expands-scope-of-its-probe/story-5oTRtNnVpVEagFpS5e4RpJ.html
29-04-2020||India||Only 3 districts in Gujarat are Covid-free; virus tally at 3,774||As many as 30 out of Gujarat’s 33 districts have reported Covid-19 cases with Ahmedabad being the worst-hit in the state. Ahmedabad accounted for 2,554 of Gujarat’s 3,774 cases as of Tuesday when 226 more people were diagnosed with the disease. In Maharashtra, which has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases, 30 out of 36 districts have been hit by the pandemic. Covid-19 cases have been reported from 25 of the 52 districts in Madhya Pradesh.Ahmedabad reported the highest number of new cases (164) on Tuesday followed by Vadodara (15) and Surat (14) and took the total number of the cases in the three districts to 2,543, 570, and 255.All 19 fatalities were reported from Ahmedabad since Monday and took the death toll from the pandemic in the state to 181. “Fifteen of the deceased were suffering from comorbid conditions,” said Gujarat’s principal secretary (health) Jayanthi Ravi. He said there is no reason to worry as the spread has not been as fast as reported from other countries. Dr Parthiv Mehta, a pulmonologist, said comorbidity was one of the reasons for the higher mortality. “Gujarat has the highest number of people with diabetes, heart diseases, obesity, high blood pressure. Most of the deceased had comorbidities so that is why we can say that people in the state are not dying because of Covid-19 but instead dying with it,” said Mehta.Mehta said another reason for higher mortality is the prevalence of L strain of the Covid-19 instead of the S in Gujarat. “What I can predict is that while S strain was majorly prevalent in Kerala, L is more prevalent in Gujarat. So mostly the old aged people with comorbidities with this L-strain are succumbing to the virus more. Also, another reason behind the high number of cases is the number of tests the state government is doing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-3-districts-in-gujarat-are-covid-free-virus-tally-at-3-774/story-nsKQTDntKdfVbVopZblElN.html
29-04-2020||India||MP minister says Jamaat event led to spike in cases; tally rises to 2,387||Madhya Pradesh health minister Narottam Mishra on Tuesday blamed the attendees of a congregation at Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Delhi that later emerged a Covid-19 hotspot for the growing cases of the disease in the state.“Jamaat people mingled with people so deep that when our teams went to localities to identify people suffering from Covid-19, they were attacked with stones. People beat our doctors and spat on them intentionally. This resulted in a delay [in identifying and treating Covid patients] and the virus spread to other areas too,” said Mishra.Madhya Pradesh has drawn flak for its handling of the pandemic and is among the states, where the Centre has deputed interministerial teams to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control the disease.Mishra blamed the attendees on a day when the number of Covid-19 cases in the state rose to 2,387 while the virus spread to 31 of the Madhya Pradesh’s 52 districts.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has also blamed Tablighi Jamaat for spreading of the virus in the state.Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said the government has blamed the group to divert attention from its failures. “Let there be a review of the situation by an independent expert or experts. If the team’s finding is same as that of the government, then the government can say with authority that any particular group is responsible.”Another public health expert, SR Azad, said the problem with the government’s approach from day one has been that it did not look beyond certain localities and groups to check the spread of the disease. “Hence, the measures expected to be undertaken were not taken like increase in number of labs, more testing, more surveys and screening...”Azad said the first four Covid-19 cases were reported from Jabalpur and they were not Jamaat members. “They had a travel history. In Bhopal, more than 100 officials and personnel of health department were infected. It was not because of any Jamaat member.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-minister-says-jamaat-event-led-to-spike-in-cases-tally-rises-to-2-387/story-hShogWwl6u54a9J5MoDSXJ.html
29-04-2020||India||Stuck in camps, uncertainty keeps labourers on the edge||As uncertainty mires the return of millions of migrant workers in the absence of Central guidelines, disquiet and anger are simmering in the shelter homes where the workers have been housed since the end of March.On Monday, several chief ministers asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to issue guidelines allowing the states to bring back the migrant workers.Close to five million workers would have to be brought back to their respective states, as per the data collected by the state governments till Tuesday afternoon. The states have demanded special trains to bring these workers back. These workers will be kept in special quarantine homes being set up at state borders and at district headquarters. Pinky, 29, has been at the Gandhi Nagar shelter home in Jaipur since March 29 and is waiting to meet her four-year-old daughter at Etawah, Uttar Pradesh. She, along with her family members, were working at a cloth mill in Bhilwara, and were brought to shelter home, when they were walking back home on March 29.“My daughter with her uncle and others reached Etawah,” she said, hoping that the UP government will send buses to take them home as the state did for workers in Haryana. “I just want to go back home,” she said.She is not alone. Many from UP at the shelter home have registered themselves with the government helpline for migrant workers stranded in other states. UP plans to bring back a million workers from other states.Chandradeo Singh, 22, who went to Mangalore from Jharkhand’s Latehar to earn a livelihood, is stuck there, along with five others. “We have exhausted all the money. Workers are not taking packets of cooked food for fear of being infected by coronavirus,” he said. He wants to know if the Jharkhand government bring them back home. “Even if the government withdraws the lockdown, we do not have bus or train fare to reach to Latehar.” Back home, his wife said the family of six was surviving on boiled food. “We get PDS ration but we do not have money to buy even vegetables or other items to cook food,” she said.The Jharkhand government’s helpline for stranded workers has registered 9,48,135 workers, from close to 15,000 places across India, all of whom want to return to their home state.Anil Sethi, 37, is among 4.9 lakh workers from Odisha who have registered with the state government portal for stranded workers outside the state. In Bangalore, Sethi, a plumber, queues up at the food centre for three hours every day, to be ladled out some tomato rice, which, he says, is not enough for five workers from Odisha, who are sharing a room. “Whatever money I saved has been spent for buying food. I called the Odisha government helpline after which local NGO persons came and gave us 2 kg rice, 500 gram flour, 250 gram rice and a cabbage for the five of us. How long can five people survive on that?” he asked. Before the lockdown, Sethi used earn Rs 400 a day and used to send half of the money back home. “I never said no to any work despite not keeping well. I have two daughters at home. So I had no other way than to work hard,” he said.Nirmal Kumar, was among the five workers. He had decided to walk back from a shelter home in Gurugram to their village in Purnia in Bihar. “We got food thrice a day in a shelter, but we want to return at any cost,” Kumar, 23, said. However, their journey was short-lived as they caught by police in Ghitorni in Delhi and put in a shelter. “The government has failed to feel our pain,” said another worker from Purnia, Bambam Kumar, 22. Arvind, 47, a worker from Bihar’s Samastipur, said he came to Ludhiana two months ago to work in the agriculture fields. “I came here to earn something but I am sitting idle now,” he said.Around 15 lakh migrant workers from Bihar are in Mumbai, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi and Haryana. The Bihar government has refused to bring them back unless the Central government gives a go-ahead. The state government has announced special assistance of Rs 1000 through the Direct Benefit Transfer system to migrant workers. “We have also received 25 lakh applications seeking Rs 1,000 assistance announced by the state government and have transferred the amount through DBT mode into the accounts of 15 lakh people so far,” chief minister Nitish Kumar said.Like Kumar, Jharkhand chief minister, Hemant Soren, has requested PM Modi to direct the Union home ministry to relax the interstate travel ban so that migrant workers and students stuck in other states could be brought back. The government has transferred Rs 1,000 each to about a lakh workers, state labour department officials said.The Rajasthan government has started bringing back migrant workers from other states. The CM has got other states on board to get migrant workers from Rajasthan back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stuck-in-camps-uncertainty-keeps-labourers-on-the-edge/story-Rs2U9qEyWG7af1hlRP9bRN.html
29-04-2020||India||300 booked, 5 held for ‘rioting’ in Surat||Five people were detained and another 300 booked on Tuesday for alleged rioting and violation of the Covid-19 lockdown after migrant workers clashed with police personnel in Gujarat’s Surat.Police said the trouble began around 7 am when police personnel on duty in Thakor Nagar objected to some workers roaming around in a local market. “A few labourers were roaming around without any reason. When policemen on patrol asked them to stay indoors and follow the lockdown restrictions, they got angry and started throwing stones. Later, some locals and the stone pelters started arguing with the police,” said inspector H M Chouhan of the Dindoli police station.Chouhan said an additional police force was rushed to the spot and the dispute was resolved after an hour-long standoff. “However, one head constable identified as Kamlesh Choudhary got injured and a police vehicle was damaged,” Chouhan said.This is the third violent incident reported from Surat involving migrant workers since the lockdown was imposed last month to check the Covid-19 spread.On April 11, 81 migrant workers, mostly from Odisha, were arrested in Surat for rioting and violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The workers allegedly resorted to violence after many of them were not paid their salaries for March and also denied permission to return to their homes. Over 90 migrant workers were arrested on March 30 in Surat for attacking police after they were not allowed to return to their native places.The lockdown left tens of thousands of migrant workers jobless and promoted many of them to return to their homes including on foot from bigger cities. The exodus prompted the Centre to ask the states and Union territories to seal their borders for non-essential travel and look after the stranded migrant workers in relief camps. But many workers have gathered in places like Mumbai and Surat demanding that they be allowed to return to their homes even as the Centre has allowed gradual restart of the economy outside the Covid-19 hotspots since the lockdown was extended this month until May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/300-booked-5-held-for-rioting-in-surat/story-9Skj36XlvxO4mP2PDXOJJI.html
29-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Customs hearings to be held via video conference||The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has issued detailed guidelines for its offices to conduct hearings on customs related matters via video conference (VC) with the consent of the appellant or respondent to ensure speedy disposal of cases while observing social distancing norms to check the spread of Covid-19.“With an aim to create a virtual Customs working environment, ensuring #SocialDistancing, reduce physical presence & usage of ICT systems, CBIC issues guidelines for conduct of personal hearings in virtual mode under Customs Act, 1962,” CBIC tweeted on Tuesday.According to the guidelines, the new system would also facilitate importers, exporters, passengers, advocates, tax practitioners and authorised representatives to maintain social distancing while performing their work at ease, from a place of their choice.Persons participating in video conference should also be appropriately dressed and maintain the required decorum, the guidelines said.The guidelines are part of the government’s ongoing reforms -- ‘turant’ (instant) customs -- such as online query module, eSanchit, web based goods registration, electronic processing of licenses, machine release of imported goods based on customs compliance verification and electronic transmission of PDF-based first copy of bill of entry (BoE) to customs brokers and registered importers, a finance ministry official said requesting anonymity.Rahul Shukla, executive director, indirect tax , at consultancy firm PwC said, “Shift to virtual environment for hearings, etc. by CBIC is a welcome move not only from COVID 19 response perspective but one more step towards a faceless customs. Hopefully, this will help expeditious clearances of pending matters with minimal glitches.”Chartered accountant Kapil Rana said conducting personal hearings in the virtual mode is in sync with the changed the way of doing business. “During the pandemic, the business is not happening or happening at a very slow pace, utilising this time to clear of all the pending cases is a fantastic move. By this, the department will be able to clear of the pending cases and also the cases live CVD refund, custom duty refund, and other refunds will be also cleared and released which will help business during this crunch time,” he said.The government has already announced permitting electronic submission of documents from March 15 to expedite import of goods, particularly raw materials such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that will immensely help the industry in conducting business amidst Covid-19 pandemic.“Turant” is an ongoing exercise of CBIC to expedite its systems and processes. It was introduced in February last year as a next generation reform to push up India’s position in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (EODB) Index where ‘trading across borders’ is a critical component for evaluation of a country’s performance, according to a February 28, 2019 CBIC circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-hearings-to-be-held-via-video-conference/story-Xfq6DRsQiyIDgfvNDKKlQI.html
29-04-2020||India||Missed childhood vaccinations trigger worry||Children missing out on life-saving vaccines could lead to a resurgence of potentially fatal diseases, such as childhood pneumonias, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and diarrhoea, among others, which threaten to reverse the gains India has made by immunising children against vaccine-preventing illnesses to bring down its infant mortality rate (IMR) from 33 per 1,000 live births in 2017 from 34 the year before.IMR, which is the number deaths per 1,000 live births in the first year of life, is a crude indicator of the overall health of a country. India is inching closer towards the Sustainable Development Goal of bringing IMR down to 25 or fewer by 2030. Its current IMR being roughly a fourth of 129 infant deaths in 1971, according to the Sample Registration System (SRS) data released in June 2019, but deaths may rise if childhood vaccines are missed.Many states in India have halted immunisation activities because of the national lockdown and community health workers are being asked to help with Covid-19 surveillance and contact tracing, which leaves them with no time to visit homes to immunise a children in rural areas.“While the world strives to develop a new vaccine for Covid-19 at record speed, we must not risk losing the fight to protect everyone, everywhere, against vaccine-preventable diseases. These diseases will come roaring back if we do not vaccinate,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general, World Health Organization (WHO).With city hospitals and clinics suspending immunisation services till the lockdown is lifted, text messages received by paediatricians from concerned parents have shot up. “We assure parents that services will be resumed as soon as the is lockdown lifted, but still queries keep coming. We used to send reminders for vaccination dates, which have also been suspended, but all pending appointments will be addressed on priority as soon as things get back to normal. Children must be kept safe, from Covid-19 and all other diseases,” said Dr Krishnan Chugh, director, department of paediatrics, Fortis Healthcare.The WHO also recommends that if immunisation services are suspended, urgent catch-up vaccinations should be rescheduled as soon as possible, prioritising those most at risk.Parents seeking information on vaccination have made paediatrics the fastest growing speciality on online health portals, such as Practo, which registered a 350% growth for paediatrics on its eConsult platform since March 1. The top queries were to do with cough and cold, affect of delayed vaccination, and fever and headache in toddlers, according to the e-health platform.“The health ministry has written to states twice asking them to continue routine immunisation, coverage of which is close to 90% but now risks falling rapidly. In rural areas, most children receive essential vaccines through government outreach using Ashas (accredited social health activist, or community health workers), who are now engaged in Covid-19 surveillance and community awareness programmes. If immunisation services stop, India risks losing gains it has made in lowering child mortality,” said the official with the Union health ministry, requesting anonymity.One in five of the world’s 5.9 million under-5 deaths take place in India, with more than half being from vaccine-preventable and treatable infections, such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and sepsis. If all children are vaccinated after birth, more than half these lives could be saved.In 2018, the last year for which global data is available, 86% of children under the age of five globally were vaccinated with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) and one dose of the measles vaccine, up from 72% in 2000 and 20% in 1980, but an estimated 13 million children never receive any vaccines, putting them at risk of disease and death, according to the WHO.“The stakes have never been higher. As Covid-19 continues to spread globally, our life-saving work to provide children with vaccines is critical. With disruptions in immunization services due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the fates of millions of young lives hang in the balance,” said Robin Nandy, chief of immunisation, Unicef....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/missed-childhood-vaccinations-trigger-worry/story-7TTkWr0T96nqTI45CJE77K.html
29-04-2020||India||BJP sends notice to UP MLA who called for boycott of Muslim vendors||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday issued a notice to its lawmaker Suresh Tiwari in Uttar Pradesh asking him to explain his comments asking people to boycott Muslim vegetable vendors and why action should not be initiated against him over them. Tiwari, the lawmaker from Barhaj in Deoria district, was on Tuesday heard purportedly calling for the boycott to avoid contracting Covid-19.“On the instructions of the [state] party chief Swatantra Dev, party general secretary Vidyasagar Sonker has issued notice to Tiwari and asked him to explain his conduct and why action should not be initiated against him,” said BJP leader Manish Dixit. Tiwari admitted to having called for the boycott, saying say he did so as a precautionary measure to protect people from getting infected. “On April 18, I was distributing masks among people in Deoria when people complained that Tablighi Jamaat was spreading the infection. Many of them were worried that Muslim vendors were infecting vegetables with saliva. As responsible MLA, I asked them not to take the law into their hands to deal with situation but simply stop buying vegetables from them [Muslims]. Tell me what wrong I have done if I have said such things,” Tiwari said.Muslim vendors have particularly found themselves isolated and drummed out of business since Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Delhi emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot following a congregation there last month.Congress leader Ajay Kumar Lallu accused the BJP of spreading hatred even at the time of the pandemic. “When the country is reeling under severe crisis of coronavirus, BJP leaders are busy fanning hatred. It is a shameful act which has exposed the real face of BJP. The Tablighi Jamaatis, who are being blamed for spreading coronavirus, have set an example by offering to donate their plasma to cure patients. I am confident the countrymen will put up a united fight against Covid-19 by neglecting such comments,” Lallu said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-sends-notice-to-up-mla-who-called-for-boycott-of-muslim-vendors/story-zTjPGu4iBtKKzQ3pZQVNgO.html
29-04-2020||India||Demand for ration cards increases amid lockdown||The post-Covid-19 lockdown has sparked a renewed scramble for ration cards under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), which entitles poor households to subsidised foodgrains from government-run fair price shops, according to multiple officials in state governments.The demand for ration cards hints at a perception among people that normality will not be restored anytime soon and a shortage of essential may be looming as a hard lockdown, confining residents indoors and shutting commercial establishments, is expected to stay in place beyond May 3 in 300 districts affected by the pandemic. A partial lockdown may continue in other districts. NFSA covers 75% of the population in rural areas and 50% in urban areas. Food right activists claim that the new rush of applications for ration cards shows that many poor households, especially the families of migrant workers, have been left out.“The only way to ensure every poor {household} gets rations is by universalizing the Public Distribution System. The states should ensure that every family gets access to rations,” said Reetika Khera, a professor of development economics at the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi and a food rights activist. According to data provided by the state governments, the demand for new ration cards is particularly high in the poorer states such as Odisha, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, where up to 90% of the population in rural areas is already covered under NFSA.Odisha has received applications for 500,000 new ration cards in addition to 32.6 million cards already issued. Some 100,00 cards have been issued and the remaining would be issued in the next two months under the state government’s food scheme, said MQ Haque, additional secretary in the food supplies and consumer welfare department. “No one will go hungry in Odisha and we are working towards that,” said Haque. The Rajasthan government has decided to give rations to 9 million people not having ration cards under the NFSA. “These are the people who are demanding PDS rations; now ,even though they are not NFSA beneficiaries, we have decided to give them grains,” said Siddharth Mahajan, food secretary, Rajasthan. Around 44.6 million people are beneficiaries of the NFSA in Rajasthan.The West Bengal government has issued food coupons to 500,000 families that applied for ration cards, entitling them to access fair price shops, according to food and supplies minister, Jyotipriyo Mullick. The state has 56.5 million NFSA beneficiaries.Uttar Pradesh has issued 323,000 new ration cards in addition to 34 million cards already issued under NFSA. In Jharkhand, 697,000 new applications for ration cards are pending. “In the lockdown period, we have decided to give 10 kg rations at Rs 1 per kilogram to applicants of new ration cards,” said Sanjay Kumar, Jharhand’s food director.Madhya Pradesh’s food secretary, Shivshekhar Shukla said about 3.2 million people, who don’t have ration cards, are being given five kg of rations - 4 kg of wheat and 1 kg of rice -- free in April. MP has 11.6 million beneficiaries under the NFSA. Shukla said processing the new ration card applications will take time.Andhra Pradesh state civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar said as many as 95,000 people had applied for new ration cards this year. Of them, after verification, 81,000 have been approved. Officials in Telangana said no new application for ration cards had been received. Karnataka has decided to give rations to every family which has applied for new ration cards, said Vijay Kumar, joint director of Karnataka’s procurement and food department. Even in affluent Punjab, applications have been received for 320,000 ration cards. Punjab has 14.1 million beneficiaries under the NFSA. The neighbouring food bowl state of Haryana has received around 250,000 new applications for ration cards.Some state government officials say they were willing to provide rations even to non-NFSA beneficiaries provided the Centre increases the allocation of foodgrains. “Since the central government is not allocating food for such additional people, we are having problem in giving rations to them,” said an official of the MP food department, who requested anonymity.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has already written to the Centre asking it to provide rations on demand during the lockdown period and not in line with the state-wise quota fixed by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-ration-cards-increases-amid-lockdown/story-xwaP0y153pnzrz91FAdKAI.html
29-04-2020||India||Internet speeds fall to lowest in 2 years||Indians experienced the slowest internet speeds in at least two years in March when the country locked down to slow the spread of the Coronavirus disease, analysis of data from the government’s MySpeed application showed.The nationwide lockdown began in the last week of March while some states ordered closure of schools and a ban on public gatherings even before that, which led to people staying home. Hindustan Times last week reported, from government data, that India’s daily average internet consumption in the week beginning March 22 (Janata curfew day) was 13% more than the average daily consumption in the previous week.The MySpeed application by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) collects data by occasionally testing internet speed on smartphones of users who have installed the application. The authority then makes six-month average results and raw data public.An analysis of the raw data from the application showed that median download speeds were 2.8 megabits per second in March. This was the lowest monthly median download speed in at least two years, since April 2018, when the app started tracking speeds. The median upload speed of 1.9 Mbps was also the lowest in the two years. Before this March, the download speed was the lowest in December 2019 (3.5 Mbps) while the upload speed was the lowest in October 2019 (2 Mbps). Specifically, 4G users got a median download speed of 3.1 Mbps speed while 3G users got a median of 0.8 Mbps speed, both the lowest in two years.Median is considered a better measure of central tendency than the mean, when there are extreme values that could skew calculations.The median download and upload speeds in February this year were 4.2 and 2.4 Mbps, compared to 2.8 and 1.9 Mbps in March, which means a drop of 34% and 20% respectively.This drop in the internet speeds was seen across all major telecom operators -- Airtel, Vodafone-Idea, Jio and the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. Median download speeds on all these networks were their lowest in two years.Also, the download speed in 16 of the country’s 23 telecom circles dropped to the two-year low in the respective states.Ookla, an internet testing and analysis company, has also reported that download speeds on mobile devices in India declined by about 14% and on fixed broadband by about 9% between February and March this year.As the nationwide lockdown that India imposed led to a surge in internet consumption, several video streaming applications jointly decided on March 25 to temporarily suspend high definition and ultra high definition video options to help telecommunication services run smoothly with the increased demand. This came after the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), an association of private telecom operators, called for such measures to reduce the burden on the networks during the lockdown.When asked for a comment, COAI officials said that they will look into the data and then issue a comment. Till the time of going to print, they had not issued a statement.That there has been a spike in demand for high data consuming services such as video streaming portals is evident with data from Google Trends, a tool that helps analyse the popularity of search queries. Youtube, Netflix and Amazon Prime – names of some of the prominent video streaming websites – and general terms such as ‘movies’ and ‘web series’ were at the peak of their search popularity during the nationwide lockdown, in comparison to any time in the last one year. Other than this, many schools and colleges started online classes while businesses made more use of e-meeting platforms for video conferencing. To be sure, the drop in internet speed in March was seen even as the country started to lock down only in the later half of the month. Whether Indians continued to experience slower internet or the telecom operators were able to scale up the capacity of their infrastructure allowing faster internet connectivity will be known when the data for April is made available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-speeds-fall-to-lowest-in-2-years/story-Je1uZaqEVtipMEiD0gr3sL.html
29-04-2020||India||IT, ITES firms’ employees can work from home till May 31: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Employees of information technology (IT) companies and IT-enabled service providers can work from home until May 31, IT and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday, extending the timeline by a month in the aftermath of Covid-19, restrictions on transport and safe distancing practices put in place to curb its spread .The department of telecommunications (DoT) on March 13 relaxed rules to allow employees of IT and ITES firms to work from home without mandatorily going through the authorised PPVPN (Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Network). The relaxed guidelines are applicable until April 30; the guidelines will now stay in force until May-end. International call centres, business process outsourcing and knowledge process outsourcing centres, e-learning sites, billing centres and medical transcription companies are covered by the relaxed rules.The mandatory Rs 1 crore deposit fee needed to let employees work from home has been waived and the service providers need to only inform the local DoT office of the addresses of their remote workers; ministry officials said this can be made a permanent fixture Prasad announced the extension after a meeting by video conference with the chief ministers of Haryana and Sikkim,and the deputy CMs of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, who are also in charge of the IT departments in their states. State IT ministers from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Assam, Odisha, Goa, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Meghalaya were also in attendance. After the meeting, Prasad said the states had requested that district-level dashboard access be given to the Aarogya Setu app to all district administrations. Some states asked him to explore the possibility of integrating the system for issuing ePasses during the lockdown with the Aarogya Setu app. Bihar deputy CM Sushil Modi asked him to develop a digital platform for sharing best practices and innovations put in place by different states to tackle the health crisis; Prasad asked the IT ministry to initiate the development of such a platform. Telangana’s KT Rama Rao suggested that a strategic working group of government officials and industry leaders be formed to explore digital solutions in education, healthcare, commerce, and emerging technologies. Prasad said that his office was in touch with all social media platforms to curb the spread of fake news, and that offenders would “face consequence and even police action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-ites-firms-employees-can-work-from-home-till-may-31-prasad/story-HTMagcEOfqhIn2AjAyJruM.html
29-04-2020||India||Ensure smooth movement of trucks with essentials: Nitin Gadkari tells states||Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday asked the states to act urgently to remove blockades for the smooth movement of trucks carrying essential goods along inter-state borders. In a video conference with state transport ministers, Gadkari said the clearances should be ensured at the earliest for the purpose. Gadkari pulled up the states for delaying the clearances and said nearly 3.5 lakh trucks were stuck because of it at inter-state borders, officials aware of the matter said. The officials said there was no discussion on the resumption of inter-state public transport at the meeting. Gadkari told the ministers that they need to intervene in such matters and ensure resolution of issues through the local and district administrations. “At the same time, adhere to health advisories and other guidelines like proper [social] distancing, wearing of masks, use of sanitizers, both by the driver and cleaners and also at the dhabaas [roadside restaurants],” Gadkari said.Himachal Pradesh’s transport minister, Govind Thakur, said there were several issues related to the movement of goods and transportation that needed to be resolved. “There is delay in movement and hence the meeting was called to discuss the hurdles. There was no discussion on public transport yet, which will only take place on May 3 [when the extended Covid-19 lockdown ends],” Thakur said. Responding to a suggestion by a state minister, Gadkari said his ministry will start a helpline to resolve the transportation issues. Gadkari suggested the states should explore the operationalisation of app-based two-wheeler taxis, especially in rural areas, to assist farming communities with smoother movement. “This will also provide new employment opportunities,” Gadkari said.Gadkari said he will accord top priority for national highway construction by two to three times the present pace over the next couple of years. He urged the states to expedite land acquisition and utilise funds that have remained unused. All India Motor Transport Congress president Kultaran Singh Atwal said the movement of vehicles remains a major issue despite the Centre’s advisories. “The e-pass system is not working properly and the movement of staff apart from drivers is still a tedious task. Local restrictions are not helping the transport fraternity. There is no fresh load, no unloading at the factories, godowns or warehouses. Our vehicles also get stuck up for days together apart from harassment by local administration,” said Atwal He added the screening process at inter-state borders has left trucks stranded. “There is screening process at interstate borders... There are long queues up to 6-7 kilometres and the drivers and crew are stranded without food and water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-smooth-movement-of-trucks-with-essentials-gadkari-tells-states/story-z12UoAHc40TXBMECV3hGEJ.html

Patients with these conditions are more vulnerable to COvid-19 infection.At least 31 other personnel of this battalion have been admitted at different hospitals after they are suspected to have contracted the virus from another colleague found positive in their camp.There have been over 60 positive cases of Covid-19 in all the central paramilitary forces till now. Earlier, cases have been reported in the Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Some of them have been cured too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paramilitary-forces-report-first-covid-death-after-crpf-si-dies-in-delhi/story-B1arsr5e1GEtrBc9mjbnwK.html
29-04-2020||India||Consider enacting 1 nation, 1 ration card: SC to Centre||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Central government to examine the feasibility of implementing the “one nation one ration card” scheme during the national lockdown so as to alleviate the hardships faced by migrant labourers who have been stranded in other states.A three-judge bench headed by justice NV Ramana passed the order in a plea by a petitioner who highlighted the plight of migrant labourers because they did not have local identity proof. “…we direct the Union of India to consider whether it is feasible for it to implement the said scheme at this stage or not and take appropriate decision in this regard keeping in view the present circumstances”, the court said disposing of the plea.The “one nation one ration card” scheme, formulated by the Central government was expected to be launched in June across 20 states. The scheme is aimed at ensuring beneficiaries get what is due to them in terms of subsidised foodgrain even when they are out of their home states. Experts are not convinced the scheme will work. “To serve ration card holders who are not usually buying from a PDS (public distribution system) outlet, is a major reform to the supply chain management of the PDS,” said Reetika Khera. “And this rejigging, supplying grain for Bihari men in Tamil Nadu or Gujarat, will have to be done across states. Even if it were possible to do it, most migrants who are stuck in the cities are likely to have left their ration card back home, for their families to use in the village. They will be better served by setting up community kitchens.”“The most obvious solution is temporarily universalising the PDS. There is enough grain to universalise for a year.”The petitioner pointed out that many migrant workers who left their home state to work in other cities have been confined to their rented accommodation and are unable to return to their home states because of the lockdown. Millions of migrant workers ar stuck in relief camps and other sites in states other than their own, with no way of returning home. They have run out of food and with no local identity proof such as a ration card or voter card to avail of government benefits like subsidised food grains, they are facing poverty and hunger, the petition said. “States and Union Territories have been giving preferences to their respective citizens and voters and denying benefits of subsidised grains, shelter, medical facilities to said migrants labourers/ employees of other states due to absence of local identity proof i.e. ration card/residential proof/ voter card”, the petitioner claimed.The petitioner, therefore, prayed that the “one nation one ration card” scheme, which is proposed to come into effect from June 2020, should be implemented during the lockdown enforced to contain the pandemic so that migrant labourers are not denied subsidised food grains and other government benefits.Activist Nikhil Dey said there are many limitations to extending the “one nation, one ration card” even temporarily., pointing out that even within states portability of cards (from one district to another) is not easy. “The ration cards of migrant labourers are not with them. Different schemes and coverage exists in different states, so they are reluctant to recognise migrants as being entitled to their schemes. In most cases, only one family member has a ration card. Moreover, there are 35% people who are outside the ambit of this scheme and then we have to factor in the population increase since the 2011 census in which NFSA (National Food Secuity Act) coverage is based . It would be one thing if ‘universal ration’ is provided -that is, a person can avail ration using any form of identification like an Aadhaar number , or any other card. That is what the Supreme Court ordered in the Swaraj Abhiyan judgement, for circumstances of a drought , and what it should order in a pandemic and a disaster such as this one -- w e need use our overflowing food stocks to universalize the PDS to deal with hunger. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-enacting-1-nation-1-ration-card-sc-to-centre/story-XNf7oBfz5kTVRmibE5JwzH.html
29-04-2020||India||No need to seal office if employee tests positive: Govt||There is no need to seal an entire building if a person living or working there tests positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) because disinfection of the affected floor and common areas is enough to stop the spread of infection, according to the Union health ministry.“The health ministry has issued a detailed advisory on do’s and don’ts if a non-Covid hospital reports a Covid-19 positive case. The same rules apply for office premises or any other building from where a positive case is reported. There is no need to shut the entire premises, rather one can just do proper disinfection of the main area, and other common areas,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry.The advisory is significant as more business activity starts and as companies and factories contemplate a return to some sort of normalcy after May 3 when the current phase of the lockdown ends. According to the health ministry guidelines for non-Covid hospitals where a positive Covid-19 patient is identified, local health authorities need to be immediately informed, followed by disinfection procedures at the affected areas.All contacts of the patient should be home quarantined and monitored for 14 days. Their details must also be shared with local health authorities.If the local health authorities are reasonably satisfied that the source case(s) have been identified and isolated, all contacts have been traced and quarantined and adequate disinfection has been achieved, the building will continue to function. But if the building still continues to report new cases in the following days, it would be advisable to temporarily close the defined section of the building from where the maximum number of cases are being reported. After thorough cleaning and disinfection it can be put to use again.Experts say much depends on the design of the building. “If the structure is where there are multiple flats or different floors, then there is no need to seal the entire building as per the infection control guidelines. However, all the flats or floors have to remain under observation, and people should watch out for symptoms,” said Dr T Jacob John, senior virologist, and formerly head of department, CMC, Vellore. Despite taking the above measures, if the primary source of infection cannot be established and or the building is still reporting large number of cases then a decision needs to be taken on whether the building needs to be shut down under intimation to the local health department.BOXFollow up actionsWhen a Covid-19 cases is reported at a workplace*Active screening of all staff is done daily (by means of thermal screening especially at the start of shift) • All staff members should monitor their own health at all the time for appearance of symptoms, and report them at the earliest*Close contacts should be home quarantined for 14 days, monitored...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-to-seal-office-if-employee-tests-ve-govt/story-perXqGTzn8eepGWyvhAv3N.html

Singh spoke to top officials of the OFB and DPSUs, via video conference, and reviewed operational plans as well as their contribution to the fight against the pandemic.Several units of the OFB and DPSUs, located in non-red zones, have already kicked off operations and drawn up plans for post-lockdown operations, the ministry statement said. Defence ministry officials said the units of the OFB and DPSUs plan to work in three shifts six days a week (rather than the usual five) to speed up production. Work will be carried out by observing social distancing and other relevant health guidelines, the officials said.The defence ministry statement said that Singh referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to revive the economy once the lockdown is over and said that the DPSUs along with the private defence industry could play a major role in the revival.Singh praised the efforts of DPSUs in coming out with new products to fight Covid-19 and also the assistance provided by them to the local administration.The OFB’s contribution in fighting Covid- 19 includes the repair of more than 100 ventilators, manufacture of 12,800 coveralls, development of specialised machines for testing of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and supply of 6.35 lakh masks to local authorities, the statement said.The OFB has also earmarked 280 isolation beds at hospitals spread across 10 locations.The statement said Bharat Electronics Ltd is ready to manufacture 12,000 ventilators in May and another 18,000 in June to support the national effort to tackle the disease. Around 3,000 engineers will help train health professionals in operationalising the ventilators, the ministry said.The statement said Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has manufactured and supplied 300 aerosol cabinets to various hospitals and also distributed 56,000 masks and extended support to migrant labourers.

29-04-2020||India||HRD ministry discusses evaluation process of CBSE Class 10, 12 papers||The Union human resource development (HRD) ministry has decided to push to begin the process of evaluation of Class 10 and 12 answer sheets of millions of students who appeared in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examinations this year, a senior official said after a key meeting of the ministry on Tuesday.In his meeting with state education ministers on Tuesday, HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ told the states to facilitate the CBSE in evaluating answer sheets, the official quoted above added. The evaluation process is in limbo because of the ongoing national lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19, but the fate of roughly 30 lakh students depend on it.“The matter has been discussed in meetings between HRD and CBSE officials and the attempt is to begin the process of evaluation of answer sheets at the earliest. In the evaluation process, different examiners often get together in one building where answersheets are evaluated. A protocol of social distancing in this regard can be prepared,” the official said on condition of anonymity.Class 10 exams are largely over, barring some areas in north-east Delhi hit by communal violence in March, and all that needs to be done is evaluation. A majority of Class 12 exams are also over and if evaluation begins, the results can be declared in June itself, the official added. But no final decision has been taken about the remaining Class 12 examinations – around 12 main subjects – the official said. The CBSE will have to wait till the required permissions are granted, the official added.A separate meeting of the University Grants Commission on Tuesday took up the recommendations of a high-level committee appointed to draft an academic calendar for the Covid-19 hit 2020-21 academic session.A second senior official said the committee’s recommended that universities follow a six-day weekly pattern instead of a five-day week and consider the lockdown period as deemed attendance by students so that nobody is disqualified because of attendance shortage.The panel also recommended the month of June as summer vacation period and suggested declaration of result by mid-August so that the session could commence. However, this will would upon the circumstances of the universities, the second official added.The committee, chaired by professor RC Kuhad, former member of the UGC and vice-chancellor, Central University of Haryana, also gave universities the option of open-book assessment or objective-type-question based test to conduct the final exams of the present session. They can shorten the exam duration from three to two hours based on the need, the second official said.The panel also suggested that students be allowed to reappear in exams if they want to improve their grades. Universities have been asked to follow social distancing norms and a common admission test for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Significantly, the panel felt that many varsities did not have adequate resources to impart e-learning.At the UGC meeting on Tuesday, officials felt more suggestion needed to be incorporated and the report may be made public after more deliberation. However, the second official said that the commission decided not make the suggestions binding in nature.In the HRD ministry meeting, Nishank said a decision had been taken to provide mid-day meal during summer holidays of schools, on which an additional expenditure of about Rs 1600 crores will be made. In addition, under the mid-day meal Scheme, an ad-hoc grant of Rs 2,500 crore was being issued for the first quarter.To augment the mid-day meal programme, the minister announced that in wake of Covid-19, the annual central allocation of cooking cost (for procurement of pulses, vegetable, oil, spices and fuel) will be enhanced to Rs. 8,100 crore from Rs 7,300 crore.

Two police vehicles were also damaged.The cops were attacked when they went to disperse a huge crowd that had gathered in a market area around 4:30 pm violating lockdown norms at Belilious Road, a containment zone in Howrah district. Howrah district is one of the four red zones of West Bengal. “Some people had gathered on the road violating lockdown norms in a containment zone. Policemen, patrolling the area, had asked some women to go back home. It was then that some young men started quarrelling with the police. The situation soon turned violent and the locals attacked the police” Arup Roy, state cooperative minister and a Trinamool Congress MLA from Howrah said.A large police contingent, with police staff from at least two police stations and RAF, were deployed to bring the situation under control.Top police officials refused to take calls. A few persons were detained.In a separate case, a young man was arrested when he assaulted a police officer at Parnasree in south west Kolkata. The young man was riding his motorcycle when police stopped him for questioning.Late on Tuesday night, the West Bengal Police tweeted: “We are taking strong action against everyone involved in the incident at Tikiapara, Howrah today. The perpetrators will be identified and brought to justice. No transgression of the law anywhere will be tolerated.”West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee retweeted it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-cops-attacked-when-they-tried-to-disperse-crowd-in-containment-zone/story-jQxeHCYReeM8Pa6zGksNeI.html
29-04-2020||India||After Siachen and Sydney, HC judge drives to Shillong to prevent constitutional vacuum; another judge drives 2200 km||Amid country-wide lockdown, a veteran judge’s experience in driving long distances in different continents and road conditions helped the Meghalaya high court avoid a constitutional vacuum on Monday. After driving for two and a half nights and several hours in day time to cover more than 2000 kilometres from Allahabad to Shillong via Kolkata, justice Biswanath Somadder took oath on Monday morning as the new chief justice of the Meghalaya high court.Justice Somadder and his office staff from the Allahabad high court, where he served, covered the distance between Friday evening and early Monday in a convoy of four vehicles. They refuelled four times and maintained an average speed of 65 kmph, sources said.Known among close associates for his long road trips, the veteran judge had earlier driven from Brisbane to Sydney in Australia, from Kolkata to Ladakh and also in distant parts of England. But these trips were part of his vacations.Interestingly, justice Dipankar Datta of the Kolkata high court also covered an equally long distance – from Bengal’s capital city to Mumbai – around the same time. On Tuesday evening, he took oath as the new chief justice of Bombay high court. Justice Datta and his son took turns behind the wheels while covering around 2200 km, sources said. He replaced chief justice C J Bhusan Dharmadhikari, who retired on Tuesday.A Supreme Court collegium announced both the appointments on April 18.Sources told HT that had justice Somadder not reached Shillong on time, the post of the chief justice would have fallen vacant. It would have led to a constitutional vacuum as there is no provision to appoint an acting chief justice when a chief justice has already been appointed.The Supreme Court collegium, on April 18, transferred justice Mohammad Rafiq (who justice Somadder succeeded) as the new chief justice of Odisha. Justice Rafiq had left Shillong and had gone to Rajasthan and took a special flight to Odisha to take charge. He also took oath in Bhubaneswar on Monday.During the road trip, justice Somadder stopped the convoy for the first time at Aurangabad to have dinner around Friday midnight. Four vehicles were needed as the occupants had to maintain social distancing. On Saturday afternoon, the convoy reached the judge’s home at Salt Lake in the eastern side of Kolkata. Justice Somadder slept for two hours and packed a few things, sources said.Some roads in south and north Bengal were not in good condition and the convoy had to slow down. The convoy stopped at Siliguri before moving to Bongaigaon in Assam and then to Guwahati.Although justice Somadder and his staff had maintained all safety guidelines, they were screened by health workers at the borders of Assam and Meghalaya, sources said. The oath-taking ceremonies at the governor houses in Shillong and Bombay were attended by few people because of social distancing guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-siachen-and-sydney-hc-judge-drives-to-shillong-to-prevent-constitutional-vacuum-another-judge-drives-2200-km/story-fHePtXf4l6lhqFCHKZ0xjN.html
29-04-2020||India||BJP govt waived loans worth Rs 6.66 lakh crore, helped defaulters: Congress||The Congress on Tuesday alleged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had waived off Rs 68,607 crore due from the top 50 bank loan defaulters, including Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya. The BJP, however, has denied the allegation. Citing what it said was an RTI reply from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the opposition party also alleged the NDA government also waived off loans worth Rs 6.66 lakh crore between coming to power in 2014 and last September, and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to come clean on the matter.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said he had asked a question in Parliament seeking the names of the country’s top 50 bank loan defaulters but the finance minister didn’t give an answer.“I asked a straight question in Parliament – state the names of the 50 top bank loan defaulters in the country. The finance minister refused to answer the question. Now, the RBI has given the names of Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and many of BJP’s ‘friends’ in the list of bank frauds. That is why this truth was held back from Parliament,” he tweeted in Hindi.Mallya recently lost his UK high court appeal against an order for his extradition to India. India has also sought the extradition of Choksi, one of the accused in the Punjab National Bank scam, from Antigua and Barbuda. Modi is fighting his extradition to India from the UK over charges of fraud and money laundering.On March 16, Gandhi had asked the question about wilful bank loan defaulters during the Lok Sabha’s budget session. But he wasn’t allowed a supplementary question, triggering protests by Congress members in the House.Gandhi later said his right as a Member of Parliament to ask a supplementary question in the Lok Sabha was taken away as Speaker Om Birla didn’t allow him to do so.The Congress leader said he was hurt by the action as it was the Speaker’s duty to protect his right to speak and ask supplementary questions. “This is completely unfair,” he had said.However, union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur took a swipe at Gandhi, saying the former Congress chief considers himself a “privileged” MP and wants to be treated differently than other Lok Sabha members.“Some people consider themselves privileged. They want to be treated differently than other MPs. They want to ask questions even after the Question Hour is over...The answers to his questions were provided in writing to him but still Gandhi and other Congress members made noise,” Thakur countered. BJP spokesperson Gopa lAgarwal also rebutted the Congress leader’s remarks. “We have categorically explained, and anyone known to Banking industry, will vouch that making provisions for NPA and Bad loans is not write off. It remains recoverable and the borrower is obligated to pay back that amount to the Banks. Provisioning only strengthens the Banks Balance sheet from the lenders point of view,” said Agarwal,He said the Congress is misleading people by raising the issue. “I am ashamed to call Congress leaders like Chidambaram and Manmohan Singh economists, if they can’t understand or swallow this basic fundamentals of banking. Actually they are playing a fraud on the people of our country trying to mislead and misinform the nation. Truly we should all ask the ex PM and ex FM; under whose tenure these scrupulous loans were given to these crony capitalist like Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya and Mehul Chokshi? And now who is trying to recover them, with Benami property act, fugitive offenders act and extradition? It is our government of Shri Narendra Modi,” the BJP spokesperson added. Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala had on Tuesday released the list of top loan defaulters, according to the RTI reply from the RBI. He also demanded answers from the prime minister on why their loans were waived off.“This is a classic case of promoting the ‘dupe, deceive and depart’ policy of the Modi government, which can no longer be accepted and the prime minister has to answer,” he told a news briefing via video conference.Surjewala said this also reflected the “misconceived priorities and dishonest intentions” of the Modi government.The entire country is fighting the Coronavirus and the government has no money to pay states, but it has the money to condone and write off Rs 68,307 crore of bank loan defaulters, he said.“Helping fugitives and waiving off their loans has become the BJP’s main agenda. On March 16, Rahul Gandhi asked the government in Parliament for the names of 50 top bank scamsters in India. The government and the finance minister kept mum and refused to disclose any names,” Surjewala said. “But now an RTI has revealed the magnitude of the waiver.”Surjewala said the government’s financial mismanagement has caused non-performing assets (NPAs) to balloon out of proportion. “Till April 24, Rs 68,607 crore had been written off by the government. The prime minister cannot evade this question by keeping silent,” he said.“As much as Rs 8,048 crore have been written off for Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi. Another diamond merchant Jatin Mehta’s Rs 6,048 crore too has been written off, and so is the case with Kingfisher’s Vijay Mallya. Similar is the case with the relations of these defaulters,” he alleged.“This is what happens when an economy, primed to be one of the largest in the world, is run by an ‘Entire Political Scientist’. Tax payers money is being used to bailout the government’s rich friends. How long will the government continue the charade of working for the poor and the middle class?” the opposition party said on Twitter.It alleged that such write-offs have come to light at a time when the government has frozen the dearness allowance of Central government employees, pensioners and defence personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-govt-waived-loans-worth-rs-6-66-lakh-crore-helped-defaulters-cong/story-ZZsUPFWZpKZPl5gnheYqLO.html

As a sign of gratitude, the first prayers at both Kedarnath and Badrinath shrine will be offered on his behalf for helping boost the local economy of the hills by his visits to the shrines,” Maharaj said.The minister further added that he would be going to Delhi after the lockdown is lifted to give the offerings from the prayers, holy flowers and holy water, to the Prime Minister.After the first prayers were offered at the Gangotri shrine on Sunday on behalf of PM Modi, the priests will now send holy Ganga water for the prime minister through the post, as a blessing to strengthen the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.PM Modi has donated Rs 1100 to Sripanch Mandir Samiti Gangotri on the auspicious occasion of Tritiya Mahaparva. Suresh Semwal, president of the Gangotri Dham Temple Committee, said that the sub-divisional magistrate of Bhatwadi area, Devendra Singh Negi gave the amount sent by Prime Minister Modi to the temple committee.“After that, we offered the first prayers to Goddess Ganga on behalf of the prime minister to give us the strength to fight the pandemic and win the war against coronavirus,” said Semwal.Deepak Semwal, secretary of Gangotri Dham Temple Committee said that anyone who offers prayers to Goddess Ganga is “given the holy water of Maa Ganga by the priests of the temple, which is why we are sending it to Prime Minister Modi also, as he offered prayers on Sunday.”Last year, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat gave credit to PM Modi’s frequent visits to the state as the reason behind the record influx of pilgrims to the four holy shrines of the state.In November, Rawat had tweeted, “This year, more than 34 lakh 81 thousand devotees have visited Chardham and Hemkund Sahib. Prime Minister Modi after visiting Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines gave the message of clean and safe Chardham Yatra to all devotees, which brought a large number of pilgrims here.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Rudra meditation cave in Kedarnath in May last year. PM Modi spent a day meditating at the Rudra Caves, nearly a kilometer from the Kedarnath shrine. Following his visit, the cave received a significant number of bookings from across the country. He also visited the Badrinath shrine in May last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-uttarakhand-priests-to-offer-first-prayers-at-kedarnath-badrinath-for-pm-modi/story-7I7sXrrSSvrAzw6zwYoB7J.html
29-04-2020||India||Think of India as one big family: Brave Punjab Sub Inspector Harjeet Singh||The blessings that we earn protect us mysteriously as a shield in the face of peril. It’s all about karma, firmly believes Harjeet Singh, known for his compassion and humility in his entire neighbourhood. Two days after his surgery to reimplant his severed hand, Singh shared an incident with his younger brother Gurjit Singh. It’s the kind words of an old woman that protected him in the face of the savage attack, he said thoughtfully. “It could have been much worse. At the same spot where my hand was cut, I had handed over vegetables to mata ji. She had given me a lot of blessings,” he said. The fearless policeman from Punjab, Harjeet Singh is slowly recovering from the brutal attack he suffered earlier this month. Singh has been promoted to the rank of SI in recognition of his bravery and he hopes to resume duty as soon as he feels better. A group of fugitives in Patiala had chopped off his hand with a sword while he was on early morning duty, enforcing the lockdown at the Patiala sabzi mandi to fight the coronavirus outbreak. The Punjab policeman had his hand reimplanted at PGIMER Chandigarh after a challenging 7.5 hour long plastic surgery. With a lathi in his hand, Singh had fearlessly faced his attackers till the time they struck him with a sword, and he fell on the ground. Talking to us on phone from the hospital, he tells us he is feeling much better and stronger. “It’s all almighty’s grace. I am grateful to God for all his kindness,” says the 48-year-old. Humble and soft-spoken, Singh is thankful for all the love and blessings that he has received from across India. The policeman says it’s Gurbani (teachings of the Sikh gurus) that have always given him strength to face any adversity. “Kare karave aape aap manas ke kich naahi hath…It’s God who is the doer….we human being have nothing in our hands. No harm can ever come your way if you have Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s blessings. I am a very small person…it’s Baba Nanak who gives us the strength to carry on,” says Singh, who remained composed and collected even as he faced a violent and brutal attack while performing his duty. He did not show any sign of anger or panic and every calmly carried his own severed hand as he rushed to the hospital on a scooter. Before disconnecting the call, Singh appeals to pass on his message to all. “Covid-19 can be defeated only by strict social distancing, and we all must follow it. I request everyone with folded hands to please stand by the police officers, the doctors, the sanitation workers who are fighting day and night for you,” he says. Singh’s father Karnail Singh was a former police officer who took voluntary retirement to look after his fields. He instilled in his sons the values of kindness and forgiveness when they were growing up. “My brother is a policeman, so he has to assert his authority, but I have never seen him hold on to anger to have any grudge in his heart against anyone. Even for his attackers, he said, “Jaane do, unki koi dushmani nahin thi mujhse, hadsa ho gaya.(Let it be, they didn’t have any enmity with me, it was an accident).” For those who break rules pandemic deliberately, this is all he has to say: “Just think of your family, think of your loved ones. Your careless actions will impact them as well.” He also hopes that we treat our country as one family. “Poore desh ko apna parivaar samjhen, toh hum zaroor jeet jayenge,” he says. Punjab Police has started a campaign #mainbhiHarjeetSingh on social media as a tribute to the police officer’s bravery. “Let’s show everyone that any attack on policemen & doctors, fighting COVID-19 on the frontlines, like SI Harjeet Singh, will unite India together as one. In solidarity with SI Harjeet& all warriors, I urge you all to wear his name proudly on your chests today,” tweeted Dinkar Gupta, Punjab Director General of Police. Gupta changed his name on my badge to Harjeet Sing on Monday. The DGP has also written to police chiefs in India, applauding Singh for his “two top attributes of a good cop: not meeting violence with violence or tit for tat, and courage in the face of fire.” SI Harjeet Singh has emerged as the symbol of the nation’s fight against COVID-19, he said. Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also shared a video of the police officer on Twitter. “It has been 2 weeks since SI Harjeet Singh’s hand was operated upon in PGI. I am extremely happy to share that he is recovering well & that his hand has started to regain movement. Sharing this video of braveheart Harjeet Singh with you all,” he wrote on Twitter.Singh’s brother, Gurjit Singh is thankful to all for standing by the family in this time of distress. “It is such a heartwarming feeling. Strangers are calling and telling us that we’re not alone. We are getting calls from across India. Humara hausla banaye rakhne ke liye shukriya! We are humbled. We are grateful to SSP Patiala Mandeep Singh Sidhu ji and our DGP sahib who arranged for such good medical treatment for my brother,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/think-of-india-as-one-big-family-we-can-t-fight-this-battle-alone-brave-punjab-cop-harjeet-singh/story-RC04ev4j5wVQzko5Hh0seK.html
29-04-2020||Editorials||One nation, one ration card: It will give a cushion to migrant workers||The Supreme Court (SC), on Tuesday, asked the Union government to examine the feasibility of implementing the “one nation one ration card” (ONORC) scheme during the national lockdown. The scheme, which allows beneficiaries to access food grains that they are entitled to under the National Food Security Act, 2013, from any fair-price shop in the country, was announced last June. The SC’s nudge to expedite the ONORC is critical. Millions of out-of-work migrant workers are stuck in host cities due to the lockdown. Many have run out of money to buy food and don’t have a proof of identity like ration cards to access subsidised food grains via the well-stocked public distribution system (PDS). States where they are stuck prefer offering relief to their own residents first, and cite the lack of identity documents to deny benefits. And among those states which have opened community kitchens for out-of-job migrant workers, there have been complaints of the quantity, quality and type of food. Some feel that the ONORC scheme will not be of much help during the present crisis since many migrant workers have left their PDS cards in their villages. Instead, the Union government must expand the well-stocked PDS system to cover all individuals, irrespective of whether they have a ration card or not, for at least six months. While this must be done, the government must also fast-track the ONORC scheme because India’s present rights-based regime is based on the assumption that people are sedentary. This is not true given the high rates of inter- and intra-state migration. Without any safety net, migrants depend either on their employers or labour contractors for food provisions or purchase food in the open market. This increases their cost of living and reduces the additional earnings they might hope to remit to their families. During the lockdown, the crisis has become even more acute. But even after the coronavirus pandemic is over, this will be useful. Migration is bound to restart because of unemployment. When migrant workers again start boarding trains and buses for the destination cities, they must have their PDS cards that are valid across India with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/one-nation-one-ration-card-it-will-give-a-cushion-to-migrant-workers/story-rFuvaYbRx8qiFv3Iwz4HrM.html
