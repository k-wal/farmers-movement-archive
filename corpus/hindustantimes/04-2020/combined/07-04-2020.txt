07-04-2020||News||Covid-19: Here is what India needs to do now||The Indian government’s decision to impose a 21-day lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) was a bold one. But now more remedies are needed to help citizens whose lives have been upended by the lockdown. It’s worth restating the main goal of the lockdown: Prevent a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases that could overwhelm the health care system, and wreak economic and social havoc. Global evidence, including from Asia and Europe, points to three priorities over the next few weeks: Test, protect health care workers, and produce better and open scientific data.First, India’s testing rates, while better than 10 days ago, are still far too low. India can use innovations such as drive-through testing to achieve an unprecedented rapid expansion of free testing through public and private labs (a ~5,000 bill will deter too many from testing, and so it needs to be free). The Indian Council for Medical Research aims to raise testing capacity to 10,00,00 a day in the upcoming months. But this will need to be done faster.Thousands of mobile testing sites placed away from health care facilities must be created, along with limited random testing of communities. The National AIDS Control Programme offers replicable lessons to ensure the quality of testing and reporting. All positive samples must be archived in national bio-repositories, paired with basic, confidential information on each person.For those testing positive, self-isolation effectively means quarantine (and testing) of their whole family. Hence, all those who test positive, and who need it, should be given immediate cash or credit to organise self-care and compensate for the loss of family wages. Each case must also be assigned a community chaperone to help meet basic needs. Most cases are mild and can be managed at home. To care for those too sick to be at home, the Indian Army can construct temporary field hospitals, as the Chinese did. India’s innovative information technology companies can connect people with local testing and treatment sites and to community support workers, even let patients rate their care. Covid-19 re-infection appears unlikely. Positive patients, after isolation and a second negative test, can be put to work (including as chaperones). These steps would also reduce the stigma of a positive test.Second, Covid-19 transmission must not occur in crowded hospitals and clinics. Hospitals must focus on treatment, not testing. Physical partitions and separate teams should manage presumptive or possible Covid-19 cases, apart from non-cases. Health care workers became infected too often in Italy, Spain and the United States (US). Sick nurses, doctors and other health care workers reduce valuable human resources. Moreover, providers without symptoms can infect older patients or those with existing conditions who are at greater risk of death from Covid-19. A major industrial push is required to ensure that the World Health Organization’s recommended protective personal equipment list is available for every frontline health care worker. Excess stocks at private hospitals need to be bought or conscripted. Indian industries must be tasked to crank out millions of masks, gloves, sanitisers and lakhs of ventilators. Whatever is unused in India can be sold or donated globally.Third, India must emphasise better science and transparency in data. Collection of core demographic and risk details (age, sex, travel, contact with other Covid-19 patients, existing chronic conditions, current smoking) is a priority. Singapore is a model of exemplary reporting and contact tracing. A follow-up phone call at three weeks can establish if the infected person is alive, dead or hospitalised. Antibody tests in random populations and among health care workers can establish the true proportion infected, but needs to start very soon before immunity wanes. The above, paired with testing in morgues, can provide a plausible estimate of the infection fatality rate — a key parameter that is inadequately documented worldwide.If Covid-19 deaths are going to rise sharply, daily reporting of the total death counts by age and sex by each municipality would help track if there is a spike in presumed Covid-19 deaths. The registrar general’s verbal autopsy studies are useful, but must be reactivated to review deaths occurring in 2020, as the last published results are from 2013. Collectively, simple denominators of infected and rates of death would help provide a true “GPS” to control the epidemic. Unfortunately, mathematical models make too many assumptions. We need actual data. To their credit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, health minister Harsh Vardhan, and most chief ministers have begun to speak as one. Honest, calm and daily communication of science can explain each citizen’s role in flattening the trajectory of the epidemic and build public confidence in a stronger response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-here-is-what-india-needs-to-do-now/story-I8KOl6dT6VRGMnPzdb0ePM.html
07-04-2020||News||Policing in the times of Covid-19||Epidemics have ravaged civilisations and changed the course of history. In 1918, over 15 million Indians perished in the Spanish flu outbreak, the last major pandemic that devastated the subcontinent. The flu is reported to have arrived in India through the Bombay port. Seven police sepoys posted at the Bombay docks were the first ones to be admitted to the police hospital with “the Bombay fever”. Now, as India stops in its tracks to break the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) chain, the police force, as one of the essential services, is again at the forefront of the Herculean task of enforcing this unprecedented nationwide lockdown.Policing during pandemic has neither specific guidelines nor well-defined roles in shaping the response. The forces are geared for imposing isolation, but never on such a vast scale. As nervous citizens were caught off guard by the hastily-announced lockdown, policemen risked their lives on the streets to ensure that the country’s 1.3 billion people stayed safe indoors — advising the violators or using force to vacate roads; drawing lakshman rekhas to space people out in front of shops and bazaars; standing at the naka (barricade) points through day and night to check cars; spreading awareness about social distancing; disciplining some for violating the restrictions; and arresting foolhardy offenders. To be sure, this, at times, resulted in excessive action, but this was more the exception than the norm. The police also traced the travel history of those who did not follow screening protocols and took them to quarantine centres.With a police-population ratio of only 192 in India (192 policemen per 100,000 people), this is no mean task. The dearth of manpower reduces the effectiveness and efficiency of the police force, and even causes psychological ailments for many. To keep a strict surveillance on its people during the lockdown in Britain, where the police-population ratio is much higher, the forces used high-tech drones.Despite their best efforts, the hapless constables, who form the frontline of the force, are often shown as ill-informed and depicted in poor light. Despite obsolete equipment, lapses in communication network and compromised police mobility due to the shortage of vehicles and drivers, our police system is still committed to deliver its best under trying circumstances.To help the citizens during the lockdown, policemen have gone beyond the call of duty. Some have distributed food and milk packets, including senior citizens. Food rations were distributed in police trucks in Punjab. The police went from door-to-door offering help to the elderly in West Bengal. They distributed food packets in women’s shelters and to labourers. Some have even tried innovative means to spread the message regarding precautions and safety measures to contain the coronavirus, wearing spiked red helmets shaped like the virus. Some policemen in the states sang patriotic songs, making an appeal to citizens to stand by the nation in its fight against coronavirus. These endeavours of the police force in this hour of crisis should not go unrecognised. Considering the staggering population, the police cannot deliver without community help and participation. For instance, after the first day’s efforts to distribute food to the deprived, the Delhi Police got overwhelming support from residents who came forward to offer vegetables and other food items. The special branch of Delhi Police distributed around 6,000 food packets to the needy in various parts of the Capital in collaboration with volunteers and staff of its district units, as per media reports. In the South district, the police, in coordination with a private trust and district civil administration, distributed 500 food packets to the needy at Sanjay Colony Bhatti Mines. From serving meals at police stations to providing medical assistance, the Delhi Police along with NGOs reached out to those in distress due to the lockdown in the slums. Some self-help groups have also come forward to carry the baton. Similarly, a few states are implementing innovative ideas for social distancing with the panchayats and police working together. The police force, as one of the sentinels of democracy, should be applauded and encouraged for being a crucial interface between the government and the public at this time of national emergency. However, there are three lessons for the future. First, police training schools should include medical emergency and police responses in their syllabus, which would call for a paradigm change in protocols and accoutrements. Second, with the police force stretched to the maximum, there is an acute need for private security guards to be trained and empowered.When the lockdown was imposed, police officials were seen walking around the parks with megaphones, sensitising the crowds about Covid-19 — a job that security guards could have done. In fact, a variety of tasks performed by the police today can be done by private guards under supervision.Last, communities or clusters which organise themselves well through self-discipline, emerge from such crises unscathed and stronger. Some resident welfare associations in Delhi and Gurgaon have already proved this, though it is crucial they follow the law, don’t act arbitrarily, impose draconian restrictions and harass community members.Yashovardhan Azad is former IPS officer and Central Information CommissionerThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/policing-in-the-times-of-covid-19/story-sIzHkVt1hOJZhMWRl4n6HL.html

After getting the person’s details or making a financial transaction in their name, cybercriminals share an OTP which is used to siphon off money from their bank account, said the police.“There has not been a single case in Navi Mumbai but we want residents to be alert,” said Pravin Patil, deputy commissioner of police, crime.Cybercriminals also use a phishing link, claiming to give free subscription of Netflix if one forwards it to their friends on social media. The police suspect either the link has a virus or can get the personal data of phones when someone clicks it.Free mobile recharges are also being used to lure persons into downloading applications which can compromise your data, officials said.In Thane, the police team is alerting residents to not fall for any employment offers or free Netflix. The police said many residents have been repeatedly getting messages about various offers and asking them to click on a link. An officer from Thane cyber cell said, “Many callers offer insurance policy, or lure people with free Nexflix. We are appealing to residents to not open dubious links and share bank details. We are also asking people to not forward such messages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/do-not-fall-for-discount-and-job-offers-online-cops/story-wJ11DXiODW0GOjbGvSfvTN.html

07-04-2020||City||Against lockdown violators: 292 FIRs against 548 people on Monday||MUMBAI: On Monday, Mumbai Police lodged 292 first information reports (FIRs) against 548 people, which is almost five times the daily average between March 20 and April 5.“We are taking stringent action against those who are violating the lockdown. We keep receiving hundreds of complaints through people on the 100 phone number and on Twitter, on violation of lockdown orders. The strict action will continue,” said Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police (operations) Pranaya Ashok.Between March 20 and April 5, 1,039 FIRs were registered in Mumbai and on Monday, 292 FIRs were filed, raising the total to 1,331 FIRs against 2,518 people. Of these, 739 charge people with gathering in public and 438 are for illegal use of vehicles. Eight FIRs are against those who violated home quarantine orders and the remaining 153 FIRs are against hotels, shops and hawkers that were operational during lockdown. Of the FIRs filed on Monday, 106 were registered in eastern parts of the city, which includes slum pockets in Deonar, Mankhurd, Govandi, Trombay, Ghatkopar (East) and Vikhroli. The police said it is coming down heavily on public gatherings in slums. To deal with the growing number of containment zones, Ashok said additional manpower has been kept in reserve and three new drones have been ordered to monitor crowds. In all, six drones are being used.Kishor Sawant, senior inspector, Sakinaka police station, said the police were helping those in containment zones. “We have asked people to prepare lists and then we arrange it for them. We have hired a cook and my staff help cook food for at least 300 migrants and beggars in this area. We distribute food to them daily.”Search on for Tablighi Jamaat attendeesDCP Pranay Ashok said about 150 Mumbai residents who attended the Tablighi Jamaat held in New Delhi in March, have been traced. “We are tracing the rest and have appealed them to approach us,” said Ashok. Though an FIR has been registered, Mumbai Police clarified no arrests would be made due to the prevailing situation and attendees would be tested so that appropriate action — admitting to hospital or isolation — may be taken.State home minister Anil Deshmukh also tweeted on Tuesday, “About 50 to 60 people from Maharashtra who are members of the Tablighi Jamaat...are hiding after switching off their phones. I appeal to them to report to the nearest police station...”No inquest for Covid-19 casualties in hospital Keeping in mind the safety of police, doctors and medical staff, Maharashtra home department has said that an inquest (official process to find out the cause of death) will not be carried out in cases where a person has died of Covid 19 in a hospital.FIRs for home-made liquor, theft of cigarettes Sakinaka police on Monday caught four men with 10 litre home-made liquor. The police traced the source of liquor to Aarey Milk Colony and caught the villager who was making the liquor at his home. Another 10 litres were seized from his residence. A pan shop owner filed a theft case at Andheri police station on Monday after a thief broke the side metal sheet of his shop and stole cigarettes worth Rs 60,000.

07-04-2020||Mumbai||Close to 160 security staff of Maharashtra CM quarantined||More than 160 members of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackery’s security squad have been quarantined, a day after a tea seller near Thackeray’s residence tested positive for the coronavirus, in the Uttar Bhartiya Sangh building in Bandra (East) and their swab samples have been taken for testing.The tea seller was admitted to the Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Municipal Hospital in Jogeshwari.“Around 160 staffers in the CM’s security squad, who possibly came in contact with the vendor, have been quarantined,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, health department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).“However, there is no need to panic; this is our procedure in the protocol to identify possible high-risk and low-risk contacts to avoid further spread of the disease,” she said. Shah did not confirm whether any member of Thackeray’s family will also be tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Following this development, the state government has replaced all staffers deployed at Matoshree and asked that all employees’ temperature be checked daily.The civic body has also identified four high-risk contacts of the tea seller, including a six-month old baby.As a precautionary measure, the security staff of Union minister of state for social justice, Ramdas Athawale, were replaced on Tuesday. Athawale’s residence is also in the same locality of Bandra (East).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/close-to-160-security-staff-of-maharashtra-cm-quarantined/story-UJAH1S1ObgJBM9IicnWzIP.html
07-04-2020||Mumbai||Virus cases cross 1,000 in Maharashtra; 64 deaths||Maharashtra, on Tuesday, breached the 1,000-mark with 150 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases taking the tally to 1,018, the highest for any Indian state. Tamil Nadu has 690 positive cases, while Delhi reported 525 cases until 9 pm on April 7.This is the steepest one-day rise in Maharashtra since the outbreak, state health department officials said.Of the 150 new cases reported on Tuesday, 116 are from Mumbai, which accounts for 642 cases, the highest among Indian cities. Pune recorded 18 cases on Tuesday, while Nagpur, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar reported two each.Maharashtra recorded 12 Covid-19 related deaths on Tuesday, taking the state’s death toll to 64. Six of the 12 deaths were reported from Mumbai, followed by three in Pune and one each in Nagpur, Thane and Satara. According to the state health department, 34,695 people have been put in home quarantine, while 4,008 are in institutional quarantine. The department said 20,877 tests (5,564 of them in private laboratories) have been carried out so far across the state, resulting in 1,018 positive cases. Seventy-nine patients have been discharged after complete recovery, officials said.The rise in numbers necessitated a state cabinet meeting on Tuesday, held via video conference as some of the ministers were in their constituencies. Senior government officials told HT that ministers pressed for additional testing facilities to understand the spread of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “The government is likely to seek permission for more labs for testing,” an official said. A private laboratory can start testing only if it is certified by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).In March, Maharashtra had applied for and received permission to set up at least seven private laboratories, in addition to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and Kasturba Hospital Lab in Mumbai. “We have increased the number to more than 1,500 tests per day,” a state government official said.According to a minister who attended the cabinet meeting, chief minister (CM( Uddhav Thackeray said the lockdown in the state is unlikely to be lifted on April 14. He said, quoting Thackeray, “The lockdown has helped Maharashtra contain the spread of the virus. Maharashtra was the first to impose restrictions in the second week of March. When the number of patients is rising, we cannot lift the lockdown next week.”Thackeray also clarified that even if the government decides to partially lift the lockdown, after reviewing the situation early next week, it would be within districts and only for unaffected areas. He said that the district borders will remain sealed and the resumption of train services was unlikely.A senior Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) official said on Tuesday that the financial capital’s high numbers are also because the city has tested around 10,500 people since the outbreak. “We have screened nearly 1.5 million people and conducted around 10,500 Sars-Cov-2 tests. This is why the numbers are high,” the official said, requesting anonymity. Mumbai recorded 99, 81 and 68 cases on April 4, 5, and 6 respectively.“Out of the six deceased patients, four had pre-existing respiratory illness, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and other comorbidities,” a city health officer said. “One of six patients had died on March 30, but the cause was confirmed only on Tuesday. None of the deceased had a history of international travel.”According to data compiled by the state’s Medical Education and Drugs Department, Maharashtra’s Covid-19 mortality rate is 5.99%. A senior Mantralaya official said that the cabinet also discussed how Kerala managed to keep its mortality rate low. Kerala had 336 Covid-19 cases until Tuesday, but reported only two deaths. Officials added that the state health department is considering getting in touch with the Kerala government to understand its measures to keep the mortality rate low.A few cabinet colleagues expressed concerns over the high mortality rate. Thackeray however, said the high rate was because of the underlying illnesses the deceased had. “Out of the 52 who died, only 11 had no underlying illnesses. Rest of them had many chronic and serious ailments. The percentage of viral infection against the state population is 0.077% and hence the situation can be said to be under control. The high mortality rate and rise in cases is due to the exclusion of countries like Dubai from the protocol issued by the Centre for monitoring at airports. The initial cases had a travel history of Dubai and had the country been included in the protocol list for monitoring, the cases would have been lesser. Similarly, the state has the highest number of people with the Tablighi Markaj programme, leading to a sharp rise in cases,” a presentation made before the cabinet stated.The presentation before the cabinet members was made by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, public health secretary Pradeep Vyas and Mumbai municipal commisioner Praveen Pardeshi.The cabinet members also demanded more number of testing laboratories at the district level. The ministers were told that the laboratories are approved only after complying with strict protocols and the capacity of 5,500 samples a day was sufficient in the current situation. Pardeshi apprised the cabinet about the aggressive testing being done in Mumbai through portable testing centres and the rapid testing mechanism. The state cabinet on Tuesday decided to widen the scope of thepublic distribution system (PDS) in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak to distribute rice and wheat to orange-card holder families, left out of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) benefits. Around 3.08 lakh people are expected to get 5-kg food grains for May and June at subsidised rates of ₹8 for wheat and ₹12 for rice per kg.Around 7 crore people, holding 1.60 lakh ration cards, get food grains at ₹2 (wheat) and ₹3 (rice), under the NFSA. 25 lakh card holders get 35kg of food grains a month, while the remaining 1.25 lakh card holders get 5kg per person per month. The families are with an annual income of ₹59,000 in urban areas and ₹44,000 in rural areas. There are about 71 lakh families that hold orange cards, like the one covered in the NFSA, but exceed the income limit and have been excluded from the PDS. The state cabinet on Tuesday decided to include these families under the PDS, by announcing to avail them the grains at subsidised rate.“The 71 lakh families or 3.08 lakh people, who had been left out of the scope of NFSA, will now get the food grains at subsidised rates. It will burden us with an additional ₹250 crore in two months,” said an official from the food and civil supplies department. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote a letter to prime minister Narendra Modi and demanded that the additional stock of 1.54 lakh metric tonnes of the grains be provided at the minimum support price in the backdrop of the Covid-19 outbreak. The state government is expected to buy the wheat at ₹23 a kg and rice at ₹27 a kg to distribute through the PDS to the additional families holding the orange cards.State cabinet also decided to widen the scope of the Shiv Bhojan Thali, the meal thali made available at ₹5 through more than 281 centres, by taking it to the tehsil level. The state government has decided to set more such centres in rural areas to ensure that the poor get meals easily available. Currently, around 61,000 such thalis are made available through centres per day to the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/virus-cases-cross-1-000-in-maharashtra-64-deaths/story-gp1lyweKq02j8ZDPCitkaM.html
07-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC’s focus areas to battle Covid-19: Test, distance, front-liners||While the spiraling number of Covid-19 cases and deaths is the biggest challenge for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), civic chief Praveen Pardeshi said they are looking at the way forward to bring down the numbers through aggressive testing, stricter compliance of social distancing, and safeguarding front-liners – doctors, nurses, hospitals’ other employees, municipal and law enforcement staff.Mumbai has recorded (642) over 60% of Maharashtra’s 1,018 Covid-19 cases. “We are aggressively testing and need to continue to do so for early detection of Covid-19 cases. Testing is being carried out even in fever clinics on a war footing. I have now authorised ward officers to engage private laboratories to conduct tests, because government laboratories are going to be overburdened. If a ward officer feels testing on a large scale is needed in any area in his ward, say for example where a Covid-19 positive patient has been found, the BMC will subsidise private lab tests the ward suggests,” said Pardeshi.Currently, 13 laboratories in the city conduct Covid-19 tests, eight of which are private. More than 11,500 tests have been conducted in Mumbai so far, and roughly 4.2% of these cases threw up Covid-19 positive results, according to BMC. More than 5,000 home visits have been conducted so far to screen persons.For stricter compliance of social distancing, the BMC has barred selling of fruits and vegetables on footpaths and in open markets in containment zones. Pardeshi said, “This will cause discomfort. People may have to eat grains for the next 10 to 12 days, but if we want to break the chain in the outbreak, we have to strictly follow this. The BMC noticed purchase of fruits and vegetables on footpaths led to crowding, and became a form of transmission of Covid-19 in high-risk areas.”There are presently 241 containment zones in the city. Sale of vegetables in Dharavi, and Worli was stopped on Tuesday.To reduce the mortality rate, early detection of the infection is crucial. About 70% to 75% of the 40 persons who died in the city due to Covid-19 came to the hospital for medical aid in the advanced stage. They died within a day or less than a day of being admitted. “If the infection was detected earlier, there would have been a better chance of medical assistance for these patients. With more testing, the BMC will be able to detect the infection early, save more lives, and reduce chances of transmission,” the commissioner said.As of April 6, when 490 positive cases were reported in Mumbai, 361 were reported stable, 36 were critical, 59 were discharged, and 34 deaths were recorded.Special care is also needed for patients who have an additional health condition such as heart ailments, diabetes, hypertension, leukemia, among others. “We need to fight the infection in these patients much in advance,” Pardeshi said. The BMC’s one strategy is testing and early detection, the other is caring for these cases in advanced hospitals. There are dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, like Seven Hills, Kasturba, Saifee, Nanavati, Sushrusha and Sai hospital. However, a Covid-19 patient without co-morbidity is not at high risk. “I cannot mix high-risk patients who also have co-morbidity, with other Covid-19 patients who do not have other health issues. When that is happening, I am not able to pay proper attention to these critical patients. So I need to separate them from the other patients and pay better attention to them,” Pardeshi said.Patients with co-morbidity and elderly patients will be moved to sophisticated hospitals with specialised wards only by reference of the doctor treating them.Moreover, high-risk and low-risk persons who have come in contact with Covid-19 positive persons from densely populated areas in the city will be forcefully moved to institutional quarantine facilities. The BMC has up till now traced over 18,305 persons who came in contact with Covid-19 positive persons, and over 1,500 of them were shifted to institutional facilities for quarantine.To safeguard front-liners, the BMC has started administering hydroxycloroquine tablets (HCQ). Mumbai has a stock of over 1 crore tablets for front-liners and patients. The BMC is also procuring rapid testing kits, to determine who is safe to go on field, and who is not, and also determine a person’s susceptibility to the coronavirus. A senior civic officer said, “These can be used in containment zones, and preliminary detection, before a laboratory test is done. The BMC aims to get 50,000 such kits.”It has also begun airlifting of personal protective equipment (PPEs) for all medical staff, from a manufacturing unit in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. While 12,000 PPEs have already been airlifted, 30,000 more will be brought on Thursday. The BMC aims to target getting 35,000 PPEs per week for its doctors and nurses. A senior civic officer said, “It is important to equip all doctors working everywhere in the city with PPEs, because a person with mild symptoms of flu, visiting a nearby dispensary can turn out to be a Covid-19 patient. So not just doctors in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, but all medical professionals should get PPEs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-s-focus-areas-to-battle-covid-19-test-distance-front-liners/story-yC86cyvUG0BewMpa4JAGGO.html

She was admitted to Kalyan’s Railway Hospital on April 3. After she tested positive for coronavirus, she was shifted to Byculla Railway Hospital, where she died.Dombivli recorded another Covid-19 positive case on Tuesday. A 30-year-old woman, a resident of Ayregaon in Dombivli, tested positive but the health officers have failed to trace the source.“We have quarantined her family members. Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation has also taken measures to ensure that the areas they live in are sealed,” said Raju Lavangare, health officer, KDMC.On Tuesday, KDMC said it will seal the border of the twin city and also identify clusters for containment. Around 175 teams are keeping a watch on containment areas. “We have asked the police to seal the border of the twin cities of Kalyan and Dombivli. This will help us check the spread of the virus,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner. Two more positive cases of Covid-19 were found in Thane on Tuesday.

07-04-2020||City||One Jamaat attendee among 2 new Covid-19 cases in Gurugram||Gurugram: The city on Tuesday reported two Covid-19 positive cases, including a 22-year-old man from Pataudi who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event held in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month. Samples of seven of the Jamaat attendee’s family members have been taken and they are admitted to the quarantine facility in Sector 9, health officials said. The patient is currently admitted to the Civil Hospital, Sector 10, the officials said, adding that it is the third case of a Jamaat attendee in Gurugram. Earlier this week, a 27-year-old man from Pataudi and a 38-year-old man from Devi Lal Colony in old Gurugram, who attended the Jamaat congregation, had tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 virus. Four immediate contacts of the former and 11 of the latter were taken to the quarantine facility, where they will be under observation for 14 days.“Since two cases have been reported from Pataudi, we are preparing a containment strategy for the block. Door-to -door screening will soon start. We will also take more samples from the area,” said an official of the health department.In the other positive case reported on Tuesday, a 50-year-old man from Sector 28 got infected with the deadly virus after coming in contact with his son, who had travelled to Bengaluru. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “The boy, who studies in Bengaluru, returned to Gurugram on March 15. He had symptoms like fever and cough, and took medicines. He did not get himself tested. The 50-year-old father, however, got infected. He went for testing on April 4 and was confirmed positive. We have tested the son, who is the coronavirus carrier, and his mother, but both were negative. The father is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city.”The total number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram has reached 18, of which nine have been are discharged and the rest are undergoing treatment in the Civil Hospital and some private hospitals of the city.To prevent infection from spreading in the Civil Hospital, the health department has created an artificial ‘disinfection tunnel’ on the entrance of the hospital. It will spray a mixture of sodium hypochlorite and water on those who will pass through it. According to the statement released by the district administration, all those who enter the hospital will have to walk through this tunnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-jamaat-attendee-among-2-new-covid-19-cases-in-gurugram/story-09wWbPw3uhZynDDxLp3ucM.html
07-04-2020||Gurugram||Mustard, wheat procurement to start in Haryana from April 15 onwards||The Haryana government has decided to set up 2,000 mandis and procurement centres across the state to purchase wheat in phases. The state government has also asked the farmers to get registered by April 19. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, on Tuesday, said that the entire harvested lot of wheat and mustard crops will be purchased by the state government. It has also asked the central government to approve an incentive for the farmers as holding charges for the delay in the procurement.The government also said that it will start the procurement of mustard from April 15 and wheat from April 20. The farmers can register themselves on an online portal called “Meri Fasal-Mera Byora” from till April 19.Khattar, who was addressing a video conference, also asked the farmers to make voluntary contributions of 1-5% of the money they make after selling the produce towards the CM relief fund. “Instead of centralised procurement, the government has decided to set up smaller mandis and purchasing centres at different places where farmers can come at an appointed day and time to sell their produce. I request all farmers to get registered with the government by April 19, which will ease the process of procurement,” he said.Referring to the voluntary contributions, the CM said that if farmers are willing, they can make a contribution at the mandi itself. “They will be asked for a contribution and if they give a nod, the payment will be deducted,” he said, adding that the arhatis (commission agents) will also have to play a crucial role in ensuring smooth procurement and loading and unloading of the produce at newly set-up mandis.The CM also said that, in line with the decision of the Centre of diverting the MPLADS (member of Parliament local area development scheme) funds for fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the Haryana government has decided to divert ₹51 crore from the discretionary funds of the CM, ministers, Speaker and the governor to the Consolidated Fund. “This money will be used to provide food, medicine, and other essential required by the distressed workers. Since the lockdown, the government has distributed 55 lakh food packets and 3.5 lakh dry ration packets to those in need,” said Khattar.Residents of the state, who hold BPL and other cards will be given double the entitled ration and that too free of cost for the next three months. “Those who are above the poverty line can also buy flour, rice and oil from ration shops at discounted prices,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mustard-wheat-procurement-to-start-in-haryana-from-april-15-onwards/story-WUplTwVzC9BgrVvvKvRF9K.html
07-04-2020||Gurugram||Surya Vihar: Residents of one of city’s oldest condos are self-sufficient, help each other out||One of the city’s oldest condominiums, Surya Vihar, in Sector 21, is harnessing the potential of its residents and staff both to deal with the ongoing lockdown that was announced to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Located at the Delhi-Gurugram border, the condominium has sought support from residents who are readily volunteering in different capacities to cater to the needs of fellow community members.Sanjiv Bhargava, president, Surya Vihar Residents’ Welfare Association, said that community members at the over 30-year-old complex were extending a helping hand to each other. “We have a good number of senior citizens living with us. Both members of the RWA and other volunteers make it a point to stay in touch with the elderly regularly, in case any assistance is required by them. Residents keep a check on each other and the staff,” said Bhargava.He added that the condominium has put in place a kitchen service for residents. “We have young people staying with us who can’t cook and are dependent on external sources of food. We reached out to one of our residents who used to work as a chef with a hotel chain and he came on board to start a kitchen service for the community,” said Bhargava.Residents can place orders for vegetarian food for lunch and dinner. For lunch, the order has to be placed by 11am and the orders are delivered from 12.30pm to 2.30pm. For dinner, the order has to be placed by 7pm and the orders are delivered from 8.30pm to 10pm.Sony Yadav, former RWA president, said that the kitchen service was proving to be useful in the time of limited or no app-based food delivery. “The in-house food facility is beneficial for bachelors or students who are not adept at cooking. It also ensures that exposure to the outside world is reduced. So far, the service has been working smoothly, said Yadav.The condominium has two grocery stores and vegetable shops within the premises that cater to the needs of the residents. While social distancing markers have not been created on the ground, shopkeepers ensure that people maintain a gap of two metres while purchasing commodities.Given the lockdown, the apartment has cut down the strength of its staff and curtailed services. The condominium is managing with a skeleton staff that keeps essential services running, and the size of the maintenance team has been reduced to five people per shift. The staff has been provided with boarding and lodging facilities within the condominium to reduce the chances of exposure.“We have curtailed our staff and provided boarding and lodging facilities to them within the complex. We don’t want our staff to be exposed to any kind of risk. They are staying within and providing services with the support of the community,” said Bhargava. The RWA has also asked women employees to stay home. “We decided that it was better for women in the support team to stay back home. We wanted to ensure that their families are taken care of and children are not left unattended,” said Bhargava. The condominium has also advised residents to minimise garbage generation since the majority of the cleaning staff at the condominium stays in Delhi, and only a skeleton staff is staying within the complex.The condominium has restricted the entry of part-time domestic help such as maids, cooks, drivers among others. Residents were advised to give paid leaves to their domestic help. Both food and courier delivery services at the condominium are continuing and have been restricted to the entrance of the condominium gate. Residents are required to collect their parcels from the gate. All persons entering the building with deliveries are thermal-scanned and mandatorily required to use sanitisers. Within the condominium, common areas are regularly sanitised and disinfected daily. The lifts are disinfected twice a day. Newspapers are being delivered at the condominium but not until the doorsteps. Residents are required to collect the papers from the guards’ desk in respective blocks.For medical assistance, the condominium has turned to a resident doctor for help who can be consulted in the evening during a fixed slot. The facility is aimed at ensuring that residents avoid venturing out for minor illnesses and be given timely treatment, as the situation may demand. Additionally, paramedics and other medical professionals are allowed entry into the condominium.“The condominium used to see a daily footfall of around 300 people earlier, but now, it has dropped to less than 25 people a day. People are abiding by the measures and helping each other out. Everyone understands the gravity of social distancing,” said Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/surya-vihar-residents-of-one-of-city-s-oldest-condos-are-self-sufficient-help-each-other-out/story-QRXmIAYv0GqNnXJq4qdNcO.html
07-04-2020||Gurugram||Pataudi Covid patient with Tablighi Jamaat link booked; second such case in two days||A man from Pataudi, who had tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday, was booked for allegedly hiding information, the police said on Monday. This is the second such case in two days—the police had registered an FIR against a 38-year-old man from Old Gurgaon, who had tested positive for Covid-19, for allegedly concealing information.Both the patients were among 25 people who had attended a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in March in Delhi. Last week, the police had said that 22 of 25 identified persons were sent to a quarantine facility in Sector 9 while the remaining three were yet to be traced.The police said the second FIR was registered against a resident of Pataudi under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Pataudi police station for allegedly disobeying an order promulgated by a public servant by leaving his house under complete lockdown.Earlier, on Sunday, the police had lodged a case against a resident of Devilal Colony under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC, Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act at Sector 9 A police station.A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that in both the cases, the persons had failed to inform the authorities regarding their participation in the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi and risked the potential spread of infection to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pataudi-covid-patient-with-tablighi-jamaat-link-booked-second-such-case-in-two-days/story-Mj6k8w2hE6hsEfDiNj0lGJ.html
07-04-2020||City||‘Haryana in Stage 2, elaborate containment plan in place for each district’||As the number of Covid-19 positive cases in Haryana reached 119, with 79 of them linked to the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, the state health department has geared up to increase testing to prevent further local transmission. Rajeev Arora, Haryana’s additional chief secretary, health department, talks to Archana Mishra about the measures taken to deal with the contagion, local transmission, testing facilities and safety of front-line healthcare workers. In the last few days, there has been a spike in the number of cases in the state. As per the state health bulletin, Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal and Nuh are among the worst affected. At what rate is the number of cases increasing and what is the current status?Till today, the number of positive cases in the state is 119, of which 15 have been discharged. We have 102 active patients. Of these, 79 are Jamaat attendees while 23 are either overseas travellers or those who came in contact with Covid-19 patients. These 79 cases are from Palwal, Nuh and Faridabad. We are undertaking extensive screening, sampling, and testing in the state to trace cases and prevent local transmission. The sample and testing size is increasing in the state and based on that, we are putting people in quarantine and isolation wards. We have also traced 105 contacts of the 79 patients who took part in the Jamaat. As per the information shared by the home department, 1,528 Jamaat attendees have been identified in the state. Irrespective of their symptoms, we have tested 1,100 of them so far. The process is ongoing. Are there any Covid-19 hot spots in Haryana? Earlier, the Central government placed Gurugram in the Covid-19 hot spot category after it reported the maximum positive cases in Haryana. Now, Hathin in Palwal and Nuh are the two hot spots, while Faridabad, because of its population density is a potential hot spot. Some villages in Palwal and Nuh were sealed. At which stage of transmission are we in the state and what is the containment strategy? I would still say we are in Stage 2, as we can identify symptomatic persons and their contacts. We have an elaborate containment plan for each district, being handled by the deputy commissioners. We are doing contact tracing along with a door-to-door screening of people in the defined containment villages. On Monday, we identified 37 critical villages in Nuh and on Tuesday, identified 14 more villages where screening and testing are a priority. Extensive screening and sampling are being done in Ambala and Panchkula too. It will continue for now. How many people in the state are under quarantine and what percentage of it tested positive for the coronavirus?After the Tablighi Jamaat incident, the number of patients has increased rapidly. At least 12-14% of people, who are currently under quarantine, have tested positive for Covid-19. We have to contain the disease and ensure the entire population is protected. Public health experts have said that extensive testing needs to be done in cities like Gurugram, having a high number of overseas travellers. According to them, vigilance and contact tracing is relatively successful, but testing asymptomatic patients is also crucial. What is your take on it? We are ramping up testing and sampling in the state. As per the state health bulletin, only 750 samples were being tested until three days ago. Today, the number is more than 2,300. It shows we are thoroughly testing people, especially knowing the gravity of the Jamaat incident. How many labs are actively doing PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests in the state? Two government labs — PGIMS, Rohtak, and a medical college in Sonepat — are conducting testing. They are directly procuring kits from manufacturers and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Five private labs are also authorised to conduct testing. Since the rate of sampling has increased, we are sending samples to private labs., with more than 150 samples sent from Palwal and Nuh in the last few days. To speed up testing, a government lab has been set up in Faridabad’s ESIC Hospital from Monday. Also, by Wednesday, a CSIR lab in Chandigarh will be functional. The state government is also authorised to send samples to Dr Lal Path labs and Dr Dangs lab in Delhi. The ICMR has said that these two labs approved for Delhi can take samples from Haryana.The state is soon going to start the rapid antibody test. How many kits is the state expected to receive in phase 1? What are the protocols for its usage?We will be procuring it in the next two to three days. PGIMS, Rohtak, is setting up the protocol for its usage — how it will be used in hot spots to check community transmission and sample size of the population for testing. By Wednesday, we will have clarity on the usage of the antibody test kits based on the number of kits we receive. How is the state addressing the issue? How many personal protective equipment (PPE) kits are available against the total demand? PPE is a consumable item. The important thing is to have stock available so that it can last for a few days even if there is a delay in the supply of kits. We have enough PPE kits as the state government has been procuring it and flexibility has been given to do on-spot purchase through Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited (HMSCL) as they are floating e-tenders.What is the current line of treatment for Covid-19 patients in the state?We are following the ICMR guidelines. Also, we have enough stock of hydroxychloroquine, with at least 12-13 lakh tablets. So far, how many Covid-19 patients have been put under critical care? How prepared is the state to provide tertiary care to positive cases? Luckily, all the Covid-19 patients are being treated in isolation wards. Nobody, as such, has required critical care, but we are concentrating on ventilators and the supply of other equipment required for treatment. We have 1,100 ventilators in the state and 400 more will be arriving shortly.Officials have said that the state government plans to release the lockdown in districts that are presently free of infection on April 14. Could you elaborate on the plan?Nothing can be said, as of now. The health department has shared its inputs with the state and central governments. It is up to them to decide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-in-stage-2-elaborate-containment-plan-in-place-for-each-district/story-eQ3MaGWPzVr33NeTeksoQM.html
07-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra looking to create more no-go zones||With the total number of Covid-19 cases breaching the 1,000-mark, the state government is now focused on containment and increasing testing capacity. The state officials said the positive cases are increasing in urban areas – mainly Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad – and so the focus will be on creating containment zones in these areas.In the past four days, Mumbai has seen a jump of 265 cases from 377 positive cases on April 4 to 642 on April 7. While Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad saw a rise of 69 cases between April 4 and April 7, Thane and Palghar districts have seen a steady rise from 77 positive cases on April 4 to 99 cases on April 7. The state government is working on the 3-Ts mantra –tracking, testing and treatment. The state health department has made a strong case for testing more people as a proactive step. State officials said the other municipal corporations in the MMR will now replicate the containment zone that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started to curb the spread of the virus outside of a cluster. Soon, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Panvel, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad will have containment zones and areas will be sealed if positive cases are found.On Tuesday, BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi gave a presentation during the state cabinet meeting on the containment zones in Mumbai. So far, Mumbai has 241 containment zones, including Worli Koliwada and parts of Dharavi, which have been sealed. A portion of Kala Nagar in Bandra East, where chief minister Uddhav Thackeray resides, has been sealed after a tea vendor tested positive for coronavirus on Monday.“The shutdown by the state government and subsequent lockdown announced by the Centre has helped us control the spike that was expected in the first week of April. The figures that we see today are under control. However, we are prepared to tackle the growing numbers,” an official said. The state government through various agencies has taken over hotels, hostels, schools, universities to be converted into isolation facilities.Another Mantralaya official said the cases are increasing in densely populated areas. “Besides tracing, we want to start testing aggressively. We are soon starting antibody tests to ascertain how many people have been infected by the virus, but developed antibodies to fight it. The BMC has started Safe And Fast Evaluation Swab Technique’ (SAFEST) machine at Kasturba Hospital, allowing for safe and rapid testing for Covid-19. Through this, we can collect 1,500 swab samples for increase testing capacity. Similar machines would be set up elsewhere,” the Mantralaya official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-maharashtra-looking-to-create-more-no-go-zones/story-K6MH80DWpdmxnshGNnMAUL.html
07-04-2020||Mumbai||Experts: ‘Need more checks in Covid-19 containment zones’||As the number of Covid-19 cases across Maharashtra continues to rise past the 1,000 mark, experts from across the country have suggested more testing and limited surveys in containment zones to understand the prevalence of the virus.“Given the scale of the city and its high population density, certainly more testing is called for. We know that for every symptomatic case, there is a much larger number who remain asymptomatic,” said Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, Sonepat (Haryana) and adjunct faculty at the department of biological sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Colaba. “One expects that the current numbers of positive cases don’t accurately reflect the true numbers of those infected.”Experts have pointed out that inadequate testing can result in asymptomatic cases silently spreading the disease. “The less testing we do, the less we know about the reach of the epidemic. Of course, it is also unfortunately true that widespread testing has its own logistical/financial difficulties,” said Dr Satyajit Rath, retired scientist from the Delhi-based National Institute of Immunology and adjunct faculty at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune.In addition to civic and government-run hospitals and research institutes, four private laboratories in Mumbai have been approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research to conduct real-time polymerase chain reaction testing for RNA virus (coronavirus). However, asymptomatic individuals are being discouraged from undergoing tests because the focus is to first test people displaying Covid-19 symptoms.“Testing asymptomatic people would support and facilitate a general panic-driven tendency of those who can afford it to test themselves repeatedly, leading to a shortage of tests for those who need them, and also a false sense of security from a so-called ‘negative’ test,” said Dr Rath. “Testing asymptomatic people is probably best done, under the current circumstances, by state health care systems in a carefully planned fashion with epidemiological utility, rather than ‘on-demand’.With Worli Koliwada emerging as the hotspot for Covid-19 cases in the city, the civic body has sealed over 280 containment zones. While family members, neighbours and those who have been in close contact with the Covid-19 patient undergo tests in containment zones, the remaining populace also has to observe the 14-day quarantine period.Stating that it is not feasible to test everyone in containment zones at the moment, Menon also suggested undertaking limited surveys in that region, to understand the prevalence of the disease.“One can then zoom in on regions where the infection appears to be larger, or where a cluster of cases have been reported, and test extensively there while trying to maintain some level of physical distancing in other areas so that spreading is prevented,” said Menon. “High-density urban regions are a particular nightmare when it comes to containing an epidemic. Mumbai is no different.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/experts-need-more-checks-in-covid-19-containment-zones/story-ay5IOVhIbufF7UdkgWlb3M.html
07-04-2020||Delhi||Duo in Narela quarantine facility booked for defecating in open||The Delhi Police have registered a first information report (FIR) against two persons for allegedly defecating in a corridor of a quarantine centre in outer Delhi’s Narela, where those who had attended Tablighi Jamaat congregations have been placed. They were evacuated from a Markaz in Delhi’s Nizamuddin on March 31. The police said the two men had defecated on the second-floor corridor, outside the flat where they are staying. A case was registered on April 4 on the complaint of the in-charge of three housing blocks of Delhi Development Authority (DDA) that have been re-purposed as quarantine centres. The DDA flats, yet to be occupied since construction, were the first to be re-purposed as quarantine centres.“...the persons residing in 212 second floor...are the suspect of the above said act and not following the instruction of health department/government and helping the spread of Novel Corona Virus and put the life of people at risk and jeopardize the entire containment measure,” the FIR read.The official said that on April 4, sanitation workers reported the incident in B-block to the housekeeping supervisor. “The housekeeping staff complained that people in quarantine often created a commotion, misbehaved with them and were not following the social distancing norms. After the open defecation incident, we filed a complaint with the police,” a government official said. Joint commissioner of police (northern range), Manish Kumar Aggarwal, said, “We registered a case under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) of the Indian Penal Code after the matter was brought to our notice.”According to a senior Delhi government official, this is not the first time such an incident has been reported. “We asked the police to register a FIR, as these people had defecated in the corridors earlier as well. We had warned them, but some of them continue to misbehave and not follow quarantine rules,” said the official.Nearly 1,000 people of more than 2,350 people, including foreigners, who were evacuated from the Markaz, where they had assembled for religious congregations last month, are at the Delhi government-run quarantine facilities and hospitals in the city. Earlier, The Uttar Pradesh government invoked the stringent National Security Act against six quarantined persons, after staffers of a hospital in Ghaziabad had alleged harassment by those placed in quarantine after attending the congregations. Health officials had accused them of making lewd remarks and roaming naked on the hospital premises. They were later shifted to an isolation ward in a private educational institution.Four days ago, two inmates at a quarantine facility, set up in an institute, in Narela had managed to escape, prompting the police to register a case and launch a search operation. They were found at their houses in east Delhi’s Patparganj village and brought back to the quarantine centre. “We had immediately informed the police and the two men were brought back to the facility,” said an official, on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/duo-in-narela-quarantine-facility-booked-for-defecating-in-open/story-slWuX3HekkH4kNJBS8JFmJ.html
07-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 lockdown: Retailers allege shortage of essentials, APMC promises enough supply||While there may not be an actual scarcity of vegetables and grocery items in Mumbai, various factors like relocation and demolition of several markets, irregular transportation, as well as lack of manpower have impacted the supply chain of essential goods and contributed to some lag and shortage in essentials. Speculation that the lockdown may be extended further has also led to panic buying that has added to this perceived shortage. To add to this, the Mumbai civic body has now decided to ban the selling of vegetables in all the 241 containment zones in the city.While Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) in Vashi, where the city sources most of its vegetables from, confirmed that there is no shortage of vegetables, smaller vendors and retailers are finding it difficult to source and sell their produce. APMC wholesale market director (vegetable market), Shankar Pingle said that close to 100-150 trucks of vegetables arrive at the Vashi market every day. “There is absolutely no shortage,” he said. However, a local vendor from central Mumbai said that the stock of potatoes, onions, ivy gourds, and some leafy vegetables are less.“Supply from the Vashi market is restricted. Authorities have also shut the Dadar market from where we used to get the main supply,” the vendor said. Similarly, a vendor from Shastri Market in Matunga, Avinash Verma, said that before the lockdown, he would get stock for a week but now getting an adequate supply for a day is also difficult. Many leading grocery outlets undertaking regular supply are facing the brunt. Most Hyper grocery outlets are not offering home delivery options unless in bulk to mega complexes. “There is no guarantee of what you will get. It is very erratic supply,” said Binita Shah, a resident from Parel. “We are now buying in more quantities since we anticipate the lockdown will be extended.”To avoid crowding at markets, several housing complexes are either getting produce directly from farmers’ groups or asking vendors to set up bi-weekly stalls in their premises. Farm to Home, a Nasik-based group of farmers, supplies vegetables and fruits directly to housing complexes in the eastern suburbs, from Vikroli to Chembur. A vendor who sets up stalls in housing complexes, Mahesh T, said, “Earlier, I would get vegetables from Vashi but now it is a time consuming and tedious process to buy vegetables from there. I am getting vegetables directly from farmers in Nasik now.” Despite complaints from retailers, APMC grain traders said that food grains and pulses stock is also adequate. “It will easily last for one month to 45 days but people must refrain from panic buying,” said Umang Sejpal, who supplies wheat in wholesale. The food grain market is now letting in retailers on alternate days for crowd control. “We have also asked our traders to limit work between 10am and 5.30pm,” said Nilesh Vira, APMC director (food grains). The Maharashtra government has provided helpline numbers through which citizens can call in case of a shortage of food grains or other essential services. An official from the control room said, “We are getting close 2,500 calls related to supply shortage every day. Once we get a complaint, we direct it to the district authorities. In the last few days, there has been a shortage of oil but we are resolving most complaints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-lockdown-retailers-allege-shortage-of-essentials-apmc-promises-enough-supply/story-wn4Zu6M4eIAYW1EBkAbVsI.html
07-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: 50K rapid testing kits, 30K PPEs ordered||Prepping to face a major challenge of ensuring testing in densely-populated areas, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will procure 50, 000 rapid testing kits to identify people infected with Covid-19. The finger prick antibody test provides results within 30 minutes.The BMC has also decided to airlift personal protective equipment (PPE) for all medical health professionals and frontline staff.The rapid testing kits are said to be helpful in slums and other congested areas in the city which can be hot spots or containment zones. Civic officials said that the kits will also be used for medical staff, to ensure their safety. Nearly 15, 000 frontline workers across the city have to be screened on an immediate basis. While 12,000 PPEs have already been airlifted from Coimbatore, 30,000 more will be airlifted on Thursday. To ensure smooth transport and quick availability of the PPEs, a manufacturing unit is being set up in Navi Mumbai to supply the equipment. Officials said that a major concern is the safety of medical staff in constant contact with patients. “The requirement of PPEs is 35,000 to 40,000 per week. The unit to be set up in Navi Mumbai will hopefully ensure ease in meeting the requirements. All of this is being done free of cost, using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds,” said a civic official.The BMC also has plans to procure nearly 400 ventilators to deal with the shortage. Recently, 35 ventilators were procured through CSR. “We have placed orders for more ventilators but due to unavailability in the market, we will have to wait a little longer,” said the official. Around 450 Mylab kits that can conduct 45,000 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are also being supplied through CSR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-50k-rapid-testing-kits-30k-ppes-ordered/story-IzKczc2LsGISj9Aaong2ZK.html
07-04-2020||City||Containment exercise in Deenpur village and Dwarka Sec 11 after cases emerge||New Delhi: The Delhi government stepped up containment measures in southwest Delhi’s Deenpur, a rural village in Najafgarh area, on Tuesday after three family members of Santosh Shokeen, the south corporation’s councillor from Nangli Sakrawati ward tested positive for Covid-19. According to a senior Delhi government official, houses in a one-kilometre radius will be screened, and a containment plan is in place, though the area has not been officially been declared a ‘containment zone’.Similar measures were put in place in a housing society in Dwarka’s Sector 11 after two people in the society tested positive for the disease. The two people, who are being treated at Lok Nayak hospital, had visited the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin. They were living with six other people in a rented apartment, all of whom have now been shifted to an institutional quarantine facility in the sub-city.Though the two areas have not been declared containment zones, all containment measures are being taken in these two areas, said a senior Delhi government official. In Deenpur village, which has one of the first few cases of Covid-19 reported from a rural area in Delhi, the person who tested positive is a former area councillor, Sukhbir Shokeen, and husband of sitting area councillor Santosh Shokeen of the Congress.“His mother and daughter have also tested positive. His wife and others who were in contact have been placed in home quarantine. We have started door-to-door screening of people,” said the Delhi government official. The district surveillance staff is trying to trace the contact history of Sukhbir Shokeen to ascertain from where he contracted the infection. As he is a public figure, the government agencies are screening all his contacts in the last few days.Santosh Shokeen, who lives in a joint family, said, “Close to 10-15 members of our family are in home quarantine, while the three affected are in hospital. Ever since the lockdown, he used to daily go out to give food to needy people. I think he contracted the infection there.”Though Deenpur is a rural village, there are several unauthorised colonies in the area.A resident of the village said, “The police have been going door-to-door to find out the number of people living and whether they are owners or tenants. Now that a person has tested positive, we want each household to be screened.”According to two senior Delhi government officials, the two who had tested positive in Dwarka were visiting a couple who live in a housing society along with four others.According to the Delhi government officials, the two people were taken for testing following a complaint by locals.“The two people who have tested positive had visited the Markaz in Nizamuddin. They have been sent to Lok Nayak hospital and others have been shifted to a quarantine facility in Dwarka,” said a second senior government official. “It will take four to five days to screen all households in the two areas. We have deployed our staff and asked for additional hands from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation,” said the official.Another official added, “We got the information on Monday and have prepared a containment plan for the two areas. We have not declared the two areas containment areas, as there is no community transmission reported so far. But measures are being taken to ensure there is no further transmission of the disease,” said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/containment-exercise-in-deenpur-village-and-dwarka-sec-11-after-cases-emerge/story-qCta1KBRE9uLN8C8dR2NwO.html
07-04-2020||City||Markaz’s neighbour, Nizamuddin East is fighting hard against anxiety||From releasing a bulletin of everyday updates to creating a book bank to reaching out to its frontline workers, residents of Nizamuddin East are leaving no stone unturned to keep the Sars-Cov-2 and the anxiety it has caused at bay. The upscale south Delhi neighbourhood is separated only by a road stretch from Nizamuddin West, which houses the Markaz (Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarter)—now the biggest hot spot of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.Though the situation is far more settled now, the residents’ association here said since Nizamuddin East shares its name with its neighbour across the road—which has now come to be known more for the coronavirus cluster— a number of food and grocery delivery apps have stopped catering to the area. “We have been taking all precautions and the only repercussion we are now facing in the aftermath of the Markaz episode is that delivery apps have completely stopped taking orders from the area. I received calls from many residents in the colony that they are not able to use these online services since the spread of the disease at the Markaz came to light. This is probably because of the similarity in names. We have tried to reach out to the service providers, but there has been no word from them so far,” Sushmita Bakshi, secretary, Nizamuddin East Colony Association (NECA), said.She added that initially when the news about numerous Jamaati members testing positive for Covid-19 broke out, there was a lot of panic among the residents. This was mainly because the Markaz is just next door and some of the essential service providers such as banks are located there. The area has been sanitised routinely since then and Nizamuddin East residents feel a less vulnerable now. The Markaz is the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, the outfit that held a congregation of over 2,000 pilgrims, including many international travellers, in early March.At least 331 people who attended the congregation have tested positive for Covid-19 in Delhi so far. Established post-partition, Nizamuddin East is home to several politicians, authors and expats. Both Nizamuddin East and West are located amid Mughal-era monuments and share a common heritage. Ever since the lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, Nizamuddin East residents who would otherwise go to the Nizamuddin Dargah or visit the Basti (adjoining the Markaz) for social work have not been to Nizamuddin West except for maybe visiting the banks. “The colony is within a 3km radius of the hot spot, and so there is still some anxiety among residents. We have been trying to send all updates in the matter to all residents so that they have a reliable source of information,” Bakshi said. In one such circular issued last week, the association had requested residents who may have visited the Markaz or had come into contact with anyone who attended the congregation to identify themselves to the authorities and get tested. It also urged the residents to suspend all activities in the Nizamuddin Basti and the neighbourhood. “We get updates on day-to-day developments from the association. Usually, there would be many who would visit Nizamuddin West for offering Friday prayers, but nobody has been there since the lockdown. Recently, some residents also received a call from the police to check on their travel history,” Ursila Ali, a resident, said.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that based on data from the health department, the police are devising different strategies including tracing six-month travel history of residents to identify people who may have come in contact with Covid-19 positive patients. He added that there is no movement across the road and barricades have been placed on the road leading to the Markaz.Meanwhile, to ensure that workers in the colony including the twelve security guards, the sanitation staff, and the vegetable vendors are taken care of, the association provides them cooked meals everyday. “We have made a roster assigning different families with the responsibility of providing a day’s meal to all the 15-20 workers. Also, a small group of residents here remains in constant touch with senior citizens to provide them any essential item they may need so that they don’t have to step out themselves,” Nina Chatrath, a resident, said.Out of the 10 gates in the colony, only one gate has been left open for essential service providers such as delivery agents and sanitation staff to be let in. The colony is also sanitised regularly.The residents have also roped in the local councillor with whose help a book bank at the colony’s community centre has been set up. Councillor Yasmin Kidwai, who is also a colony resident, said that since all book shops are closed, it might be a good idea to have a place where one can go and pick up a book to read. “We thought of creating a book bank to engage children, as it’s hard to keep them indoors. All residents are free to donate books. Even adults can come over and read at a distance. We will follow all the social distancing measures in the exercise,” Kidwai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/markaz-s-neighbour-nizamuddin-east-is-fighting-hard-against-anxiety/story-iEOjUz77Kurp54Pw4O16RP.html
07-04-2020||City||UP initiates psycho-social counselling, patient pooling to tackle Covid crisis||The Uttar Pradesh (UP) health department, on Tuesday, initiated a number of measures to tackle the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the state. These measures include patient pooling, alternate facilities for asymptomatic patients, and psycho-social counselling to help people deal better with the disease. The officials said that figures of UP till Tuesday afternoon stood at 314, while 168 of these included people linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi.The officials said that there has been a lot of emphasis over the concept of psycho-social counselling of people, who feel mentally stressed in the present scenario. As such, the health department has roped in a team of 100 counsellors, who will be taking up calls and speak with callers seeking psychological counselling.“There has been a lot of emphasis on psycho-social counselling of patients and people amid the present Covid-19 scenario. For this purpose, we have already opened up our helpline number, 18001805145, which solves queries of people regarding Covid-19. Now, this helpline will be more fruitful as we have a team of 100 counsellors, who will help people deal with mental stress in the present circumstances,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health). “From Tuesday onwards, anyone calling for counselling will be connected to our counsellors and the caller can speak to them,” he added.Additionally, the UP government has recently floated the Covid care fund in order to strengthen the medical and healthcare infrastructure in the state to deal with Covid-19 cases and also for any future upsurge.To deal with Covid-19 cases, the government has also started with dedicated hospitals and has introduced a three-layered hospital system for Covid-19 positive patients.The L1 category hospitals (in every district) will be at the lowest end, where all Covid-19 patients will be treated. In case, they face some complications, the Covid-19 patients from L1 category hospitals will be shifted to L2 category. In case of critical cases, the patients from L2 will be shifted to L3 hospitals, which have super specialty facilities.“It is seen that there are districts where Covid-19 positive patients are fewer in number (for instance 2-3 patients). Even for smaller number of patients, we have to rope in resources, fill staff and also bring up a new hospital for their treatment. As such, we have given special powers to the divisional commissioners to pool in patients. Under this scheme, the divisional commissioner can shift a certain number of patients from one district to another under his/her division,” Prasad said.“This way, patients can come under one bigger hospital where staff and resources are already available. This can save our manpower and resources as well,” he added.In another initiative, Prasad also said that it has come to light that about 75% of Covid-19 patients were asymptomatic but found to be positive for Covid-19 in the test results.“In order to lodge asymptomatic patients away from symptomatic patients, we have decided to hire lodges, hotels or hostels near the hospital complex. In such places, all the asymptomatic patients will be kept and they will be treated by a dedicated team of health and paramedical staff. Once these asymptomatic patients move to hotels, lodges or hostels, their beds in the hospital willbecome vacant. These can be used up for treating other Covid-19 positve patients, who have complications or need immediate help,” Prasad said. He added that a government order to this effect will also be issued by Tuesday night and sent to all district magistrates in the state.Meanwhile in Ghaizabad, the number of Covid-19 positive cases stood at 23 on Tuesday evening. The officials said that figure has stood at 23 since Saturday evening and no new positive cases have emerged in the district.“On Tuesday, we received 112 test reports and all were negative. So the count since Saturday evening has stood at 23. So far, we have quarantined 263 people who attended various religious congregations. The containment exercise has also been taken up vigorously in different areas of the city,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).On Tuesday, the health department also installed a new machine with the help of which people can come and give their samples to check for Covid-19. “The setup contains a shield between the person who takes samples and the one who comes for giving the sample. There is a windscreen in between the two. The person collecting the samples will put his hands in gloves attached to the screen and take samples without any chance of getting infected,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-initiates-psycho-social-counselling-patient-pooling-to-tackle-covid-crisis/story-SsvdqhYI4vk7ylC68sjKYK.html

The officials have also advised high-rises to install incinerators on their premises to dispose of masks and sanitary pads, which are termed hazardous waste.The city has about 300 high-rises in different areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali, Crossings Republik and Raj Nagar Extension, among others.“In the meantime, the RWAs and apartment owners’ associations can collect the used masks at a single point in their building and then alert our zonal officers to collect them. A door-to-door collection vehicle will transport the masks to the incinerators. People should also understand that throwing away used masks could be hazardous for others,” Dinesh Chandra, municipal commissioner, said.The corporation has also arranged for 10,000 cotton masks for all its officials and cleaning staff.“The cotton masks are beneficial as they can be washed and reused. We are also taking precaution that no masks disposed of in public places are taken to the landfill. All masks are destroyed in the incinerators,” Chandra said.Apart from the daily garbage collection, the corporation is also engaged in sanitization work of Covid-19 hot spot areas and quarantine centres.The civic body has roped in five big machines to spray a mixture of water and disinfectant besides 17 other smaller spraying machines to sanitize different areas. The spraying activity has been taken up in 100 residential wards.On Tuesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath also stressed on the use of cotton masks to prevent the spread of the virus.“These are less expensive and provide better protection. Their use has also been recommended by the World Health Organization. We have also roped in a number of women self-help groups for making these cotton masks,” Adityanath said.Environmentalists said masks should not be left in public places or thrown away casually.“They can spread the infection to others. People should also avoid throwing masks in with their daily garbage. Otherwise, used masks will land at the landfill from where they can further infect scrap collectors,” Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-civic-body-advises-high-rises-to-install-incinerators-to-dispose-of-masks/story-cp1MnXWj0OyfbioaXS2AwO.html
07-04-2020||City||Review on lifting lockdown only after consultation with Centre: UP CM||The Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said that any decision on lifting of the lockdown after April 14 will be taken after consultation with the Centre. He, however, said that a review on lockdown is expected after April 12.CM Adityanath was speaking during a video conference with mediapersons of all 75 districts in the state. He raised concerns about the rising number of Covid-19 positive cases which have surged in Uttar Pradesh in the past four-five days, ever since a few people returned after attending a religious congregation in Delhi.“The lifting of the lockdown will depend on the number of Covid-19 positive cases and the Centre will be consulted. As of now, we have about 314 positive cases and 168 of these are linked to members of the Tablighi Jamaat. We have increased surveillance and even reached interior areas in different cities to trace people who are in hiding,” the chief minister said.On Monday, Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had said that he would appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to extend the lockdown.“We are also trying to trace the contacts of Covid-19 positive people linked to the Tablighi Jamaat. Had these cases not taken place, we would have been in control of the situation,” Adityanath added.He said that to check the spread of Covid-19, clusters have been identified and surveillance systems have already been activated. As per the number of Covid-19 cases, Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Kanpur and Meerut, among other districts, have emerged as hotspots with high numbers of Covid-19 positive cases.“Through the CM’s helpline (1076), we have reached the Gram Panchayats and are seeking information about people who have returned. Many of them have been quarantined for 14 days and they will further be kept in home-isolation. People from the Tablighi Jamaat are still in hiding and they should come forward. We are working on identifying them,” he added.Adityanath, on March 30, had visited the Gautam Budh Nagar district to review the health and medical facilities in the district and rapped officials on their knuckles. Following this, former district magistrate BN Singh was transferred out and new district magistrate Suhas LY was brought in.The CM also visited Ghaziabad the next day but cut his visit short and flew back to Lucknow to take stock of the situation when reports of thousands of people who attended a religious congregation at Delhi’s Nizamuddin came to light.On Monday, Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), said that the lifting of the lockdown after April 14 would not be possible until there was a single Covid-19 case pending in the state.“So it cannot be said that lockdown will be lifted after April 14. Our health teams, police and officers are putting in a lot of effort and they will have to work for a longer period. People’s participation is also required now,” he had said.Initially, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister had announced a lockdown of 16 districts in the state on April 22. The 16 districts included Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. Thereafter, in his address to the nation, Prime Minister Modi, on the night of March 24, had announced a countrywide lockdown for 21 days, which is scheduled to end on April 14.CM Adityanath also said that he has appealed to the management of schools not to ask for fees during the lockdown period.“We have also appealed to them to give salary to their staff and teachers. We cannot force them but we are taking steps to defer the payment of fees for a couple of months,” he said in response to a query raised over the issue.He also added that the state health department will also get about 10,000 portable ventilators in another 10 days’ time from a Noida-based company and each set will cost only about ₹1.5 lakh to ₹2 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/review-on-lifting-lockdown-only-after-consultation-with-centre-up-cm/story-8zyAXE3GGyorqJ8xfbdobL.html
07-04-2020||Noida||HCQS sale regulated in GB Nagar after people and doctors start hoarding drug||The guidelines to procure antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQS), which is in huge demand across the world owing to reports that the drug can be used to pre-empt the onset of Covid -19, has been tightened in Gautam Budh Nagar to prevent its hoarding and ensure its availability to patients who are in need of them.The antimalarial drug is also used in the treatment of auto immune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and porphyria cutanea tarda. The district health department has already procured over 7,000 tablets for its usage as a prophylaxis (medicine to prevent the onset of a disease) in the Covid-19 treatment. Another medicine which is being used in Covid-19 treatment is tamiflu, which is used to treat influenza types A and B.According to the officials, 15 days ago, HCQS went out of stock as many private hospital doctors had hoarded the medicine in large numbers after the government approved its use as a prophylaxis. The public also rushed to buy the medicine as a precautionary measure.The medicine was notified as a Schedule H1 drug by the central government in the third week of March, making a physician’s prescription mandatory for purchase of the medicine. Previously, it was not necessary to show a doctor’s prescription to buy HCQS.“We have asked wholesalers to first check the retailer’s stock details before giving them new stock. The retailer has to show the quantity sold, the patient’s details and the doctor’s credentials to ensure that no hoarding takes place. We have also asked the wholesalers to give only half the quantity of what is asked for by the retailer,” AK Jain, assistant commissioner, food safety and drug Administration department, said.“We had come to know that a lot of doctors had bought the medicine in huge quantities, creating a temporary shortage in the market. Most of the wholesalers are in Ghaziabad and they have been given the required instructions to ensure that there is no shortage,” Jain said.The chemists’ association of Gautam Budh Nagar said HCQS is going out of stock at most of the places following the increased demand and restrictions in place. There are around 2,500 medical shops in the district and currently only about 600 of them are open. Many aren’t able to open as they are situated in the interior areas and supply has been affected following the lockdown. Most of the shops don’t have hydroxychloroquine because many have kept it for themselves and their families,” Anoop Khanna, president, chemists’ association, said.The Indian Medical Association (Noida) is also going to raise the issue of hydroxychloroquine shortage with the authorities. “In the next meeting with the DM and the chief medical officer, we will discuss the issue of availability of the tablet. We need to ensure that private hospitals don’t face any shortage as the malaria season has also arrived,” Dr NK Sharma, president, IMA, Noida, said. “Doctors are taking hydroxychloroquine as prophylactic while treating Covid-19 patients. We are also giving this and tamiflu to patients and they have been responding well to these drugs,” Dr Saurabh Shrivastava, head, department of medicine, Government Institute of Medical Science, Grater Noida, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/hcqs-sale-regulated-in-gb-nagar-after-people-and-doctors-start-hoarding-drug/story-0FjLhr9hwbQyHhLpNtpRyL.html
07-04-2020||Noida||GB Nagar to follow Agra and Bhilwara models of containment exercise||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration will adopt the containment model of Agra and Bhilwara, Rajasthan. The first case of Covid-19 to be reported from Noida on March 12 was that of a tour guide.The 300 surveillance and containment teams started conducting a survey of 12 clusters in the district from where Covid-19 cases were reported.One of the first clusters of six Covid-19 patients in India was of those who had come in contact with a Covid-19 patient from Delhi with a travel history to Italy. He tested positive in Agra on March 2. Within 10 days, 350 teams of health and other government officials surveyed over 12 lakh people in Agra, and 1,000 suspected patients were identified and their samples collected. Agra has a total 62 positive cases until Tuesday.According to the official, who handled the first cluster of Covid-19 in Agra, there was no set model at that time to contain the spread.“When the first cluster was identified in Agra, we had immediately constituted 350 teams to survey and screen people. Immediately, the next day, a group of 16 Italians tourists was found positive for the infection and they had stayed in a hotel in Agra. Our teams stayed in the hotel to sanitize and trace all persons who visited the hotel during the stay of the Italian group. We provided training to all hotels in Agra to handle the situation,” Dr Vikasendu Agarwal, state surveillance officer, Lucknow, said.“There was no model for us to follow when we devised our own containment process. Agra hosts lakhs of foreign tourists, so it was a difficult task but we did it successfully,” Agarwal said.In Bhilwara, the first Covid-19 case, of a private hospital doctor, was reported on March 19. The district since then have gone on to have the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan. But only one case was found positive after March 31. All positive cases are linked to the hospital which includes 19 hospital staff and their relatives.Within eight days of the first case, 1,135 teams were constituted which surveyed over 75,000 houses, screened 365,600 persons in Bhilwara district. By March 31, samples of around 1,400 people were collected and tested.The surveillance officer from World Health Organization (WHO) who was part of the core team which contained the spread of Covid-19 successfully in Bhilwara said quick contact tracing, social distancing and mass sampling are the only ways to contain the spread of the virus.“Within eight days, our teams had surveyed over 73,000 houses in Bhilwara. Repeated survey and screening of the same houses and people are important to keep a tab and see if anybody has developed symptoms of the virus. Bhilwara was the first place where the Covid-19 outbreak had taken place in Rajasthan. So all the support required to conduct mass sampling was provided by state government which helped us in identifying infected persons quickly,” Dr Rajesh Gupta, surveillance medical officer, WHO, posted in Kota, Rajasthan, said.“As a result of quick and intensive contact tracing, only one positive case has been found in Bhilwara since March 31. Over 3,000 samples have been sent for testing in Bhilwara till now,” Gupta said.Gautam Budh Nagar reported its first Covid-19 case on March 12. By Tuesday, the total number of cases has risen to 58, of which 39 are linked to fire safety firm Ceasefire in Sector 135.Last week, former district magistrate BN Singh was pulled up by chief minister Yogi Adityanath for failing to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the district. The new district magistrate Suhas LY joined on March 31 after which 300 surveillance and containment 300 teams were constituted. A call centre was also started to address the queries and concerns the public has and also to undertake contact tracing of positive patients. “In six days, we have constituted 300 teams and they started work on Tuesday. We have increased the number of sampling to screen suspected patients. Recently, we have started a new call centre to streamline the whole system of fighting Covid-19 in the district. Our patients are continuously getting discharged after treatment. We are expecting good results in the coming days as the procedure of contact tracing has been intensified,” Suhas said.“We are also focusing on increasing the number of persons tested,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-to-follow-agra-and-bhilwara-models-of-containment-exercise/story-6mkCcFK5aAO0QeUK3lQugO.html
07-04-2020||Noida||Covid-19: Nurse of a private hospital found positive; 2 patients discharged||A 20-year-old nurse from the dialysis department of a private hospital in Sector 62 has been found to be positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is the first case of a medical professional getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the district. The woman is a resident of Maujpur in Delhi but is working in the Noida hospital. The total number of positive cases in the district stand at 58.Another lab technician of the hospital was found positive for the infection in Delhi after which samples of the woman and other medical staff were taken last week. The girl was living in a paying guest(PG) accommodation with a friend in Sector 62 since the lockdown was announced.Officials have sealed the PG and the area around it for containment as per the protocol. The woman has been admitted in the Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida. The wing of the hospital where the nurse worked along with the lab technician has been sealed and complete sanitisation of the hospital premises has been carried out.“We had tested the medical staff of the hospital as a precautionary measure after a lab technician was found positive in Delhi. After this, the woman was found positive. The medical staff of the hospital who came in direct or indirect contact of the woman and the lab technician has been asked to undergo home quarantine. All the required measures have been taken as per the protocol to contain and sanitise the area,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate.In another development, a 39-year-old man from Sector 150, who was admitted along with his 33-year-old wife, was shifted to Sharda Hospital after his condition deteriorated on Tuesday. The couple has been shifted to Sharda on late Tuesday night. The blood count of the man has come down drastically, making his condition serious.According to the health officials, it is difficult to use the single donor platelets procedure with him as it can put the donor at the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 as they have to be seated on two different beds next to each other during the process. Single donor platelets are prepared by the platelet aphaeresis machine.Doctors can explore the option of random donor platelets (RDP), which are prepared from donated blood.In another development, two patients were discharged from the Government Institute of Medical Sciences on Tuesday evening. One discharged patient is an employee of the Ceasefire company in Sector 137, who was admitted along with his wife and daughter for COVID-19 infection.Another discharged patient is a 35-year-old man from a residential society in Zeta-1 area of Greater Noida who had a foreign travel history.“We are happy to see that 10 Covid-19 patients have been discharged after responding successfully to the treatment given. In the coming few days, we are expecting that more people will be discharged,’ said Dr Saurabh Shrivastava, head of department, medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-nurse-of-a-private-hospital-found-positive-2-patients-discharged/story-yQNh1mTPYiaRvphslrri2H.html

If the realtors fail to follow the directions, they will have to face legal action, officials said.The move comes after the authority realized that some developers are not taking care of construction workers staying at their sites properly. According to the authority officials, about 50,000 labourers are staying at various construction sites in sectors 150, 143, 117, 118, 122, and 78, among others.The authority has issued instructions to builders in accordance with the guidelines of the UP government, which state that all the developers in the state will have to take care of the labourers rendered jobless after the 21-day lockdown came into force, the officials said. “Construction work at many builders’ sites was underway when the lockdown was announced. So, many construction workers got stuck at the sites in the city. And they are facing problems to get food and other essential services. In view of Covid -19 pandemic crisis, it is the responsibility of the respective builder to provide essential services to these workers during lockdown. Those who do not obey these guidelines will face legal action,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.In Noida, there are at least 100 housing projects where construction was underway, and labourers are living at the sites. Some big builders are providing food at the sites to labourers, but others are not providing food and other required essential services, said the officials.“The builder should ensure that construction labourers get food in morning and evening regularly till the lockdown is lifted,” said Maheshwari.The Noida authority has written to builders’ groups -- Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) and National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco) -- in order to ensure compliance of the instructions of the government. The authority has directed Credai to inform each member to follow instructions to avoid legal action.The builders’ body said that most of the developers are already providing food to the labourers. “We are regularly providing food to around 3,000 construction labourers daily at different sites. But we will ask those, who are not doing it, to do the same,” said RK Arora, chairman of Supertech Limited and member of Credai. Arora is also the president of UP chapter of Naredco.The Credai president for Western UP wing, Prashant Tiwari, said, “We will pass on the authority message to all builders for compliance. However, most of us are doing it already.”The Noida authority, with the help of the police and local volunteers, are providing food to the needy regularly since the lockdown started, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/deliver-food-to-labourers-at-construction-sites-or-face-action-noida-authority-tells-developers/story-kP3DLh7njY6YdWanVcOiIN.html
07-04-2020||Noida||Online classes, WFH raises computer repair demand, a non-essential service||With most offices giving its employees the option to work from home and educational institutions conducting online classes in light of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, the demand for the purchase and repair of electronics has gone up. However, this continues to remain a non-essential service.When the three-week lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, the movement of only essential services like groceries, telecommunication, pharmaceuticals, etc. was allowed. Electronics and their maintenance and repair did not make the cut.However, with daily life now depending on laptops and computers due to the current situation, people are facing problems.“There are four of us at home. My wife and I work on laptops provided to us by our offices and have a spare one. From April 1, both my children started their online classes. They are in different classes but their online sessions are at the same time. I needed another system but nothing was available in the market or even online. Luckily, a friend who owns an electronics showroom in Nehru Place, Delhi, could help me with a second-hand system. The four of us now work on four laptops,” said Deepak Kumar Jha, a resident of sector 77.People have also complained about the increased load on the internet services but as telecommunication is a part of essential services, those issues have been resolved.“My wife and daughter are both working on one shared laptop. My daughter had to start a new job but the lockdown was announced before she could join so she never received the office equipment. Now she has to manage with what we have at home. They both have conference calls which put pressure on the bandwidth, making the system slower. But right now there is no other option,” said Rajiva Singh, a resident of Sector 50.Vendors said that they started seeing a spike in the repair complaints as soon as organisations started going for the work-from-home option, which was days before the lockdown was announced.“There was a sudden rise in those requests. Another spike came around when schools and colleges started there classes in March-end and the beginning of April. But by then we could not help out people as the movement of our technicians is restricted. There is nothing we can do about the various requests for maintenance and repairs that are coming in daily,” said Gaurav Kumar Seth, the owner of a maintenance lab in Sector 59.Even though they are not on the essential services list, laptops and other such electronics have become a necessity in today’s scenario. “Computer repair and maintenance are not on the list of essential services. However, the UP government has put a provision in place that if a demand for a particular service arises, it can be taken into consideration. So far no major requests have come in but if they do, we can consider them,” said Anil Kumar, deputy commissioner, industries, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/online-classes-wfh-raises-computer-repair-demand-a-non-essential-service/story-kOMsOPbCOZX9tVxLOvIw3M.html
07-04-2020||Chandigarh||Khattar govt coercing state employees to donate to Covid fund: Surjewala||Senior Congress leader Randeep Surjewala on Tuesday accused the Haryana government of coercing its employees to contribute towards Covid relief fund.In a virtual press conference, Surjewala said instead of ‘extorting donations’ for the fund from the employees, the top brass of the state government — including the governor, chief minister and cabinet ministers — should pitch in with substantial amounts from their personal funds.“The CM should persuade industrialists, mining and liquor companies to make contributions,” he added.The Congress leader said sharing had always been a part of the Haryanvi culture and the employees had always made voluntary donations. “But, the way this regime is mounting pressure on them is unheard of,” he added.As an evidence, Surjewala shared an education department communication asking the school principals to ensure registration of Group B and C employees for making donations towards relief fund failing which their March salary will be held back. “I have seen a WhatsApp group where the heads of departments have pressured the employees to make donations,” he said.“It cannot be a mere coincidence that salaries of lakhs of government employees have not been disbursed by the Khattar government till April 7,” he added.“Will the government bring transparency about the expenditure from the relief fund,” Surjewala said.Meanwhile, chief minister ML Khattar clarified that no employee was being coerced to donate towards the relief fund. “It is a voluntary contribution. Everyone will have to give information on a website about how much they wanted to contribute,” he said during a digital conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-govt-coercing-state-employees-to-donate-to-covid-fund-surjewala/story-IDY1iSswyxh44GZsa1NRCN.html
07-04-2020||Chandigarh||Teams set up to check black marketing, over pricing of essential commodities||The Haryana government on Tuesday constituted special teams of food, supplies and consumer affairs department and local administration to keep a check on black marketing, hoarding, and price inflation of essential commodities.A department spokesperson said that the price capping of 25 essential commodities including pulses, sugar, salt, wheat, flour, potatoes and onions has been done by all deputy commissioners in their districts. Every shopkeeper has been strictly directed not to sell any product above the capped rate. Shopkeepers have also been told to display the rate list outside their shops to ensure no overcharging is done. It is also being ensured that masks and hand sanitisers are not sold above the maximum retail price. During checkings, 277 challans and 13 criminal cases have been registered due to irregularities done by wholesalers and retailers.The spokesperson added that directions have also been issued for ensuring the adequate availability of mustard oil, pulses and other essential items in the state. “The officers are in regular contact with the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) and the demand of the required stock for pulses and mustard oil has been sent to the federation.“Supply and availability of all essential items are being ensured through wholesalers,’’ the spokesperson said, adding that under the public distribution system, wheat, fortified flour, sugar, mustard oil are being distributed free of cost to consumers during this month. Soon, 2880 metric tonnes of pulses per month will be made available by the central government to all the eligible 27 lakh families covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana, BPL and Other Priority Households (OPH) for distribution in April, May and June. Apart from this, 5kg additional wheat per member per month will be made available free of cost by the Union government for April, May and June. Thus, during this period, double ration will be made available to the consumers.He said that under the Public Distribution System, directions have been issued to open ration depots for a longer duration for maximum distribution to the consumers, ensuring social distancing at each depot. In Ambala, Bhiwani and Kurukshetra districts, the ration was made available to consumers at their doorstep and now arrangements are being made to implement the same plan in the entire state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/teams-set-up-to-check-black-marketing-over-pricing-of-essential-commodities/story-YvfxMXfGwm6Kjxu6RjKR4O.html
07-04-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana accuses Delhi govt of concealing details of cop’s infection||The Haryana government on Tuesday lodged a protest with the Delhi government, alleging that they failed to inform them about a state police sub-inspector who died on April 4 at a hospital in the national capital after contracting Covid-19.Charging some of the deceased’s family members and the hospital with concealing information, cases have also been registered against them. Haryana home minister Anil Vij said the sub-inspector from Sonepat was admitted to a private hospital in Delhi last month after he suffered a brain stroke. Neither the Delhi government nor hospital authorities or even the deceased’s family gave any information that he had tested positive for the infection, the minister said.“On Tuesday, we lodged a strong protest with the Delhi government and our state chief secretary talked to her counterpart in this regard. A sub-inspector of the Haryana Police died in Delhi, but we were not informed,” Vij said. The minister said they handed over the body to the family, which also concealed the information.“Many people participated in the deceased’s last rites in Sonepat and several of his colleagues from the police station where he worked also took part in the funeral. He was also given a gun salute. Later, we learnt that he had tested Covid positive,” Vij said. “I enquired from my officials about this, but they said they had no information. This is a big lapse on part of the Delhi government that they failed to inform us,” he said.Vij said 30-40 people, including police officials and some members of the deceased’s family have been quarantined after the revelation.“A case has also been registered against some of the deceased’s family members under Sections 269 and 270 of the IPC for concealing the information. We have also registered a case against the Delhi hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-accuses-delhi-govt-of-concealing-details-of-cop-s-infection/story-KSzhBXUYH61omwkS1M80fI.html
07-04-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana to open 2,000 wheat purchase centres||Haryana government on Tuesday announced that it would open 2,000 wheat purchase centres. The decision came amidst the growing worries among 40 lakh odd farmers about the fate of upcoming mustard and wheat procurement operations under the lurking uncertainty due to the lockdown and shortage of labourers.In a bid to firm up its fresh procurement plans, the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government held a series of meetings in past two days with multiple stakeholders, procurement agencies and the commission agents (arhtiyas). The state government has also urged the Centre to give incentives between Rs 50 and Rs 125 to encourage farmers for staggered arrival of the wheat. From opening 140 mustard purchase centres (against 67 last year) to raising the number of wheat procurement centres from previous 477 to 2,000 and using every possible covered place — like sheds owned by various sects and empty spaces of rice millers — the state government will begin the massive wheat procurement exercise in a staggered manner from April 20. The objective of the new procurement plan is to open purchase centres in the proximity of villages. As Haryana has over 6,000 villages, one procurement centre will cater to three villages. This is expected to check the issues of transportation of the grains and glut in the market. Usually, wheat and mustard procurement begins on April 1 every year. Due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown that will end on April 14, the procurement was deferred. PREFERENCE TO REGISTERED FARMERSAs per chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, produce of the registered farmers will be procured first. He has asked the unregistered farmers to register themselves by April 19.“We will procure every grain even as there is a possibility of delay,” Khattar assured the peasantry.Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of food and civil supplies, said Dera Sacha Sauda, Dera Jagmal, Dera Bhumanshah and rice millers spread across 13 districts have offered their covered premises for procurement. The government is also approaching Radha Soami dera and other sects to convert their covered shed into temporary purchase centres.Last year, 80% of the total procured wheat had arrived in the mandis in 25 days, but this time, the government plans to complete the procurement in two months in staggered manner. “We will use every resource, including MGNREGA labourers.”Over 15,000 migrant labourers currently staying in government-run shelter homes are willing to join the procurement operations, Khattar said. “Arhtiyas will play a big role...Wheat MSP will be transferred to the farmers through the arhtiyas, while mustard MSP will be transferred directly to the account of farmers,” Khattar said.INCENTIVES TO FARMERSThe state government has asked the Centre to give incentives to farmers to delay and stagger food grain arrival. On March 26, additional chief secretary (food and civil supplies) PK Das wrote to Union secretary (food and public distribution) Ravikant, saying that Haryana government wanted wheat procurement to be done in staggered manner to ensure smooth procurement. “This can be facilitated by incentivising farmers,” Das said.A farmer from Kanheri village, however, said, “Our biggest worry is if the wheat will be procured. The government should fix the dates when the farmers of a particular area should bring the foodgrains to mandis.”Hisar-based agricultural university V-C Prof KP Singh said, “Farmers can only delay harvesting up to a limited extent and long delay may affect them. If the lockdown extends, then we need specific arrangements and alternative measures to save our farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-to-open-2-000-wheat-purchase-centres/story-UbqtTKX3cS1wvHeUUwI7SN.html

The CM ordered the food and agriculture departments to immediately come out with standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the mandis and purchase centres. He directed the departments to scale up the number of purchasing centres to 4,000, from the current 3,761, which is already double that of last year.Amarinder also wrote to his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee, seeking her personal intervention to revive manufacturing and loading at the jute mills in her state against the pending indents for gunny bales placed by the Punjab government.He said indents had been placed for 3.4 lakh jute bales from December 2019 to March 2020, and approximately Rs 1,000 crore had been transferred in advance in the escrow account of Jute Commissioner of India, Kolkata.The CM was informed that there was no shortage of labour as 14.2 lakh workers were available to join the operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/30-member-control-room-to-coordinate-wheat-harvesting-procurement/story-GCgNYIlCdoamswFyO0RPxL.html
07-04-2020||Lucknow||‘Consider age factor while releasing children in conflict with law’||Although the women and child welfare department has prepared a list of around 1000 children, who are in 24 observation homes in UP for being in conflict with law, for interim bail in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, the high-powered state panel has said those delinquents should not be released whose juvenility (whether they are minor) was in dispute.The Supreme Court had on April 3 asked Juvenile Justice Boards to consider releasing these children to prevent spread of pandemic. It came after over 11, 000 prisoners were released recently on the apex court order. The majority of children listed for release have disputed juvenility. Around 2,000 children in conflict with law are lodged in the observation homes. The number of children lodged is much more than the capacity of the UP observation homes.“The apex court had directed states to decongest prisons. Observation homes should have been decongested in the same line. In UP, there are several cases with disputed juvenility. We will flag this issue with the high powered panel again,” a senior government official said on the condition of anonymity.“As per the high powered panel’s order, we are releasing children in conflict with the law. Their parents or guardians have been issued a letter that would work as a pass so that they could take children along for 8 weeks,” director, women and child welfare, Manoj Kumar Rai said,“We have around 2, 000 children in 24 observation homes and almost half falls in the category suggested by the Supreme Court. We will act as per the high powered panel’s directions,” he added.A child rights activist Deepika Singh said, “Decongesting shelter homes is need of the hour. There is no point considering the age when the apex court has taken the gravity of the crime into consideration. The high powered panel should review their decision.”After the Supreme Court order asking all states to release prisoners on either parole or interim bail to reduce overcrowding in jails, the state government on March 26 prepared a proposal and sent it to the high-powered committee formed to ensure implementation the apex court’s orders.On March 28, national commissioner for the protection of child rights (NCPCR) asked the state governments to prepare a list of children in conflict with the law lodged in observation and special homes so that they could be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/consider-age-factor-while-releasing-children-in-conflict-with-law/story-6u9XUWXHNq2TJn5NdteIxH.html

On Monday night also, the region experienced heavy rain, accompanied by winds.Besides, the farmers are staring at a shortage of labour and combine machines due to the lockdown.Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer of Bholath, said there is panic among farmers due to coronavirus and acute shortage of labour. “Besides, combine machines that have gone to other states have not returned yet. This will delay harvesting. The wheat grain is now vulnerable to shrivelling, blackening and discolouration.”“If the lockdown remains in force, we don’t know how we will arrange for combine harvesters or even manual labour. Moreover, shortage of gunny bags will also be a problem this time,” said Amarjot Singh of Kartarapur.Jalandhar agriculture officer Naresh Gulati said, “The state government has allowed free movement of combine harvesters from other states for harvesting, which is likely to begin on April 15.”Admitting shortage of gunny bags, district mandi officer Davinder Singh said, “Several units from where agencies procure bags are closed due to lockdown. We are planning to use plastic bags to tackle this problem.”The state has 35 lakh hectares area under wheat cultivation.‘GOVT WILL PROCURE EVERY GRAIN OF WHEAT’Meanwhile, housing and urban development minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said the state government will procure every grain of wheat.

The city has recorded 10 Covid-19 patients and two deaths to date.Among the 10 positive cases, a 67-year-old man of Krishna Nagar was tested positive on April 3 and he has no recent foreign travel history and had not travelled outside Amritsar for long. The man’s wife too was tested positive for the virus on April 5.Former municipal corporation official Jaswinder Singh, 65, of Chatiwind Gate died of coronavirus at a private hospital on Monday. He was tested positive for the virus and he too had no recent foreign travel history, making him another community spread case. Singh’s wife has also been tested positive in her preliminary test.“Both the cases are community transmission cases as the patients had no foreign travel history. The patients had not even met any known coronavirus patient. The patients’ source of infection has not been traced yet and health department is working on it. This is worrisome. This is a warning sign for residents to stay indoors,” said Amritsar civil surgeon, Dr Prabhdeep Kaur Johal.Dr Rakesh Sharma of the GNDH said, “The community transmission is already on, although not declared officially. Sometimes an early third stage can be halted then and there. Next 10 days are very crucial to control the spread.”Fearing community transmission, some residents have been urging government to step up surveillance and enforce the lockdown. “The administration has not been able to trace the source of infection in two cases nor has it given any official statement on the community transmission. We have definitely entered third stage,” tweeted a city resident. “Kindly look into the matter urgently. Despite community spread, people are still not serious about the lockdown in Amritsar. Vehicles are passing by and people are wandering on the streets without wearing masks. Please start patrolling in the by-lanes,” tweeted another resident on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-concerned-as-community-spread-danger-lurks-in-amritsar/story-Mvd73rnN2UFWYYzHpbbMkJ.html

The health department is trying to trace the source where he got the infection.A WORRYING TREND?State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Gagandeep Singh Grover, an epidemiologist, says it is too early to spot a trend in Punjab as the total cases are not that high.“Moreover, if you will see the figures in rural areas, the majority of those infected were either direct or indirect contacts of SBS Nagar’s Baldev Singh and the Mohali panchayat member. The virus spread is happening in urban areas too,” said Dr Grover.Of the 39 cases reported in urban centres, 15 were direct or indirect contacts of those with foreign travel history whereas the source of infection in other cases is still unknown, reveals the data.A total of 16 persons found Covid-19 positive in the state attended the Nizamuddin congregation.Special chief secretary KBS Sidhu in a tweet said the number of total jamaat attendees identified by the state government rose to 599, of whom 559 were traced.Of these, 430 are still in Punjab with 289 having been found negative and the results of 125 are awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/half-of-punjab-s-positive-cases-reported-in-rural-belt/story-wTyj8L6CstxlRQQoLqTUJK.html

Amritsar deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon said the Punjab government issued them special curfew passes so that they could reach the airport. “Most of these passengers have completed 14-day quarantine period but still medical teams examined them again inside the passenger terminal,” he said, while overseeing the arrangements at the airport. He said more NRIs will leave through chartered planes on April 9.The DC said the UK government is also gearing up to airlift 4,000 NRIs from Punjab. However, the high cost of travel due to indirect flights has irked many of the NRIs, especially from Canada. Some activists are tying up with the airlines to facilitate the Canadian citizens in getting a direct flight from Amritsar airport. Approximately, 2,600 NRIs from Canada are stranded in Punjab, as per the #CanadiansStuckinPunjab online initiative.

07-04-2020||Lucknow||On UP govt’s call, pvt hospitals begin treatment on appointment||Responding to the state government’s call, private hospitals in the state capital have started attending to limited number of patients after prior appointment. The appointments are scheduled in a manner so that there is no overcrowding. “I do follow up of my patients between 11 am and 1 pm every day. The timing has been informed to all my patients over the telephone,” said Dr Anoop Agrawal, secretary of the UP Orthopaedic Association, who owns a hospital in Faizullaganj.“Even if the OPD hall can accommodate 50 people we ensure only 5 come at a time and sit at a distance from each other,” said Dr Sandip Kapoor, director Health City Hospital in Gomti Nagar.EMERGENCY OPDs ATTENDING TO LIMITED PATIENTS KGMU is treating 100 patients in emergency OPD against 7000 odd patients who were treated on normal days. In Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences 120 patients are being treated. On regular days 8000 patients are treated here. Similarly 70 to 80 patients are being treated in Balrampur hospital against 4000 odd patients it would treat on normal days. Civil hospital gets 5000 patients usually. Now, only about 50 are being treated in emergency OPD.Private hospitals/clinics usually attend to 25000 patients. Now, the number is limited to little over 2000.“Every day appointment is given over the telephone to ensure keeping in view only one patient comes every 25 minutes. Hence one patient and one attendant remain in OPD at any given time,” said Dr Adarsh Kumar a senior plastic surgeon in Indira Nagar.For urgent operations the doctors have devised a new plan. “After following all protocols we perform only one such operation on a day,” said Dr Vaibhav Khanna, a microvascular surgery expert.“We have ensured that apart from all emergency departments the diagnostic facilities like CT, x-ray , MRI remain open 24x7 right through the lockdown period,” said Dr Mayank Somani, CEO Apollomedics super speciality hospital, in Alambagh.The operations that can be postponed are being scheduled tentatively for April end. Many hospitals have offered their entire set up to the government to be used for isolating patients suffering from novel coronavirus. This move would help the state health department acquire them at five day notice.THE ISSUESThose suffering from chronic ailments of liver and kidney or respiratory problems aren’t able to get relief immediately for they require a doctor who is free to attend to them. Not all hospitals have a big OPD area.There are about 400 single doctor clinics too in the city with small waiting area. “Such doctors are either not seeing patients or doing so after prior appointment. A doctor who usually visits two to three clinics is going to just one these days,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president IMA Lucknow.“This is causing trouble for many patients as against the 40000 odd patients who would turn up at various OPDs, at present only 10000 are getting medical treatment,” he said. “Also those hospitals where the staff is not trained in maintaining highest sanitation protocol are avoiding to see patients in person,” said Dr Anoop Agrawal. Doctors also said that majority hospitals do not have PPE kits for doctors or medical staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/on-up-govt-s-call-pvt-hospitals-begin-treatment-on-appointment/story-k0DKsXZxWau2P4JdtmaG2H.html

A formal decision on salary cuts of ministers, possibly lawmakers too, could be decided at the meeting of the state cabinet on Wednesday. The lawmakers, who were entitled to spend Rs 20 million (Rs 2 crore) from their development fund each year, will from now get to spend Rs 30 million to spend each year, a decision that was taken by the government in February.It’s still not clear if, like the centre, which has already suspended the MP local area development fund (MPLAD) fund for two years, the state government too would come up with a similar move.Eight ministers, including MSME minister Siddharth Nath Singh, minorities welfare minister Nand Gopal Nandi, law minister Brajesh Pathak, panchayati raj minister Bhupendra Chowdhary, minister of state for Haj and Waqf Mohsin Raza, minister of state for electronics and information technology Ajit Singh Pal, minister of state for urban development Mahesh Chandra Gupta and minister of state Atul Garg announced pledging their entire MLA fund for covid care.More like Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh, who have already announced pledging their Rs 1 crore from their local area development fund, could announce more from their funds, a minister said.He added that many of them like, state’s deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had along with contributing from their fund and going for salary cuts, are also funding community kitchens.“We will do whatever it takes to defeat the pandemic. As public representatives we all should so whatever we can,” the ministers said. On Tuesday, UP BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak, who is also an MLC, had announced donating his entire local area development fund for two years. He had also been the first lawmaker to announce 30 per cent salary cut for a year. After the union cabinet decided that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his entire team of ministers would take 30 per cent salary cuts, UP governor Anandiben Patel too had announced a similar move.UP BJP lawmaker from Noida Pankaj Singh has announced that he would donate four months’ salary to covid care, the only lawmaker in the state to have made such announcement.More lawmakers joined the campaign with UP BJP general secretary and MLC Vidyasagar Sonker, Somendra Tomer also announced donating Rs 10 million (Rs 1 crore) from their fund. “The party is firmly backing the government in taking whatever steps it needs to take to fight the pandemic. We have sought contribution and support from all, including opposition parties and others,” UP BJP media in-charge Manish Dixit said.BSP chief Mayawati has already asked her party MPs to donate Rs 10 million for covid care, a decision that came in for praise from chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The Samajwadi Party as well as the Congress as well as BJP’s ally Apna Dal too has announced contributions to the covid fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-ministers-to-take-salary-cuts-pledge-funds-for-covid-care/story-6aemMU0axMQVaY7UfPmZhK.html

The HC said as much while rejecting a plea for medical termination of a 30-week-long pregnancy of a 19-year-old rape survivor.“Undoubtedly this court can exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and grant permission for medical termination of pregnancy even if the pregnancy has crossed the statutory limit of 20 weeks,” said the bench of justice KK Tated and justice Sarang Kotwal.“But, this power can be exercised only in exceptional cases and in conformity with the basic requirements of the MTP (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) Act, 1971,” said the bench, adding that, the outer limit of 20 weeks laid down by MTP Act “cannot be stretched to an unreasonable period”.The 19-year-old woman had moved the HC seeking permission for an MTP, claiming that she was forced to carry the unwanted pregnancy and it was causing her huge mental and physical agony. She further claimed that if she was compelled to deliver the baby, the child would also have to carry the stigma and face harassment as it would not be accepted in society.Acting on her petition, the bench had sought a report from the medical board established at Sir JJ Group of Hospitals. The board submitted its report on March 6, stating the foetus suffered from a serious cardiac anomaly and could be allowed to be terminated.The bench, however, refused permission, primarily because the pregnancy had advanced much beyond the statutory limit.The bench also took into consideration the fact that though the rape survivor realised she was pregnant in August 2019 and lodged a complaint with the Wai police in Sahara district only on January 18, 2020. She approached the HC a month later, on February 28.The rape survivor had claimed that two persons gave her a drink laced with sedatives and took turns raping her. When she discovered she was pregnant she approached one of her rapists, who offered to help get the pregnancy terminated. She approached the police on January 18, only after the accused started threatening her.The bench said the delay could have been easily avoided if the petitioner had taken steps for her examination immediately after becoming aware of her pregnancy. “Even taking into account the reluctance of rape victims to seek help, the delay on her part, in this case, is quite unreasonable,” the court said.It has now directed that this being an exceptional case, the state government shall bear the expenses for the medical treatment of the rape survivor and shall also look after her child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-stretch-20-week-pregnancy-termination-limit-for-unreasonable-period-hc/story-ecdStQ3AtBtWdAyMT9h5xN.html

On April 1, Hindustan Times tracked them to their village where Ram Achal, 28, said: “There’s no better feeling in the world than being home. We do not regret the walk now. Our families and fellow villagers treated us like heroes.”The village -- with just about 50 huts -- is by the Ghagra river.Manna Lal, 48, who had led them on the walk, was not nearby. “He is now obsessed with swimming in the river. He eats, swims, stays home and does nothing. All of us are just idling around. In two weeks we will look for wheat harvesting job in the nearby farms. It could get us Rs 250 per day against Rs 450 per day construction work that we were doing in Kanpur. This wage difference makes us migrate,” said Bechu Lal, 30. All the migrants -- nearly 100 -- in the village are construction workers in Kanpur or Pithoragarh (Uttarakhand). “All barring three came back home after the lockdown. They (the three) are stuck in Pithoragarh,” said Nanku, who claimed to have walked nearly 450 km from Pithoragarh in four days. They said they were thermal scanned for Covid-19 on Bahraich boarder.During the March 24 Lucknow conversation, smiles were alien to these eight migrants; now they are all smiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tortuous-250-km-trek-andthen-home-sweet-home/story-m4qAJ512BuOQbeHVhOBJtI.html

In Jaipur West, 1754 were booked under MV Act and 1500 vehicles were seized and in Jaipur South, 14 were arrested under section 151 of CrPC, two for violating lockdown orders, 967 were booked under section MV Act and 801 vehicles were seized.Jaipur city police is divided into four districts -- Jaipur East, West, North and South.Additional director general of police (ADGP), crime, Bhagwan Lal Soni said vehicles were seized under section 207 (vehicles used without certificate of registration permit) of MV Act. All of them were commercial vehicles and were roaming without permit.“Those who were not following the guidelines of lockdown have been booked under section 188 of IPC,” Soni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/covid-19-cases-rise-in-jaipur-but-vehicle-seizures-show-lockdown-violations/story-MayhW3GQa5NjySAXhirLxN.html
07-04-2020||Ranchi||UP-bound 13 bikers from Vizag caught in Jamshedpur, quarantined in PCTC||Police apprehended 13 bikers on their way to Uttar Pradesh from Visakhapatnam at Sundernagar check post here on Monday, violating 21-day nationwide lockdown to stop spread of Covid-19 pandemic, an official said. All of them have now been put in institutional quarantine at Police Constable Training Centre (PCTC) in Swaspur under Jadugora police station area in East Singhbhum district.This has, however, once again brought in focus how people have still been violating Covid-19 lockdown by crossing two states and several districts without being caught, tested and quarantined, defeating the purpose of arresting the spread of coronavirus and thus putting lives of lakhs at risk. India has so far registered 125 Covid-19 deaths, 4,565 corona positive and 4,098 active cases. Andhra Pradesh reported two deaths, 303 positive and 295 active cases, while Odisha reported 39 positive and 37 active cases.“We caught 13 persons riding motorcycles at Sundernagar check post around 10.45 am today. During interrogation, they told that they worked as cloth-hawkers in Visakapatnam in AP and were going to their native places in UP as they had no food and money to sustain in Visakhapatnam anymore. We have seized five motorcycles and sent all of them to PCTC quarantine centre in Swaspur under Jadugora PS. Further action will be taken against them as per the guidelines by the higher authorities,” said Jagdish Prasad, Sundernagar PS officer incharge. East Singhbhum additional deputy magistrate (ADM, law and order) NK Lal — who is also district nodal officer for corona surveillance cell — said the 13 people coming from Visakhapatnam and caught at Sundernagar check post have been put in 14-day quarantine and their throat and nasal swab samples were being sent for Covid-19 testing as they came from other states.Meanwhile, Bistupur police today arrested 25 people during morning walk at Beldih Golf Course and Dahtkidih area under Bistupur PS area. “We apprehended 25 people in Bleidh Golf Course and Dhatkidih this morning for violating lockdown. FIRs have been lodged against them and action will be taken on the basis of the same,” said Rajesh Prakash Sinha, Bistupur PS OC. The 25 people were, however, later released on personal bond with warnings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-bound-13-bikers-from-vizag-caught-in-jamshedpur-quarantined-in-pctc/story-qeS3hWxJfH2GvjpFnJGYDO.html
07-04-2020||Ranchi||Fourth case: Another woman from Hindpiri tested coronavirus positive||A 54-year-old ailing woman from Hindpiri who had allegedly come in contact with state’s first positive coronavirus case — a Malaysian woman who attended the Muslim religious congregation Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin — was on Monday found to be infected with Covid-19.Finding that two confirmed cases emerged from the same locality, the district administration completely sealed the entire Hindpiri area for next 72 hours. “Any movement in the locality has been banned for next 72 hours. All 15 entry and exit points will be closed. Every resident will be screened. People will remain in their house and volunteers will be deployed to provide them their essential requirements,” said Rai Mahimapat Ray, Ranchi deputy commissioner in an order.The affected woman is reportedly suffering from kidney ailment and is surviving on dialysis. Her family, however, declined that she had ever come in direct or indirect contact with the Malaysian lady.Speaking to media, along with Ranchi’s SSP Anish Gupta, he added, “Following the development, we have shifted the entire family to isolation centre for proper observation and contact tracing exercise has begun. A control room has been set up at Guru Nanak School adjoining Hindpiri. A team of doctors and ambulances will be stationed there. In any case, residents will not be allowed to come out from their houses. Strict action will be taken against those found violating the order.”The DC appealed to the residents to follow the government’s guidelines and cooperate with the ongoing health screening task. He asked them to report about the cases of illness if such thing come to their notice.The number of positive cases of coronavirus infection is gradually surging in the state, which registered its fourth case on Monday. Of the four, three are woman. This was the second consecutive day when corona-positive case came to the fore.On Sunday, a woman from Chandrapura block of Bokaro district was found infected with Covid-19. The woman had travel history as she returned on March 15 from Dhaka after attending Tablighi Jamaat event there. Besides the affected woman, her husband and two other couples of the same block had visited Dhaka.The state’s second case was reported from Hazaribag district when a 52-year-old man was tested positive for Covid-19. The man had returned to the district from West Bengal’s Asansol on March 29 amid nationwide lockdown. Confirming Ranchi’s second case, DC Ray said, “The woman, who was detected with novel coronavirus infection, has been shifted to dedicated Covid-19 hospital at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). We are finding out if the affected woman had come in contact with the Malaysian lady.”On March 31, Jharkhand registered its first confirmed case when a Malaysian woman was tested positive. She was the part of 22- people group, including 17 foreign nationals, who were recovered from two mosques in Ranchi. The group had descended to Ranchi last month after attending Tablighi Jammat in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/fourth-case-another-woman-from-hindpiri-tested-positive/story-6sdxWJM0SdfZt90F3PudHL.html

As far as sample testing is concerned, the veterinary doctors have not observed any abnormal symptom yet. If we detect any abnormal behaviour, we would certainly go for sample testing,” he added.Patna zoo houses 17 big cats and around 30 small cats which include seven tigers and four lions. Patna zoo is home to more than 1200 animals including 338 mammals, 471 reptiles and 355 birds. Among them are Royal Bengal tigers, black beer, giraffe, chimpanzee, zebra and Sangai deer, fish aquarium and reptile house are main centre of attraction for the visitors.Around 80 workers are taking care of inmates in different shifts. The workers have been maintaining distance from animals. “The zookeepers are taking caring of hygiene and cleanliness. The enclosures and houses are disinfected regularly. The food coming from outside is washed properly”, said a zoo official.The Bihar government had announced on March 13 for closure of zoo till March 31, which was extended till further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-covid-fear-patna-zoo-authorities-heighten-monitoring-of-inmates-health/story-45wB9kiDfRBd4v8wPmV12L.html

It may take some time. So far, we have treated 80 suspected COVID-19 cases here, but only two were positive,” he said.Earlier, union minister of state for health Ashwini Choubey had said that efforts were under way to start testing facilities at AIIMS (Patna) at the earliest. Once AIIMS testing facility also gets functional, all the four medical college hospitals in the state capital will have the capability.Till 10 am on Monday, Bihar carried out 3,545 tests, with 28 active positive cases spread across 10 of the 38 districts in the state. The emphasis is on quarantine of suspected cases. At present, 7163 rooms, including 4012 with attached bathrooms, are available at 2018 functional quarantine centres, though the number of persons admitted is 870 only.“The government is constantly monitoring the situation. All we want is that people with any symptoms should come forward for testing and treatment, which may not include hospitalization in all the cases. Most people with symptoms and travel history will only need to follow the guidelines at isolation centres or at homes for their own good and that of their family members and society. People are cooperating,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-to-expand-testing-facility-to-four-more-hospitals-no-ve-case-in-24-hoursat-present-3-hospitals-are-testing-samples-in-the-state-with-over-10-cr-population/story-yMjdJkTf3xXLo6qt1yzW7O.html
07-04-2020||Patna||Migrants move freely out of quarantine centres close to Patna||PatnaThe government has made elaborate arrangements to quarantine people coming from outside and suspected of any COVID-related symptoms, but a visit to a few of them in the riverine belt of Patna showed neither the people nor the authorities were taking it seriously despite alarm bells ringing across the world.Sample this: At the five quarantine centres in the riverine belt of Danapur along the Ganga river close to Patna, most of the inmates were missing when this correspondent reached there. They had been allowed to move out freely. They were themselves not taking the risk factor seriously.What is more, none of the centres had any arrangement for sanitizer, soap, masks and gloves. Beds have been made by attaching benches of schools. For others, there was arrangement on floor.At the Ganghara panchayat bhawan, where 39 migrants from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have been kept, none was present during the day time. An official present there said all the inmates had returned on March 22, but they were yet to undergo any medical test.The situation at the Habaspur middle school quarantine centre, where 50 persons have been kept, the situation was only a shade better, with only 15 persons present during the day. Most of the inmates worked in Kolkata as labourers or drivers.“Some of them have gone to take bath, while other may have gone to toilet. They don’t have any symptoms ever since they returned to their village on March 26,” said a villager.At Madhopur middle school quarantine centre, there are 20 persons kept – 13 from Rourkela and seven from Gorakhpur. However, just one person was present. He said that despite having no symptom, he had been kept outside.Kasimchak panchayat mukhiya Dinesh Rai said eight persons had been kept at the Manas centre, while four at another in Kasimchak. “But adequate supply of bleeching powder and sanitizers is not there,” he said.Danapur BDO Devendra Kumar, on the other hand, refuted the charge, saying doctors had been regularly examining the people kept at quarantine homes, though none of them has so far shown any symptoms.“Nobody is staying in our facility as of now but we have enough space,” said an official of district administration. “Each school has three or four rooms and all people coming back from outside the state will be kept together so we can handle a large number of people,” he said.“We have not been given any masks or gloves or anything to protect ourselves when we go out and visit families where people have returned from other areas,” said Anita Devi, an ASHA worker with the Hetanpur primary health centre (PHC) in Danapur Diara. “How are we supposed to go and meet people without any protection?”.The Bihar government has issued a circular on March 22, 2020, instructing district magistrates to make temporary arrangements in government schools and community centres to quarantine returning workers. The government has sanctioned Rs 100 crore from the chief minister’s relief fund for food and other arrangements at such locations.Around 1.81 lakh migrants returned to Bihar amid the lockdown, but only 27,000 among them have been quarantined in 3,200 government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/migrants-move-freely-out-of-quarantine-centres-close-to-patna/story-uoOnLYwnR59LM9O8TtrccP.html
07-04-2020||Ranchi||‘Jharkhand doing everything to check pandemic with minimum resources’: CM Soren||Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren says the pace of Covid-19 testing has been slow in his state because of a delay in procuring testing kits and personal protection equipment (PPE) from the Centre. In an interview with Aurangzeb Naqshbandi, he also spoke about his government’s lockdown exit strategy while underlining that a final call will only be taken after assessing the situation on April 15 when the lockdown ends. Edited excerpts:We got the first 5,000 [testing] kits on Friday and that is why our testing has been slow. We have been repeatedly, since March 21, requesting for PPEs from the Centre. There has been an inordinate delay in getting Central help. We are doing everything to contain the pandemic with minimum resources. We are gradually increasing the testing. Jharkhand is a poor and a tribal-dominated state and we are facing a huge shortage of money. The Centre is not helping us with any financial assistance. On top of that, public sector undertakings are not clearing our dues amounting to several thousands of crores. The high court has asked us to specify the measures we have taken to fight the Covid-19. In times like this, it becomes extremely difficult to fight multiple battles.It is difficult to say anything at this moment. Lockdown is a tough measure and equally tough is the exit. We cannot tell the people on April 14 {last day of the lockdown} that everything is fine now and they can resume their normal lives. We have to take appropriate measures to ensure that we do not undo what we have achieved by enforcing the lockdown. Much of our exit strategy depends on number of positive cases and whether we have been able to flatten the curve. We will take a call after evaluating the situation. We have started CM’s didi kitchens in 4,600 village panchayats and there is a daal bhaat scheme in urban areas to ensure nobody sleeps hungry. Under the daal baat scheme, a person would have a complete meal for ₹5 but now we have made it free. We have made 1,200 CM’s didi kitchens. The target is to feed 5,000 daily. But we have also received complaints. We have deployed flying squads and are trying to check people do not face food shortage. The government has also released two months of free ration to BPL card holders.You will be surprised to know that the people in our state are aware of the pandemic to the extent that they are being extra cautious. In many villages, residents have on their own enforced the lockdown and are not allowing any outsiders into their areas. You will find many such examples in rural areas. The problem may arise in urban areas and that is why we are taking extra precautions there.We have identified around 150,000 people who have come to Jharkhand since February 15. Out of those, more than 100,000 have been traced and stamped. We have also put in quarantine centres 5,000 people against whom lookout notices had been issued. We have set up control rooms, dedicated 70 phone lines for stranded people and deployed officials for better coordination. We are coordinating with those state governments. I cannot say that we have reached 100% people but our efforts to do so are ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-doing-everything-to-check-pandemic-with-minimum-resources-cm-soren/story-CyXc2VqjxbbFfup8mSrmxI.html
07-04-2020||Jaipur||Covid-19 update: The ‘ruthless containment’ model of Rajasthan’s Bhilwara||Bhilwara district, which was once among the 10 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots in the country, is now being talked about for its ‘ruthless containment’ model.In the video conference with chief secretaries of states, India’s cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba praised Rajasthan for the Bhilwara model, said Rajasthan chief secretary DB Gupta. “The government is planning to implement this model in other places, too, for effective containment of the infection,” he said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Bhilwara model of containment worked in phases. The first task was to isolate the district, second was screening strategy in city and rural areas and third was quarantine and isolation wards, followed by monitoring mechanism for rural areas, said Rajendra Bhatt, district collector, who led the team of government staff in this ‘war against Covid-19’.For isolating the district, curfew was imposed in the district on the day the first case was reported. This was from March 20 to April 2. During this period, essential services were exempted from the order.“We sealed borders of the district and set up check posts at all entry and exit points. Roadways and railway services were stopped and movement of private vehicles prohibited,” Bhatt said.After isolating the district, the administration defined the containment zone of 1km from the epicenter – Brijesh Banger Memorial Hospital (BBMH), a private institution, who doctors and staff were the first ones to test positive – and buffer zone of 3km. Similar, containment and buffer zones were also created around the house of a positive patient.“On the basis of cluster mapping, we identified six areas and deployed special teams for continuous screening of suspected cases in these,” the collector said.During this phase, disinfection of the following was done on a daily basis: containment zone and buffer zone; locality of positive cases; all ambulances and police vehicles; screening centre and quarantine centre; collectorate, police line and public dealing offices; and city wards.In the second phase of curfew, from April 3 to April 13, even essential services are prohibited in the city. “During this period, there’s no relaxation of any type. We are ensuring door to door supply of essential items such as vegetables, fruits and milk to residents and food packets to the poor,” Bhatt said.For screening, survey teams trained by specialized doctors regarding Covid-19 ILI (influenza-like illness) symptoms, checking persons having foreign travel history and prioritizing epicenter affected population as well as migratory population. There is a supervisor for every 10 survey teams.“Screening and testing was prioritized for Brijesh Banger Memorial Hospital. ICU admissions, doctors and nursing staff, IPD and OPD patients, persons who were identified to have had contact history with the positive cases, health workers and other staff were screened and all suspected cases told to be in home quarantine,” the collector said.He said a dedicated screening and testing centre was established at MG Hospital, which was dedicated as Covid hospital. People were brought to these cntres for screening and testing in government vehicles and dropped back. “In screening, doctors and nursing staff did thermal scanning and physical examination. If anyone had symptoms or was contact of a positive patient, his samples were drawn and he was sent in isolation,” Bhatt said. He said every day, government vehicles carried these samples to Jaipur for testing, thrice a day.For every positive patient, the close contacts were brought to isolation wards and the tier-2 contacts were taken to institutional quarantine facility. The district administration used 1,541 rooms of 27 hotels as quarantine centres.Apart from the hotel room, the administration also had 11,659 quarantine beds in 22 institutions and hostels. MG Hospital has 200 beds. The capacity could be extended up to 427 beds. Four private hospitals with isolation ward capacity of 25 beds each were also acquired.For monitoring, Bhatt said, corona fighters and corona captains were appointed in city and rural areas. In city, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) is the corona caption and ASHA and ANM are corona fighters. In the villages, block development officers (BDO) and tehsildar are corona captains at the level of panchayat samitis and sarpanch, panchayat sahayak, teachers and ASHAs are corona fighters at village level.“Corona captains and corona fighters monitor people in home quarantine, ensure food supplies, food packets, flow of migrant labourers and law and order,” collector said.Bhatt said while in other cities, source of Covid-19 infection was known, in Bhilwara, it is unknown from whom the doctor got infected. Ask him to sum up his efforts in one line and he says, “Ruthless containment model and cooperation of people in our war against Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/the-ruthless-containment-model-of-bhilwara/story-AKfS6V3WGaQd5n6vQNaXBJ.html

As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has forced educational institutes to shut down, doubts have increased over whether PU will hold its annual convocation.Panjab University controller of examinations, Parvinder Singh said, “We have already started contacting scholars to get enrolled on NAD so that they can get online degrees. Keeping in mind the current situation, we are not sure if the convocation can be held or not.” In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, PU suspended its classes on March 15 and has directed employees to work from home.The tentative date of this year’s convocation was April 20 but preparations have come to standstill amid the current lockdown. As many as 450 PhD scholars of PU are eligible to get their degrees this year, so far. The numbers might increase. The varsity has already written to college principals, making it mandatory for them to get students enrolled on NAD, so that they can get their degrees online.Controller of examinations said the university had recently got a confirmation from NAD that documents of 5,000 students from affiliated colleges were verified after the varsity had shared the data of 25,000 students for provision of online degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panjab-university-research-scholars-to-get-degrees-online/story-o0iUrG6gMEYUWljudTWbeI.html
07-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity’s first coronavirus positive patient recovers||A 23-year-old management student and resident of Sector 19, Chandigarh, who was the tricity’s first Covid-19 case, has recovered. She was discharged from Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, on Monday night, 19 days after testing positive on March 18. Another patient, a 21-year-old youth from Sector 38, was also discharged from the hospital, taking the total number of recovered patients in Chandigarh to seven.GMCH director-cum-principal Dr BS Chavan confirmed that the two have been discharged after testing negative for Covid-19. The management student had returned from the UK and landed at the Amritsar airport on March 15, following which she reached the city the same day. The 21-year-old patient had came in contact with her brother and was later hospitalised on March 23. Around 12 persons who had come in direct contact with her were identified. Her mother and brother, who had also tested positive, were recently discharged from hospital.“Today when I tested negative, I couldn’t believe that it happened finally. Along with the virus, I was fighting the stigma, as a lot of rumours were going around when I tested positive,” said the 23-year-old woman after being discharged. “You need to have support a system by your side to defeat the virus. My mom and I spent time in isolation in the same room and eventually things got normal,” she said. “It was a really bad phase. I overcame it by reading books related to my course work.”With six people who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in New Delhi testing negative for Covid-19 on Monday, no fresh case was reported for fourth consecutive day in Chandigarh. However, reports of eight suspects are awaited.The UT officials had identified a total of 123 contacts associated with the six people, who were quarantined at their houses in Manimajra, Mauli Jagran, Bapu Dham Colony and Daria. Also, no fresh case was reported in Panchkula on Monday, with the coronavirus count staying at two since March 31.However, the Panchkula health department on Monday collected samples of around 50 people, who had attended religious gatherings in different states. Civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said some of the reports have come negative, while others are awaited. On Panchkula’s first case, she said a fresh sample of the 38-year-old woman salon worker was taken recently and she again tested positive. “As per protocol, her sample will be taken again after 14 days and after two of her samples test negative consecutively in the stipulated time frame, she will be discharged,” she said.

07-04-2020||Chandigarh||Gone with the tweets: The brief disappearance of UT adviser Manoj Parida from Twitter||After a flurry of tweets during the lockdown to prevent the coronavirus spread, UT adviser Manoj Parida’s brief disappearance from social media platform Twitter on Monday led to much speculation in some circles, especially as he had been interacting regularly with residents to coordinate supplies of essential activities here.Active till Sunday night, Parida had been tweeting about decisions by the administration and Centre to control the pandemic, even sharing videos of his making public announcements. He had also fearlessly engaged with the public venting its anger on the administration after the door-to-door delivery system promised during the lockdown failed to take off initially.By Monday, the account was not available, leaving many wondering what had happened to the man who recently courted controversy by posting what he thought were Chandigarh helpline numbers that turned out to be from Panchkula, or had wittily responded with “Mera job khatre mein mat dalo, bhai (don’t put my job on the line, brother)” when a fan posted: “We want Manoj sir as governor.”However, by Monday night Parida was back tweeting away under a new handle @manuparida1, cheekily adding “Back on public demand.”A technical glitch as of now seems have caused problems with his old account, though the jury is still out on that one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gone-with-the-tweets-the-brief-disappearance-of-ut-adviser-manoj-parida-from-twitter/story-qHDANPbZdRtwjR2LOKQMaN.html

Directions have been given to priests of various churches to offer prayers and pass it on to the people through social media. We will be live streaming prayers on Thursday, Good Friday and Saturday,” said Rev Ignatius Mascarenhas, Bishop of Simla Chandigarh Diocese.The Holy Week is also a time to reach out to others, perhaps by contacting distant family or friends. “Consider calling someone who might be lonely or anxious during the pandemic,” Rev Mascarenhas advised.Setting up a sacred space at home for worship will help people stay at home during the pandemic and engage with the divine with devotion, said Lawrence Malik, adviser, Tricity Churches Association. Most of the church heads were offering prayers on social media, especially on WhatsApp and through YouTube, he added. Rev Brian Anderson, pastor, Light of the World Church, Zirakpur, said, “We are offering prayers through Facebook Live and YouTube. We are also using the Zoom app to talk to people and pray for them.

The entire village has been sealed. Out of the total of 58 reports, we have received 38, out of which four tested positive. The rest are negative. Twenty more reports are awaited, Dr Manjit Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-surpasses-chandigarh-s-coronavirus-positive-cases-count/story-g0g2toDstaVwsHEFpkrz7H.html

Kumar told the police that he and 36 others, who got stuck due to the curfew, had been planning to travel back. Kumar alleged that accused Satvir Singh, who also stays in Kumbra, and his friends had assured them that they will drop the migrants back to their village in Bihar. They were asked to collectively pay ₹40,000 up front and additional ₹5,000 on reaching Bihar.Kumar said that on April 1, they were taken in two vehicles and dropped near the Shambhu Barrier. Satvir asked them to wait saying he will return after picking up a few more migrants, Kumar told the police. The migrants waited for one entire night and kept calling Satvir, who switched off his mobile phone. The cops deployed at the Shambhu Barrier noticed them and they were sent back to Kumbra in a truck.A case was registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 269 (Whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code at Phase 8 police station, Mohali. Investigations revealed that the accused have other cases of cheating registered against them in different police stations of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/curfew-in-mohali-four-men-arrested-for-duping-migrant-labourers-of-40-000-on-pretext-of-dropping-them-to-bihar/story-cAD8HzX0IDWLx8IzBSoWDJ.html

No outsiders are allowed. Masks, gloves, shoes and sanitisers are provided to staff coming in direct contact with the animals while feeding and cleaning them and taking care of their health.The special diet given to the animals now includes meat. Immunity boosters are added. Supplements usually given to sick animals and those that have given birth are now given to all animals. “With disturbance from human beings reduced the animals appear happy and stress free. The feed intake is good and healthy,” says Sudhagar.Staff families to be screened tooThe Central Zoo Authority has already issued an advisory for 24-hour monitoring of animals through CCTV for any symptoms/abnormal behaviour. “We will also start screening the staff and their families with health questionnaires given out to ascertain if anyone is showing any symptoms,” adds Sudhagar. Meanwhile, the Chandigarh forest dept has closed all the nature trials in Nagar Van till April 15. Dr Abdul Qayum, deputy conservator of Forest, Chandigarh, took to Twitter saying, “Public entry to all forest areas were prohibited on getting positive Corona cases. It was a timely decision by the Chief Wildlife Warden, which not only helped in stopping in disease spread but also saved wildlife unlike reported in New York USA.”Tigress diya takes cubs for outingsWith the zoo closed for visitors following the Covid-19 outbreak, tigress Diya, who gave birth in November last year, has been allowed by zoo authorities to take her three cubs for well-deserved outings. Zoo officials for the last 10 days have been opening Diya’s enclosure where she has been isolated since November with the young ones to prevent infections. The tigress and her cubs now remain outside for two to three hours before going back.These are considered test trials and the animals will be on public display once the zoo reopens. Zoo authorities had earlier created a crawling gallery for the cubs to play and get sunlight. The cubs had been coming out of the cubbing area and enter the feeding cell that used to be earlier frequented only by Diya to get their share of meat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chhatbir-zoo-animals-stress-free-without-visitors-two-layer-sanitisation-system-in-place/story-YmBzcnqgSzNLl3blLfkPnI.html

07-04-2020||Chandigarh||In corona backlash, friendly neighbourhoods turn frosty in Chandigarh||After having recovered from Covid-19, people are facing a hardship of another kind. The virus has gone but the stigma has stayed on. Apprehensive stares, aloof attitude and harsh words are the new stumbling blocks for those who battled the novel coronavirus and came out winners. A 42-year-old man, who reached his Mohali home after spending over two weeks in an isolation ward, was left shocked by the indifference and frosty behaviour of his neighbours. “They look at me as if I am going to infect them all. If I come out in the verandah even for a minute I can see them immediately rush inside their homes. I have recovered and I am taking all precautions. But they think that merely by looking at me, they will be infected,” he said.He said they have a problem with his mother (who tested negative) taking a walk in the backyard of his house or washing clothes there. “One of my neighbours even threatened to complain,” he said. The epidemic is revealing the worst side of people who they once considered their friendly neighbours. Disappointed with the attitude of neighbours, he said, ”They have no right to torture us mentally. It’s not that they are not well read. These are educated people behaving like illiterates. If they don’t know how the disease spreads, they must google it and learn about it before showing such discrimination.” Mistrust, sometimes bordering on incredulity, is the new hurdle they are finding hard to get used to. A Sector 27 resident under home quarantine said, “The moment you are put under home quarantine, people think you have committed a crime and are being punished for it. Home quarantine is not punishment. The whole country is under lockdown.”He said the moment authorities paste the home quarantine sticker outside your house, neighbours start spreading rumours about you. “This is wrong. People should be supportive,” he said.One of the suspects whose contacts were released on social media said his details were leaked on social media and he faced a harrowing time after that. “I got so many random calls. People asked me details of my visits. When it got too much, I stopped answering unknown numbers. It was torture. One can handle the illness, but this behaviour is nerve racking.”To make matters worse for survivors, even those who are looking after them are being treated with mistrust. A nurse from Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) said that her neighbours, whom she has supported in the most difficult times, avoid her like plague. “They stay away from me, they don’t make eye contact, and all because I work in a hospital. It is appalling to see the way people are changing around you,” she said.The stigma attached with the virus is giving way to another fear. A health workers admitted in PGIMER’s corona ward is very worried, and not so much about the disease. “What if my landlord asks my wife and child to vacate the house? Its my only worry,” he said. According to the UNICEF, the level of stigma associated with Covid-19 is based on three main factors. One, it is a new disease for which there are still many unknown aspects. Secondly, we are often afraid of the unknown. And thirdly, it is easy to associate that fear with ‘others’.*Drive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination*Prevent people from seeking health care immediately*Discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-corona-backlash-friendly-neighbourhoods-in-chandigarh-turn-frosty/story-mrwBpIzTqz7apu7NCcctgP.html
07-04-2020||Lucknow||Smriti, Congress in twitter war over relief to Amethi poor||Union minister and Amethi MP Smriti Irani and the Congress have got into a twitter war over providing relief to the poor in Amethi, a bastion the Congress lost to the BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Incidentally, this bitterness came even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to opposition leaders seeking a united war against the coronavirus. Political experts say both parties have found the coronavirus outbreak a chance to propagate their connect with Amethi.Before its 2019 loss, the Congress had lost Amethi just twice in the past -- in the post emergency elections of 1977 and then again in 1998 when Captain (retd) Satish Sharma, a Gandhi family loyalist, got defeated.Three days back Congress posted a tweet, “Hamara dilon ka naata hai, haemin rishtey nibhana aata hai (It’s an emotional connect as we know how to honour relations)” and followed it up with another tweet on Sunday mocking BJP MP Smriti Irani’s efforts, who then took to twitter to target the Congress. Irani responded with a series of tweets that highlighted her contribution to Amethi while mocking at the Congress. “Why would you want to ensure safety of people by making them stay indoors? If people remain alive how would Rahul ji engage in politics? If you want to know about Amethi, ask Pradeep Singhal ji, your own (Amethi) chief as a week back I had spoken to him on how we need to focus on social welfare instead of politics,” she tweeted.Tagging the Congress’s tweet about her playing ‘antakshari’ while Rahul supplied essentials to the people, Smriti then posted a series of tweets on how the people of Amethi were being cared for.“In Amethi 25,221 widows found money in their bank accounts courtesy @myogiadityanath. This week money was transferred in the Jan Dhan accounts of 1,48,000 women because there is the government of @narendramodi and @myogiadityanath. Yes, you may be angry as you didn’t get the cut,” she said in a series of tweets.“About 75,413 elderly and 4,454 labourers got money in their bank accounts while 2,16,270 poor got rations but why should this be acceptable to you because you weren’t able to rob Amethi of its bite,” she posted in another tweet.BJP leaders as well as district officials in Amethi admit that Smriti was in regular touch with them, sending food and other essentials for the people of her constituency just as Congressmen, too, made a similar admission about Rahul Gandhi taking care of the people here.“After sending truck loads of dry ration for Amethi, Rahul ji has sent 12,000 sanitisers, 20,000 masks and 10,000 soap cakes which are being distributed to the poor through the district Congress committee,” said Amethi Congress chief Pradeep Singhal. The twitter handles of Amethi BJP and Amethi Congress, too, have been actively propagating how the present and former MPs of Amethi are engaged in people-connect. Both parties shared “photo proofs” of how the cadres were reaching out to the people, running community kitchens and taking care of the requirements of the poor and daily wagers hit hardest by the 21-day lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/smriti-cong-in-twitter-war-over-relief-to-amethi-poor/story-Otrbvx6E9kyZ9MYSyA1VqM.html
07-04-2020||Lucknow||Challenge is big, but we’ll overcome it, says UP health minister||Uttar Pradesh health minister Jai Pratap Singh keeps tabs on developments in the state from his make-shift office at home.“I talk to chief medical officers across the state on a daily basis,” he told HT on phone while admitting that the return of migrants to the state had posed a fresh coronavirus challenge, which his department was confident of meeting successfully. Singh had got himself tested for Covid-19 after attending a function in which Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor was present. Kanika tested positive, but the minister didn’t. Excerpts: How is the state’s health minister managing the situation?I am doing it from home. Me, my principal secretaries, secretaries and directors general are all jointly taking stock of the situation. The files that need the chief minister’s attention are sent to the chief minister’s office (CMO). So I am in my office between 9.30 am and 10 am and once I log in, I am lost in a maze of responsibilities.The migrants posed a fresh challenge for the state fighting to check community transmission of COVID-19?  Yes, we are aware of this (challenge). I kept checking with district magistrates and chief medical officers about the return of migrants to villages. We have the names and contact details of all who have returned.But judging by the visuals of exodus to villages, the numbers could be huge, right?That is why in nearly all the districts we have got two community health centres (CHCs) ready for quarantine facilities. So our CHCs are there, then in hospitals adjacent to villages we have set up isolation beds. We are regularly reviewing the situation and taking required action.Any specifics, because the numbers appear to be huge?Yes, the numbers are big. We had appealed to them to remain where they are and the chief minister had spoken to his counterparts in other states urging them to take care of UPites stranded in their states, just as we are taking care of people from other states here. But, despite the appeal, they returned. To be fair to them (migrants), their problem is that they are very poor and fear being stranded with no food. And thus they felt that returning to their village was the best option. This of course, increases our challenge. It’s a huge task but we are up to it.You mentioned village heads; are they supporting you? Yes, they are. They have been told to report anyone showing symptoms (of COVID-19) or any migrant in quarantine either jumping isolation. The huge exodus to villages has created fresh challenges but we are doing our best. You are the health minister but from what we know each minister is also in-charge of one district or more. So are other ministers too keeping a watch? See, I am in-charge of two districts – Sultanpur and Gautambuddha Nagar. Then I come from Siddharthnagar. Naturally along with my overall responsibilities as the health minister, I have to be additionally alive to my duties in these districts from where people have expectations. For instance, as minister in-charge of Sultanpur we have a list of around 7,500 migrants who came and their list was readied and immediately the village heads were informed of their arrival. Then there were some others who had come there but belonged to adjacent districts and were sent to CHCs around those districts. We have to save our villages. Do you directly receive calls from villages?  In many cases, yes. For instance people like those from Siddharthnagar stranded outside UP call us. There are many from Siddharthnagar who are settled in Mumbai, Kerala or Bangalore. I keep getting calls from people stranded there. I pass these details to the state BJP chief who in turn galvanises the party cadre there to help them. Such coordination keeps going on. Then there are other calls, some seeking advice, some help. We have to attend to their issues. As people’s representatives we have great responsibilities. Most ministers are on work-from-home protocol. By when do you see normal functioning resuming?  Soon. Let’s hope for the best.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/challenge-is-big-but-we-ll-overcome-it-says-up-health-minister/story-mxzvuFym2aNY7ed3lF5z5H.html

07-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi government steps up fight to contain coronavirus in 7 zones||With the number of Covid-19 cases rising in the national capital—20 new cases were reported on Monday taking the tally to 523—the Delhi government on Monday declared three new containment areas, taking to seven, the total number of such zones in the city. More will likely be declared, a senior official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. States have some leeway on defining such areas and according to senior officials from the Delhi health department, a containment area is declared when a bunch of cases with unclear history is reported from a locality. This is done to prevent the infection from being transmitted to other parts of the city. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicApart from the Nizamuddin Markaz, four separate containment areas have been declared in Dilshad Garden -- all with different focal patients — and one in a slum cluster in New Moti Bagh. Another containment zone was declared in the Tibetan colony in Majnu Ka Tila in March, after a Covid-19 positive patient took a bus from there to Himachal Pradesh. A second senior Delhi government official said on condition of anonymity that the containment period for this area is almost over.According to officials, the separate focal patients — in one Dilshad Garden case, it is unclear where the patient got the infection from — have raised fresh fears about community transmission taking place. “In hot spots some community spread may be occurring,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS and a member of the national task force on Covid-19.A locality in the Sadar Bazaar area is also likely to be declared one after four people from there tested positive for Covid-19, the first official added.Based on the number of cases, contact tracing history, population density, and type of locality – slums or plotted developments – a geographical area is declared to be containment area by the district magistrates or deputy commissioners, to physically keep people in. Delhi does not have a norm on how big a containment area has to be; this is decided by the district task forces depending on the information received from the district surveillance officers.“We cannot have the same guideline throughout Delhi because the geography is very different. If we say a 3 km radius (for instance) it will cover thousands of households. This is not feasible. We let the implementing officer decide how to demarcate the area,” said a senior official from the Delhi government. Although people providing essential services are allowed to go out from the area, registers are maintained to keep a track of who is going where and they are asked to use masks and sanitisers. And no one is allowed to enter the area. “Barricades are placed, all entries and exit to the area are sealed off, and police are stationed to ensure that no one gets in or out. Essential services can be delivered to the entry points from where local volunteers can take it in. The volunteers are also tasked with delivering all essentials to the doorsteps of people who have been asked to remain in quarantine,” according to a second official. ASHA workers and ANMs (Accredited Social Health Activist and Auxilary Nurse Midwife) from the dispensaries attached to the area are asked to carry out door-to-door surveillance in such areas. “They visit everyone in the neighbourhood and check them for symptoms such as fever, sore throat, cough, or difficulty breathing. They also take down detailed history of where people have travelled to check for possible exposure and contact with the confirmed cases. In case anyone has symptoms, the healthcare workers immediately report them to the district office and, if necessary, they are taken for testing,” said a third official. All decisions in a district are taken by a 27-member team headed by the District Magistrate. The team includes officers from the integrated disease surveillance programme, health department, municipal corporation, and Delhi pollution control committee.The district teams and the officials of the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme exchange notes, to share details of contacts of positive cases across districts. The DMs also coordinate with the police to ensure that people do not move around in containment zones and to bring back people who might have run away from quarantine facilities inside the zones. “There are multiple WhatsApp groups through which we are coordinating. We check with the health department officials in case some clarity is needed, else we inform them about the status,” said a third senior official.Once a positive case is reported, the five civic agencies in Delhi carry out the drive in their area. In Nizamuddin and Dilshad Garden, close to 65,000litres and 18,000 litres of disinfectant have been sprayed ever since the cases came to light.Every police station, including Nizamuddin has access to CCTV cameras in the locality, A C4I(Control, Command, Communication, and Intelligence) Centre at the police headquarters, connects CCTV footage of police cameras across the city.Station House Officers have to immediately inform the area Sub Divisional Magistrate if there is a possible case of a Covid-19 infection in the area . The SDMs then inform the DM. The DM takes a call and alerts the district Deputy Commissioner of Police to help with enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-steps-up-fight-to-contain-virus-in-7-zones/story-KqDH3jtCSzKHKl2XqiCEbK.html
07-04-2020||Gurugram||Six held for assaulting Muslim family, threatening them to leave||Six men were arrested for allegedly assaulting a Muslim family and telling them to leave the place, after an argument during the nine minutes ‘lights off’ exercise on Sunday night in Manohar Nagar, Sector 8.The police said two members of the victims’ family, identified as Aatif Warsi and his cousin Mubin Khan, sustained injuries and were rushed to Civil Hospital in Sector 10 for treatment. They were later discharged and their condition was said to be stable.The police, however, denied there was any communal angle to the incident but arrested the men under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for causing hurt and promoting enmity.According to the police, the incident took place around 9.15pm, when at least 20 men, including the victims’ two neighbours, assembled on a road behind their house to participate in the lights off exercise. In the police complaint, Warsi, alleged, “The group was chanting nationalist slogans when they noticed some people flashing lights on their phones on the second floor of our house. The group objected to videos being recorded and at least six men barged into the house.” He added that one of the suspects hurled abuses at them and threatened them to leave. The group dispersed and the men returned to their houses at the time, he alleged. A few minutes later, one of the suspects, who lives in the adjacent house, allegedly tried to throw a chair from his balcony at Warsi’s mother. “Some of the men jumped onto our balcony and threw bricks at us, which hit me and my cousin. My father hid other members of the family in a room and locked it from inside to protect them. The men threatened us and left,” alleged Warsi. Sumer Singh, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), west, said, “The police received information of the incident from the control room at 9.55 pm and immediately rushed to the spot. Six men were arrested on Monday from Manohar Nagar area. The investigation so far has revealed that there was some old enmity between the neighbours and there had been scuffles in the past. There is nothing communal in the alleged incident. The situation is completely peaceful. Further probe is on and we are verifying the allegations.”Warsi’s father, Akram, who hails from Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, said that he had been staying in the city since 2009 and had never faced discrimination on the basis of religion. “We were just recording videos of the lights off to send it to our family on WhatsApp,” he said.The police said Warsi sustained an injury on his right eye and his cousin, Khan, suffered an injury on his left cheek. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that a PCR vehicle rider had made multiple rounds of the area on Monday and the situation was peaceful.A case was registered against the suspects under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman), 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act at New Colony police station on Sunday night, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-held-for-assaulting-muslim-family-threatening-them-to-leave/story-mMpRZT6pd7rLjV10M95VdM.html

According to the police, the men were allegedly looking for Tablighi Jamaat members after they received a text message that some of the members who had tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were nabbed by officials from the village. The arrested men were identified by their first names as Vinod, 40, and Pawan alias Fighter, 41 (both from Basai village), Aalam Khan, 39, from Devilal Colony, and Harkesh, 18, from Raebareli, Uttar Pradesh.

A case was registered against the men under Section 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Rajendra Park police station on Sunday.The police said that the arrested men had allegedly received text messages on an instant messaging mobile application and seen posts on social media regarding the arrest of some Tablighi Jamaat members who tested positive for Covid-19. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said that the men were drinking together on Saturday evening. “After looking at the post on social media, they decided to go to the mosque in Dhankot village and check if any Tablighi Jamaat members were hiding there. They were travelling in a Gypsy jeep. When they reached the spot, they knocked at the gate of the mosque but no one came out. Vinod, who was carrying his licensed pistol, then fired two gunshots at the mosque.”On Sunday, the police had received a complaint from the Imam of the mosque regarding the firing of gunshots. The complainant alleged that he had found an empty shell casing near the spot and a bullet hole in the gate of the mosque. The Imam was sleeping on the terrace of the building and did not hear the sound of the gunshots during the incident which took place on Saturday night. He was informed by the residents of the village about the shooting the next morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/four-arrested-for-shooting-at-mosque-cops-say-they-were-looking-for-tablighi-jamaat-members/story-6ky6PC7ommrIqzOGWKKCBM.html
07-04-2020||Gurugram||Air quality in Gurugram reduces for the first time in 10 days due to firecrackers||After 10 straight days of ‘satisfactory’ air quality, largely due to the absence of vehicles from city streets and the closure of industries, pollution levels in Gurugram spiked on the night of April 5 after the use of firecrackers during a nine-minute candlelight vigil. The city’s average 24-hour air quality reading at 4pm on Monday was 106 (in the ‘moderate’ category of the air quality index), up from 91, the previous day. While the spike isn’t a steep one, it marks the first time since March 26 that the city’s air quality reading passed the 100-mark.All of the city’s four official air quality monitors recorded spikes in particulate matter beginning at 9pm on Sunday. At Vikas Sadan, the maximum concentration of PM2.5 between Sunday and Monday touched 170µg/m³, up from 83µg/m³ between Saturday and Sunday. At another location in Gwal Pahari, PM2.5 levels soared to a maximum of 276µg/m³ between Sunday and Monday, as opposed to 235µg/m³ the previous day. Yet another monitor in Sector 51, which has been recording PM2.5 levels between 60 and 100µg/m³ since March 26, saw PM2.5 levels touch as much as 284µg/m³ on April 5.Air quality experts and officials both attributed this spike to firecrackers which could be heard on the night of April 5. “While the spike wasn’t major, it shows just how prone air quality is to deterioration even with just a few firecrackers being burst,” Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, said.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Gurugram, said, “We will check the data. In any case, with no vehicular movement happening these days, and with temperatures also rising, pollution levels will remain largely low. There is no need to worry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-reduces-for-the-first-time-in-10-days-due-to-firecrackers/story-emq8k8wfA8rJN4QPJBceiP.html

After the incident came to light on social media, the office of Mumbai Police commissioner had directed the local police station to register a first information report (FIR) against the biker, after which a case was filed under the Epidemic Diseases Act, said an officer. Kailas Avhad, senior inspector of Vakola police station, said, “We are recording the woman’s statement and will take action against the person who spat on her.” The complainant, Shonyo Kabai, had stepped out of her home along with her sister to purchase groceries, when a biker approached her, forcibly took off her mask and spat on her near Kalina signal. As the roads were relatively empty, the two sisters were unable to find help. “I was wearing a mask and a cap. I wonder what is it that bothered him to do such a thing,” said Kabai. “I don’t know if this incident has to do with coronavirus, but our community faces discrimination. There is name calling and some tease us,” she added. The incident received a prompt response from the police after Linda Newmai, a social activist from Delhi, tweeted about it. “A NE girl from Manipur is the new victim again here in Mumbai. This happened just an hour ago. A biker came & spat on her #stopracism. This is not done! We have to fight #Covid19 or these racial attacks? I request the @MumbaiPolice to immediately take action please!” read Newmai’s tweet. She said since the outbreak, those hailing from the north-eastern states claim they face discrimination and are not provided with essential goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/biker-spits-on-manipuri-girl-police-to-file-fir/story-2PgmXS9JqtVrJDzskeneeN.html

07-04-2020||Delhi||Students await communication from recruiters, concerned about reduced offers||A final-year undergraduate student pursuing mathematics in a Delhi University college is “fairly anxious” these days despite landing an annual package of ₹17 lakh at a multinational firm at her college’s placement drive last year.The 21-year-old was set to start work in June after graduating. However, Covid-19 pandemic has made the situation uncertain. “There hasn’t been any communication from the company’s side over the job offer — whether it still stands or not. I am fairly anxious because a lot of money and my career are at stake,” she said, requesting anonymity.“I have to rethink my decisions if there is a salary cut in the offer, because, what if they lay us off eventually? I was supposed to join in June but now, we don’t know when our exams will be conducted,” she said.From Delhi University (DU), Delhi Technological University (DTU) to Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), teachers and students at higher educational institutes across the capital are concerned about the impact of the global pandemic on placements and job offers. While many colleges and institutes had already conducted their on-campus placement interviews before the lockdown, which started on March 25, some had to cancel the interviews and tests.Rajeev Gupta, dean of student welfare and part of DU’s placement cell, said, “The short-term issue is that placement is closed everywhere. If the lockdown is extended, we may have to think of alternative arrangements for placement interviews, consisting of an online module. The long-term problem of the current crisis is that the requirements [in the job market] may go down.”DU sees most placements from English, Foreign Language and Management branches, Gupta said.Hena Singh, a colleague of Gupta’s, said that students are concerned over a possibility of salary cuts in the job offers they have already received. “Since the companies have not initiated any communication on the job offers [after the lockdown], it would be an overreach to approach them on this,” she said.Several institutes, such as Jamia and DTU, have been conducting internal meetings over the issue and are reaching out to companies to “honour their offers”.Rihan Khan Suri, placement officer at Jamia, said that while no company had rescinded an offer yet, the university administration, along with the vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar, had taken stock of the situation and were thinking of alternative ways to ensure students don’t suffer. “The economy was already struggling before Covid-19, which further worsened the crisis. We had already been discussing the placements and possible job crisis issue. Suggestions were made to rope in alumni networks from different courses on an individual level,” Suri said.Rajesh Rohilla, head of training and placement at DTU, said the IT sector was likely to continue hiring since more jobs are coming up in the digital arena. “A company revoked some paid internships but no job offer has been revoked till now. Since we have a single-placement policy, which means one student gets one job offer, we will be asking all 220 companies that came on campus, not to rescind any offer. We may ask them to consider delay joining dates, if it looks unlikely immediately,” he said, adding that DTU’s V-C, Yogesh Singh, has also initiated online classes to ensure the academic session isn’t disrupted and employment prospects are not affected.However, not all institutes are worried about the situation. “Our placement concluded in February and all our students were placed. We don’t think any job offer will be rescinded. However, there is a chance that the joining may get delayed,” said Madhu Vij, placement convener at the Faculty of Management Studies (FMS) of the Delhi University.On Friday, director of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, V Ramgopal Rao, had also appealed to recruiters “to be considerate and keep their promises”.“A few months of delay may be fine. Please do not complicate the lives of these brightest children in an already complex environment. If at all, they are capable of getting you out of recession faster than you can imagine,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/students-await-communication-from-recruiters-concerned-about-reduced-offers/story-iuhCY9L2fYEuWjXsiGQTvN.html

The Greater Noida authority chief executive officer (CEO) Narendra Bhooshan, who is also the CEO and managing director of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor Integrated Industrial Township Greater Noida Limited (DMIC IITGNL) said that they have contributed Rs1.85 crore towards the fight against Covid-19 pandemic in India.“We have given Rs 95 lakh to the PMCares fund and Rs 90 lakh to the UP Chief Minister Distress Relief Funds. We have exhausted our entire corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund,” Bhooshan said.The CEO has appealed to all stakeholders including mobile makers, corporate houses and other businessman to come forward to contribute in this time of crisis.Apart from this Oppo, a mobile manufacturing company, has also donated ₹50 lakh towards the UP Chief Minister Distress Relief Fund to be used for Covid-19 measures being taken by the state government. Officials said that the Greater Noida authority, like other government bodies, is making all efforts to take steps to contain the spread of Covid-19 by conducting regular sanitisation drives in sectors, villages and other public spaces people visit for procuring essentials.“We are conducting sanitization drives in all markets, government offices, shops, community halls and villages to check further spread of Covid-19 in the district,” said Bhooshan.The authority has also decided to distribute masks to the needy who cannot purchase it on their own.“We have been distributing food to migrant daily wagers, their dependents and people from other economically weaker sections of the society so that they do not starve. Our volunteers and at least 500 staff members are engaged in daily distribution of food to needy staying at construction sites, slums and other areas of the city,” said an official requesting anonymity.Of the 58 cases of Covid-19 in Gautam Budh Nagar district, which includes Greater Noida, 39 are directly or indirectly linked with fire safety solutions company Ceasefire. Fear of community spread in the district heightened when the domestic help of a Ceasefire company employee, along with three of her family members, tested positive for Covid-19 late Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-contributes-for-fight-against-covid-19/story-W30kMGOX2qx2X9Q23GL5LJ.html
07-04-2020||Noida||Builders urge UP-Rera to extend dates to register housing projects, postpone coercive action||Noida builders have urged Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera ) to issue a notification postponing the implementation of old orders, including those related to compliance and registrations of housing projects, as all government and private sector offices are shut in view of the of the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Builders said even after the government announced the lockdown, the old orders issued by UP-Rera are being implemented, thereby creating problems for respective builders. The issues, which are being faced by the builders are related to refunds orders by UP-Rera, obtainment of registration number for a housing project, continuation of escrow account for housing projects and submission of quarterly progress report of respective realty projects, among others.“As per the rules, UP-Rera has ordered refund in cases wherein the developer has failed to deliver a project as per the timelines promised. We have requested UP-Rera that the execution of such orders be postponed for the next three months as the financial condition of all builders is not sound, given the slowdown in the real estate sector,” RK Arora, president (Uttar Pradesh chapter) National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a developers’ lobbying body, said.Builders said as per rules, they have to renew the registration of a housing project once it expires. But builders, whose registration date has by now expired, cannot do so due to the lockdown and they cannot even continue with the process of obtaining registration for old projects. UP-Rera also has a role in managing escrow accounts, which were opened to regulate the use of funds collected from buyers. Builders requested that the escrow accounts operations should be continued as they have to pay salary of the staff and also taxes.“We have requested UP-Rera to issue a notification that all old orders stand postponed for the next three months. Once the lockdown is lifted, UP-Rera can again resume normal activities,” Harendra Yadav, member, NAREDCO, said.UP-Rera member Balvinder Kumar said, “We will look into their demands and take appropriate decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/builders-urge-up-rera-to-extend-dates-to-register-housing-projects-postpone-coercive-action/story-YoYAd5pcklTCL2qqbIOwqM.html
07-04-2020||Lucknow||UP CM’s Covid care fund: Barring BSP, other opposition lawmakers yet to pitch in||The Uttar Pradesh Covid Care Fund is yet to receive pledges of monetary support of Rs 1 crore each from many lawmakers of major opposition parties in the state, barring those of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has set up the fund to buy medical equipment and provide facilities in medical colleges and hospitals to fight the coronavirus. A fund collection target of Rs 1000 to Rs 1500 crore has been set.Yogi Adityanath called BSP chief Mayawati last week to thank her for her directive to her party MLAs to allocate Rs 1 crore from the Vidhayak Nidhi to the Uttar Pradesh Covid Care Fund.The chief minister also allocated Rs 1 crore from his Vidhayak Nidhi and held a video conference with MLAs/MLCs and MPs on the issue. Several opposition leaders attended the two video conferences last week. The attendees included Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary, SP MP Rewati Raman Singh, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhna Mishra.Ram Govind Chaudhary was not available for comment on the issue. When asked whether SP leaders will allocate Rs 1 crore from the MPLAD fund, Rewati Raman Singh said “SP chief Akhilesh Yadav will take a call on the issue.” Samajwadi Party spokesman and former minister Rajendra Chaudhary, said, “Samajwadi Party legislators have already committed or allocated a large chunk of their Vidhayak Nidhi for the fight against coronavirus in their respective assembly constituencies and so may not be left with sufficient amount for allocation of Rs 1 crore to the CM’s Covid Care Fund. They may have to meet other commitments as well. How can SP members withdraw their commitment and take back the amount already given for the cause? The SP legislators will release the remaining amount on the directions of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.”As for the Congress, while Lallu said the party will take a call on the issue, Mishra was not available for comment.Earlier, assembly speaker Hridaya Narayan Dikshit spoke to leaders of political parties, urging them allocate Rs 1 crore for the fund. Dikshit, who has allocated Rs 1 crore from his Vidhayak Nidhi, also spoke to most of the ministers and MLAs, seeking allocation of Rs 1 crore from the Vidhayak Nidhi. “Yes, I tried to speak to all the ministers and MLAs. I have received letters from many ministers and MLAs, informing me about allocation of Rs 1 crore from Vidhayak Nidhi to the UP Covid Relief fund. Those who have sent letters in this regard include minister for finance Suresh Khanna and about 20 legislators,” said Dikshit.The speaker also said, “Each MLA is entitled to spend Rs 3 crore every year from the Vidhayak Nidhi and the limit of allocating Rs 25 lakh per item has been done away with.” A state assembly functionary said although most legislators may agree to donate their salary for the fund, the assembly secretariat was yet to receive their letters of consent in this regard. This delay may be because of the lockdown, said the functionary, adding, “The state government has the powers to deduct Rs 1 crore from the Vidhayak Nidhi of all MLAs and this power should be used to allocate funds to fight the corona disaster.”UP legislative Council chairman Ramesh Yadav has also sent a letter to all the MLCs, urging them to allocate Rs 1 crore for the UP Covid Care Fund. “I request you to allocate Rs 1 crore to the fund to fight the coronavirus pandemic,” Yadav said in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-cm-s-covid-care-fund-barring-bsp-other-opposition-lawmakers-yet-to-pitch-in/story-6wLBTfVV9YvMBqzyTIOrMK.html
07-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi needs 3 lakh protective kits to fight Covid-19, has only 1.47 lakh||The Delhi government, gauging the current rate of hospitalisations for Covid-19 and those being sent to state-run quarantine centres, has projected a requirement of 3 lakh personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for the national capital.Of this, the government so far has been able to make arrangements for only 1.47 lakh PPE kits, which will be used from this weekend.A senior official in the Delhi government’s health department said that at present, the city has stocks that would last for around 4 days only. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We have 5,000 PPE kits at our warehouse and a total of around 4,000 kits available at various hospitals, quarantine centres, testing labs and so on. This is enough to last a week,” the official said.On an average, around 2,500 PPE kits are required for use in the city on a daily basis.To ensure adequate availability of PPE kits — which includes full-body suits, goggles, masks, gloves and shoe covers — for at least a month and to be prepared for any contingency, like the Nizamuddin Markaz case, the Delhi government has placed an order for 1.2 lakh kits and arranged for another 27,000 from the Centre, bringing the total to 1.47 lakh.An official in chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said that 27,000 kits are currently with the DRDO for disinfection.Kejriwal, in a digital address on Monday, thanked the Central government for allotting kits for Delhi and said they would be delivered to the Delhi government in a day or two.“This is a great step towards ensuring the safety of our doctors. The Delhi government, the Central government, and the people are collectively fighting the battle against Covid-19. I hope that we will overcome the virus very soon,” he said.The other 1.2 lakh kits are being bought directly by the central procurement agency (CPA), which is responsible for buying medicines, consumables and equipment for Delhi government-run hospitals.“The kits are now arriving in batches of 3,000-4,000 a day. Earlier, they were coming at a rate of 1,500-2,000, which was ramped up after several meetings with the concessionaire. Given the present scenario, the current rate of arrival of PPE kits is manageable. But, if there is another Markaz like case, then Delhi can slip into a crisis,” said a senior official in the Delhi government.At least 329 of the total 525 coronavirus cases in Delhi have been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, which took place in the Nizamuddin Markaz in mid-March. The demand for PPE kits has grown substantially among medical staff, after at least 24 healthcare workers — doctors, nurses and sanitation staff — contracted Covid-19 in the city.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said that apart from arrangements made by the government, hospitals also now have the power to procure such kits on their own from private manufacturers.But, a senior official in Delhi’s Lok Nayak hospital said that the process was “time consuming”.“The issue is that the PPE kits have to meet the standards specified by the government and the rate per kit has to be either Rs 1087.47 or less. So, a lot of time goes in the verification process. Our staff is already working round-the-clock, tending to Covid-19 patients. Besides, only a few supply kits that are actually up to the mark,” the official said on condition of anonymity.The shortage of these kits, though not immediate, has forced the Delhi government to even change its appeal from seeking donations for the CM’s relief fund to asking MLAs, MPs, NGOs, private firms and other stakeholders to provide PPE kits instead.Kejriwal also did the same when Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) east Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir offered a total of Rs 1 crore to the Delhi government to buy PPE kits and masks for doctors and nurses.Thanking Gambhir for his initiative on Twitter, Kejriwal wrote, “Gautam, thank you for your offer. The problem is not of money but availability of PPE kits. We would be grateful if you could help us get them from somewhere immediately. Delhi government will buy them. Thank you .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-needs-3-lakh-protective-kits-to-fight-covid-has-only-1-47-lakh/story-uO6kgourXRIlYGIBtdWSNL.html
07-04-2020||Delhi||25,000 in quarantine under watch, 247 booked in Delhi||The Delhi Police, using mobile phone surveillance, have filed 160 first information reports (FIRs) against people in home-quarantine for violating lockdown orders, officials said on Monday. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the mobile phones of 25,000 people in home-quarantine would be monitored.Besides, the police have also filed 81 FIRs after physical checks at houses of the people under home-quarantine. Six more persons were booked on the complaints of their neighbours, the police said in a statement, taking the total number of those booked till Monday evening to 24x7.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMost of them are being booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act and sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). First-time offenders or those who inadvertently stepped out of their houses are being booked only under Section 188 of the IPC, the police said.“People who are deliberately and frequently breaking the home-quarantine rule are charged with all the three sections of the IPC, as the maximum punishment they would be getting is up to two years of imprisonment, or fine, or both. Those found breaking the rule for the first time or unintentionally are booked only under Section 188 of IPC and given a warning that harsher sections would be slapped if they are caught violating the order again,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.How the enforcement is being doneThe police are primarily using geofencing technology to identify the quarantined persons venturing out of their residences. “Since we know the address of the persons in home-quarantine, their house is considered the static location. We use software to carry out geofencing of their smartphones. If the person leaves the geofencing area, there is a change in their phone’s tower location and we receive an alert,” a senior police officer said.Each police district has formed a dedicated team, comprising personnel having technical expertise and those who carry out physical checks. “The phone numbers of all the home-quarantined people have been uploaded on the software that tracks the movement,” the officer said.“Any breach of the geofence is communicated to the police station staff concerned. The police then visit the quarantined person’s house and confront him/her with the technical data. If a satisfactory reason is not given, an FIR is registered. The person will be arrested and granted bail,” said the officer, adding that all the sections of the IPC are bailable.Officers said that they are also conducting surprise checks to ensure that those under home-quarantine don’t dodge the police by leaving their phones at home. The police are also scanning the CCTV cameras of the neighbourhood to track the violators, said Dinesh Kumar Gupta, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara).The Delhi government has shared names, phone numbers and residential addresses of more than 25,000 citizens of Delhi who have been put under home-quarantine, to avoid the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. A majority of them are people who have foreign travel history, senior police officers said.Delhi Police spokesperson, Mandeep Singh Randhawa, said that the number of FIRs will continue to increase. “Our police personnel are regularly conducting house visits and those found absent are being booked,” said Randhawa.The decision to use phones for tracking people in home-quarantine was taken in a meeting between Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal almost a week ago.The use of phone location to track a person in quarantine started in China, and was quickly adopted in Singapore and European countries. To ensure that people who are ordered to stay in isolation do not move out, health departments and the police had initially started pasting notices outside their houses and encouraged neighbours to report violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cops-use-phone-surveillance-to-book-those-violating-home-quarantine/story-Gw3HHZzekCXtlTwQLRTXlL.html
07-04-2020||Delhi||Cracker bursting breaks spell of good air in Delhi||At 9pm on Sunday, Delhi’s 13-day spell of good air days was broken. A sudden spurt in firecracker burning on Sunday, coupled with low wind speed, pushed the city’s air quality further into the ‘moderate’ category on Monday.While environment experts said that the situation could have been worse if such unprecedented cracker bursting had happened in “normal circumstances”, authorities are ascertaining how large quantities of crackers were procured by people during the lockdown.Amid the Covid-19 outbreak, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged people to come out to their balconies and light candles, earthen lamps or torch lights for nine minutes at 9pm on Sunday to show their support for the government’s fight against the disease. However, on Sunday evening, while lamps glowed, the sound of firecrackers also echoed across the city.As per the data, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Monday was recorded 142, up from Sunday’s 102, in the lower-end of ‘moderate’ zone. On Saturday, the AQI was 87 (‘satisfactory’), as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).By 4.30pm on Monday, the AQI at many stations in Delhi had slipped to the ‘poor’ category. Monitoring stations at Rohini, Wazirpur and Vivek Vihar recorded AQI levels above 200 at 4.30 pm.Since March 24, the air quality levels in the national Capital have consistently remained in the ‘satisfactory’ zone, and had even improved to ‘good’, with an AQI of 45 on March 28.Experts said that assessing real-time air pollution, the spike in the pollution levels between 9pm and 10pm on Sunday was somewhat similar to that seen in the early hours of Diwali night. If such cracker burning activity had happened in regular circumstances, with vehicles plying and industries operating, under similar weather conditions, the AQI would have dipped considerably, experts said.A senior CPCB official said that since cracker burning was consistent across the city and was the only polluting activity that happened, its impact on air quality was noticeable.“Since these circumstances are not normal and everything else is shut, the AQI levels remained in the moderate zone. The problem was that even the wind speed was not strong enough to neutralise the impact of cracker bursting. But Sunday’s cracker burning was more like a freak episode, which authorities were not anticipating. We can attribute the spike in pollution solely to cracker bursting because nothing else is happening,” the official said.Weathermen said that the wind speeds were low through Saturday, Sunday and until Monday afternoon.“The winds were calm on Sunday night and it was only by Monday morning that it improved to reach around five to six kilometres per hour (kmph). By Monday afternoon, the wind speed picked up to reach around 15kmph. This was not enough to blow away the pollution caused by yesterday’s (Sunday) cracker burning,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Srivastava said that the wind speed will pick up from Monday night. There is also a forecast of rain and thunderstorm on Tuesday, which is likely to improve air quality to acceptable levels.Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s (DPCC) hourly average data on particulate matter levels shows that at 9pm on Sunday, PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels in Delhi’s air was 48.1ug/m3. This spiked to 49.5ug/m3 at 10pm and gradually to 57ug/m3 by 6am on Monday.Delhi Police officials said that considering that the city is under lockdown and only the sale of essential commodities is being permitted, chances are that the crackers that were burnt on Sunday night were hoarded by people since last Diwali. Senior officials said that no action was taken against cracker bursting. Officials also confirmed that no permission requests were received by them for licences to sell crackers over the last few weeks.“All shops selling non-essential commodities are shut and our teams are continuously monitoring areas. The crackers that were burst last night could be what people saved from Diwali,” said MS Randhawa, Delhi Police spokesperson.Wholesale cracker dealers said that sale has been completely shut during the lockdown. Narendra Gupta, president of fireworks and general traders association in Sadar Bazar, said that permanent vendors had also stopped distribution and sales. “Nobody had anticipated that there would be a call from the Prime Minister to light candles, let alone cracker bursting,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cracker-bursting-breaks-spell-of-good-air-in-delhi/story-Mxy3qc7ZuWZsk0SzPeZCqI.html

This is the highest single-day number of new infections in the district.Of the 37 cases, 13 were reported until 1pm, and 22 positive tests were confirmed at 5pm, and two cases at 7pm, by the district administration.The total count for Pune district is 142, with 114 in Pune city, 20 in Pimpri-Chinchwad and eight in rural Pune.A senior official from the PMC’s health department requesting anonymity, said, “Of the 37, most are close contacts of already positive Covid-19 patients. Also, it is noticed that those who attended the Delhi Tablighi event are hiding their travel history which is making it difficult for us to isolate and detect people.”The official said, “It is better that all those who attended the event come forward otherwise they will be risking their lives and the lives of their family members.”Among the fresh cases is a four-year-old girl who has tested positive for Covid-19. Of the 37, 20 are admitted to Naidu hospital, seven are at Sassoon hospital, and one each at Deenanath Mangeshkar, KEM and Jehangir hospitals.Officials added that family members of the 60-year-old woman who was brought in deceased to Sassoon hospital on Sunday, and then tested positive, have also tested positive.The PMC official said, “Four family members of the deceased, including a nine-year old boy, 10-year old boy, 39-year-old female and 30-year-old female have tested positive and have been isolated now.” After a sudden spike in the number of cases the administration will now rigorously trace close contacts by conducting house-to-house surveys.Pune division has a total of 661 people who attended the Delhi Markaz Tablighi event, said divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar, of which 299 people have been quarantined, while 49 are from other districts of Maharashtra. A total of 205 are out of Maharashtra.

07-04-2020||Pune||Born in a pandemic: Hospital provides shelter to family of newborn in Pune||Two-day-old Laxmi turned red as she struggled to break into a cry when the summer heat irritated her tender skin. Her mother, 35-year-old Ranabai, tried to comfort her and in that moment she was oblivious to the imminent issue of homelessness and starvation that her family was facing. The Kamla Nehru Hospital has provided the family of four temporary respite by providing them shelter at the hospital until the lockdown is in place. The woman came to Pune with her partner from Pandharpur via a train before they were stranded at the Pune railway station for two days. They were picked up by the Pune police and brought to the shelter created by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) at Mahatma Phule High School on Dhole Patil road. As the woman recovering from the child’s delivery, blew on her neck, the child smiled. “See, the gods made her smile for us,” she says as her partner frets about the last Rs 50 they were left with. As a native of Uttar Pradesh, the woman barely speaks any Marathi.Ranabai’s partner is Sahebrao Bhimrao Adagale, 50, who stands at the end of the corridor outside the postnatal care ward. Dr Lata Trimbake, medical superintendent at Kamla Nehru Hospital, had taken the decision to let the family stay at the hospital. The hospital has made an exception for the family in such unnatural times as Covid19 pandemic has gripped the world. During the routine rounds of PMC medical staff at the shelter homes, the doctors found the woman in labour on the afternoon of April 4.“The health department has appointed 15 teams and one of the doctors found Ranabai in the shelter. When the doctor reached, her labour pain had already begun. An ambulance was called and she was brought here. Primary investigation was conducted and a letter was given to her as she did not have an antenatal card. The baby was 2.7kg and has no complications,” said Dr Trimbake.The family is getting food from the service provided by a volunteer named Subhash Jadhav. The hospital has provided them with a babycare kit, bedsheet, and blankets for the mother and the baby. The couple is not legally married, they do not hold any document to prove their identity and only skill that the man-woman duo hold is that of cutting sugarcane and cooking, respectively. “I’m from a village near Georai in Beed. I met her when she was begging at the Pune railway station around 7-8 years ago. We never got married, but we have been together ever since. Cutting sugarcane was an honest day’s work for good 3-4 months in Pandharpur before it shut down. I picked scrapped for a couple of days, but could not make any money. Then, they picked us up and brought us to the shelter. Now, I do not even have money for a cup tea. How will I care for a newborn?” says Adagale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/born-in-a-pandemic-hospital-provides-shelter-to-family-of-newborn-in-pune/story-eQjqkD7FLtP0MRVx1C5RHL.html

The inmates had sent a request to the Yerawada jail authorities seeking consideration of their plea to be released from the overcrowded jail in the last week of March. They have threatened to go on strike if their matter is not listed for hearing. Their demand comes after a high-powered committee had been constituted in Maharashtra following the Supreme Court (SC) order of decongesting prisons. The SC order decided that undertrial prisoners booked for offences with maximum punishment up to 7 years will be released on interim bail initially for 45 days.Yerawada jail superintendent UT Pawar said, “Nobody is currently on a hunger strike. We have received their application and the same has been forwarded to the Bombay High Court. We cannot release them as they are criminals convicted of serious offences.”In view of the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak in the state, the Maharashtra prison department had requested judicial authorities to grant complete or provisional bail to undertrials in minor and moderate cases to reduce crowding in jails, Sunil Ramanand, additional director general (ADG) of prisons, had said at a press meet held in the city on March 17. The initiative has been proposed in 60 jails of Maharashtra spread across 45 locations. The 60 prisons, which have a capacity of 24,000, hold 38,000 inmates of which 40-45 per cent inmates are lodged in four central prisons including Yerawada, Arthur road, Thane, and Nashik prisons. The Maharashtra government has released 2,520 from 47 prisons till April 2 since it took a decision to release close to 11,000 undertrials who were facing prison terms of less than seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/800-yerawada-jail-inmates-approach-bombay-hc-with-release-request-threaten-to-go-on-strike-if-not-heard/story-iSPe7pQgUwnFjVIBwj4pgO.html

The village has been cordoned off and villagers have been locked inside their homes, while the authorities scramble to trace the source of infection that claimed the life of Gian Chand, the third Covid-19 fatality of the state. It is being claimed that neither the victim had any history of foreign travel nor he had come in contact with any coronavirus positive patient. This has mounted concerns of villagers, especially those residing in Chand’s neighbourhood. As soon as Chand was tested positive for the infection on April 1 at PGIMER, Chandigarh, 12 members of his family were isolated and their samples taken. Even his body was not handed over to his family members and was cremated at Chandigarh.“Our entire village is sealed and nobody is allowed to come out. Only one person from a household could step out to fetch fodder for cattle,” said Rasin sarpanch Ram Mehar. He said for vegetables and staples, local shopkeepers contact vegetable vendors and grocery retailers in Karnal, who deliver the order at the police naka from where it is collected for local sale.SIGN OF RELIEFThe villagers, however, have heaved a sigh of relief as samples of most of Gian Chand’s family members tested negative for Covid-19. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav confirmed that Chand’s 11 family members have tested negative. “But, as a precautionary measure, police deployment in the village will last for few more days even if all family members are tested negative,” he added. ‘Sirsa woman has no history of travel, contact with corona patient’ The 38-year-old Sirsa woman, who tested positive for Covid-19 on March 30, neither has any foreign travel history nor did she come in contact with any confirmed case, said Rohtak PGIMS doctors. PGIMS nodal officer for Covid-19, Dhruva Chaudhary, said the woman was the only positive case admitted to the isolation ward, along with two suspected patients, whose reports are awaited. “We are trying to find the actual source of infection. The woman’s husband tested negative, while their children aged 8 and 6 tested positive,” he added.The woman ran a PG facility in Sirsa, while her husband owned a similar business in Chandigarh.“We have taken 40 samples of the woman’s neighbours and contacts, all of which tested negative. The samples of 66 children, who were in contact to woman’s kids, also tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-800-rasin-villagers-living-in-fear-after-karnal-man-succumbs-to-covid-19/story-6gUwpa1cCFBxKfPZKqhHbI.html

The doctors, along with 50 para-medical staff, were placed under observation after a trauma patient they attended to was reported positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.The hospital at Pimpri had quarantined 92 of its staffers, shut down its surgical unit and fumigated the entire hospital after the patient, who underwent an emergency surgery, tested positive for Covid -19.“It is a big relief for us after we received the NIV (National Institute of Virology) reports. The families and management were worried after the patient was tested positive,” said an official spokesperson of DY Patil Hospital management.Jitendra Bhawalkar, dean, Dr DY Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, said, “A 30-year-old man, residing at Khadki, Pune, was admitted to the emergency section after having blood trauma on March 31. Immediate surgery was performed on him and, on April 2, he developed fever. The doctors got suspicious and his samples were sent for testing to NIV (National Institute of Virology) on April 3. He tested positive for Covid-19 on April 4.”Bhawalkar said the patient was immediately shifted to the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) Hospital in Pimpri. “We then tried to find out all those who had come in contact with the man and quarantined our 42 doctors and 50 para-medical staff as a precautionary measure.”The surgical unit of the hospital was shut down and fumigation of the entire hospital was carried out in view of the high exposure to the Covid-19 patients, he said.Recently, YCM Hospital signed a memorandum of understanding with Dr DY Patil Medical College Hospital to shift all non-Covid-19 patients from YCMH to DY Patil Hospital after the civic body decided to reserve the 750-bed YCMH exclusively to treat Covid -19 cases.Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar had said that the swab tests of the 42 medical staffers who came in direct contact with the man were sent to NIV for testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/92-medical-staffers-of-dr-dy-patil-hospital-at-pimpri-quarantined/story-AFnnirS9s0BqV9XLTnhgiL.html

07-04-2020||Pune||On the Frontline: Single rural women and farm widows are worst affected by lockdown, says Seema Kulkarni||The Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch (Makaam), Maharashtra, has been supporting 500 single and widowed women who do not have ration cards or bank accounts, access food supplies. These women are from across 11 districts of Maharashtra. Seema Kulkarni of the Society for Promoting Participative Ecosystem Management (Soppecom), Pune, which is handling donations and disbursement of funds for Makaam, spoke about this initiative. What is the situation of agricultural village economy in Maharashtra after the lockdown?Maharashtra has been facing an agrarian crisis for some time now. Post-Covid-19 and the lockdown the situation has only worsened. Harvesting operations have come to a halt as elsewhere, supply chains have been broken, so farmers are unable send their produce to the mandis. The curfew in Maharashtra is being implemented rather rigourously and police patrols in villages are preventing farmers from engaging labour to harvest the produce or for other farming activities. This has meant that the agricultural labourers are also without any work. Works under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) have completely stopped. Livestock has also been impacted because movement for grazing has also been restricted. Poultry and meat sales have gone down because of some of the myths around meat and the coronavirus. Why are single women and farm widows disproportionately affected by the current situation?Women are affected deeply by the crisis on various fronts. Many of them engaged in agriculture wage work and now they are without work and hence without any cash flow. They would often buy their ration form the wages they earned on a daily basis. Most of them still do not have separate ration cards as their names are still included in their martial home rations. However, they are living separately with their children and do not get their share from the ration. So they need to buy all their ration at a higher rate from the market.We encountered two problems in our dialogues with the women a) no separate ration cards b) have ration cards but they are not digitally verified so cannot access food grains. This is something that needs to be brought to the attention of the government.Vegetable vending is another task that women engage in weekly markets. All weekly markets have been stopped after the lockdown and women are not able to bring their produce to these markets. Many of the women involved in cane cutting are still on field sites as sugar production comes under essential commodities and the crushing season is on. However, the conditions of work have not improved and no physical distancing, etc maintained. How is Makaam supporting single/widowed women farmers in the current pandemic?The immediate concern staring in our face is the access to food. We are providing direct relief in the form of food supplies to about 500 single and widowed women across 11 districts, primarily farm suicide affected districts. Our second and more sustainable support is through a process of dialogue with the government to ensure that these women benefit from the different schemes announced by the central and the state governments irrespective of ration cards or other forms of documentation. We are writing to state level officials and also district collectors to consider these women in their food distribution programme even if they do not have ration cards or their ration cards are not digitally verified. Secondly, we have also explicitly demanded that women who do get the widow pensions should get it as an advance for 3 months and all the arrears should be cleared as well. Irrespective of whether or not the JanDhan accounts are active or not women should get the Rs 500/month announced by the government. Most importantly, MAKAAM will soon share what support needs to be extended to these women in the post lockdown period as well in the form of work.How is Soppecom raising funds for this initiative? How will the funds be used?Soppecom has appealed to various people to contribute towards extending support to the single and widowed women in rural India. The funds are being used to provide basic food supplies that include cereals and pulses, peanuts jaggery all locally procured in consonance with their eating habits and soaps. The food supplies would help them to tide over the immediate crisis till the government is able to streamline its food distribution process. The support is primarily being extended to those who do not have ration cards as they would not be covered under the recently announced government scheme which caters to only ration card holders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-frontline-single-rural-women-and-farm-widows-are-worst-affected-by-lockdown/story-SGFeBlzpM0rYK8ntro3eOK.html

A truck is easily sanitised in the showers which emanate from all the sides,” said DCP Bawache.Trader Rajendra Sanklecha lauded the efforts undertaken by the police and said, “The police have undertaken a noble cause for the safety of buyers and traders.”According to officials, six more mist blowers have been set up outside the entrance of police stations which come under the jurisdiction of ZoneV of the city police which comprises of Kondhwa, Wanowrie, Market Yard, Bibvewadi Hadapsar and Mundhwa police stations.DCP Bawache said, “The police personnel are at the forefront in this fight against Covid-19 (coronavirus) and they are at a risk to get infected with the Sars-cov-2 virus. So this initiative has been undertaken as a precautionary measure.”Additional Commissioner (Eastern Region) Sunil Phulari, “We ate taking these precautions for the safety of the residents and police personnel in this times of crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-police-use-mist-blowers-as-sanitising-apparatus-outside-market-yard-police-stations/story-oTgBuUTe7gXQiJAE7CRtCM.html
07-04-2020||Pune||Get up to speed with sprint queen Avantika Narale’s lockdown gameplan in Pune||Avantika Narale, city’s sprint queen has not been able to hit the tracks due to the lockdown, but the 17-year old has numerous training drills up her sleeve to make sure the quarantine isn’t hampering her fitness. Narale had missed her training at the Baburao Sanas Ground since March 10, as activities had been suspended at the grounds and the hostel was converted into an isolation centre for Covid-19 patients, even before the lockdown started. Narale practices every evening on normal days under two coaches – Sudhakar Memane and Sanjay Patankar at the ground. The coaches have given Narale a routine to follow during the lockdown at her Wadgaon Sheri residence.Morning sessionMy first session of the day starts at 7am. First, I do warm-up exercises and then squats, push-ups, lunges, burpees and various running exercises in the courtyard of her house. The session continues for two hours. Once I finish training, I have a healthy breakfast and rest till lunch is served. I am fond of listening to music and I do that in my free time. Even while participating in tournaments, I take time out after my training, to listen to music, as it is integral part of my routine. Afternoon sessionAfter lunch, I spend time with my younger brother and we generally play games like ludo and cards. Watching movies on the television set is another thing which I like a lot. I generally prefer to watch old and new Hindi movies. Sometimes, I also take a nap for an hour in the afternoon.Evening sessionI practice from 5pm to 7pm. Jumping, stretching, ABC running drills, climber exercises and different types of running workouts are something I do in the evening. ABC running drills include high knee skips, butt kickers, ankle drill, skipping, high knee running, foreleg extension marching, straight leg running, high knee bounce skips, ankle bounce and bounding. I do all these drills every day and I am in touch with my coaches over the telephone.After finishing my workout, I prefer to watch videos on Youtube about different types of workouts. The videos help me understand different techniques of training. When I see any new type of drill over the internet, I prefer to discuss it with my coaches, before including it in my routine.At night, it is family time again and we prefer to play cards and ludo on alternate days. Gym I don’t have an everyday gym session even on normal days, so I am not missing the gym much. I have very good drills which help me stay active and fit. The drills are perfect for quarantine days. I miss running on the tracks, but at moment staying home is the best option for all of us. I am praying things become normal soon.HobbiesListening to songs and watching movies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/get-up-to-speed-with-sprint-queen-avantika-narale-s-lockdown-gameplan-in-pune/story-cbpCkZYMqWo6nciEpZJF3K.html

A study on trending cyber crimes shows fraudsters are taking advantage of the situation as many people are using online banking services to be updated with their banking activities.“Taking advantage of this, several cyber fraudsters have started calling up people posing as bank officials and asking them for their bank details and One Time Password (OTP) if they wish to delay their loan’s equated monthly instalment (EMI),” said Vishal Thakur, DCP, Mumbai cyber police station. Cyber police have received several complaints over the past 10 days and are helping local police stations probe such cases. “Fraudsters are also sending links by messages asking people to download applications like Anydesk, Quick Support, Airdroid and Team Viewer which provides remote access to your phones and enables the fraudster to hack your phone and steal your bank details,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyber-police-issues-advisory-on-cyber-crimes-amid-lockdown/story-0tDnAdHq4u5w7fAcdsUz0O.html
07-04-2020||City||No observing quarantine? App to track, alert Mohali police, health officials||A Covid Control App to identify and mark quarantined spots and people, enabling easy tracking by health and police officials, has been launched by the district police and IT consultant Avinash Sharma in an attempt to gain technological advantage over the battle against Covid-19.The app, which runs on Android, has to be mandatorily downloaded by those who are quarantined. Their location is tracked via their mobile phone numbers through geo fencing technology that creates a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographical area.“Telecom service providers will help track the phone numbers,” says Mohali senior superintendent of police and nodal officer for Covid-19 Kuldeep Singh Chahal, who has been involved with the project along with deputy superintendent of police Amroz Singh .Every quarantined user will be geo-fenced within a 500 metre radius of his or her place of quarantine and will have to upload a selfie every hour. The system will then update the location and match it with the quarantine area. Anyone breaching the geo fence will get a warning message which will also alert the police control room, even if the phone is switched off.Penal action taken against those breaching norms include FIRs registered under Sections 188 (disobedience of orders duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“Other app users will also be able to see, in real time, all the ‘red zones’ and quarantined or cluster areas on the app. People entering an infected area will get an alert,” Chahal said.The 24-hour control room has been set up near the Phase 8 police station with a dedicated team to monitor quarantined persons and bring the violations to the notice of the police station concerned.Also, WhatsApp groups have been formed at the police station level for immediate redressal of issues involving the local Saanjh (community) team, police teams and representatives of society to raise genuine queries and troubleshoot at the local level. Any issue which is beyond the scope of a group will be redressed at the district level. A 24-hour police helpline number (88720-90029,0172-292-0074,0172-227-0091) has also been up to resolve issues related to the lockdown through direct intervention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-observing-quarantine-app-to-track-alert-mohali-police-health-officials/story-BptBVWxpqdTMjcNFTFpL2O.html
07-04-2020||World||Trump sets stage for UNSC meet on Covid-19 on April 9; pans WHO, China||After US President Donald Trump virtually blamed the World Health Organisation for playing the Chinese side on the coronavirus pandemic, heat will now mount on Beijing at an informal discussion on the virus outbreak in the UN Security Council on Thursday, April 9, at 3 pm EST (April 10 12.30 am). The informal discussion will be preceded by a briefing by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.“The WHO really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately, I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation,” Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday. It is not what prompted the outburst but as one Indian analyst put it, Trump had hit the nail on its head.WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was elected to the post after China backed him in the May 2017 election as he defeated US-backed Dr David Nabarro, who was the candidate of the UK. Despite the coronavirus being detected in Wuhan in China as early as November 17, 2019, the WHO categorised Covid 19 outbreak as a pandemic on 12 March 2020 when it had crossed the borders and created havoc in Europe. By then, the virus had already killed 1,000 people in the european region.All the 10 non-permanent members of the UN Security Council have backed the informal discussion led by the UNSC President; the post is held by the Dominican Republic. But whether the closed-door discussion will conclude with any outcome depends on the proposals put up and the exercise of veto powers of China and its ally Russia.If President Trump’s tweet is indicative of the US mind, then the vote will be 13 to 2 or 14 to 1 depending on how Russia plays. Other two members of the P5, the UK and France have suffered at the hands of pandemic and so has Europe.While China may say that the pandemic is not a peace and security issue - the argument used to block a request by Estonia for a discussion last month - the economic misery that the pandemic has hurled the world towards a deep crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-sets-stage-for-unsc-meet-on-covid-19-on-april-9-pans-who-china/story-uqEwh7zS2KPGYbgIDAb1ZM.html
07-04-2020||World||‘WHO blew it’: Trump targets health body for ‘faulty’ recommendation over Covid-19||As the number of fatalities crossed 11,000 in the United States Tuesday morning and the country continued to struggle of rising number of cases and shortage of medical supplies, President Donald Trump put the World Health Organization on notice calling it “China-centric” and giving the US bad advice.“The WHO really blew it,” the president wrote on twitter, “For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?”Also read: Trump sets stage for UNSC meet on Covid-19 on April 9; pans WHO, ChinaTrump has touted the February 2 ban on travelers from China as a key part of his administration’s response to the outbreak and that he ordered despite the advice of those who wanted him to “ride it out”. But it wasn’t immediately clear what brought on this sudden outburst against the world body that is trying to organize a united global response to the pandemic that has killed more than 76,000 people and caused 1.3 million confirmed infections around the globe. The WHO had in January recommended countries keep their borders even as it was warning the world about the epidemic which it branded a pandemic in March.American officials and lawmakers have accused WHO of readily certifying Chinese numbers on the outbreak that they believe are grossly suppressed. Rick Scott, a Republican senator, has said WHO is “helping Communist China cover up” the extent of the outbreak and called for a congressional hearing to consider continued US funding of the world body.The United States has exited a number of world bodies and pact on President Trump watch: the Paris Accord on climate change (2017), UNESCO (2017), Iran deal (2018) and UNHCR (2018). And the president has complained about US contributions to world bodies such as the United Nations. The president has been battling criticism himself for botched response to the crisis, including delayed start of mitigation efforts, despite sufficient warnings, including, as reported widely on Monday, by one of his top advisers, Peter Navarro, who wrote an internal White House memo in January warning that that the epidemic could imperil the “lives of millions of Americans”. The president was underplaying the threat at the time.The number of fatalities went up to 11,018 Sunday morning confirmed cases to nearly 370,000. New York state accounted for a third of both the fatalities and cases with more than 4,750 deaths and 131,000 cases. New York city, the epicenter of the American outbreak, had 3,485 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-blew-it-trump-targets-health-body-for-faulty-recommendation-over-covid-19/story-iYPODBhuVDNtFQJpdhOeeJ.html

The previous single-day record was 630, set on Friday.New York has borne the brunt of America’s deadly coronavirus pandemic, accounting for around half the number of deaths across the country.COVID-19 has killed more than 11,000 people in the United States, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University.Cuomo said New York appeared be nearing the peak of its pandemic, with a three-day average of hospitalizations down.He added that intensive care admissions and intubations had also declined.“We’re projecting that we’re reaching a plateau in the number of hospitalizations,” Cuomo told reporters.He said social distancing was working, urging New Yorkers to continue to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary.“I know it’s hard but we have to keep doing it,” Cuomo implored.On Monday, the governor extended a shutdown until near the end of the month, ordering schools and non-essential businesses to remain closed until April 29.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was “too early to draw any definite conclusions” about whether the situation was improving in the Big Apple.“I want to really make sure none of us in public life tell you we have turned a corner until we are absolutely certain,” he told reporters.Elsewhere, a crew member of the military hospital ship USNS Comfort tested positive for the virus, a navy spokesperson told AFP.The vessel arrived in New York last month to relieve the burden on hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.“The crew member is isolated from patients and other crew members. There is no impact to Comfort’s mission, and this will not affect the ability for Comfort to receive patients,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-registers-record-731-coronavirus-deaths-in-24-hours/story-EzVTcuvLbuJdvo4TfxeV7N.html
07-04-2020||World||UK mood more sombre as world leaders wish PM Johnson recovery from Covid-19||The mood across the United Kingdom turned gloomier when it was announced on Monday night that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit in hospital, as get-well messages from world leaders poured in.The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has crossed 5,000 in the UK, with the number of cases testing positive has grown to over 51,000. New mega hospitals are being set up as the National Health Service grapples with the growing challenge.Apart from the inconvenience, and even public irritation by some at the restrictions imposed, there is much despair at not being able to enjoy sunny, increasingly warm weather that coincided with the three-week lockdown imposed from March 23.The stay-at-home message harped on from every media has prompted the vast majority of Britons hunkering down in homes, barely emerging for shopping, walks or essential work. There are concerns that the situation may lead to mental health issues.Johnson’s political friends, foes and others rallied for his quick return to Downing Street, with many calling for national clapping in his support at 8 pm on Tuesday. #ClapForBoris trended, but critics insisted they would not join, given his controversial handling of the pandemic.The government’s approach (’herd immunity’ giving way to lockdown) has come in for much criticism from experts and others, but several critics said the country cannot afford a lack of strong leadership at the top of government, and wished him speedy recovery.Ministers reiterated the core message to stay at home and cited Johnson’s hospitalisation as an example that the virus can affect anyone, and cited his previous robust health maintained by regular runs and cycling as not making him immune to it.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among world leaders wishing Johnson speedy recovery. He tweeted: “You’re a fighter and you will overcome this challenge. Prayers for you good health and best wishes in ensuring a healthy UK”.US President Donald Trump said Americans “are all praying for his recovery”, adding: “I want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine, and a friend to our nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson. We are very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon”.Russia President Vladimir Putin wished Johnson a speedy recovery, saying he was “convinced that your energy, optimism and sense of humour will help you overcome the disease”, while French President Emmanuel Macros tweeted: “My full support to Boris Johnson, his family and the British people at this difficult time. I hope he will rapidly overcome this ordeal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mood-more-sombre-as-world-leaders-wish-pm-johnson-recovery-from-covid-19/story-Q3C2chAizhiAsI8HCFMfXJ.html

Downing Street said if Raab were also to be incapacitated, the role would be performed by chancellor Rishi Sunak.Johnson, 55, was described by his spokesperson as being stable, in ‘good spirits’, breathing unassisted and without pneumonia. Queen Elizabeth, members of the royal family, leading individuals across the political spectrum and others wished him speedy recovery.Friends of Johnson recalled his robust health based on playing rugby, tennis and running. Former prime minister David Cameron described him as a “tough and resilient guy”, adding: “He is pretty fit. I have faced him on the tennis court and am sure he will be fine”.Michael Gove, cabinet office minister, announced that he did not have symptoms but is in self-isolation. He is the latest senior figure at the heart of the Johnson government whose movements have been curbed by the virus.Gove said while working from home that Johnson is not on ventilator, but has been administered oxygen: “One of the reasons for being in intensive care is to make sure that whatever support the medical team considered to be appropriate can be provided”.“The prime minister was taken into hospital on Sunday. He was undergoing a series of tests when his condition deteriorated. And the medical advice was that he should be moved to intensive care”, he added.Officials said Raab has full authority of a prime minister but will not be able to appoint or drop ministers in the Johnson government. Raab chaired meetings related to the response to coronavirus on Tuesday.Johnson’s partner, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, also contracted the virus but is recovering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-is-stable-in-icu-says-official/story-wnmanm7z9UHQb90WrutHqL.html
07-04-2020||World||China reports zero deaths as once worst-hit Wuhan to lift 76-day lockdown||The first epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic, Wuhan where the novel coronavirus emerged in late December is set to allow residents to travel outside the city on Wednesday for the first time since January 23, ending a 76-day unprecedented lockdown implemented to contain the outbreak.The cautious lifting of the mass quarantine in Wuhan on Wednesday means the sealed city will reconnect its severed transport links with the rest of China: trains will leave the station; flights will take off from the airport and private cars will be able to drive out of city borders.The first steps toward the gradual lifting of Wuhan’s lockdown comes in the backdrop of China on Tuesday reporting zero deaths from the disease for the first time since the national health commission (NHC) started to publish disease data in January.Watch | China to lift traffic ban from coronavirus epicentre Wuhan after 11 weeks A city of around 11 million people, Wuhan was the eye of the virus storm; it has until now accounted for more than 2,500 of the 3,331 Covid-19-related deaths and over 50,000 of the nearly 82,000 infections China has reported.The coronavirus first emerged in the city in December, by most accounts from a seafood and meat market, stealthily and rapidly spreading between humans after it jumped from a host animal to patient zero – not an unusual zoonotic event but which in this case has gone on to assume pandemic proportions, killing more than 70,000 and sickening over 1.3 million globally.The residents of Wuhan didn’t know what had hit them.Instead, the government hit them with the largest urban lockdown in history, which in the weeks since January 23 became tighter and tighter, and spread to the rest of the province of Hubei, virtually locking up 60 million people. Officials and experts, however, have clearly said the outbreak control procedures will remain in place.Wang Zhonglin, Wuhan’s chief of the Communist Party of China (CPC), told a meeting on Sunday that authorities will “…continue carrying out strict community-based monitoring and management, making sure that a rebound in new infections won’t occur following the traffic resumption.”Entry and exit restrictions at and monitoring of residential communities will continue, officials said.Local media reports said restaurants, hotels, shops, buses and subway stations in Wuhan will continue to ask citizens to scan their health codes and register so that their health status and travel history could be monitored.Like in the rest of China, focus in Hubei and Wuhan will also be on asymptomatic and imported cases.The local health commission said Hubei had 690 asymptomatic patients under medical observation.The Chinese mainland reported 32 new imported cases of Covid-19 on MondayBringing the total number of imported cases to 983, the NHC said Tuesday.Of the total imported cases, 285 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery and 698 were being treated in hospitals with 21 in severe condition, the commission said in its daily report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-zero-deaths-as-once-worst-hit-wuhan-to-lift-76-day-lockdown/story-obOasY0jWpwM9RyyUMvUcP.html
07-04-2020||World||What you need to know about the coronavirus right now||Here’s what you need to know about the coronavirus right now:British leader in intensive carePrime Minister Boris Johnson was being treated for worsening coronavirus symptoms in an intensive care unit on Tuesday. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is deputising for him as the country is in a state of virtual lockdown, a situation due to be reviewed early next week.Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital late on Sunday after 10 days of persistent symptoms, including a high temperature. His condition deteriorated rapidly over the next 24 hours, and he has received oxygen.Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancee, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday that she was feeling better.China marks a milestone - no new deathsFor the first time since the coronavirus outbreak began, China reported no new deaths on Tuesday. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,740 as of Monday, while 3,331 people have died, according to its National Health Commission.With mainland China well past the peak of infections in February, authorities have turned their attention to imported cases and asymptomatic patients, who show no symptoms but can still pass on the virus.Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, is due to allow people to leave the city on Wednesday for the first time since it was locked down on Jan. 23 to curb the spread of the virus.Focus on anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquineIn a matter of weeks, the decades-old anti-malaria drug that President Donald Trump has persistently promoted as a potential weapon against COVID-19 has become a standard of care in areas of the United States hit hard by the pandemic — though doctors prescribing it have no idea whether it works.Scientists have detailed biochemical properties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections, as it blocks steps in the replication of certain viruses, and can suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.India will allow some exports of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump urged New Delhi to release supplies of the drug seen as a possible treatment for COVID-19.India could face retaliation for its decision to ban exports of the drug, Trump said late on Monday in Washington.Tentative signs of plateauingThe governors of New York, New Jersey and Louisiana pointed to tentative signs on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak may be starting to plateau in their states, but warned against complacency as the death toll approached 11,000 nationwide.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said statewide deaths from COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus, were up 599 from Sunday, on par with an increase of 594 during the previous 24 hours and 630 on Friday.In neighbouring New Jersey, the state with the second-highest number of cases and deaths, Governor Phil Murphy cited a 12% daily growth rate in confirmed positive cases on Monday, half the rate from March 30.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards similarly expressed cautious optimism. “New hospital admissions are trending downward,” he told a news conference.World’s tallest statue for sale? Not likelyPolice in India lodged a case this week against an unknown online fraudster who tried selling the world’s largest statue, the Statue for Unity in Gujarat, for $4 billion, claiming the proceeds would be used to help the government of the western state fund its coronavirus fight.Police say cybercrimes have surged 86% in the four weeks since the virus scare gripped India, with scams ranging from free mobile recharges to offers of free Netflix subscriptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-right-now/story-0v0zsW3t0HhGeyHWnLhAHJ.html
07-04-2020||World||World Health Day 2020: 20 habits to give up that are ruining your health||Every year, World Health Day is celebrated to spread awareness on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and various aspects related to ensuring efficient healthcare across the globe. From supporting healthcare professionals to leading campaigns against substance abuse and sounding the bugle to fight some of the leading non-communicable diseases, the World Health Organization settles on a theme every year on World Health Day.The WHO has named this year the ‘International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife’. This year’s World Health Day theme couldn’t be more apt as it is dedicated to honouring the indefatigable nurses and midwives across the globe.As the world unites to honour the many nurses and healthcare workers across the globe, the least we can do is to take a pledge towards maintaining our health. This World Health Day, let us resolve to get rid of some habits that stand in the way of building good health.Let 2020 be the year where we bid adieu to 20 health-damaging habits.1. Sleep deprivationThere’s nothing as bad as depriving your body of sleep. Experts suggest an average adult requires between 8 to 6 hours of sleep every day. Following a routine is of the utmost importance for good health. 2. Binge eatingThis is a shortcut to gaining weight, especially around the waistline. Reach out to healthy snacking like eating nuts instead to binge eating.3. Excessive screen timeLimit screen time, need we say more?4. SmokingSmoking and tobacco consumption kills thousands across the globe every year. It is also one of the leading causes of lung, throat and mouth cancer.5. Excessive alcohol consumptionToo much alcohol consumption at regular intervals can have a debilitating effect on your health. From altering your gut microbiome to affecting stamina, the cons of excessive alcohol consumption are many.6. Prolonged sittingApple CEO Tim Cook had described sitting as the “new cancer” some years ago. Take regular breaks, stretch or go for a quick 5-minute walk while at work - keep moving.7. Processed sugar consumptionSugar is the enemy, experts have often warned. Make a switch to jaggery or honey over refined or processed sugar.8. Excessive refined flour consumptionGive your health a boost by giving indigenous flour a try. Supermarkets these days are full of a variety of flours made from ragi, whole wheat, buckwheat among others that will not only give your regular dishes a delectable spin but also give your health a boost.9. Eating too quicklyChewing your food properly and for long gives the brain and the gut the required time to come into action and digest the food efficiently. 10. Consuming large mealsThe mantra is to exercise portion control. Consuming large meals makes digestion sluggish and makes one feel lethargic. 11. Fast food consumptionFull of empty calories, excessive sodium, sugar and fat - fast foods are something you must say goodbye to on your road to achieving good health. Eat local and fresh as much as possible. Read your labels and steer clear of processed and packaged foods as much as possible. 12.

On Monday morning, AFP saw nine bodies loaded into trucks outside Wyckoff Hospital in Brooklyn.Several undertakers interviewed by AFP said they were struggling to deal with New York state’s coronavirus death toll of more than 500 a day. Between Friday and Saturday, a high of 630 deaths were recorded.“The majority of funeral homes do not have refrigeration or (have) limited refrigeration,” said Ken Brewster, owner of Crowe’s Funeral Homes in Queens.“If you don’t have the space... you need those trucks,” added Brewster, whose small business has been bombarded with requests for funeral services for COVID-19 patients over the past week.Like 9/11’Pat Marmo manages five funeral homes across the city.He is finding it difficult to cope with the stress generated by influx of bodies, particularly because he himself just lost a cousin and close friend to the pandemic.“The hospitals are pushing (us). They want the people picked up (as quickly as possible) and the funeral homes don’t have the facilities to handle these bodies,” he told AFP.Marmo estimates that his homes are currently dealing with three times more bodies that normal and that burials will last well into next month.“It’s almost like 9/11, going on for days and days and days,” he said, referring to the worst terror strikes on US soil back on September 11, 2001.Undertakers are so overcrowded that a city official raised the possibility Monday of carrying out temporary burials in a public park.“Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified, orderly and temporary manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take,” tweeted Mark Levine, a Manhattan council representative.The comments caused quite a stir in America’s most populous city, which has already been transformed by the pandemic, including in Central Park where a field hospital is tending to virus patients.Apex of deaths? The mayor’s spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, stressed that the city government was not considering using local parks as cemeteries.But she added that Hart Island, where around one million New Yorkers are buried in mass graves, may be used “for temporary burials, if the need grows.”Mayor Bill de Blasio himself spoke of the possibility of temporary burials “to tide us over until the end of the crisis.“We are not at that point,” he told reporters, before refusing to give any more details.Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that the number of deaths across New York state had flattened out since Saturday’s high, below 600 a day.He suggested the state may be at the peak of its pandemic, but extended stay-at-home measures until April 29, saying now was not the time to end social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-morgues-overflow-new-york-struggles-with-covid-19-dead/story-OKtK5pVzfAckJniWCjiX1J.html

Indian pharma industry supplies HIV drugs to 8 million patients in south Africa, paracetamol to the UK, 80 % of all drugs to the neighbourhood including Maldives and Mauritius, and will supply hydroxychloroquine to big countries affected by the coronavirus like the US, Spain, Germany and Brazil. For the past three days since the DGFT put a ban on export of hydroxychloroquine on April 4, the empowered committee has been meeting to reconcile the demands of the health ministry and the pharmaceutical industry. We informed all the countries including the US about the change in policy. It is a matter of record,” said a senior South Block official.According to sources, the change in the export policy of critical drugs was communicated to the countries concerned through the External Affairs Ministry early on Monday. The DGFT was told to issue a notification to this effect.The formal announcement by the foreign ministry was made on Tuesday. Also Read: Coronavirus case count to guide India’s lockdown futureAnurag Srivastava, the external affairs ministry spokesperson attributed the decision to “the humanitarian aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic” battle. “We will also be supplying these essential drugs to some nations who have been particularly badly affected by the pandemic,” he said.Behind PM Modi’s decision to lift the export ban is the message that India will not walk out of any commitment on critical drugs particularly at a time when the world is fighting the coronavirus, people familiar with the development said.India has a $ 50 billion pharma industry that employees a vast force and caters to critical drugs for large parts of the world. Some countries such as Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius are completely dependent on the Indian industry for its supplies.Also Read: There’s light at the end of the tunnel | OpinionSince the US companies had placed hydroxychloroquine orders on 100% export-oriented units in India, the much-needed drug will be supplied almost immediately with the pharma companies sitting on a drug pile.President Trump had called up PM Modi on Sunday, the day after the DGFT banned hydroxychloroquine export on April 5. The government decided to relax the restriction after satisfying itself that India had enough stocks of essential drugs to meet any possible requirement of the health ministry.The DGFT notification on licensing hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol is in the works and will be issued any time soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-modi-s-hydroxychloroquine-export-order-a-covid-19-message-to-the-world/story-ySR32J4ccmcnhrCzARv3jI.html

Their bodies were lying on the ground,” Ayesha Chundrigar, who runs ACF Animal Rescue, told neas agency AFP.“It was so horrific, I can’t tell you.”As the virus pandemic grew, Pakistan’s major cities were plunged into lockdown, forcing many shops to close. Only stalls selling essential goods such as food and medicine were allowed to continue operating.The bodies of about 20 dogs were found dumped in a sewer near Lahore’s Tollinton Market, a hub for pet businesses which had closed leaving animals to starve.The total number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan has sharply increased to 3,864 with more than 500 fresh infections while the death toll reached 54, the health officials said on Monday.The Ministry of National Health Services, in an early morning update on its website, reported that four patients died of coronavirus in the last 24 hours.According to the officials, Punjab has 1,918 cases, Sindh 932, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 500, Gilgit-Baltistan 211, Balochistan 202, Islamabad 83 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 18.The increase in the number of new cases was reported despite hectic efforts to curtail the spread of the virus.The government has extended the partial lockdown until April 14 and asked people to stay at homes and follow social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horrific-says-activist-as-hundreds-of-lockdown-hit-animals-die-in-pakistan/story-QHXGwT49MWSbe9gpsRVYuO.html

Though a nationwide lockdown has not been enforced, restrictions continue to remain in place across the country.“To stay at home, to continue this period of isolation and distance is the best way to get out as quickly as possible, but certainly it will be a case of several weeks, perhaps several months,” Trudeau said in a press conference. Trudeau spoke even as thousands of Canadians became part of the first batch availing a federal bailout package, which provides CA$ 500 per week, to those who have been economically battered by the crisis. Canadians have grave concerns about the period of economic hardship looming. According to a public opinion survey conducted by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute or ARI, 87% of those polled said that “on the economic front, the worst is yet to come.”Trudeau has been in self-isolation since his wife Sophie Gregoire tested positive for the virus in mid-March. However, he has opted to work from home in isolation even after she was given the all clear by doctors. Trudeau indicated that he may return to “office” in the days ahead, though he will largely work from home, in this case Rideau Cottage in Ottawa, since that’s what he and the government has asked “of everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-in-canada-normal-life-can-stay-disrupted-for-several-months-says-justin-trudeau/story-uiKJ5iLWpO8nwQe2cvImWI.html

He was undergoing a series of tests, his condition deteriorated. And the medical advice was that he should be moved to intensive care at around seven o’clock last night”, he added.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab is deputising for Johnson.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) on March 30 lowered the seven-day reverse repo rate to 2.20 per cent from 2.40 per cent, the largest cut in nearly five years. The PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points to 4.05 per cent on February 20, after various liquidity injections and other policy easing earlier in the year.The PBOC cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the second time this year on March 13, releasing 550 billion yuan.The government is set to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus. It aims to spur infrastructure investment, backed by as much as 2.8 trillion yuan of local government special bonds, according to news agency Reuters. The national budget deficit ratio could rise to record levels, Reuters reported quoting sources.The ruling Communist Party’s Politburo had said on March 27 that it would step up macroeconomic policy changes and pursue more proactive fiscal policy. It called for expanding the budget deficit, issuing more local and national bonds, guiding interest rates lower, delaying loan repayments, reducing supply-chain bottlenecks and boosting consumption.Beijing had earlier introduced various small measures and fiscal expenditure such as tax breaks, reduced power charges and fee reductions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-half-a-million-companies-in-china-shut-shop-as-covid-19-batters-economy-report/story-I5UVjndw8U7836wSyUogcO.html

07-04-2020||World||Japan to declare state of emergency over coronavirus||Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will on Tuesday declare a state of emergency in parts of the country, including Tokyo, over a spike in coronavirus infections.“I have decided that a situation gravely affecting people’s life and the economy has occurred. This evening, I plan to call a government headquarters meeting and declare a state of emergency,” Abe said Tuesday.He announced the plan a day earlier, citing “rapid increases of new infections, particularly in urban areas like Tokyo and Osaka”.The declaration is expected to take effect from midnight and will empower governors of seven affected regions to ask people to stay inside and businesses to close their doors.But it stops far short of the sort of lockdown seen in parts of Europe and the United States, with no enforcement mechanism to keep people inside or shutter business, nor penalties for those who fail to comply.Experts and local leaders have pushed for the declaration, and 80 percent of people polled by public broadcaster TBS over the weekend said they backed the move.Seven regions will be affected: Tokyo, neighbouring Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama, the western hub of Osaka and neighbouring Hyogo, and the southwestern region of Fukuoka.The measure is expected to be in place for around a month initially.It comes with pressure growing on the government to take fresh action as medical experts sound the alarm on a spike in infections, with Tokyo reporting a record 143 new cases on Sunday, still far below those seen in many parts of the world.Doctors in the capital warned this week that the city was already in “critical condition”, with hospitals stretched thin.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, who has pushed for the emergency declaration, urged residents on Tuesday to cooperate with requests to limit movement.“It may cause inconvenience in daily life, but I call for everyone’s cooperation because lives are at stake,” she told reporters.In addition to asking people to stay inside and urging the closure of businesses that attract crowds, the measure allows governors to commandeer property for medical purposes.Koike is expected to explain how the measure will apply in Tokyo at a news conference later Tuesday.Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said public transport would not be scaled back but “we will take appropriate measures to reduce person-to-person contacts drastically”.“We will mobilise all possible policies to prevent infections from spreading further,” he added.“I’d like residents in designated regions to act calmly.”The economic impacts of the measure have raised concern, and Abe on Monday unveiled plans for a stimulus package worth around $1 trillion, or 20 percent of gross domestic product.Japan has so far been spared the sort of virus outbreak seen in parts of Europe and the United States, with close to 4,000 confirmed infections and 80 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-declare-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus/story-OU3tKjbU0elIggjTXacjtM.html

I wish him a speedy and full recovery,” she tweeted.The EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that “my thoughts are with you and your family.” Barnier is recovering in quarantine in his native France after announcing March 19 that he, too, had tested positive for the coronavirus.“Wishing Boris Johnson all the best and a speedy recovery. My thoughts are with you and your family,” Barnier tweeted.Also read: UK Covid-19 death toll likely to be between 7,000 and 20,000, says epidemiologist European Council President Charles Michel also expressed a similar sentiment.“Get well soon, Boris,” Michel tweeted.The wishes from two of the European Union’s top officials underlined the setting aside of political tussling that had characterised the pre-virus relations with Johnson.Britain left the EU at the end of January this year as a result of its Brexit decision, but thorny negotiations are meant to continue for the rest of this year to define future ties.Johnson has insisted those talks will not go on beyond the end of December, in line with a law his government has passed, even though a Brexit agreement between both sides allows an extension of up to two years.Boris Johnson was moved to the St Thomas Hospital in London on Sunday night, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus.

07-04-2020||World||Dominic Raab: A combative lawyer who is now Boris Johnson’s stand-in as UK Premier||With British Prime Minister Boris Johnson fighting for health in the intensive case of a hospital in London, the UK is facing a leadership crisis.The 55-year-old prime minister was taken to the hospital on Sunday night for routine tests after struggling to shake off Covid-19, but his condition worsened during Monday afternoon.Britain has no formal succession plan should the prime minister become incapacitated, but Johnson, 55, has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for him.Raab is a former Foreign Office lawyer who has been both an ally and a rival to his boss.During the Brexit campaign in 2016, Raab campaigned alongside Johnson successfully to break away from the European Union. Three years later, the pair stood against each other in the Conservative Party’s leadership contest.Raab, who was the Brexit minister under former premier Theresa May, quit after just three months in November 2018 in protest at May’s doomed divorce deal with Brussels that he said offered too many concessions.But when Johnson became Conservative party leader and prime minister after May’s resignation in July last year, Raab was catapulted back into government.His role as foreign secretary also carries the title first secretary of state, implying seniority over all other ministers except the prime minister and making him his de facto deputy.Often combative, he holds a black belt in karate and is a keen boxer.His Czech-born Jewish father came to Britain in 1938 as a six-year-old refugee. He died of cancer when Raab was 12 and his mother brought him up in the Church of England.He competed in karate for 17 years, making the UK squad.After studies, he became an international lawyer at London legal firm Linklaters before joining the Foreign Office in 2000 as an advisor.Raab was posted to The Hague in 2003 to head a team focused on bringing justice to war criminals including Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Charles Taylor.From 2006 to 2008, he was chief of staff to the Conservatives’ home affairs spokesman David Davis while in opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dominic-raab-a-combative-lawyer-who-is-now-boris-johnson-s-stand-in-as-uk-premier/story-YejeuCSYOwLaIuMCPrqPsJ.html

The WHO has named this year the ‘International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife’. World Health Day this year comes at a very difficult time for all of us.We are more grateful than ever to all of our health workers fighting the #COVID19 pandemic.You make us proud and you inspire us.We stand with you and we count on you. pic.twitter.com/laENQX4HfKThe global health organisation, along with its partners, will make a series of recommendations to strengthen the nursing and midwifery workforce worldwide.According to the WHO, a strengthened workforce of nurses and midwives is significant to ensure that everyone gets the healthcare they need and for countries to achieve their “national and global targets related to universal health coverage, maternal and child health, infectious and non-communicable diseases including mental health, emergency preparedness and response, patient safety and the delivery of integrated, people-centered care, amongst others”.World Health Day comes this year at a time when the entire globe is struggling to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. Over 1 million people have been infected by the deadly contagion while more than 60,000 have lost their lives to Covid-19 infection. United Nations secretary-general António Guterres on Tuesday tweeted out on the occasion of World Health Day and said that it comes at a “very difficult time”.“World Health Day this year comes at a very difficult time for all of us. We are more grateful than ever to all of our health workers fighting the #COVID19 pandemic. You make us proud and you inspire us. We stand with you and we count on you,” Guterres said in a video message posted on his social handles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-health-day-2020-support-nurses-and-midwives-as-they-fight-covid-19/story-czodc5RUFUKkG5DiLYMhPO.html

07-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Rush for masks, toilet paper slows Japan’s household spending decline||Japan’s consumer spending fell in February but at a slower-than-expected pace as households scrambled for protective masks, toilet paper and staple food amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic.But spending on travel and entertainment slumped, government data showed on Tuesday, a sign households were cutting back on non-essential purchases even before travel bans and social distancing policies took effect in March.Analysts expect the hit to consumption from the pandemic to deepen significantly in coming months, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declares a state of emergency on Tuesday that is likely to paralyse activity in major cities, including Tokyo, for a month.“This pandemic is an unprecedented type of economic crisis that deals an immediate blow to consumption and jobs,” said Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.“We’ll likely see a freefall in consumption in March and beyond of a scale never experienced before. In a crisis like this, Japan has little choice but to embark on helicopter money like other major economies,” he said.Household spending slid 0.3% in February from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of declines but a smaller drop than a median market forecast for a 3.9% decline and the 3.9% fall marked in January.Spending on toilet paper jumped 47% in February from a year earlier, while that on domestic package tours slumped 37%.Supply chain disruptions, travel bans and social distancing policies triggered by the pandemic have hit Japan’s economy, which is already on the brink of recession, piling pressure on policymakers to take stronger steps to ease the pain.Abe said on Tuesday the government’s stimulus package to combat the pandemic would be among the world’s biggest and would include direct fiscal spending of $358 billion.It was the first time the premier unveiled the size of direct spending of his package, which he said would total 108 trillion yen - equal to 20% of economic output.The 39-trillion-yen ($358 billion) in spending would be more than double what Japan spent to deal with the hit to growth from the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.While the stimulus could ease the immediate damage from the pandemic, lawmakers are already calling for even bigger spending to prevent bankruptcies and job losses.With the government set to boost bond issuance to pay for the package, the Bank of Japan could ramp up bond buying to keep borrowing costs low, said Yajima of NLI Research Institute.Analysts expect Japan’s economy, which shrank in the final quarter of last year, to post two more quarters of contraction as the pain from the pandemic deepens.Separate data showed inflated-adjusted real wages rose for a second straight month in February, providing some relief for an economy under threat of a deep downturn over the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-rush-for-masks-toilet-paper-slows-japan-s-household-spending-decline/story-QbHXxUKoUBzQjTV8U8hmUK.html

The 55-year-old UK leader was shifted to the intensive care ward in London’s St Thomas’ Hospital on Monday.He is in ICU as a precaution should he require ventilation to aid his recovery, officials have said.“I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend of our nation Prime Minister Boris Johnson. We’re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care ... a little while ago,” Trump said during his daily coronavirus task force briefing from the White House.“He’s been a really good friend.

Resolute,” he said.Also read: What you need to know todayTrump also said his administration has contacted the British government to extend their help.“We’ve contacted all of Boris’ doctors, and we’ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go… When you are brought into intensive care that gets very, very serious,” he said.“We are working with London with respect to Boris Johnson,” the US president added.Trump said that he had asked two US pharmaceutical companies (not named) to contact Johnson’s doctors to check if both he and the companies could help with the therapies in practice to treat coronavirus patients.“We have made tremendous progress on therapeutics… I’ve asked two of the leading companies... I have asked them to contact London immediately,” he said.Trump also said the two companies have contacted their London offices and ensured that they have everything that Johnson’s doctors may need during his recovery.Boris Johnson was tested positive on March 27 and his symptoms included high temperature and a cough.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-donald-trump-sends-wishes-to-very-good-friend-boris-johnson-as-his-covid-19-symptoms-worsen/story-G9bwem1MQQBtxr6xM48ciO.html

This was the first time he had publicly brought up trade after the visit.President Trump made the request for releasing the hold on hydroxychloroquine in a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday morning (evening in India).Watch | Donald Trump hints at ‘retaliation’ if India withholds hydroxychloroquine exports “I said we’d appreciate you allowing our supply to come out, If he doesn’t allow it to come out. That would be okay but, of course, there may be retaliation,” the president said at the daily White House briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, adding, rhetorically for stress, “Why wouldn’t that be?”India has not yet decided either way yet. Prime Minister Modi had told the American leader during the call that India “will do all what we can”.The US orders were placed in March. The size of the order could not be ascertained and it was also not clear if they were placed by the US government through the agency spearheading the federal effort boost domestic availability of medical supplies and equipment needed to deal with the outbreak, or private companies.India is one of the largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine in the world and banned its export, along with a bunch of other deeming them essential for its own domestic to fight the pandemic. The restriction on hydroxychloroquine was upgraded to a blanket ban, without exemptions on humanitarian and other grounds, on Saturday, the day before Trump called Modi.At the Monday news briefing, President Trump either misheard the reporter’s question, or misunderstood it. He had been asked if was worried about retaliation from other countries against his decision to ban the export of certain medical equipment, which he has in recent days to address shortages at home in the United States, like the one imposed by Prime Minister Modi on hydroxychloroquine.“I don’t like that decision,” the president said. “I didn’t hear that that was his decision. I know that he stopped it for other countries I spoke to him yesterday. We had a very good talk, and we’ll see whether or not that’s his decision. I would be surprised if he would you know because India does very well with the United States.”While correctly acknowledging India had not turned down his request, not yet at least, the president went ahead with his threat of “retaliation”, which he dressed up with his long-running grievance on trade. “For many years they’ve been taking advantage of the United States on trade. So I would be surprised if that was the decision. He’d have to tell me that.”After the failed attempt to seal a trade deal during the February visit the two sides decided to continue talking and aim for a deal some time r later in the year, perhaps after the November 3 general elections in the United States. A joint statement issued by the two sides during the visit said, the two leaders “agreed to promptly conclude the ongoing negotiations, which they hope can become phase one of a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement that reflects the true ambition and full potential of the bilateral commercial relations, advancing prosperity, investment, and job creation in both countries”.The joint statement and a news briefing to wrap up the visit were the last times the American president spoke publicly about trade issues with India, until the Monday briefing.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThere is no proven evidence yet that hydroxychloroquine works against the coronavirus. There have been some studies and trials, but scientists and experts have said they were either too small or without the necessary protocols to establish its effectiveness. Physicians have been using it nevertheless, even in the United States.President Trump has spoken of hydroxychloroquine as a potential “game-changer” many times, with experts of his coronavirus task force adding the usual cautionary note every time that the drug has no proven benefits for Covid-19 patients. The US drug regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, granted “compassionate use” authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), to be prescribed to severely ill patients in mid-March. Last week, the regulator gave it emergency-use authorization. And it is being tried on COVID-10 patients in New York City, the epicentre of the American outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-threatens-retaliation-if-india-turned-down-his-request-on-malarial-drug-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-vaccine-covid-19/story-c1aIImaEGKw893uO01bVQJ.html

National Health Service guidelines advise those who are self-isolating not go to hospital unless they develop new symptoms or become sufficiently unwell.Johnson, who is not a smoker, said recently that he wanted to lose weight. He plays tennis and while mayor of London used to cycle around the capital.The face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, he won a resounding election victory in December before leading the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan. 31.He has faced criticism for initially approving a much more modest response to the new coronavirus outbreak than other European leaders, saying on March 3 that he had been shaking hands with coronavirus patients.He changed tack when scientific projections showed a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. On Monday, health officials said Britain’s death toll stood at 5,373.Johnson effectively shuttered the world’s fifth-largest economy, advising people to stay at home and the elderly or infirm to isolate themselves for weeks.The virus had already penetrated the British government.Johnson and his health minister tested positive last month and chief medical adviser Chris Whitty also self-isolated. Johnson’s pregnant 32-year-old fiancée, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-taken-to-icu-after-covid-19-worsens/story-opFKOV1WCYhD55pvFCNI7J.html

The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication”.The decision was made by Johnson’s medical team after his condition worsened over the course of Monday afternoon. Before he was moved to ICU, he asked Raab to deputise for him where necessary, officials added.Raab said in a statement that he will deputise for Johnson “where necessary in driving forward the government’s plans to defeat coronavirus”, adding that the prime minister is receiving “excellent care” in the St Thomas’ Hospital.Raab said his focus in the new role will be to make sure the “prime minister’s direction and all the plans for making sure we can defeat coronavirus and pull the country through this challenge will be taken forward”.“There is an incredibly strong team spirit behind the prime minister and making sure that we get all of the plans that the prime minister has instructed us to deliver... implemented as soon as possible.”As the United Kingdom moved into the third week of the lockdown, the Department of Health said the death toll had increased to 5,373 and the number of the number of patients testing positive for the virus rose to 51,068.The news prompted a wave of get-well messages from cabinet colleagues and others across the political spectrum.

07-04-2020||World||Covid-19: As US braces for ‘hardest and saddest’ week, Trump sees ‘light at the end of tunnel||Americans braced themselves for the “hardest and saddest” week as coronavirus fatalities are expected to peak in some parts of the country while President Donald Trump maintained he had seen “light at the end of the tunnel”, holding out hope of a turnaround “in not too distant future”.US fatalities from the coronavirus neared 10,000 with 9,653 by Sunday morning with more than 4,150 in New York state and 3,048 in New York City alone, the epicenter of the US outbreak. The state registered a drop in one-day deaths Sunday though and that gave rise to guarded optimism of a “plateauing in the data”.The number of confirmed cases in the United States stood at more than 330,000, accounting for a fourth of the global pandemic count of 1.2 million. New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana continued to be the hardest hit states and New York City, Detroit, New Orleans, Miami among the most impacted cities, with the national capital Washington DC being cited as a growing concern.“This is going to be the hardest and saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly,” US surgeon general Jerome M Adams told Fox News on Sunday and went on to draw parallels with key pivotal moments in US history and lives. “This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized. It’s going to be happening all over the country.”Fatalities are expected to peak this week in some parts of the country, public health officials have said, from infections contracted around two weeks ago, before the country began shutting down with enhanced social-distancing measures and stay-at-home orders now in force in all but eight states.US officials had earlier warned the past week and this would be the hardest hit and President Trump sought to prepare Americans for this as the “toughest week” with a grim warning of a “lot of death”. Experts of the White House coronavirus task force have said 100,000 to 240,000 American could die in the epidemic even with the social-distancing measures in place.The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, an independent body often cited by the White House coronavirus task force, has said the projected peak day is still 10 days away, April 16, when 3,130 deaths have been projected nationwide. And New York state is projected to peak on Wednesday (April 8) with projected fatalities to 878 on that day.But the president sought to strike a note of optimism, as he has throughout this unprecedented health crisis, telling reporters at the daily briefing of the task force on Sunday, “We see light at the end of the tunnel. Things are happening. We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. And hopefully in the not too distant future we’ll be very proud of the job we all did.” He doubled down it with the morning after, with a twitter post in all-caps: “LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL”.Asked if the president’s optimism was contradictory to the spike in death being predicted by experts, Anthony Fauci, the epidemiologist who has emerged as the most trusted member of the president’s task force, said, “I don’t think they’re so different. I think we all know that we have to reach a certain point. And that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death. But it’s also a point at which things are going to start changing.”He said there was a lag time of two weeks in cases and fatalities and the impact of mitigation effort in place now will be seen in two weeks. But, he cautioned, “What you’re hearing about potential light at the end of the tunnel doesn’t take away form the fact that tomorrow or the next day is going to look really bad.”Deborah Birx, the task force coordinator, concurred, but said that “although we’ll see rising number of cases of people who lose their lives to this illness, we’re also hopeful to see a stabilization of cases across these large metro areas where the outbreak began several weeks ago”. The United States has begin to show the effects of social-distancing as was happening in Italy, which had begun to turn after weeks of spiraling cases and death, she added.US Navy commander Brett Crozier whose plea for help for his coronavirus-affected crew led to his dismissal has himself tested positive, in the meanwhile.And a tiger at a New York city zoo has tested positive for coronavirus in a first, the US department of agriculture said in a statement. The animal caught the infection from an employee and this is being called the first human-to-cat transmission of the deadly pathogen. The department went on to caution with people with coronavirus to avoid contact with pets and other animals..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-as-us-braces-for-hardest-and-saddest-week-trump-sees-light-at-the-end-of-tunnel/story-CUkuaKeVycpvZxOw4yRufK.html
07-04-2020||World||Canada asks medical workers treating Covid-19 patients to reuse face masks||Even as medical-grade equipment like face masks are in great demand across the world to protect frontline medical professionals who are dealing with Covid-19 patients, Canada’s seniormost health official has said the country has started exploring the possibility of decontaminating such material for their reuse.Personal protective equipment or PPE like face masks keep medical workers safe as they treat and care for patients suffering from Covid-19 disease. However, with demand high, the supply of such masks has become a matter of contention.Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam has asked hospitals and medical facilities throughout the country not to dispose of used masks since public health officials are looking into whether they can be disinfected for reused.“I think it is one of the most important and I think worthwhile lines of pursuit for PPE right now,” she said, as several entities in the country were working on a process for decontamination that would make the material reusable and safe for healthcare workers.Given this ongoing research, she also asked authorities across Canada to retain such PPE. She said she was “signalling to provinces and territories that certain things shouldn’t be thrown away right now, so that we can actually implement this should we find the actual people who can do this.”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has already announced that several million masks will be reaching the country early this week from China, even as an amicable resolution to the matter of the United States barring export of such N-95 masks to Canada appears likely. “I am confident we are going to be able to solve this,” Trudeau said.The coronavirus outbreak looks set to tip Canada’s economy into recession and the Liberal government of Prime Minister Trudeau has already announced stimulus measures totaling C$105 billion ($74 billion) in direct spending, or five per cent of gross domestic product.Almost half the cases in Canada are in the province of Quebec, where premier Francois Legault said on Sunday he hoped to see new diagnoses peak in a number of weeks. He also told reporters he was extending a shutdown of non-essential businesses for another three weeks to May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-asks-medical-workers-treating-covid-19-patients-to-reuse-face-masks/story-cY9D587dixdewIBvjzdWvJ.html
07-04-2020||World||Canada govt mulls holding virtual parliament session during Covid-19 crisis||The Canadian government is exploring the possibility of holding virtual sessions of Parliament to pass legislation, as part of emergency measures to counter the impact of Covid-19 crisis.The idea has been mooted by Pablo Rodriguez, a leader of the ruling Liberal Party in the House of Commons, in a letter to the Speaker Anthony Rota, as well as leaders of three major Opposition parties.The proposal comes as the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attempts historic bailout measures for employers and workers across the country. As the coronavirus crisis became pronounced in March, the House of Commons was suspended, but sittings with the minimum number of members required were held on March 23 and 24. While the House remains suspended till April 20, Trudeau has called for another emergency session in the week ahead to pass more measures.Rodriguez’s effort comes in that context, as he wrote to the Speaker seeking to gauge “ability of the House of Commons administration to support and facilitate virtual sittings”. He pointed out that Canadians are working from home and only leaving for essential chores. He stated, “It is only appropriate that Members of Parliament practice these same measures, and adapt the way that we conduct our business during the time the House cannot meet on a regular and normal basis.”While the response from Opposition leaders to this proposal has been positive, it will require changes to the Standing Orders governing the running of the House of Commons, for business to be conducted remotely.The number of people killed by the Sars-CoV-2 virus in Canada has jumped by just over 20 per cent to 258 in a day, officials said on Sunday.On Sunday morning, the number of those diagnosed with Covid-19 had risen by almost 12 per cent to 14,426, the public health agency said. The respective figures on Saturday were 214 deaths and 12,924 positive diagnoses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-govt-mulls-holding-virtual-parliament-session-during-covid-19-crisis/story-6BEO44muwt04X8we0yvgxK.html
07-04-2020||India||1.03 mn people in over 26k shelters: Centre tells SC||New Delhi As many as 26,476 relief and shelter camps across the country are housing 1.03 million migrant workers and other needy people during the Covid-19 lockdown, according to a status report submitted by the central government before the Supreme Court on Tuesday.Of the 26,476 camps, 22,567 are being run by governments of various states and Union territories and 3,909 by non-government organisations (NGOs). Government-run camps house around 630,000 and NGO camps some 400,000 . Additionally, food camps operated by various governments are feeding 8.4 million people.The status report was filed on a plea filed by activists Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj seeking payment of minimum wages to all migrant workers, who are either employed by companies or contractors or self-employed. The three-week lockdown enforced on March 25 forced an exodus of such workers, mainly daily wagers, from the cities to the hinterland on concern that their livelihoods were at work.When it comes to government- run relief camps, Kerala tops the chart with 15,541 such camps that are currently functional. The south Indian state, which reported the first coronavirus cases in the country, houses 302,016 people in these camps, the report said.Maharashtra, which is the state with the highest number of Covid patients, is next in the list with 4,532 relief camps. Only 1,135 of these camps are government-operated and the remaining 3,397 are run by NGOs.These 4,532 camps in Maharashtra house more than 447,000 people. NGOs run camps sheltering more than 373,000 people and the government has camps housing 73, 492.Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in the country, has 2,230 government-run camps housing 100,000 people. Delhi has 102 government relief camps which shelter 4,788 people.Mander and Bhardwaj had pointed out in their petition that migrant workers are unable to earn their wages because of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced by the government to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The centre, in its status report, told the court that the petition was bereft of any facts and was based on newspaper reports. The petitioner, the centre stated, is in “complete and blissful ignorance” of the huge exercise being undertaken by the central government as well as by the state governments in cooperation with each other to deal with coronavirus pandemic.“A reading of the petition clearly reflects that the petitioner wanted to file the petition and therefore, he has filed the petition without undertaking ay exercise to gather true and correct facts from the statutory authorities or from anyone else. Such attempts under the garb of public interest litigation jurisdiction deserve to be deprecated by this Hon’ble Court”, the centre’s response said.The bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, after going through the centre’s report, expressed its inclination to refrain from interfering with the matter which it considered was within the domain of the executive.CJI Bobde asked advocate Prashant Bhushan who was appearing for the petitioners, as to why wages have to be paid when the workers were being housed and fed.Bhushan pointed out that all migrant workers were not in relief camps. He also pointed out that their families were dependent on the money sent home by the workers.The court asked Bhushan to go through the government’s report before making his arguments and posted the case for hearing on April 13.The status report by the central government also gave details about the food camps that are currently functional in various states.The national capital has 1,379 government food camps and 256 NGO-run food camps. The government food camps feed more than 1.2 million people. Additionally, NGO-run food camps feed more than 100,000 people in the city, the report said.Uttar Pradesh has 2,558 food camps (893 government-run and 1,665 NGO-run) providing food to more than 1 million people.Jharkhand has 1,432 food camps (government and NGO) and Haryana has 1,433 NGO-run food camps. Karnataka has 691 government food camps; the figure is 712 for Rajasthan.“The central government and all state governments are doing their best, strategizing all human resources and other resources to come out of this unprecedented global crisis”, the status report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-03-mn-people-in-over-26k-shelters-centre-tells-sc/story-i6LQKdus8c0bInUAvnnkZM.html
07-04-2020||India||Political row after migrant worker dies in Karnataka||Bengaluru A political controversy has broken out in Karnataka over the death of a woman migrant worker who walked 240km under the scorching sun to get back home.Gangamma, a resident of Sindhanur taluk in north Karnataka’s Raichur district, worked as a labourer in Bengaluru but lost her job when the nationwide lockdown was clamped on March 25, said a district administration official. Along with many other migrant labourers, she boarded a tractor heading to Raichur district on March 30 but the vehicle was stopped at the Tumakuru toll gate, roughly 240km from her native district, the official added.Gangamma, along with the other workers, decided to walk to their villages from the toll gate but were again stopped by police near Bellary town, where the local police took them to a rehabilitation centre on April 2. By then, Gangamma had walked for hours under the searing sun with little food and water, and she fell ill. She passed away at the Vijaynagar Institute of Medical Sciences on April 5, the official added.The state government condoled her death and announced compensation for her family. “ In lockdown circumstances woman Gangamma who was walked to her native place has passed away. This is very unfortunate and painful. We are investigating the matter and I have directed officials to provide compensation to her family,” chief minister BS Yediyurappa tweeted.But the Opposition blamed the state administration for the death. Senior Congress leader and former Bellary MP VS Ugrappa condemned the government’s role in providing food and essentials for the poor. “It is unfortunate that this woman had to die due to hunger. There is huge gap between what the government has announced on paper and implementation on the ground. Banging vessels and lighting lamps will not fill hungry stomachs. The state government has failed in its responsibility.”Bellary district information officer Ramalingappa denied that the woman died due to hunger. “She had walked all the way from Tumkur and was ill. We provided all facilities to her including food and when she became sick, was admitted to the hospital. It is unfortunate that she passed away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-row-after-migrant-worker-dies-in-karnataka/story-CuhCwoNhQuyjNKhJGbw0HM.html
07-04-2020||India||7 states are yet to implement Centre’s ration quota plan||New Delhi: The Union government is carrying out the largest movement and distribution ever of foodgrains to states in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown through the Food Corporation of India (FCI), official data shows.Railways are carrying record freight from a network of state-held granaries — 150,000 tonne worth of shipments daily in contrast to a normal average of 80,000 tonne daily in the pre-lockdown period, data from consumer affairs ministry showed. The Centre is ferrying additional foodgrains after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package, which doubled food ration quota under (from 5kg per person under the National Food Security Act to 10kg) for the next three months. The additional 5kg is being distributed free.However, seven states -- Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Manipur -- haven’t yet implemented the doubling of ration quota, prompting federal authorities to send repeated advisories to them, an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. “The movement of foodgrains is unprecedented. Given the quantities and rakes recorded by us, we think this is the largest exercise to be carried out ever,” an official of the consumer affairs ministry said, asking not to be named. In addition to meeting the regular requirements of foodgrains as mandated by the Food Security Act, the Food Corporation of India FCI is sending out wheat and rice directly to states without holding the otherwise mandatory e-auctions. Such quantities are being sold to states at open market sale rates to ensure continuous supply of food grains, the official added. “Wheat shipments are also being sent to meet the requirements of manufacturers of wheat flour and other wheat products based on the assessment of requirements done by district magistrates,” the official said. FCI has allotted 138000 tonne of wheat for such commercial processing in 13 states and 132,000 tonne of rice to eight states under this model.The Centre wants to distribute most of its old stocks because its granaries are overflowing and this will help it make space for the new harvestsSeveral states have delayed implementing the doubling of ration quota. “We want to exhaust our existing stock of food grains before we lift the free grains quota given by Centre. As of now we don’t have any problem of ration,” said Jokey Angu, Arunachal Pradesh’s secretary of food and civil supplies.Jharkhand submitted its plan to the Centre on Tuesday.The state’s food, public distribution and consumer affairs department director Sanjay Kumar said: “We have told the Centre that since for April and May regular foodgrain quota is being distributed to beneficiaries, we will distribute the additional free foodgrains of two months, total 10 kg, next month in May. The remaining 5kg will be distributed in June.”A senior food department official from Karnataka, HR Vijay Kumar, said Karnataka has distributed the total foodgrains due for April and May in April itself from its own quota. The Centre has offered foodgrains for the months of May, June and July, he said. In May, the state will be distributing foodgrains due for May and June from the Centre’s quota. A spokesperson for the Chhattisgarh government said it was opting for moving surplus rice from the state’s stocks to the Centre’s stock and claim the subsidy since it is a rice surplus state. Andhra Pradesh’s supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar said Food Corporation of India authorities have refused to release additional rice immediately, asking the state to exhaust its existing stocks first .

07-04-2020||India||Two more cases in Dharavi, ministers visit slum cluster||Mumbai: Two more people tested positive for Covid-19 in Dharavi on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases of the coronavirus disease in Asia’s largest slum to seven. The two were the 80-year-old father and 49-year-old brother of a 30-year-old woman who tested positive on Saturday, said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of Mumbai’s G/North Ward where Dharavi is located. “In tracing of high-risk contacts it was found that they are the father and brother of the 30-year-old woman.”All three patients are residents of Dharavi’s Dr Baliga Nagar area. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already sealed Dr Baliga Nagar, where Dharavi’s first Covid-19 patient, a 56-year-old garment shop owner, was detected last month. He succumbed to the virus. The colony he lived in has eight buildings with 308 flats and 91 shops, which have all been sealed. All 29 high-risk contacts of the two Covid-19 patients detected on Tuesday are being tested and essential supplies like food and medicines will be provided to them by the BMC, which has quarantined 3,250 residents of the densely populated slum in the Rajiv Gandhi Sports complex in Dharavi. On Tuesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope, and and local MLA and school education minister Varsha Gaikwad visited the quarantine facility in the sports complex and the Dharavi police station to assess the situation. Tope and Gaikwad discussed the outbreak of the deadly virus in Dharavi with the police and civic staff Shiv Sena Lok Sabha MP Rahul Shewale wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, urging him to impose a strict lockdown in the entire Dharavi area. “Lockdown is necessary because of the high population density in the area. In addition to that, civic body should take all the hospitals in Dharavi and convert them into a quarantine centre,” he said. Shewale also suggested that BMC enhance its Covid-19 testing capacity and every person in the slum be tested for the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-more-cases-in-dharavi-ministers-visit-slum-cluster/story-imDtWQ2V5lklZTnYlrqWzK.html

While all MPs have supported their salary cut as the country looks for ways to raise resources to fund efforts to contain the coronavirus disease, many have raised questions about taking away the MPLADS fund for two years.The Joint Committee of Parliament, which looks into salaries and allowances of MPs, has recommended a 30% cut in the constituency allowance and a Rs 6,000 reduction in the office allowance. An MP is entitled to ₹ 70,000 per month to meet constituency-related expenses and another ₹60,000 as the office allowance. An MP is also entitled to ₹2000 as daily allowance for attending Parliament sessions or committee meetings apart from official accommodation, water and electricity supply and a special allowance to buy laptops or computers.The Committee has decided to deduct ₹21,000 from each member’s constituency allowance and ₹6,000 from their office allowance. These deductions will be applicable from April 1, along with their salary deductions.While the MPs will now get ₹14,000 towards stationery as against ₹20,000 earlier, there will be no cut, however, in the remaining ₹40,000 of the office allowance, which is meant for engaging personal assistants.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi tweeted in support of the decision. “I welcome Gazette notifications issued from LS & RS Secretariats regarding 30% reduction in Constituency Allowance & Stationary allowance for MPs & 30% reduction in constituency Allowance for Ministers. Initiative is a good beginning for augmenting resources for fighting COVID-19,” he tweeted. Congress MP Manish Tewari tweeted, “History and not too far in future is very unkind to leaders who play on the fears of people. Parliament has passed a 32 lakh crore budget. We are in week one of the New Financial year. This is nothing but a power grab. Sad that @ombirlakota & @MVenkaiahNaidu signed of on it.”On Tuesday, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla accepted the recommendations of the Joint Committee for the cuts in allowances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-salary-cuts-and-mplads-fund-freeze-mps-to-lose-30-of-two-allowances/story-uPuU9LbydGxy897j7J43HN.html
07-04-2020||India||AIIMS asks staff to reuse masks four times||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi has asked its staff to reuse their N-95 respiratory masks at least four times in order to make their quota of the gear last longer, bringing into focus fears of shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) that is crucial for front line health care workers tending to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients.The direction, issued through a circular released on Tuesday, was followed by a set of guidelines that appeared to acknowledge that the reusing was not ideal, while at the same time telling staff how the devices must be disinfected after each use. “It is imperative that in accordance with evidence-based scientific literature, these N-95 masks are to be disinfected by individual users (by keeping them in open after use or by other methods) and re-used at least four times each, whereby these will suffice for about 20 days,” the circular said. Doctors and nurses at the country’s premier medical institute are allotted a particular quota of PPEs, which in the case of N-95 masks is five. With an average shift lasting 8-12 hours, the guidelines suggest they reuse each mask four times to last a total of 20 days.“We will shortly share the protocol for disinfecting the masks with everyone; N-95 masks do not need to be thrown away after one use,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital, before the conflicting guidelines were issued.Doctors at the institute slammed the directive. “We have been writing to the administration about the shortage of PPE and N-95 masks since March. Not only have we not received any concrete answers on how they are dealing with the shortage, they have now issued guidelines for using the masks four times. How is a doctor supposed to carry the infected mask home? How are they individually supposed to disinfect it? This should happen at the hospital level to curtail the spread of the infection and even then only when there is no other option available,” said Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T, general secretary of Resident Doctors’ Association at AIIMS.The guidelines that were later released by AIIMS said: “Currently, decontamination of PPE for purposes of reuse is not recommended, primarily because of concerns that decontamination would degrade the performance especially of the respirator (N-95 masks)”.But, the document went on to say, “as an extraordinary last resort method in the event of imminent shortage of PPE”, the devices must be disinfected in bulk: the PPE is to be collected in ‘red bags’ used for biomedical waste, hung on a clothesline in a sealed room, and decontaminated using diluted hydrogen peroxide vapour. “The circular does not clarify whether the same will be applicable for people working in the Covid-19 wards and those screening the patients for respiratory symptoms – as they are at a higher risk of carrying the disease home with the masks. If we are at this stage even before community transmission has begun, what will happen when there is a deluge of patients? This will take active doctors out of duty,” said Dr Srinivas.Similar directions have been issued by the United States’ Centre for Disease Control, but that has come after many American hospitals reached near-capacity. The United States leads the world in number of Covid-19 infections with close to 400,000 cases. In comparison, India has a little over a tenth of that number.The World Health Organization rules do not address the issue of how many times an N-95 mask must be worn, but advises against wearing one respirator for more than four hours since it could lead to discomfort. A group of researchers from Stanford University’s School of Medicine reviewed various decontamination measures and said hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet radiation could disinfect the masks but they could not determine whether filtration and material strength would remain intact after repeated use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-asks-staff-to-reuse-masks-four-times/story-MlUFDckpCFWBCOQQtOzqVM.html
07-04-2020||India||‘Your cats are safe’: Maneka Gandhi assures after tiger tests Covid-19 positive||BJP MP Maneka Gandhi on Tuesday posted a video message saying a cat could not get or give coronavirus and there was no need for people to abandon them after it emerged that a tiger in a zoo in the United States was infected with Covid-19.Gandhi, a prominent animal rights activist said, “A cat is not a tiger, there is no relationship, there is as much relationship a dog has with a wolf.”Maneka’s video appeal follows the revelation that a tiger in the Bronx zoo in the US had tested positive for coronavirus sparking fears around the globe that the disease could spread to the animal kingdom. Indian authorities have sounded alerts for all tiger habitats in India and have advised continuous monitoring of the animals for any abnormal behaviour and isolation for sick animals among other measures to prevent possible human to animal transmissions.Gandhi seemed to be responding to speculations on social media that domestic animals like cat, if they pick up the Covid-19 infection, could also further spread the contagion among unsuspecting humans.“Your cats are completely safe to be around, so allow people to feed them, allow them in every colony, they are a great asset,” Maneka Gandhi appealed in the video.Gandhi’s post seemed to have started a debate with some questioning the basis of her claim and cited a study that has not been peer-reviewed to suggest that anti Sars-Cov-2 antibodies were detected in cats.Gandhi responded to the challenge by saying that a “scientific approach” was needed at the hour and not “hysteria”. She put out a series of tweets to support her point, one of them referring to a WHO advisory on the matter.“It’s been months since the spread of #COVID19 started. Lakhs of humans have it, thousands have died. Not 1 out of 50 million cats across the world (except some mythical cat in Belgium) have been infected. WHO has put out an advisory saying that cats can neither get nor give it,” one of her tweets said.Several Indian states have alerted officials to take measures to safeguard the animals in zoos, national parks, sanctuaries etc.A veterinary officer with the Jammu and Kashmir wildlife department Ranjit Katoch said the department is following the protocol issued by the Central Zoo Authority and monitoring animals round-the-clock.She said mammals like carnivores, especially cat, feral and primates were among the animals that were carefully being monitored.Authorities in the Sunderbans, home to the rare Bengal Tigers, were also monitoring the behaviour of all 88 tigers round the clock, said officials quoted by PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/your-cats-are-safe-maneka-gandhi-assures-after-tiger-tests-covid-19-positive/story-GV3W5QzdPUhvYA0O9IghMJ.html

07-04-2020||India||Covid-19 crisis can push 40 cr informal sector workers in India deeper into poverty: ILO Report||The COVID-19 crisis has the potential to push around 40 crore informal sector workers in India deeper into poverty, with the lockdown and other containment measures affecting jobs and earnings, an International Labour Organisation (ILO) report said on Tuesday. India has imposed a three-week lockdown till April 14 to contain the pandemic. As per ILO, India is among the countries less equipped to handle the situation. “COVID-19 is already affecting tens of millions of informal workers. In India, Nigeria and Brazil, the number of workers in the informal economy affected by the lockdown and other containment measures is substantial,” the ILO report released in Geneva said. “In India, with a share of almost 90 per cent of people working in the informal economy, about 400 million workers in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty during the crisis. “Current lockdown measures in India, which are at the high end of the University of Oxford’s COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index, have impacted these workers significantly, forcing many of them to return to rural areas,” it said. The report further said countries experiencing fragility, protracted conflict, recurrent natural disasters or forced displacement will face a multiple burden due to the pandemic. “They are less equipped to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 as access to basic services, especially health and sanitation, is limited; decent work, social protection and safety at work are not a given; their institutions are weak; and social dialogue is impaired or absent,” it added. The ILO also noted that the pandemic is having a catastrophic effect on working hours and earnings globally. The new ILO report highlights some of the worst affected sectors and regions, and outlines policies to mitigate the crisis. It found that the crisis is expected to wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020 -- equivalent to 195 million full-time workers. Large reductions are foreseen in the Arab states, (8.1 per cent, equivalent to 5 million full-time workers), Europe, (7.8 per cent, or 12 million full-time workers) and Asia and the Pacific (7.2 per cent, 125 million full-time workers). Huge losses are expected across different income groups but especially in upper-middle income countries (7 per cent, 100 million full-time workers). This far exceeds the effects of the 2008-9 financial crisis. The sectors most at risk include accommodation and food services, manufacturing, retail, and business and administrative activities. The eventual increase in global unemployment during 2020 will depend substantially on future developments and policy measures. There is a high risk that the end-of-year figure will be significantly higher than the initial ILO projection of 25 million, it said. More than four out of five people (81 per cent) in the global workforce of 3.3 billion are currently affected by full or partial workplace closures. “Workers and businesses are facing catastrophe, in both developed and developing economies,” ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said. “We have to move fast, decisively, and together. The right, urgent, measures, could make the difference between survival and collapse.” The ‘ILO Monitor 2nd edition: COVID-19 and the world of work’, which describes COVID-19 as “the worst global crisis since World War II”, updates an ILO research note published on March 18. The updated version includes sectoral and regional information on the effects of the pandemic. According to the new study, 1.25 billion workers are employed in the sectors identified as being at high risk of “drastic and devastating” increases in layoffs and reductions in wages and working hours. Many are in low-paid, low-skilled jobs, where a sudden loss of income is devastating. Looked at regionally, the proportion of workers in these “at risk” sectors varies from 41 per cent in the Americas to 26 per cent in Asia and the Pacific. Other regions, particularly Africa, have higher levels of informality, which combined with a lack of social protection, high population density and weak capacity, pose severe health and economic challenges for governments, the report cautions. Worldwide, two billion people work in the informal sector (mostly in emerging and developing economies) and are particularly at risk. Large-scale, integrated, policy measures are needed, focusing on four pillars -- supporting enterprises, employment and incomes; stimulating the economy and jobs; protecting workers in the workplace; and, using social dialogue between government, workers and employers to find solutions, the study says. “This is the greatest test for international cooperation in more than 75 years,” said Ryder. “If one country fails, then we all fail. We must find solutions that help all segments of our global society, particularly those that are most vulnerable or least able to help themselves. “The choices we make today will directly affect the way this crisis unfolds and so the lives of billions of people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-crisis-can-push-40-cr-informal-sector-workers-in-india-deeper-into-poverty-ilo-report/story-WYNAWNATcnvX3DYM1I7khN.html

Total number of positive cases in Delhi stands at 550. Out of them 331 cases are related to the Nizamuddin Markaz, 170 cases have foreign travel/contact history and 49 cases are under investigation. Twenty people have been discharged while there have been nine deaths,” the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.Follow coronavirus live updates here. Earlier in the day, the Delhi government said that phone numbers of 1950 people related to Tablighi Jamat have been given to Delhi Police for tracing. All these people were removed from the Nizamuddin headquarter of the Markaz.The Delhi Police has also asked visitors to the Markaz after March 1 to inform police stations in their areas.“After March 1, whoever visited Markaz Nizamuddin should inform their concerned Police stations. If they don’t do so it will be considered as concealment of facts and legal action will be taken against the violators,” said M S Randhawa, Delhi Police spokesperson , according to ANI.He also appealed to hospitals to inform the police if they admit any Covid-19 patient. “I would like to appeal to all hospitals to inform us, health department of Covid-19 authorised hospitals if they admit any Covid-19 positive patient. If this is not followed it will be considered as concealment of facts and legal action will be taken,” Randhawa said.While states have expressed concern over the high number of cases among the Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts, several opposition leaders have expressed fears that these cases were being highlighted to demonise Muslims. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury in a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind has asked him to that the Tablighi Jamaat event congregation “cannot be the excuse to target the Muslim community as a whole”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-25-new-cases-delhi-now-has-550-covid-19-cases/story-yMGt1sVXDc2CjHrA8qefzJ.html

Road transport accounts for about 60% of freight traffic in India and 87% of its passenger traffic, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.Trucking has emerged as a major chokepoint in global supply chains from food to medical supplies as governments around the world take ever more stringent steps to contain the pandemic, restricting the movement of vehicles as well as people to drive them. The stoppages in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a three-week lockdown from March 25, are a harbinger of the damage the measures are wreaking on the economy amid forecasts the country could see its first contraction in at least two decades.“Though the government has allowed movement of both essential and non-essential goods, the situation is very different at the ground level,” said Naveen Kumar Gupta, secretary general of AIMTC, the largest grouping of transporters in India. Almost daily clarifications by the government take time to trickle down to officials enforcing the rules, making operations difficult, according to the organization’s president, Kultaran Singh Atwal.The decline in road transport is another major setback for fuel demand in the world’s third biggest oil market, which has already been hit by the collapse in air travel. Fuel sales in March by India’s three biggest state-run retailers shrank by as much as 33%.One of the major problems facing truckers is loading and unloading because of a shortage of labor, according to AIMTC. And with the lockdown shutting highway food establishments and workshops, truckers can’t get the services they need even if they are on the road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-3-week-covid-19-lockdown-sees-trucking-skid-to-a-halt/story-s1E1FhLkIdkr5ZJxzZzyvN.html

In a flash, the number of Covid-19 cases soared from 67 at the end of March to 690 as on April 7. Of these, 637 are linked to those returning from the Tablighi Jamaat conference that was held in Delhi in mid-March. Here are five ways in which the government, faced with the prospect of an exponential spread of the virus, has acted to bring the situation under control.Surveillance, containment: Chennai is one among the 10 worst-affected cities in the country, recording at least 149 cases. On April 5, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) launched a 90-day, door-to-door survey of every household in the city for Covid-19 symptoms. Nearly 16,000 healthcare workers armed with personal protective equipment and trained to ask the right set of questions will visit close to a million buildings in the city to record Covid-19 symptoms and create a disease database, SP Velumani, the minister for Municipal Administration, Rural Development and Special Programme Implementation, said.Those with symptoms would instantly be taken to the closest Covid-19 medical facility. Adhering to what is now referred to as the ‘Bhilwara model’, based on the way that the state authorities locked down Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, one of the first coronavirus clusters to emerge in the country in March, Chennai has already sealed off high-risk areas that reported multiple Covid19 cases. Nine areas of the city that accounted for nearly 20 cases have been declared containment zones. An area within a five-kilometre radius of such neighbourhoods are completely isolated, disinfected daily and citizens are simply not allowed to leave their homes. Health workers survey nearly 3000 houses in each of the nine hotspots every day.Ramped up testing: The government’s testing and isolation efforts, until the Tablighi Jamaat incident, were focused largely on air-passengers and those with a history of overseas travel. Rather than stigmatise the attendees, the government started a helpline towards the end of March so that they could self-identify and seek testing. This has worked in favour of the state: more than 1431 attendees have been traced so far. However, since many are from rural areas, the state has directed its identification efforts there. After the go-ahead from the Indian Centre for Medical Research for using antibody tests which return quicker results, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami announced on April 5 that the state had placed an order for 100,000 rapid test kits. State health ministry officials said that a bulk of it would be sent to smaller towns and rural areas.Essentials supplied: The effectiveness of lockdown depends in large measure on the state’s ability to deliver essential goods and services to people in a manner that keeps them safe at home. The state’s well-oiled Public Distribution System (PDS), Amma Canteens and welfare schemes have helped no doubt, but the smooth supply of vegetables has been one of Tamil Nadu’s biggest successes in this crisis. The government has set aside Rs 3280 crore for measures such as a Rs 1000 cash support scheme and delivering free rice, lentils and cooking oil through PDS shops. In many parts of the state, local authorities deliver a three-kilo weekly supply kit of vegetables for a nominal Rs 100. To further ease the strain on the healthcare system, the CM has also announced a subsidy of 30% capital investment with a cap of Rs 20 crore for new manufacturers of invasive ventilators, masks, drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and vitamin C tablets. He also announced sops for farmers, including a waiver of cold storage user fee, loans up to Rs 10 lakh to farmer producer firms, as well as exempted traders from paying 1% market fee for procuring farm produce. Farmer cooperatives: Four months ago, Tamil Nadu handed over a large part of the management of fruit and vegetable supply chain to farmer producer companies (FPC). FPCs are for-profit cooperatives that can be formed with 10 or more farmers as shareholders. Its activities can range from production and procurement to marketing and even export. Such cooperatives now run nearly 10 primary processing centers (PPC) in the big horticultural regions such as Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri. Since the FPC are farmer-owned companies, they find it easier to procure vegetables at a price that is fair to both farmers and consumers. There are cold storage facilities at all the PPCs. The farmer cooperatives are now playing a big role in door-delivering pre-packaged five-kilo vegetable boxes for Rs 250 in cities like Chennai and Coimbatore. Gagagdeep Sigh Bedi, Tamil Nadu’s agriculture secretary and agriculture production commissioner has been a big advocate of farm sector reforms in the state. “We invested nearly Rs 480 crore in this PPP scheme and it has come in handy in the time of a huge crisis. The FPCs now account for about 5-10% of Chennai’s daily vegetable supply. The horticulture department has started its own ecommerce door delivery platform a few days ago that makes 1000 deliveries a day in Chennai. We have 3700 mobile vegetable units currently and plan to add 500 each day,” Bedi told HT.Social distancing measures: In order to ease overcrowding in markets, Tamil Nadu converted bus stations in towns and cities into vegetable markets. The state has some 120 farmers markets where farmers can sell their produce directly to consumers. To manage social distancing and avoid chaos and crowding, nearly 60 farmers markets were relocated to bus stands that are now empty because of the lockdown. “The concrete flooring of the bus stands makes it easier to disinfect; bus stands are usually centrally located; and the large open architecture of bus stands make it easier to install disinfectant tunnels and prevent physical contact between people,” Bedi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-lessons-from-tamil-nadu-s-book-how-the-state-is-fighting-covid-19/story-Sl4kD5HZksOIuOTRDm2OeM.html

Vijayan said 1,46, 651 people were under observation in the state and 70 patients were discharged from hospitals.With the situation improving slightly, the CM has announced some concessions to certain sectors-- automobile workshops can be opened for two days in a week, mobile shops and repairing units can open on Sundays. Similarly, electricians with a licence will be allowed to carry out repairs in flats and other units. Earlier the government had allowed tea leaf plucking in estates and farmers to ferry their produce to collection outlets.The CM welcomed the 30% cut in MPs’ salary announced by the Centre but disapproved of the decision to suspend the MPLADS for two years.“Many MPs use this fund to develop their areas. Now they need it more to provide healthcare facilities. The decision is against the federal structure of the country. We want this decision to be revoked,” he said.About the possibility of extending the lockdown period in the state, he said the state will take an appropriate decision after hearing the Centre’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-fresh-cases-in-kerala-cm-demands-restoration-of-mps-fund/story-a6lEM8WgXplZXT7lyrmo9L.html

The health ministry officials also highlighted the importance of the lockdown and social distancing measures in the overall strategy to contain the spread of the pathogen by citing a recent study by ICMR, which in lay man’s terms says that a coronavirus-positive person could have ended up infecting over 400 others had the restrictions not been in place, which have the potential to limit the spread per infected person to 2.5 people. However, there is still no decision on a possible extension to the three-week nationwide lockdown in the light of requests by states like Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka favouring an extension. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab are also said to be in favour of maintaining the restrictions beyond April 14.In other important developments, the Centre said it had issued guidelines to states to streamline coronavirus disease management by dividing the health facilities into three categories-- Covid Care Centres, Covid Health Centres and Dedicated Covid Hospitals to segregate the management of mild, moderate and severe cases respectively.The country’s testing capacity has also witnessed a gradual increase and the total number of samples tested now stand at 1,07,006 including 11795 samples that were tested between Monday and Tuesday.One hundred and thirty six government labs and 59 private laboratories are authorised to test for Covid-19 at the moment even as rapid tests involving antibody testing have begun and the first set of results ratified by the Pune Lab. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has indicated that his government will ramp up testing along with tracing, treatment, teamwork, and tracking. He cited South Korea’s example to say that mass testing was required to contain the disease before it exploded like in other urban centres in Europe and America. The Delhi government has ordered conventional kits to test 50,000 people and rapid test kits to test 100,000 people and announced that random testing at hotspots will begin soon.According to Worldometre, a website that tracks the total number of coronavirus cases across the world, India has the lowest rate of tests per million—102-- of the population among the top 34 countries battling the coronavirus. Click Here for Latest Reports on CoronavirusHimachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu decided to follow Centre’s lead as the former slashed the salaries of all public representatives including MLAs and ministers by 30% for the year and also merged the MLA local area development fund for the next two years with the state funds earmarked for Covid-19 containment efforts and the latter ordering the utilisation of Rs one crore from the MLA fund for purchasing medical equipment, drugs and for funding other prevention initiatives against coronavirus.Coronavirus live updates In other important news, states continued to encourage Tablighi Jamaat participants from the March event in Delhi to contact authorities to aid in effective containment measures with the Punjab government giving them (Tablighi workers) a 24-hour deadline to approach the nearest police stations and the Delhi police also issuing a similar order. Authorities in Maharasthra complained that around 50-60 attendees of the event have switched off their phones and were trying to hide in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-latest-india-tally-close-to-5000-mark-maharashtra-goes-past-1000/story-yaJBKb6e8mhfhO6KuHROkJ.html
07-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Textile ministry announces new PPE rules||The Union Ministry of Textiles has announced a new regulatory framework for the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) units after reports emerged that Indian manufacturers, who failed laboratory tests, have sold their rejected products to a section of private hospitals.The ministry has laid down new norms, which require a Unique Certification Code called UCC-Covid19 and a tamper-proof sticker in indelible ink specifying details of the manufacturer. The ministry issued a notification to this effect on April 6, saying that the code would apply to both PPE garments and fabric that pass the laboratory tests, as stipulated by the South India Textile Research Association (SITRA) and the Defence Research & Development Establishment (DRDE). The code will record the type of garment, its test procedure and also the date of the test. The certification will be valid for a fixed time frame and both SITRA and DRDE will preserve the sample sent by the manufacturer, said the notification, accessed by HT. The move, ministry officials said, was to tighten the production of PPE units by Indian manufacturers in line with the specifications of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). Approvals have been given by the Coimbatore-based SITRA, an autonomous body under the ministry, and Gwalior-based DRDE. The notification stated that in case of coveralls a manufacturer needs to print in indelible ink or in tamper-proof sticker detail such as the name of the maker, code, test standard, batch number and order details. A ministry official, on condition of anonymity, told HT that the move was prompted by media reports that some manufacturers, whose products were rejected by SITRA and DRDE, were found to be supplying their units to a section of private hospitals. The ministry’s directive has been sent to states as well.Nihar Ranjan Dash, a joint secretary in the ministry, said that the certification primarily concerns coveralls and fabric provided by certain manufacturers of PPEs. “The directive doesn’t concern masks, as they’re certified by the Bureau of Indian Standards. We relied on imports of masks for all this while, and their specifications were of international standards,” said Dash. The tightening of norms would help Indian manufacturers prepare for the global market, he added. The current capacity of the Indian industry is to manufacture 10,000 PPE units per day, but Dash said that in about three months, the country is likely to produce three lakh units.An official of one of the testing agencies told HT on condition of anonymity that the two specific tests that are applied are the synthetic blood penetration for overalls and bacterial efficiency as far as masks are concerned. “A severe shortage of N-95 masks has been a cause for concern, as there are just a handful of manufacturers in the country,” said the official. Since India began domestic production of PPE in March owing to the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), these two testing agencies have approved 18 manufacturers to produce PPE units with non-woven textiles such as masks and coveralls. Later, the agencies approved 20 more manufacturers of the fabric. Only 50% of the manufacturers passed the test at the outset, the official said. “However, the success rate has come up to 80% now,” he added. M Rajaa of Coimbatore-based Saastha Textiles, one of the approved manufacturers of waterproof, laminated thermoplastic polyurethane and thermoplastic elastomers fabric in knitted, woven and non-woven fabric used in PPE units, told HT that the fabric needs to have a certain type of lamination to ensure that blood and virus do not contaminate a health care worker. “We also need to use only polypropylene virgin material to ensure that the material is protective and some manufacturers are also using reprocessed materials,” said Rajaa. Parag of Sai Synergy, another manufacturer of PPE units, said that the Indian Navy has ordered their products earlier and they always carry a sticker. “The sticker has to be put during the manufacturing process and cannot be put thereafter,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-textile-ministry-announces-new-ppe-rules/story-wAeOmca9W1BrLr8JaAvQ2J.html

07-04-2020||India||India has low testing rate, needs to scale up surveillance: Analysis||A new analysis by Indian epidemiologists has revealed that the country has one of the lowest Covid-19 testing ratios compared to other affected countries and that its infection containment measures may not be adequate because of this. India has conducted only 47 tests per million population as of April 5, compared to 2,753 in the UK, 4,572 in the US, 8,800 in South Korea and 22,918 tests per million population in the UAE.The analysis also found that in Indian states where testing was more, fatalities were comparatively lower. Kerala, which has the highest testing rate of 276 tests per million population, has one of the least case fatality at 0. 65%. But Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, West Bengal, and Gujarat have higher case fatality average (of about 3% to 9%) compared to the national average of 2.3%. Testing is also low in these states with about just 15 tests or less per million people. The authors-- Giridhara R Babu, Professor and Head, Life Course Epidemiology at Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI); Tarun Bhatnagar, scientist at ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology; and Deepa R, a research associate at PHFI; have warned that low testing but high fatality rate states may be missing positive Covid 19 cases.The authors have divided the states into four categories -- states with a high rate of testing and low case fatality (such as Delhi, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) where early diagnosis may be resulting in better outcomes; two states with high testing and yet high fatalities (Maharashtra and Karnataka) where authors are trying to understand if it’s because of elderly patients with co-morbidities; states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh with low testing and low fatalities; and states such as West Bengal, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh that have less than 20 tests per million but a case fatality rate of 3 to 5%.The authors explained that a lockdown cannot be continued for a very long time. To contain the disease, India will need more surveillance, extensive tracking, testing and isolating cases. “In summary, containment measures need to be improved in all states by increasing the number of tests. Also, syndromic surveillance and symptomatic quarantine measures are useful strategies to improve containment measures. States which have inadequate testing, poor early detection efforts, and higher case fatality will pose greater challenges in the future. If the cases are not detected early, then those who develop complications cannot be referred timely and, therefore, can succumb,” the authors wrote in BMJ Global Health journal’s blogs. The analysis has not been peer-reviewed yet.Since January 24, a little over 100,000 tests have been conducted in India, according to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) data. ICMR has approved at least 200 labs (both public and private) for testing through RT-PCR machines and is in the process of identifying other government and private labs, research institutes and medical colleges that have the capability and infrastructure to undertake testing for inclusion into the Covid-19 testing network. It is also procuring 0.5 million rapid testing (blood test) kits for mass testing, to be deployed in states where maximum cases are being reported.“We have to look at the cost and availability of tests. We can’t compare ourselves with US, UK or South Korea. One has to realise the size of our country and state of our economy...We have to try and see how much we can expand testing and at the same time isolate and contain clusters carefully. I think we are doing better than many European countries,” said Dr Shobha Broor, senior virologist and former head of the AIIMS department of virology.Authors of the BMJ analysis said it’s important that states make testing and detection data public. “It is more than two months since the first observed COVID19 case was diagnosed in India. We still have minimal data to understand the epidemiological trajectory of COVID 19 in India. The biggest limitation for our analysis is that state-wise testing, detection, and case-specific details are not made available in the public domain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-low-testing-rate-needs-to-scale-up-surveillance-analysis/story-yRQDOQlTlHOq0sLDHU63IM.html

We have found several clippings in his mobile, which we will have to test digitally,” the DGP said.In the past few days Islam has posted several posts on social media platforms questioning the government’s handling of the Covid-19 patients and those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi last month.There are at present 28 positive Covid-19 cases in Assam and 26 of them are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event.The patients are being treated at several government hospitals across Assam. Many others who came in contact with them have been kept in quarantine facilities.“The quarantine centres are worse than detention centres. I heard that even those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation one or two months ago have been kept in quarantine and their family members are not allowed near them,” Islam is reportedly heard claiming in the clip, which HT has accessed.Hindustan Times could not verify the authenticity of the clip.Assam has six detention centres lodged inside jails to keep those declared foreigners by foreigners’ tribunals. Another big detention centre, which can house around 3,000 people, is under construction.The legislator allegedly said that people kept in quarantine have not been tested for Covid-19 and are being kept there despite not having any symptoms associated with the disease.“I doubt that these people in quarantine may be killed with some lethal injection and the authorities will claim they died due to coronavirus. There is conspiracy going on to show that these people brought the virus from Nizamuddin Markaz, and kill them inside quarantine facilities,” the MLA allegedly said.Several AIUDF MLAs contacted by HT refused to comment on the matter general secretary (organisation) AIUDF who has the same name as the MLA said the lawmaker’s comments were not the party’s official line.“Islam’s comments at such a time are unfortunate, but those are not the party’s official stand and are his personal views. Hope the government also takes action against elected representatives from other parties who have made sensitive comments about the present situation,” said Md Aminul Islam, the AIUDF general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-mla-arrested-for-communal-rant-on-covid-19-booked-for-sedition/story-S8GNpubNbTdA4cPsTUV7hN.html

Plans are also afoot to supply 50% of these PPEs to other medical professionals across the country, the ministry said. “Indian Railways has taken up the in-house production of PPE type overall on a mission mode. A DRDO laboratory recently cleared overalls produced by its Jagadhari workshop. Approved design and material will be used for making this protective overall by other workshops under different zones,” the ministry said on Tuesday.The material for the overall will be procured from Punjab, as it is located near the Jagadhari workshop in Haryana. The Indian Railways is aiming to produce three sets of overalls per sewing machine per hour for as many days as required in its production units and workshops, the ministry said. “It may be noted this internal effort of Indian Railways is over and above a centralised request projected to the government and also indicated to HLL Lifecare Limited (HLL) through indent,” the ministry added.HLL, the government’s nodal agency for medical procurement, had pointed out an acute shortfall of supply of equipment due to high demand and logistical constraints since the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown was enforced on March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The state-run company had also written to the Indian Railways citing the supply crunch. The country is facing a massive shortage of PPE for doctors treating Covid-19 patients. The Delhi government had last week also accused the Centre of not responding to the shortage of the PPE in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-plans-to-make-low-cost-ppe-after-drdo-nod/story-sW4ZCPHN9kgf6OVx2IIj6J.html
07-04-2020||India||Steady rise in Covid-19 cases in Andhra, Telangana||The twin Telugu-speaking states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (AP) have been experiencing a steep rise in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases since the last week of March.Telangana and AP have recorded 11 and four deaths, respectively, to date. The combined count of Covid-19 positive cases stood at 673 till Monday night. Telangana reported its first double-digits figure of 13 on March 18, when eight Indonesians, who visited Karimnagar town after attending the Tablighi Jamaat meet in Delhi in March, tested Covid-19 positive.The mid-March congregation has turned the Jamaat headquarters at Nizamuddin into a Covid-19 hot spot.Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters on Monday night that out of 364 Covid-19 positive cases recorded so far, only 50 belong to the state, including 30 who returned from abroad recently and then infected 20 of their family members. Of these 50, 35 have recovered and discharged from hospitals and the rest are on the road to recovery, the CM said.The CM said the state saw a spike in Covid-19 positive cases after the Nizamuddin event. A total of 314 new cases were reported in the second phase, including 11 deaths. “Of these 314 people, 308 are still undergoing treatment and the remaining six have been discharged,” he said.The CM said that the state authorities have identified 1,089 Jamaat attendees so far. Besides, another 265 people, including 93 family members of the Jamaat attendees, have been traced and tested for Covid-19. “It was found that over 1,000 of those who attended the Nizamuddin event weren’t infected. While the test results of the rest would be known in a couple of days,” the CM said.The state authorities were also on the lookout for another 3,017 people who might have indirectly come in contact with these Jamaat attendees, he added.Andhra Pradesh, too, has seen a similar upswing in Covid-19 positive cases after the Jamaat attendees returned home. The state, which reported its first double-digits figure of 11 Covid-19 positive cases on March 26, crossed the three-figure mark within six days on April 1, when it reported 113 cases.By Monday night, the number of Covid-19 positive cases has shot up to 309, including five who have recovered and discharged from hospitals.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting on Tuesday afternoon, where the state health department officials said that out of 304 Covid-19 positive patients undergoing treatment in hospitals, 280 are linked to the Jamaat meet, including their primary contacts.The state government has identified 1,085 people who attended the Jamaat event. The tests were conducted on 997 attendees and 194 tested Covid-19 positive.“Another 2,400 people were identified to have come in contact with them, including their family members, relatives, friends and others who travelled with them from Delhi to Andhra Pradesh. Of them, 84 tested Covid-19 positive,” the officials told the CM. The authorities conducted tests on 205 people who had returned from abroad and 11 of them tested Covid-19 positive. Another six persons were infected among the 120 who had come in contact with people with recent foreign travel history. While seven tested Covid-19 positive among the 134 who showed symptoms of the viral disease, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/steady-rise-in-covid-19-cases-in-andhra-telangana/story-0Up74k9GaTerNL7vETJHKJ.html
07-04-2020||India||How Centre’s smart cities command centres are monitoring Covid-19 hotspots||The Centre has begun using integrated command and control centres designed for Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led smart cities mission for surveillance and monitoring of Covid-19 affected districts across states. States have converted the smart cities command centres into ‘war rooms’ for real time data monitoring using the central data dashboard to provide up-to-date information about the status of coronavirus cases in different administrative zones of their cities, officials aware of the development said. The war rooms are also being used for tracking people under quarantine and suspected cases. States with highest reported Covid-19 positive cases, say, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh among others are using the command centres for CCTV Surveillance of public places, geographic information system (GIS) mapping of coronavirus positive cases, GPS tracking of healthcare workers. “Centre is coordinating with the states through our central command centre at Nirman Bhawan in New Delhi. States are also using it for predictive analytics (Heat Maps) for virus containment across different zones of the city. We are also doing real-time tracking of ambulances and disinfection services,” a senior government official said.The Centre is using Smart Cities for collaborating with the district administration, district police and city administration to monitor the suspected cases of COVID-19. Centre aims to use smart infrastructure for developing predictive analytics using heat maps and taking action in monitoring the movements (using geo-fencing) as well as periodic health status of suspected cases. “States are also using it for providing virtual training to doctors and healthcare professionals, providing medical services through video conferencing, tele-counselling and tele-medicines. Leveraging this technology, Smart Cities are collaborating with medical practitioners in the city to provide online medical consultation facilities to citizens. The guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in collaboration with NITI Aayog and the Indian Medical Council, allow doctors to write prescriptions based on telephonic, textual or video conversations — chat, images, messaging or emails. People certified medical practitioners without the need to go out of the house, reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread,” the official said. “All the operators are given daily tasks to monitor quarantine citizens, passengers who came from abroad recently and resolve general queries regarding Covid-19,” the official added.This comes at a time when the Centre is mulling to resume movement and commercial activity in districts with no coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. In an interaction with chief ministers on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the states to formulate a “common exit strategy” to ensure “staggered re-emergence of the population” once the lockdown ended.The empowered group on COVID 19, led by Niti Aayog, is also seeking support from international organisations like the WHO and the UN for providing technical support in monitoring and surveillance systems. According to officials aware of the development, a meeting of the empowered group with the UN is also scheduled Tuesday. Monitoring at state level In Maharashtra, the highest affected state with 868 reported cases thus far, local administrations like the Pune Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PSCDCL) has collaborated with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to develop an integrated data dashboard. “Each case of the city has been mapped using geo-spatial information systems and city administration is monitoring the areas and creating buffer zones where patients were diagnosed positive with COVID-19 infection,” an official said. Using heat-mapping technologies and predictive analytics, the city administration is developing a containment plan and the containment zones get reflected on the dashboard. The healthcare operations at the city’s Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital are tracked at this facility. The Smart City’s integrated dashboard also monitors the quarantine facilities and tracks the health of suspected patients and their contacts placed under home quarantine.Tamil Nadu, with 621 reported COVID 19 positive cases, has deployed a team of doctors at the integrated command centres to monitor 250 people under quarantine each. “In Chennai, 25 doctors are engaged in ICCC, they had given 250 quarantine people each to guide their counterparts and give them moral and psychological support. They will also refer necessary medicines, if required. In Vellore, 118 suspects are mapped with individual health experts for advice. The contact details and medical history are shared and necessary advice given to the suspects,” the official said. In the smart cities of Uttar Pradesh the command centres are being used for tracking health services across the state. The state has 308 positive cases thus far. “In centres like Kanpur Smart City, Aligarh, Varanasi etc itracking of health services from the ICCC is being done. Telemedicine is offered through video conferencing facilities launched by the city administrations. In Aligarh, Doctors are deployed at Aligarh Smart City Integrated Command and Control Center (ICCC) during 11- 8 pm to enable telemedicine and video conferencing facility through a dedicated Whatsapp number,” the official said. Madhya Pradesh has also deployed a team of doctors at the command centres for counselling and monitoring. The state has 256 positive reported cases thus far. In Bhopal, the integrated command and control centre (ICCC) is being used as a helpline and tele-counselling centre for citizens. Medical officers are stationed at ICCC in different shifts to assist during any situation. “In Ujjain smart city centre, two doctors are stationed at the centre for 24 hours duration to take video conferencing/ telephone calls from the citizens and give appropriate advice based on the symptoms. Forty Medical Mobile Units (MMU) are operationalized to distribute medicines to people based on prescriptions by doctors. In Jabalpur, dedicated Rapid Response Team (RRT) and Mobile Action Unit (MAU) are present on ground ward-wise who coordinate with officials present at ICCC regarding screening, ambulance, quarantine etc.” the official said. Medical teams are stationed at the command centres to provide any immediate medical attention to through the helpline. “Trained professionals resolve the queries raised by citizens at an initial level and these calls are then connected with a designated doctor. This counselling process is reducing the panic among citizens/callers. The doubtful citizens are being encouraged to consult a doctor,” the official said. In Gujarat’s Gandhinagar smart city contact details of grocery stores for all sectors are also provided. The Surat Municipal Corporation has published an online dashboard for providing the overall statistics on tested, confirmed, active, recovered and death cases, the dashboard provides the trends and patterns on the spread of COVID-19 within city, in terms of cumulative cases (each day), number of new confirmed cases reported, age-wise distribution of cases, zone-wise distribution and gender-wise distribution. Spatial mapping of affected areas is also being provided. The first lot of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s ambitious Smart Cities Mission, aimed at developing 100 citizen-friendly and self-sustainable urban settlements, will be measurable only by 2021, when the first 20 of them are completed. Under the mission, setting up of integrated command and control centres (ICCC) for each city is a vital step. The ICCCs are designed to enable authorities to monitor the status of various amenities in real time. It was initially aimed to control and monitor online water and power supply, sanitation, traffic movement, integrated building management, city connectivity and Internet infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-centre-s-smart-cities-command-centres-are-monitoring-covid-19-hotspots/story-gHWui8G3q5mmuMHldKuvFK.html
07-04-2020||India||How Centre is using smart cities project to monitor Covid-19 hot spots||The Centre has begun using integrated command-and-control centres (ICCCs) designed for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious National Smart Cities Mission, an urban renewal and retrofitting programme, for real-time surveillance and monitoring of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-affected districts across the country.States have converted the smart cities’ ICCCs into war rooms for real-time data monitoring using the central data dashboard to provide information about the status of Covid-19 positive cases in various administrative zones of these cities, the officials aware of the development said. The war rooms are also being used for tracking people under quarantine and suspected Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh are among the states that are using the command centres for closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance of public places, geographic information system (GIS) mapping of Covid-19 positive cases and global positioning system (GPS) of healthcare workers. “The Centre is coordinating with the states through our central command centre at Nirman Bhawan in New Delhi. States are also using it for predictive analytics (heat maps) for virus containment across different zones of their respective cities. We’re also doing real-time tracking of ambulances and disinfection services,” a senior government official said.The Centre is collaborating with district administration, police and civic authorities to monitor suspected Covid-19 cases. The government aims to use the infrastructure for developing predictive analytics using heat maps and taking action in monitoring the movements such as geo-fencing and running periodic health checks on those who are suspected to be suffering from Covid-19. “States are also using it for providing virtual training to doctors and healthcare professionals, providing medical services through video conferencing, tele-counselling and tele-medicines. The Smart Cities Mission technology is leveraging the technology to collaborate with doctors across these designated cities to provide online medical consultation facilities to the people. The guidelines, issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in collaboration with NITI Aayog and the Indian Medical Council, allow doctors to write prescriptions based on telephonic, textual or video conversations — chat, images, messaging or e-mails. The risk of the spread of Covid-19 is vastly reduced, as many doctors, who aren’t in the frontline of combating the viral outbreak, don’t need to step out of their homes,” the official said. “All the operators are given daily tasks such as monitoring quarantined citizens and passengers who came from abroad recently and also answering frequently asked questions regarding Covid-19,” he added.The initiative comes at a time when the Centre is considering to resume movement and commercial activity in districts, where no Covid-19 cases have been reported to date after the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced since March 25 to contain the Covid-19 is lifted. In an interaction with chief ministers on Friday, PM Modi told the states to formulate a “common exit strategy” to ensure “staggered re-emergence of the population” after the lockdown is done away with.The empowered group on Covid-19, led by Niti Aayog, is also seeking support from international bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) for providing technical support in monitoring and surveillance mechanisms.

The dashboard also monitors the quarantine facilities and tracks the health of suspected patients and their contacts placed under home quarantine.Tamil Nadu, which has reported 621 Covid-19 positive cases to date, has deployed a team of 25 doctors at an ICCC and each of them has been tasked to keep a watch on 250 quarantined people. “In Chennai, 25 doctors are engaged in the ICCC. Each of them has been asked to monitor 250 quarantined people and give them moral and psychological support. They will also prescribe medicines, if required. In Vellore, 118 Covid-19 suspects are mapped with individual health experts for advice. Their contact details and medical history have also been shared. Besides, they’re being counselled regularly,” the official said.Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh, the ICCCs are being used for tracking health services across the state. UP has reported 308 Covid-19 positive cases so far.“The ICCCs keeping a tab on health services in Kanpur, Aligarh, Varanasi etc. Tele-medicine is offered via video-conferencing facility. In Aligarh, doctors are deployed at the ICCC between 11 am and 8 pm to enable telemedicine and video-conferencing facility using a dedicated WhatsApp number,” the official said.

Naik had earlier said that a Bengaluru-based practitioner had treated Charles.Prince Charles has denied it because he might be having some problems in admitting it. His country does not recognize Ayurveda, Naik said in an interview to PTI.“It was obvious for him to refuse. I am hundred and one percent sure that he got cured because of Ayurveda,” the minister said. He did not say if there was a specific Ayurvedic medicine that purportedly cured Prince Charles or if he benefitted from a holistic Ayurvedic approach.Naik said that once scientific validation of some formulas in Ayurveda is done, the country would be ready to treat Covid-19 patients with it.When other systems like allopathy have failed, we have a solution to treat COVID-19 through Ayurveda, he said.The minister also alleged that a lobby was hindering the usage of Ayurveda as an effective medicine to treat novel coronavirus in the country.He said his ministry has been following up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Ayurveda has a solution for coronavirus, which is not offered by other streams.“We have been asked for scientific validation for the Ayurvedic formula. But we must understand that scientific validation of Ayurveda has been done thousands of years back.It is a stream of medicine that has been passed on from one generation to other.”He did not say how the validation would have been done thousands of years ago for a disease that is known to have come into existence only last year. There is no known cure for COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV2 that was first observed in Chinas Wuhan province in late 2019. Scientists and pharma companies all over the world are working fervently to create the first vaccine or first cure for the disease.The central government will have to notify the Ayurvedas formula to treat coronavirus. We have put up our claim before the PM after which he has acted and a task force has been formed, he said.Naik said that coronavirus attacks the immune system.“If you boost the immunity system, then the virus cannot attack you. It also affects your respiratory system. We have a solution to improve respiratory system.” Strictly speaking, the coronavirus SARS-CoV2 does not attack the immune system but attacks the respiratory system, leading to the disease. However, most of the damage in COVID- 19 disease is caused by the immune system, which unleashes a massive defence to stop the virus from spreading. In the process, millions of immune system cells attack the virus and infected lung tissues but end up wreaking havoc on the entire lung. This leads to shortness of breath, dry cough and other complications, leading to in some cases death.The minister added that there is 60 to 70 per cent control on spread of coronavirus in India due to home remedies prescribed in Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani.“Lakhs of people are currently taking advantage of it, he said. But he provided no details of where the people are benefitting from the Ayurveda cure or if any hospitals are running regulated programmes in this regard.India is the only example where this virus has been controlled. We have already issued advisory to the people on does and donts, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-have-a-solution-to-treat-covid-19-through-ayurveda-claims-ayush-minister-shripad-naik/story-IBlUWmsze36qXPvB1GlfxO.html

Of the 4067 Covid-19 cases in the country, 1445 were linked to the congregation in March in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Markaz. Officials in Odisha have said 68 people, including African nationals, had gone to the Tablighi Jamaat’s Delhi headquarters from the state and 28 came back. Out of the 28 three, including a postman who had attended the religious congregation and returned home, have tested positive for the virus.This prompted chief minister Naveen Patnaik to urge all those who had attended the meet in New Delhi, to come forward and self-register with the government helpline on Covid-19.“Corona is currently the biggest threat to the human race and to beat it we all need to come together to beat it,” Patnaik said.“Only through awareness, we can break the chain of coronavirus. While there is no need to panic but we do need to be careful. Your cooperation will for the betterment of your own family and the human race,” he said.Three Muslim brothers living in an apartment in the Bomikhal area of Bhubaneswar tested positive last Friday, as the state’s total cases surged from five to 20 on a single day. Soon after, Bhubaneswar municipal authorities sealed off the entry and exit points of the area and started active surveillance of people who had come in close contact with the brothers. On Sunday, 15 other Muslims who lived in the same area tested positive for Covid-19, even as Odisha saw the highest single-day surge in positive cases, taking the total to 39. It is not yet clear whether the three brothers or any of their family members attended the congregation, but officials admitted that the current focus of the government was to scrutinise Muslim majority areas and make them undergo Covid-19 screening tests.In the last four days, the Odisha government has announced 10 Covid-19 cluster containment zones around the state including four in Bhubaneswar. Most of these containment zones have sizeable Muslim populations. “Though we are still not sure how many attended the congregation, the aim is to take the swab samples of as many people in these zones and test them,” said a senior official of the state government’s health surveillance team.The areas include Bhadrak town, Bhubaneswar’s Jadupur locality and also Brahmabarada, a village in Jajpur district where the Tablighi chief Maulana Saad had addressed a meeting between February 29 and March 3 this year. In all these containment areas, screening procedures are being followed vigorously but the state health department has refused to share the number of swab samples they have taken in these zones so far.Health department officials also said they are facing problems in collecting samples from such areas as personnel were scared of getting infected by the coronavirus.“Everyone is in panic mode. One can’t force health workers to visit the area if they are unwilling,” an official said.Mohammed Moquim, Congress MLA from Barabati-Cuttack, said he has been urging community leaders to get tested.“The virus is the enemy of humanity and anyone who has attended the Jamaat in Delhi should come forward to get tested,” he said. Even though the chief minister and Subroto Bagchi, Odisha government’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19, have urged people not to ostracise those who have tested positive or give the pandemic a religious colour, some Muslim leaders admitted that of late they are being viewed with suspicion.“We are urging all our community members to come out and report whether they attended the Jamaat. But unfortunately, the entire community is being vilified thanks to one-sided debates in a few news channels,” Mohd Shahnawaz, president of Jama Masjid Bhubaneswar, said.“In Odisha too, we can sense some sort of unease when people see our community members,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-containment-zones-odisha-tests-for-covid-19-cases-among-minority-dominated-areas/story-4VXG4Tx3Liu9LY0hkxWdtN.html

The child acquired the infection from his 29-year-old mother who works as a doctor for the Southern Railways.On March 29, the 29-year-old woman was admitted in ESI Hospital, Coimbatore along with the baby, her 58-year-old mother and the family’s domestic help. The doctor tested positive after treating a 63-year-old man in a railway hospital in Erode. He had travelled along with two Thai nationals who had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in March.“First, the mother tested positive so we thought all other people in the family should also be tested so we admitted them and took a swab test,” the dean of the ESIC Hospital Dr. A. Nirmala told Hindustan Times. “At that time the child was found to be positive. He was allowed to be in the same room as his mother since both of them had tested positive. We closely observed both mother and child and provided counselling services to the mother as well.”In India, the number of Covid-19 cases has been lowest among the age group of 0 to 20 years, while the maximum number of cases has been reported among those between 21 and 40 years. The casualty rate has been highest in those above 60 years, due to existing co-morbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension and other issues, according to data released by the government last week.The team of doctors treating the 10-month-old infant knew that if the baby was immunologically competent, secondary problems would not arise. They continued to closely watch the child for other symptoms. “Meanwhile, we were treating the patient with required medicines and also giving nutritional food for baby and members of the family,” the dean said.“We kept a close watch on the baby and treated him with antibiotics for elevated temperature. We could not put the baby on hydroxychloroquine like we did for the adults. But since the baby was immunised for all other infections, it could have helped (him) get a good immunity.”All patients were fed a diet of porridge and fruit. “As a baby we took a lot more care of him, he didn’t develop any abnormal symptoms. Finally took the swab test for the family members. All except the doctor’s mother turned out to be negative. We discharged the doctor, the child and the maid, but the 58-year-old mother is still under treatment,” Nirmala said. Hydroxycholoroquine which is commonly used to treat malaria, arthritis and lupus, among other ailments, has been in the eye of a storm after United States president Donald Trump on Monday warned of retaliation if India did not supply the drug as asked. India, the largest manufacturer and exporter of the drug, initially banned exports on March 25 to ensure adequate domestic supplies. On Tuesday, the Centre decided to allow exports, depending on availability, after stockpiling enough for domestic use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-s-youngest-covid-19-patient-10-month-old-baby-recovers/story-awOruBogbm4ZAAbLgWJfsL.html

That is why, if the need arises we will extend the lockdown, a decision will be taken based on the situation,” chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, according to news agency ANI.TelanganaChief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao has cautioned that if the lockdown is lifted it could cost lives and that it is the reason the country has seen very few cases.“It is true that the country’s economy has taken a beating during the lockdown period. Telangana, too, suffered heavily – our revenue was just Rs 6 crore in the last six days, against the expected revenue of Rs 2,500 crore. But we can always revive the economy once this crisis is over, but we cannot bring back the lives of the people who could die in large numbers if the lockdown is lifted,” he said.He said it will be difficult to control people if the lockdown is lifted.“All the efforts we had put in all these days, braving financial loss, would go waste if the situation comes back to square one due to the lockdown being eased,” Rao said.RajasthanChief minister Ashok Gehlot said the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus has to be lifted in phases and not as soon as the 21-day period ends on April 14.“We cannot withdraw lockdown immediately. It has to be done in a phased manner, that is what I feel,” Gehlot said at a press briefing through video conferencing.KarnatakaState medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar hinted that the lockdown could be extended beyond April 14th in the state’s ‘red zones’. The state has identified parts of capital Bengaluru, Mysore, Nanjangud, Gauribidnur, Bidar and Mangalore as ‘red zones’ as they account for a bulk of the positive cases in the state. Sudhakar said while speaking to the media that they would consult with the Centre and other relevant officials and the state might take a call to lift the lockdown in the ‘red zones’ only in phases.Assam Assam’s health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has also hinted towards extending lockdown in the state.“If the lockdown is lifted by April 14 or 20, we will face challenges,” Sarma was quoted as saying by a local news portal. Sarma added that the challenge would be to quarantine all the people stranded outside Assam who will come back as soon as the lockdown order is lifted. Uttar PradeshAwanish Kumar Awasthi, the state’s additional chief secretary (home), said that following the recent spike in Covid-19 cases, the lockdown in the state is likely to continue.“The state government wishes to make it clear that the lockdown is not likely to be lifted until there is a single coronavirus case in the state. The lifting of the lockdown means UP has become coronavirus free,” Awasthi said at a press conference in the state capital.PunjabSuresh Kumar, Punjab chief minister’s chief principal secretary, has also pointed that the lockdown is expected to continue in most parts but issue curfew passes to allow harvesting from April 15.“A final call will be taken on April 12 or 13,” Suresh Kumar said on Sunday.MaharashtraState health minister indicated last week that the government may extend the lockdown by a couple of weeks, especially in Mumbai and other urban areas of the state.“Lifting it fully in a city like Mumbai is unlikely,” health minister Rajesh Tope said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-extend-covid-19-lockdown-what-have-some-states-said-against-withdrawing-restrictions/story-OidykD4k3aRxlvzFiPyPsN.html

The animal could be a possible Covid-19 suspect.The Sunderban is the world’s largest mangrove delta and the only mangrove forest inhabited by tigers. As the mangroves are largely impenetrable, tigers are usually spotted on the river banks and when they cross the rivers and creeks from one island to another. “Patrolling on boats has been increased to look out for tigers that show signs of Covid-19, such as breathlessness. The BSF and police have also been asked to keep a watch,” said Ravi Kant Sinha, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal. On Monday, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had directed all tiger range states to observe tigers with symptoms of Covid-19 such as dry cough or laboured breathing. The advisory came after a tiger at the Bronx zoo in New York was detected with coronavirus. It was the first instance of a tiger being infected with the deadly disease.As the Sundarbans delta is located along the Indo-Bangla border, the Border Security Force and police, who also patrol the delta in their own boats, have also been asked to look out for tigers which are found to be panting while crossing rivers from one island to another.“Our men are patrolling the area. We have been asked to alert the forest department if we spot any tiger with symptoms such as dry cough, breathlessness and running nose,” said SS Guleria, BSF deputy inspector-general (South Bengal Frontier). Out of the 2967 tigers in India, Sundarbans has around 90 tigers in its one national park and five wildlife sanctuaries. The Indian part of the Sundarbans forest spreads over 4,200 sq km comprising 48 islands crisscrossed by rivers. Unlike other forests, boats are the only means of patrolling this delta. “We have around 1,200 camera traps which have been kept on standby on boats and floating stations. Around 30 double cylinder boats are operating in the field. If we get any information about any suspect tiger, our teams will move in and camera traps will be set up in that area,” said a senior official of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve who did not want to be named.The state forest department has already stopped all kinds of tourism in the Sundarbans, which is known for its Royal Bengal Tiger and estuarine crocodiles, among other animals.West Bengal is among the top three states in the list of casualties caused by human-tiger conflicts in India. At least 30 people have been killed by tigers between 2017 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lookout-notice-for-tigers-running-out-of-breath-while-swimming-across-rivers-in-sundarbans/story-YJlGPiYEzFHyYTC3zel95O.html

This strategy is producing positive results, especially in Agra, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Pathanamthitta, Bhilwara and East Delh,” Aggarwal said.Follow coronavirus live updates here.Rajasthan’s Bhilwara district has particularly been in the news for its ‘ruthless containment’ model. The district which was once among the 10 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hot spots in the country, before a three-pronged attack that involved isolating the district, a screening strategy in city and rural areas and quarantine and isolation wards followed by monitoring mechanism for rural areas allowed the government to get a grip on the spread of coronavirus.Aggarwal also cited an ICMR study to underline that failure to practise social distancing could extract a very high price.“A recent ICMR study shows that if one Covid-19 patient does not follow lockdown orders or practice social distancing, then the patient can infect 406 people in 30 days,” he said.As part of the government’s efforts to boost medical facilities, the railways have prepared 40,000 isolation beds in 2,500 coaches.“Indian Railways has prepared 40,000 isolation beds in 2,500 coaches. They are making 375 isolation beds daily and this is going on across 133 locations across the country,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cluster-containment-showing-results-says-govt-as-354-more-test-positive/story-eEdSSkRvkhk0iLa0QAfRfJ.html

It is an epidemiologic term that describes the virus’ reproductive number.Agarwal said R-Naught for coronavirus is between 1.4 and 1.5 as per one study by the scientific body, ICMR.The government also said that no decision on the extension of lockdown has been taken yet and appealed against any speculation amid conflicting reports on the matter.“These are discussions related to social media, honorable SC has ordered against speculations which may lead to panic among citizens. As soon as any decision on the matter is made, we will convey that to you,” Agarwal said.He added that a total of 326 infected people have recovered so far while the total number of positive cases climbed to 4421on Tuesday with the reporting of 54 new cases and 8 deaths in the past 24 hours. The total number of casualties due to Covid-19 stood at 117.In another important announcement, Agarwal said the cluster containment strategy and outbreak management plan was giving positive results in places like Noida, Bhilwara, Agra, Pathanamthitta and areas of East Delhi, which were among the disease hotspots.The health ministry official added that technology was being used successfully in smart cities like Pune, Surat, Bengaluru and Tumakuru for surveillance, tracking, management of home quarantine, predictive analysis using heat map, telemedicine etc.“Smart Cities are using technology to manage Covid-19 in surveillance, contact tracing, home quarantine management, information dissemination, training, predictive analysis using heat maps and counseling,” said Agarwal.Coronavirus live updates He added that the health ministry has come out with a very important guidance document for the appropriate management of Covid-19 positive cases and suspects which has demarcated three classes of facilities to be set up, namely, Covid Care Centres, Dedicated Covid Health Centres and Dedicated Covid Hospitals for the management of mild moderate and intensive care respectively.He added that the Indian Railways have turned over 2500 coaches into 40,000 beds for treatment of positive patients as part of the country’s preparedness to deal with a possible quick spike in cases.Click Here for Latest Reports on Coronavirus||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-covid-19-case-can-infect-406-in-30-days-in-absence-of-lockdown-warns-govt/story-0fN81eJdNyJfNoPaLENg5N.html

Only people involved in the delivery of essential services, such as health care, are allowed to function in this period. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka have suggested they were not in favour of lifting all restrictions after April 14 and conveyed to the Centre that the pandemic will be easier to contain if the lockdown were to continue. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh too have favoured an extension of the lockdown.Earlier in the day, a group of ministers led by defence minister Rajnath Singh met at his residence to discuss various issues that would have to be factored in once the lockdown was lifted. “The ministers were very clear that even if the lockdown is lifted, travel restrictions will remain,” said the official quoted above.It was for the fourth time that the group met. Singh and home minister Amit Shah usually head these meetings. On Tuesday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman too attended the discussions, along with 14 other ministers. The talks focused on what form of travel should be allowed. “Trains and buses will not be back to normal,” said the official. “Air traffic will also be disrupted. The public should expect a slow, staggered return to a new normal.’’A key concern flagged in the meeting was that the farming sector was struggling. The ministers discussed the challenge amid apprehensions that the harvest season would face a major setback.“The ministers were briefed that the special concessions for agriculture were not filtering down. The labourers were too scared to go back to work,” said a second official. In the same way, the lack of resources was also impacting the supply of medicines. While there was no shortage of drugs, said this official, there was a shortage of people to transport them.The official said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be conveyed the key deliberations at Tuesday’s meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expect-a-slow-return-to-a-new-normal-officials-on-covid-19-lockdown/story-epp7urRD2gUdWSt0DeVjZL.html
07-04-2020||India||In Gehlot’s praise for ‘Bhilwara model’, a message for fight against Covid-19||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said that the model adopted by his government in checking the spread of coronavirus in Bhilwara, has set standard in fight against the pandemic.He added that the first case in Rajasthan was reported on March 2, 2020, and strict measures were taken in the state on the very first day.“The Bhilwara border was sealed on March 19 after we found a doctor being corona positive and it is becoming a learning ground now. In Bhilwara, 3,000 teams were formed that reached 32 lakh people. We reached nearly six lakh homes and screening was done,” Gehlot said while addressing a press conference through video conferencing.The chief minister further said that the same Bhilwara model will be replicated across the state, including in Ramganj in state capital Jaipur, which has become the new Covid-19 hot spot.A 45-year-old man from Ramganj, who returned from Oman via Dubai on March 13, has become a superspreader, transmitting the virus to at least 19 family members and sparking fears of community transmission.Gehlot also said that Rajasthan will start rapid testing of coronavirus in the state within a week as his government has ordered 10 lakh testing kits from China which will be received soon.Bhilwara reported a surge in Covid-19 cases after two doctors got infected with Sars-Cov-2 virus, which later spread to another 25 patients, necessitating a massive screening exercise of the district’s entire 28 lakh population and curfew in the district.With 27 cases, the district was considered the worst hit in Rajasthan and for a few days, at the national level too.Bhilwara, about 250 km south of Jaipur with about 48 per cent of the district’s total 2.8 million people mainly engaged in cultivation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-gehlot-s-praise-for-bhilwara-model-a-message-for-fight-against-covid-19/story-UbM8k907ywn21GkMzCfelO.html

Not only have we not received any concrete answers on how they are dealing with the shortage, they have now issued guidelines for using the masks four times. How is a doctor supposed to carry the infected mask home? How are they individually supposed to disinfect it? This should happen at the hospital level to curtail the spread of the infection and even then only when there is no other option available,” said Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T, General Secretary of Resident Doctors’ Association at AIIMS.Even before the government has admitted a community spread, at least 34 healthcare workers have been infected in Delhi so far. One of the doctors from the physiology department of AIIMS who tested positive for the infection and passed it on to his pregnant wife and brother was not involved in active care of Covid-19 patients; authorities have been unable to trace a clear history.Around 20 other healthcare workers, who came in contact with a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19, have been quarantined for 14 days.“The circular does not clarify whether the same will be applicable for people working in the Covid-19 wards and those screening the patients for respiratory symptoms – as they are at a higher risk of carrying the disease home with the masks. If we are at this stage even before the community transmission has begun, what will happen when there is a deluge of patients. This will take active doctors out of duty,” said Dr Srinivas.The hospital insists that it is as per current scientific knowledge.“We will shortly share the protocol for disinfecting the masks with everyone; N-95 masks do not need to be thrown away after one use,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital.In its guidelines on using personal protective equipment during Covid-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) says, “Respirators (like N-95 and FFP2) have been used for extended time during previous public health emergencies. This refers to wearing the same respirators while caring for multiple patients who have the same diagnosis. Evidence indicates respirators maintain their protection when used for extended periods. However, using one respirator for longer than four hours can lead to discomfort and should be avoided.”The shifts of healthcare workers in the hospital last between eight and twelve hours. The WHO guidelines do not talk about reuse.With the US scrambling to get supplies as their tally closes in on 370,000, their Centre for Disease Control has said a N-95 mask can be donned multiple times depending on manufacturer recommendation or up to five times, conditional to stringent measures on how the masks are stored and reused.A group of researchers from Stanford University’s School of Medicine reviewed various decontamination measures and said hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet radiation could disinfect the masks but they could not determine whether filtration and material strength would remain intact after repeated use.Heating the mask at 70 degrees Celsius in kitchen microwave for 30 minutes or hot water vapour for 10 minutes can also help in decontamination, but the study came with the rider: “Please do not heat your masks in a home oven! Our reports do not advocate or advise on practices and suggest that you strictly adhere to your hospital’s policies and procedures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-aiims-delhi-asks-its-staff-to-reuse-n-95-masks-four-times/story-0pAXppQz7mJEWt6ex2w7uO.html

The same containment model will be replicated across the state, including in Ramganj and Jaipur.“State authorities reached out to six lakh households in Bhilwara and conducted widespread testing there.

We will screen them and other staffers who were deployed there,” he said.“We will quarantine them to contain the spread, in case they (the security personnel) have been infected,” the home minister told a news channel.The tea vendor was admitted in Jogeshwari-based HBT hospital for COVID-19.However, it is not yet clear how the vendor, who stays inside his small shop, contracted the infection.After the case was reported, civic officials on Monday sprayed disinfectants in the area.Meanwhile, Deshmukh also lambasted people who flout the lockdown norms and step out of their homes for “frivolous” reasons, and warned strict action.“We are keeping vigil. We have issued orders to seize vehicles and 4,000 vehicles have been seized till Monday,” he said.The home minister also asked people living in containment zones not to panic and cooperate with the state government by not stepping out of their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-at-matoshree-to-be-tested-for-coronavirus-infection/story-IzbiNWvlxn26I4nNFeLHqO.html

07-04-2020||India||A 19-member commando team deployed in Mohali to fight Covid-19||Punjab police have come up with a novel concept with the launch of a specialised unit comprising 19 constables trained in all types of emergency responses linked with coronavirus, including making first contact with positive Covid-19 cases, enforcing quarantine, isolation and hospitalisation. The programme is presently being tried out in Mohali district in the state and has aptly been named ‘Covid Commandos’.“The district will have 19 Covid Commandos designated as Covid-19 emergency response team to spearhead coordination and response to persons and areas affected by Covid-19 within Mohali district,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mohali.The chosen members of the Mohali police who will serve as Covid Commandos are physically fit and self-motivated constables who have themselves volunteered to take up the onerous job of Covid-19 control in this moment of extreme exigency, said Chahal.“The commandos will be ready for deployment in a short span of 30 minutes within the entire district,” he added. The deployment of Covid Commandos will safeguard the rest of Mohali police from coming in direct and first contact with Covid-19 positive cases and thereby reduce the chances of police personnel getting infected in the field.The Covid Commandos have been provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and training on its proper usage, including removal and disposal. They have also been given Go-Bags carrying first aid supplies for a response to emergency situations.“They are trained and motivated to meet the requirement of an on-scene police presence along with health department staff. They have also been trained for handling a non-cooperative positive patient as per the standard operating procedure in place,” added Chahal.Coronavirus live updates Covid Commandos will respond to requests for assistance from the health department and community at large to deal with Covid-19 related cases including, but not limited to, transportation to hospitals, wellness checks and delivery of critical items like medication.“Officers may be required to enforce revised local or regional public health ordinances, such as mandatory quarantines, isolation, or travel restrictions. They may also be required to provide testing and coordinate treatment to limit the spread of COVID-19 within the district,” said Chahal.Click Here for Latest Reports on Coronavirus||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-19-member-commando-team-deployed-in-mohali-to-fight-covid-19/story-cZk0W90JmEzN6BW8978FAL.html
07-04-2020||India||Covid-19 Update: Himachal Pradesh follows Centre, cuts ministers, MLAs salaries by 30%||Following in the footsteps of the Central government, Himachal Pradesh cabinet has decided to slash salaries of most public representatives in the government and the state boards by 30% for a duration of one year and has also suspended the release of the MLA area fund for two years, news agency ANI reported on Tuesday.All the money saved through the cuts will go to the state corpus dedicated to fighting coronavirus in the state, the report added. The decision comes close on the heels of the Centre slashing salaries of all MPs and ministers by 30% and suspending the MPLADS funds for the next two years.Several states including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha had earlier announced a deferment in payment of a big chunk of March salaries to state employees in an effort to shore up reserves deployed for fighting Covid-19.The Union cabinet’s decision to slash salaries taken on Monday also applies to the Prime Minister, whose 1/3rd of the salary along with that of other MPs for the rest of the year, will now go into the consolidated fund of India to be used to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.The centre brought an ordinance to implement the directive which was a demonstration of the government’s willingness to set an example for others in this time of crisis, union minister for environment Prakash Javadekar had indicated.“Charity begins at home,” Javadekar said while announcing the cuts.The decision by the centre is likely to result in a saving of Rs 7,930 crore, including close to Rs 29 crore that will come from the MPs salaries.MPs get Rs one lakh salary apart from several other perks and privileges which have been left untouched. The President, the Vice President and the governors of states have also decided to take salary cuts.Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, too, has decided to take a 30% cut in salary.There has been a mixed reaction to the suspension of the MPLAD scheme, with some opposition leaders fearing the stoppage will prevent the serving of the poor and the most affected on the ground level.The decision by Himachal Pradesh government comes amid demands by the Congress government to slash all union budget allocations by around 30% and suspension of all government advertising for the next two years.

Edited excerpts: How is the ministry meeting the challenges brought on by the pandemic?The ministry has aligned its efforts with the Centre and has extended support to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) by making their National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs), their hostels and the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in the country available for converting them into quarantine or isolation facilities so that we have enough wards to observe and treat those infected by the virus. We have also shared the details of nearly one lakh candidates skilled in healthcare related sectors through various programmes under the Skill India Mission. These professionals will help in containing the spread of the infection and efficiently manage patients in quarantine and hospital facilities that will be set up in the coming days. Additionally, a list of 2000 healthcare trainers and more than 500 healthcare assessors have also been shared with MoHFW, who can be utilised for services.We have also taken steps to ensure that candidates undergoing apprenticeship training across various establishments do not suffer from the economic impact of the infection. MSDE has notified all establishments under designated and optional trade to pay full stipend to apprentices engaged with them. The government will reimburse stipends to these establishments under National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) for the lockdown period as per guidelines.What is the number of those who will be reimbursed?Currently there are 24,884 establishments engaging 2.42 lakh apprentices in both designated and optional trade. As per the provision under NAPS, the government reimburses 25% of the stipend amount to be paid to apprentices per month subject to a maximum of Rs 1500 per month. During the lockdown period due to Covid-19 pandemic, the government will be paying approximately Rs 36.30 crore to the establishments who would be claiming reimbursement for engaging apprentices under NAPS during this periodEvery sector is expected to reel under from the impact of the pandemic. There are projections of job losses. How will the ministry ramp up efforts at skilling so that people can be self-reliant?The virus will undoubtedly impact the economy and industries will see sluggish growth, especially in sectors like aviation, tourism and hospitality and automobile. However, we do not intend to slow down the process of training and readying people especially in skills for Industry 4.0 that will definitely gain more in importance once we get over this crisis. We will continue to assess the situation and, in line with the directives provided by the Central Government, extend the necessary support.Our commitment to the people and to the economy remains unchanged; we will gradually speed up the skilling efforts, impart trainings and ensure measures to reskill and upskill young people. Some of our trainees in short-term training programmes and Jan Shikhsa Sansthans have committed themselves to the service of the nation by manufacturing and producing masks and sanitisers, operating from their homes.What is the feedback from your interaction with people on the ground, what is the initial assessment of the lockdown and what has emerged as areas that need focus?Both members of the public and industry feel we need to first control the spread of this deadly virus and then go ahead with the revival work. So far, India has been successful in managing the spread of Covid-19 with measures like lockdown and underlining the importance of social distancing. Of course, there is the concern that the virus is outpacing the economy and it is true to some extent. Industries have suffered, people are worried about their livelihoods and jobs. However, the government has taken deep and preventive measures to address some of these concerns and have promised that livelihoods will be protected.We have seen how even developed countries have been affected by this pandemic and we must learn from these examples and win again this outbreak. At this point, the government’s priority is to save lives and stop the virus from spreading and that is possible only through strict adherence to social distancing, by staying at home. Only then will we be able to flatten the curve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-don-t-intend-to-slow-down-training-will-ready-people-for-industry-4-0-minister/story-uQLg4fyKyUIKTCY3jjbRdP.html

It was announced on March 24 by the Prime Minister.Rao also cautioned that if the Covid-19 lockdown is lifted it could cost lives.Before KCR, as the Telangana chief minister is popularly known, a top bureaucrat in Uttar Pradesh also hinted that the lockdown may not be lifted in the state on April 14.A senior bureaucrat in Punjab has also favoured an extension of the lockdown. On Friday, a minister in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in the country, also said that the restriction should not end on April 14.The lockdown came into effect on March 25, a day after Prime Minister Modi addressed the nation, saying that the step was being taken to break the chain of infection and control the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19. He also urged people to avoid travel and stay wherever they are.Earlier today, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said the final week of the ongoing lockdown is “critical” for evolving an exit strategy as data regarding the spread of coronavirus will have a bearing on the decision to be taken by the government.He also appealed to the people to abide by whatever decision is ultimately taken by the government and cooperate with the same spirit that has so far been evident “even if it meant to continue with some degree of hardship still beyond April 14”.“As today marks the completion of two weeks of nationwide lockdown in force since March 25, I thought it appropriate to reach out to the people and the leadership of the country with my views and concerns amidst current efforts to tide over the crisis caused by the outbreak of coronavirus,” Naidu said in a statement.The lockdown, acknowledged by experts as a necessary preventive measure, has disrupted economic activity and caused an exodus of migrant workers from cities towards their villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-thinking-of-extending-covid-19-lockdown-after-april-14-as-states-experts-make-request-report/story-QNQD7oAIeeKs9oNjCA2GdP.html

Hence, the apprehension of the petitioner also because of the vulnerable age and overcrowding in jail that he is likely to contact Covid-19 which may be detrimental to his health, is unfounded,” the judge said.Michel is in judicial custody from January 2019 and has been lodged in Tihar jail for 16 months now. He was extradited by the CBI from Dubai in December 2018.Appearing for Michel, his counsel Aljo K Joseph and Sriram Parrakat, had submitted Michel has a low immunity level and is aged 59 years. He states that the strength of the prisoners of Tihar Jail is 10,000 whereas presently, around 17,000 prisoners are lodged therein. Thus, because of overcrowding and social distancing not being mentioned, petitioners are prone to catch Covid-19.They also contended that the charge sheet has already been filed and other co-accused have been granted bail.However, the court said despite being a British national, Christian Michel has not been in that country for the last 6-7 years and had to be extradited from Dubai after an inquiry. The judge said he was a flight risk and had no roots in the society.The court had heard the arguments through video conferencing on Monday and had reserved the order.Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court also rejected the bail application of Shivinder Mohan Singh, ex-promoter of Ranbaxy, stating that he is already in isolation and is maintaining social distancing.Justice Mukta Gupta said that even if Singh has to use common facilities like restroom and taking food, the distancing can still be maintained besides maintaining hygiene by use of adequate measures including washing hands etc. to which the petitioner does not state that there is any inadequacy.Singh, through his advocate, had also sought release on the ground that he would be of help to the society in view of his expertise in the healthcare sector. However, the court said that the apex court has already asked Singh to give his suggestions which would be considered by the concerned authorities.“The suggestions have been transmitted to the concerned authorities and if they find feasible and need the co-operation of the petitioner, they would be at liberty to take the same through various means including Video Conferencing as is done in all the cases,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alleged-middleman-michel-sought-bail-plea-over-covid-19-denied-you-are-in-a-separate-cell-says-judge/story-OmArl1ZP8hdVyRV6TwDQAN.html

It’ll go on spreading. South Korea identified every single individual through large scale testings. We are now going to do large scale testings like South Korea,” he said.The Chief Minister said that the administration plans to conduct 1 lakh random Covid-19 tests at city’s various coronavirus hotspots.Today we are going to give 2000 phone numbers of people who were brought out of Markaz to find out if they roamed in the area around Markaz. The areas they went out to, will be sealed & monitored: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal https://t.co/qPph2QTxIU“Tracing is being done well in Delhi. We have also started taking the help of Police. We have given them the phone numbers of 27,702 people to find out if the people, under self-quarantine, are indeed staying at homes,” Delhi CM said.Kejriwal talked at length about the treatment plan for coronavirus patients in the national capital. He said that critical patients with pre-existing ailments like diabetes, cancer, et cetera, will be admitted to hospitals whereas others can be isolated at hotels and dharamshalas.  Patients with heart&liver ailments,cancer,diabetes&above 50 yrs of age will be kept in hospitals. Patients below 50 years&with minor symptoms will be kept in hotels and dharamshalas with all medical facilities. Arrangement of 8000 beds will be made for serious patients: Delhi CM pic.twitter.com/73aQvBvFAjHe said that the government will require an estimated 400 ventilators, 1200 beds equipped with oxygen if there are 30,000 patients in Delhi.  In this manner, if there are 30,000 active cases in Delhi we will have arrangements for them. The hospitals have been identified. 12,000 rooms in hotels will also be taken over in phases if the needs arise: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal https://t.co/VuXk0CmIcMThe Chief Minister emphasised the need for teamwork and active tracking and monitoring of the Covid-19 situation to be able to effectively tackle the crisis.

Austerity measures which can be used to divert much-needed funds to the fight against Covid-19 are the need of the hour. In this spirit, I am writing to offer five concrete suggestions. I am certain you will find value in them,” she said.Gandhi demanded a complete ban on media advertisements --- television, print and online --- by the government and public sectors undertakings (PSUs) for a period of two years, with the exceptions being advisories for Covid-19 or issues relating to public health.“Given that the central government currently spends an average of Rs 1,250 crore per year on media advertisements (not including an equal or greater amount spent by PSUs and government companies), this will free up a substantial amount to alleviate the economic and social impacts of Covid-19,” she added.The Congress chief also sought immediate suspension of the Central Vista project. “At a time like this, such an outlay seems self-indulgent to say the least. I am certain that Parliament can function comfortably within the existing historical buildings. There is no urgent or pressing requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained. This sum could instead be allocated towards constructing new hospital infrastructure and diagnostics along with equipping our frontline workers with personal protection equipment (PPE) and better facilities.”In her third suggestion, Gandhi sought a proportionate reduction of 30% in the expenditure budget (other than salaries, pensions and central sector schemes) for the central government as well.“This 30% (Rs 2.5 lakh crore per year approximately) can then be allocated towards establishing an economic safety net for migrant workers, labourers, farmers, MSMEs and those in the unorganised sector,” she added. The Congress president also urged Modi to put on hold all foreign visits, including that of the President, the Prime Minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, state ministers and bureaucrats. “Exceptions can be made in case of special emergency or exigencies in national interest to be cleared by the PM. This amount (which is around Rs 393 crore for just the Prime Minister and Union cabinet’s trips in the last five years) can be utilised extensively in measures to combat Covid-19.”In her fifth suggestion, Gandhi demanded transfer of all money under PM-CARES fund to the PM-NRF. “This will ensure efficiency, transparency, accountability and audit in the manner in which these funds are allocated and spent. It seems like a waste of effort and resources to have and create two separate silos for the distribution of funds. I understand that Rs 3800 crore approximately are lying unutilised in the PM-NRF (at the end of FY2019). These funds, plus the amount in ‘PM-Cares’, can be utilised to ensure an immediate food security net for those at the very margins of society,” she said.Gandhi further wrote, “Every single Indian has made great personal sacrifices to fight this disease. They have complied with every suggestion, instruction and decision taken by your office and the Central Government. It is time that the Legislature and the Executive reciprocate this trust and good faith. Please be assured that you have our unwavering support in meeting the grave challenge of Covid-19 facing the country.”This is Gandhi’s fifth letter to the Prime Minister since March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-welcomes-salary-cut-of-mps-lists-5-tips-to-fight-covid-19/story-cJxAafRmuzrFziCzW84wvM.html
07-04-2020||India||In 5-point letter, Sonia Gandhi asks PM Modi to go into austerity mode||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, offering five suggestions to tackle coronavirus disease Covid-19.She also asked the Prime Minister to suspend Rs 20,000 crore central vista beautification and construction project forthwith. “Austerity measures which can be used to divert much needed funds to fight against Covid-19 are need of the hour,” the Congress president has said in her letter.She further said that the suggestions are in response to her discussion with the Prime Minister over phone. “In your call yesterday, you very kindly asked me to convey to you any suggestions our party has to meet the grave challenge of Covid-19. It is in this spirit that I write to you.”Among the suggestions, Gandhi has sought complete ban on government advertisements given to the media - TV, print and online - for two years.I am certain that you will find value in these suggestions, Gandhi further wrote in her letter.This comes a day after the Union Cabinet decided to cut the salaries of the Prime Minister, other ministers, and parliamentarians by 30 per cent for a year, and to suspend for two years, a scheme under which parliamentarians get Rs 5 crore a year to spend on developmental work (MPLAD scheme), with all the money saved going into the consolidated fund of India to be used to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.That’s expected to work out to approximately Rs 7930 crore. Of this, a total of close to Rs 29 crore will come from the salaries of MPs.In addition, the President, the Vice President and the governors of states have also decided to take salary cuts.A Member of Parliament is paid a salary of Rs 1,00,000 plus allowances. A member of Parliament would contribute Rs 30,000 per month and Rs 3,60,000 in the year.The salary of the prime minister of India is the same as other MPs. The President of India is paid a salary of Rs five lakh per month while the Vice President is paid Rs four lakh per month. The president, vice president and governors have also volunteered to take a 30% cut. The governors are paid Rs three lakh and fifty thousand each.The Consolidated Fund of India is the fund into which all tax revenues flow, and the one used to make most payments.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had chaired the cabinet meeting and then a meeting of his council of ministers. Both were conducted over video conference.PM Modi had on Sunday reached out to two former presidents and two former prime ministers of India to discuss country’s response to the unprecedented crisis over coronavirus outbreak. The prime minister is also said to have called up Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Odisha chief minister and BJD supremo Naveen Patnaik, Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, DMK chief MK Stalin and Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh Badal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-sends-5-suggestions-to-pm-modi-to-fight-covid-19-pandemic/story-qoJWiZPeFh95FFNaHmkM1O.html

Experts suggest limited community spread has begun in the area, after reports that in many of these cases the source of the patient’s infection is unclear.Officials have declared these four places as containment areas. Each of them has a focal patient (the person who might have infected others). Three of these containment areas were declared on Monday – two separate blocks of GTB Enclave and one in Dilshad Colony. Officials have been unable to establish travel or contact history of the focal patients in these areas.The developments come amid a debate on whether India has entered the community transmission stage of the pandemic, in which the source of a patient’s infection could not be traced or isolated.“One of the blocks (in GTB Enclave) is linked to a nurse from Delhi State Cancer Institute who tested positive and the other is linked to an old man. We are not sure where he got the infection from,” a senior Delhi government official said, requesting anonymity.On Monday, 10 nurses from the Delhi State Cancer Institute in GTB enclave tested positive for Covid-19, taking the hospital’s tally to 18 (of which two are doctors and 16 nursing staff). After this, the cancer institute decided to test all 48 of its patients.Also read | Covid-19 lockdown could be extended by 2 weeks, say officials after GoM meet“We have sent all samples for Covid-19 testing. If they test negative, patients will be moved to various private hospitals. However, if they test positive, they will be taken to the nearby Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital, which is a dedicated Covid-19 centre,” said an official from the Delhi State Cancer Institute.Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital is one of the two Delhi government hospitals completely dedicated for treatment of the deadly infection caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus. At present, there are 85 Covid-19 positive and 164 suspected patients admitted to the hospital.Separately, in the Dilshad Colony containment area, a middle-aged man (the focal patient) with unclear history (meaning no foreign travel or no established contact with a Covid-19 positive case) tested positive for Covid-19.The fourth containment area is linked to two mohalla clinic doctors who practise in Dilshad Garden. (So far, 34 health care workers and hospital sanitation staff have tested positive for the viral infection across Delhi).The J and K blocks of Dilshad Garden were declared containment areas after a 38-year-old woman (the focal patient), who returned from Saudi Arabia on March 10, passed on the infection to at least 11 people, including the two mohalla clinic doctors. Six of them are from the Dilshad Garden area. In the same cluster, officials were not able to establish the source of infection of a patient in Maujpur. This patient did not have any direct contact with the woman who returned from Saudi or the two doctors.“In hot spots, some community spread may be occurring,” said Randeep Guleria, director, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and a member of the national task force on Covid-19.Also read | In PM Modi’s hydroxychloroquine export order, a Covid-19 message to the worldAlthough a Union health ministry document late last month said limited community transmission of the Covid-19 disease has begun in India, authorities maintain that the country is not witnessing large-scale community spread.Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said community transmission was happening in the Dilshad Garden containment areas.“Now, we should not focus so much on getting the history of the patient and figuring out where they might have got the infection from…We must focus on keeping people out of hospitals. And, to slow the community spread, everyone must wear masks,” he said.There are four main stages of disease outbreak. Stage I is usually when cases are imported and are not of local origin. Stage II is when there is local transmission, which means a section of people testing positive have come in contact with a positive patient having a travel history. Stage III is community transmission. Stage IV is an epidemic, when there several clusters of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alarm-bells-in-dilshad-garden-as-experts-suggest-limited-community-spread/story-2ajevUUPWijDEk1xU3KzGL.html

May I please humbly request that you give the family privacy as we wait for her to come home today. Please remember this isn’t a release & the house has been declared as a subsidiary jail,” she said.While two other former chief ministers and National Conference leaders, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, were released earlier, Mufti continues to remain under detention.“@MehboobaMufti must be set free.

07-04-2020||India||WhatsApp to impose new limit on forwarding to fight fake news||WhatsApp, the American freeware, cross-platform messaging and voice over internet protocol (VoIP) owned by Facebook, announced on Tuesday that it would limit forwards of frequently-forwarded messages to just one chat to stop the spread of misinformation about coronavirus disease (Covid-19).WhatsApp issued a statement, where it said that the new feature would be rolled out from Tuesday. “We wanted to highlight a feature change that WhatsApp is rolling out today to slow the spread of misinformation. Today we are announcing a new limit so frequently-forwarded messages can only be forwarded to one chat at a time. This limit kicks in once a message has been previously forwarded five times or more,” the statement said. Messages that have been forwarded five times are known as frequently-forwarded messages and are marked by two arrows on top. WhatsApp introduced the distinction in January 2019 to impede the virality of messages. The limit will be a global one and will be led with curbs in India. WhatsApp said that the move was aimed at the spread of misinformation about Covid-19. “This is the latest limit that WhatsApp has set, making us one of the few products that have taken steps to constrain virality and place limits on how people can send messages,” the statement added. WhatsApp is also beta-testing a new feature wherein a magnifying glass icon is displayed next to frequently-forwarded messages to allow users to find out more information about them. The feature, WhatsApp said, gives users the option to send the message to a web search leading them to news results or other sources of information. “Double-checking these messages before forwarding may help reduce the spread of rumours. This feature is currently in testing and we’ll keep you updated on the next steps,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-to-impose-new-limit-on-forwarding-to-fight-fake-news/story-aSPHQVS4e3oYdpMRjml9gO.html

Around 7,000 enumerators will be involved in surveying people across the state for flu-like symptoms and travel histories, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant announced. The data from the survey, which will be held across three days between April 13 and 15, will then be processed by the Goa health department and accordingly, persons who display flu-like symptoms or those with travel history will be tested for coronavirus and isolated, if necessary. Government employees including health staff, government and aided school teachers will pan out across the state in pairs with a questionnaire that families will be expected to fill. “We are launching a community survey in the whole state. They have been given a format, travel history details, flu symptoms or any other signs symptoms,” Sawant said on Monday, calling on residents to cooperate with the enumerators and give the right information regarding their travel history. The survey is expected to cover everyone, including those living in makeshift camps along the construction sites, beach shack workers, those within industrial estates among others who are not usually covered. The survey is being done as part of a move to lift the lockdown in the week following April 14 when the 21 day period ends. Those who display symptoms or those who have travel history will be subjected to a rapid antibody test which, if positive, will be tested using the more detailed PT-PCR test for the Covid-19. Goa has registered seven persons who tested positive for coronavirus, six of them have travel history but entered the state before the lockdown began. The seventh patient contracted it from his brother who had a travel history. With the state’s borders sealed, the government hopes no new additional patients will be found over the coming eight days. The Goa government also announced a 20% hike in wages for frontline workers at the coronavirus hospital including the sweepers and security guards. The government will also separately lodge those working at the Goa Medical College and Hospital in hotels so that they do not risk infecting their families if they happen to contract the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-to-begin-3-day-community-survey-to-identify-potential-covid-19-patients/story-ywPM45IW7jjahQyRvf2xFO.html

Each quarantined person has been asked to upload a selfie on the app on an hourly basis. The surveillance mechanism ensures that the person’s location can be traced, as the app sends out an alert to a local police station if s/he moves out of the stipulated limit of 200 metres from h/his home.The state government has issued a press release, which stated that about 7,000 people are under home quarantine in Janjgir-Champa district. Many of these people have recently returned from abroad or from other Covid-19 affected states in the country.“A special team has developed a new mobile application. If the home-quarantined people turn off their phone or location or internet connection, the app sends out an alert to a local police station,” the release said.Police personnel and medical teams have been trained to use the app to track suspected Covid-19 patients.“We are planning to extend the use of this mobile application to other districts in Bilaspur range,” Dipanshu Kabra, inspector-general of police, Bilaspur range, told Hindustan Times.“We want to respect the privacy of the people who are quarantined at home.

The FIRs (First Information Reports) have been filed under the penal code and the Epidemic Diseases Act that was invoked last month by the city government.They had been evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti, which has emerged as the largest hot spot of Covid-19 in Delhi and across the country.Nearly 30% of the 3,900 Covid-19 infections across the country have been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi last month that was attended by thousands of its members. After a massive operation to trace the Jamaat workers across the country, the government has placed 21,200 people and their contacts under quarantine.National Security Adviser Ajit Doval had to intervene last month after the Tablighi leadership refused to let the authorities vacate the headquarters. Of the 2,000-odd people who had been put up in the Tablighi headquarters called the Markaz, 24 had already tested positive by then and 200 more showed symptoms. They were all sent to hospitals or quarantine centres across the city, depending on their condition.By Monday evening, 329 of them had already tested positive. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told reporters that 62% of the 525 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Delhi were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat. Not everyone has been tested yet.Government officials told Hindustan Times that the task to track down possible contacts of the Jamaat members had become a lot more tedious after it emerged that some Jamaat members from outside Delhi were accompanied by women when they came to the city who stayed with their relatives in Delhi. “This means there is a possibility that the Jamaat infection may not be limited to the workers and their immediate family but may have spread to some pockets in Delhi,” a senior government official said.In Delhi, the official said, the confidence of the government that it had been able to isolate all Jamaat members and their contacts would be critical to the decision on the lockdown in Delhi on April 15.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the 21-day lockdown on March 24 in a televised address to the nation. After PM Modi last week told states to start discussions on how the lockdown should be eased, some states such as Maharashtra and Telangana have called for its extension.

Besides, what’s working and what’s not as far as the treatment is concerned,” said a senior scientist at the ICMR.Available data have shown that around 80% Covid-19 positive cases will develop mild symptoms, 15% severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation such as difficulty in breathing, and 5% critical enough needing oxygen or ventilator support.“There is a lot we know so far and a lot more that needs to be known further. The research will keep on evolving. We will get to know new things about the virus and disease pattern with every new research coming out on Covid-19. It’s an ongoing process,” the scientist said. However, registering for the collaborative does not mean a hospital or a laboratory is exempt from providing other patients’ details to the authorities.“It is over and above the usual testing and disease management protocol that need to be followed while dealing with Covid-19 suspected or positive cases,” he added. Hospitals should continue to independently report the data to central and state health authorities in line with the existing guidelines, including local integrated disease surveillance programme units on a real-time basis, the ICMR statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-form-clinical-research-collaborative-on-covid-19/story-qKrd84vPkPUYbk7fqMmB6M.html

But to detect such transmission and the risk of future pandemics, a lot of resources need to be invested in surveillance of animals as well to understand how Covid-19 is impacting them. Uma Ramakrishnan, associate professor, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, and senior fellow, Wellcome Trust, underlined the need to study possible reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.Q. Is there a chance that the virus will find a new animal reservoir outside China?A. It’s possible, but overall, humans are the most numerous species on earth and currently, the virus is infecting them.Q. How can scientists track animal reservoirs?A. This is a great question! We could. First, conduct a survey among asymptomatic wildlife/possible reservoirs and look for Covid-19 sequences. We would do this most likely in bats because they carry a high burden of viruses. We could also look for situations where bats are in contact with humans such as the bat harvest we have studied in Nagaland. Second, test animals that show symptoms in zoos or the wild. Regardless, what we will need to do is lots of surveillance! This will require lots of fieldwork and sampling, as well as detailed molecular characterisation and testing, and also genome sequencing to better understand the transmission dynamics (where is spillover happening, from which species to which species). This is an exciting field but poorly represented in India. Almost no such work exists. Q. What does the tiger testing positive in Bronx Zoo tell us about the susceptibility of wildlife to the virus?A. Not too much, just that tigers can get infected naturally.The papers that have been published already told us this, but in that case, the cats were infected on purpose. Here, the tiger contracted it possibly from an asymptomatic carrier. What we do not know is how are tigers affected in general. Is there mortality? And, at what rate?Q. What does this mean for wildlife?A. In zoos, contact between humans and captive animals is high. Is this the case at all in the wild? It might be that the chances of transmission are much lower for wild animals (while could be a chain: humans to macaques to tigers, for example), and does this happen? These are all questions that would need to be addressed from both a basic and applied perspective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surveillance-of-wildlife-for-sars-cov-2-reservoirs-could-give-important-clues-scientist/story-WOAO9Ya6aiEAVsu74aOHuK.html

President, VP, and Governors also take 30% pay cut for a year,” he tweeted.On March 31, Banerjee had, however, tweeted that she doesn’t take any salary as the Bengal CM or as a lawmaker. “I do not take any salary as an MLA or a Chief Minister and I have also foregone my MP Pension despite being a seven-time Member of Parliament. I come from limited means. My primary source of income is from my creative pursuits, the royalties I generate from my music and books,” Banerjee tweeted last week.On April 2, the Bengal government had announced austerity measures under which no new scheme will be taken up and all construction works will stop except urgent repairs and maintenance for which approval has to be taken from the finance department. The drive has been initiated because of the massive unexpected expenditure to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak across the cash-strapped state.Dhankhar, whose acrimonious relation with the state government has been in news for months, had earlier contributed Rs 10 lakh to the chief minister’s emergency relief fund and Rs 5 lakh to the Prime Minister’s relief fund.Banerjee has also donated Rs 5 lakh each to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund and the state Emergency Relief Fund to help combat the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-guv-appeals-to-mamata-banerjee-to-take-pay-cut/story-a0svT2yBAP2PUKdqFpIOOK.html

A handkerchief or any other piece of cloth in at least two layers can also be used for the purpose,” said a government order that will come into effect from 7 am on April 9 and will remain in force till further orders.“Disposable/single use masks should be properly disposed of by following due procedure prescribed by Health and Family Welfare Department. Cloth masks should be cleaned with soap/detergent/disinfectant and water and sun-dried for at least 5 hours after every single use. Masks used by one person must not be used by any other person,” the order said.Wearing surgical masks in public spaces may help limit the transmission of viruses, including the one that causes coronavirus disease or Covid-19, a new study published in the the journal Nature Medicine on Saturday had said.The study was published days after a high-level US scientific panel said the Sars-Cov-2 virus that caused Covid-19 is airborne and can be spread through speech or breathing – contradicting previously held belief that it spreads largely through close contact.Earlier, the district administration of Ganjam had made it compulsory for all to wear masks while stepping out.

I would be surprised if he would you know because India does very well with the US.”Trump also reiterated his long-standing grievances on trade issues with India, saying: “For many years they’ve been taking advantage of the US on trade. So I would be surprised if that was the decision. He’d have to tell me that.”Brazilian President Bolsonaro, facing tremendous pressure at home for his handling of the Covid-19 crisis, too, said he had sought supplies of hydroxychloroquine from India. “I asked the PM of India for his support in continuing the supply of pharmaceutical inputs for the production of hydroxychloroquine. We will spare no effort to save lives,” he tweeted.The people cited above said more than 20 countries from around the world have sought supplies of hydroxychloroquine from India. The new partial easing of the ban will offer a way out in coping with this situation, but only after ensuring there are adequate supplies to meet domestic needs, the people said.External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava said the Indian government’s first obligation was ensuring “adequate stocks of medicines for the requirement of our own people”. Temporary steps were taken to restrict exports of a number of pharmaceutical products and a comprehensive assessment was made of possible requirements under different scenarios, he said.“After having confirmed the availability of medicines for all possible contingencies currently envisaged, these restrictions have been largely lifted. The DGFT has notified lifting restrictions on 14 drugs [on Monday],” Srivastava said.In view of the enormity of the Covid-19 pandemic, India has maintained the world community “must display strong solidarity and cooperation” and this approach has guided New Delhi’s evacuation of nationals of other countries, he said.The Indian Council of Medical Research has said: “Hydroxychloroquine is found to be effective against coronavirus in laboratory studies and in-vivo studies. Its use in prophylaxis is derived from available evidence of benefit as treatment and supported by pre-clinical data.” India’s National Taskforce for Covid-19 has recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for infections among “asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19” and “asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-india-lifts-restrictions-on-24-drug-exports-amid-coronavirus/story-UN7jWbEu8Myjr9MjAxLO2N.html

07-04-2020||India||Amid lockdown, Shimla gets respite from monkey menace||Since the 21-day national lockdown started on March 25 to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), there have been reports from different parts of the country of a rise in animal sightings -- leopards, deer, elephants -- in big cities (a trend similar to several other countries where lockdowns were imposed).Shimla, however, has a different story to tell. Twelve days into the curbs, about 1,900 simians who have made the Himachal Pradesh capital their home -- often to the chagrin of officials, residents, and tourists -- are conspicuous by their absence.According to experts and the local administration, few people on the streets has led to the lack of food, prompting many of these simians to either move to nearby forests, or to villages on the periphery of the city. Most langurs have headed into the forest in search of food, while several rhesus monkeys have chosen to head to villages on Shimla’s outskirts. These simians are largely herbivorous in the city, living off gifted food and leftovers, but become omnivores when in the forest, feeding on rats and insects. “This is a temporary phase. they will be back once the bustle of the town returns. Over the years, the monkeys developed commensal habits by feeding on garbage, food waste on the streets, or by raiding homes,” said Rajesh Sharma, Shimla’s divisional forest officer, wildlife. Commensalism, which results from long-term biological interaction, is where members of one species gain benefits while those of the other species are neither benefited nor harmed.The most striking fallout of Shimla’s missing monkeys is on the Hanuman temple in Jakhu Hills that was overrun with simians The temple’s priest who performs rituals in the absence of devotees these days, says he has not come across the sight he’s seeing these days in his four decades at the temple. “At any given time, about 500 monkeys would roam in and around the Jakhu temple, but now they have simply vanished,” says Anil Thakur, a local who lives near the temple and runs a travel business..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-shimla-gets-respite-from-monkey-menace/story-gHcLt3EnxcshwJhobqaF3O.html
07-04-2020||India||Directorate of health dept found to be Bhopal’s biggest hot spot||The biggest hot spot of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the capital of Madhya Pradesh has been found nowhere else but at the directorate of the state health department, which is tasked with controlling and containing the disease across the state. Four more employees from the directorate tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, said officials, adding to the 15 officials from the facility, including two IAS officers, who had tested positive over the past few days. Among those infected include principal secretary, health services, director, National Health Mission, two additional directors, a joint director, and four deputy directors.The test reports of several other people at the centre are still awaited, amid allegations -- yet unsubstantiated -- at the centre that some of those infected hid their symptoms, leading to the spread.As a result of the outbreak in state’s anti-Covid headquarters, about 150 employees in the directorate are now in self-quarantine, said three officials aware of the matter who asked not to be named. The control room in the directorate is almost dysfunctional, one of the officials said.“At this time, certain Apps have been handy for us. We interact with each other through video conferencing with the help the apps and monitor the situation in the entire state. Those who have been found positive are also trying to contribute to managing the administrative affairs,” said a second official from the facility.A third official said that work was continuing. “The only problem is the lack of effective communication. A new person who takes over will take some time to understand the situation. All the government of India advisory first comes to the directorate and then its is communicated to the district and block level,” the third official added.At the same time, however, allegations were flying through the state administration about whether the outbreak could have been contained.According to a leader of the Health department’s employees’ association, the sons of at least two senior officials had concealed that they recently travelled to the US, which is now the country worst affected by Covid-19. “The officials continued to visit the secretariat and the directorate and also attend meetings with other top and junior officials. They were seen suffering from cold and cough,” he said, asking not to be named.Another employee at the centre said that since some of the officials who went to Indore several times on procurement trips should have stayed in home quarantine rather than coming to the directorate building. Indore is a certified Covid-19 hot spot that accounts for 151of the 256 cases reported in the state till Monday evening.In light of these charges, the state administration issued a statement on Sunday night, saying that all precautions were taken and there was no oversight. “In none of the advisories issued by the central government there was any advisory against travel to the US. The principal secretary’s son returned on March 16 and his medical examination was conducted at the international airport at New Delhi. He remained in self-quarantine till March 30, and doesn’t have any symptoms. On the principal secretary testing positive on April 4, the samples of other family members were sent for a test and no one were found having symptom of coronavirus,” the statement issued by the department of public relations of MP government said.When contacted, additional director, health, Sapna Lovanshi said: “All the department officials and employees are discharging their duties with dedication while following the norms of social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/directorate-of-health-dept-found-to-be-bhopal-s-biggest-hot-spot/story-i6idIWWeGsNjY5rg5pZ5EM.html
07-04-2020||India||At least 30% of total Covid-19 cases in country tied to Jamaat event||At least 1,445 of 4,780 Covid-19 cases in India are linked to a congregation held last month in Delhi at Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters that has since emerged as a hot spot of the disease, the Union health ministry said on Monday as state governments continued to warn of strict action against those who attended the gathering but have failed to report for testing.Officials in states like Odisha and Madhya Pradesh said a few attendees have turned out to be super-spreaders of the disease. A person, who attended a congregation in Bhopal where certain attendees of the Jamaat congregation in Delhi were also present, spread the virus to 18 members of his family and turned a housing society in Bhuvaneshwar into a Covid-19 hotspot, according to an Odisha health official.A person, who attended the Jamaat event in Delhi, is believed to have spread the disease to another 16, who attended the Bhopal congregation, including the Covid-19 positive person from Bhuvaneshwar, according to an official of the Bhopal district administration. Three people linked to the Jamaat have been identified in Uttarkhand for having spread the disease to another 28 in the state. “All [28] persons tested positive for Covid-19 did not attend the Nizamuddin [Delhi] congregation [of Jamaat]. Many of them got the virus from the attendees,” said a Uttarakhand health department official, who did not wish to be named. As on Monday, 708 people in the state have been found to have been linked to the Delhi congregation. The Union home ministry said at least 25,500 Jamaat followers and people who came into their contact have been quarantined across India. “In Haryana, five villages have been sealed after it was found that some foreign nationals linked to the Jamaat had stayed in those villages,” said Union home ministry joint secretary Punya Salila Srivastava.Tamil Nadu recorded 50 fresh positive cases on Monday. They include 48 people, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi last month, state health secretary Beela Rajesh said. A total of 621 people in the state have tested positive for Covid-19 while four have died.The Assam government on Monday warned Jamaat followers to report to authorities or face legal action. Health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said action will be taken under the Disaster Management Act, which provides for up to two years in prison. Except for one, all other 25 Covid-19 positive cases detected in the state are linked to the Jamaat congregation in Delhi.“After receiving data from different sources, we had to trace 617 persons from Assam who attended the [Delhi] event and had since returned to the state. We have been able to collect samples from 491 of them while 128 are yet to be located,” Sarma said.Of the 278 Covid-19 positive cases in Uttar Pradesh, 138 are linked to the Delhi event, said additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi. He added police have identified 1,499 Jamaat members and quarantined 1,205 of them. Awasthi said their samples were being sent for tests.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Covid-19 cases in the national capital had reached 523. They include 330 linked to Jamaat.The Gujarat police on Monday said they have so far identified and traced 126 people from the state, who had attended the Delhi congregation of the Jamaat. Around 12 of them have tested positive. Gujarat has so far reported more than 140 Covid-19 cases and 12 deaths.A case was registered against 16 people, including seven minors, associated with Tablighi Jamaat in Chhattisgarh’s Korba district on Monday for allegedly hiding their travel history and resisting medical screening, police said. A 16-year-old boy, who tested positive for Covid-19 on April 4 and is admitted to a hospital in Raipur, is among them, they said. Authorities at the Narela Quarantine Facility in New Delhi have approached the police against some Tablighi Jamaat attendees for allegedly misbehaving with sanitation and health Staff. As per the complaint, two persons allegedly defecated in the corridor area of the facility.Meanwhile, an FIR has also been registered against some of the attendees admitted to the LNJP Hospital in Delhi for allegedly spitting towards the Operation Theatre. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on Monday in an attack on the Tablighi Jamaat said the organisers should have been “sensible” and called off the congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin.Addressing the media via video-conferencing, joint general secretary of the RSS Manmohan Vaidya said: “The spread of the virus has definitely increased because of the event Tablighi Jamaat organised in the capital… If their leadership would have taken a decision and cancelled it on time it would have been good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-30-of-total-covid-19-cases-in-country-tied-to-jamaat-event/story-OyDtc8YqvixYLQTdFifRBM.html

07-04-2020||India||Govt keeps watch on onion prices after Lasalgaon shuts operations||The consumer affairs ministry is monitoring prices of essential commodities, including that of onion, after a coronavirus positive case in Maharashtra’s Nashik led to a shutdown of Lasalgaon, Asia’s largest onion trading hub. A Covid-19 positive case came to light in Nashik on March 30, forcing suspension of operations in Lasalgaon, which subsequently affected the supplies. However, an official of the market said the operations in most onion markets in Nashik will resume on Tuesday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“We, at Lasalgaon, have decided to resume trading on Tuesday (April 7). The district collector ordered the shutdown because the corona positive patient was a major bakery supplier who regularly supplied pav (Indian bread) to the entire area,” Narendra Wadhwane, the secretary of the Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee or APMC, said on Sunday. While markets in Nashik are closed, onion supplies from Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have continued. “Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh account for over nearly two-thirds of late kharif onion crop, which is the crop that has hit markets now, said Shirish Jamdade, a horticulture department official in Pune.APMCs are state-regulated bodies that run wholesale markets in the country.According to a government note, state officials have compiled a list of all onion traders and suppliers and shared the list to counterparts in various states to facilitate supplies. The principal secretary of the state agricultural marketing recommended market committees to tell farmers to bring harvest pre-packed in gunny backs to speed up trade. “Since the lockdown, 1,650 truck load of onions have been dispatched by traders of Nashik to various parts of the country, which has helped in maintaining in steady supplies,” the government note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-keeps-watch-on-onion-prices-after-lasalgaon-shuts-operations/story-kVWfeBCD7fINRBWAv4PL4K.html
07-04-2020||India||Courts to conduct hearings through video calls, says SC||The Supreme Court on Monday issued a slew of directions to courts across the country to facilitate hearing of cases through video conferencing, a step which it said was essential to ensure that court premises do not contribute to the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde, said that hearings in congregation must become an exception during the lockdown period and taking steps towards that end is a matter of duty and not an exception.“Until appropriate rules are framed by the high courts, video conferencing shall be mainly employed for hearing arguments whether at the trial stage or at the appellate stage”, the top court ordered in a suo motu (on its own) case registered by it based on a letter written by senior advocate Vikas Singh.Singh, in his letter, had suggested modalities to reduce person to person contact and the gathering of advocates inside the Supreme Court.The bench, which also comprised justices DY Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, said that in view of the unprecedented and extraordinary outbreak of a pandemic, it is necessary for courts to respond to the call for social distancing and ensure that court premises do not contribute to the spread of Covid-19.“The Supreme Court of India and all high courts are authorized to adopt measures required to ensure the robust functioning of the judicial system through the use of video conferencing technologies”, the court stated in its order passed under Article 142 of the Constitution.Article 142 of the Constitution empowers the top court to pass orders to do complete justice in cases before it.The Supreme Court, under complete shutdown due to the outbreak of the pandemic, has been hearing only extremely urgent cases since March 25 via video conferencing without the personal presence of lawyers. Any examples of cases heard? The apex court said on Monday that the high court in each state would be at liberty to work out the modalities for the use of video conferencing after taking into account the peculiarities of the judicial system in the state concerned and the public health situation in that state.The district courts which fall under the administrative supervision of high courts will have to adopt the mode of video conferencing prescribed by the high court in question, the top court ordered.Video conferencing, the court said, should be mainly employed for hearing arguments. When it comes to examination of witnesses and recording of evidence, consent of both parties should be obtained before using video conferencing to do the same.“If it is necessary to record evidence in a court room, the presiding officer shall ensure that appropriate distance is maintained between any two individuals in the court”, the court ordered.The court concerned should also maintain a helpline to ensure that any complaint with regard to the quality or audibility of the feed is communicated during the proceeding or immediately after its conclusion.No such grievance, the court said, will be entertained at a later stage.The court also took into account the concerns of those litigants who do not have the means or access to video conferencing facilities. In such cases, the court will have to notify and make available the facilities for video conferencing for such litigants.“If necessary, in appropriate cases, courts may appoint an amicus-curiae and make video conferencing facilities available to such an advocate,” the apex court added.Further, the presiding officer of a court will have the power to restrict entry of persons into the court room or the points from which the arguments are addressed by the advocates. However, no presiding officer shall prevent the entry of a party to the case unless such party is suffering from any infectious illness.“..where the number of litigants are many the presiding officer shall have the power to restrict the numbers. The presiding officer shall in his discretion adjourn the proceedings where it is not possible to restrict the number,” the court clarified.The top court also asked the Department of Justice and National Informatics Centre (NIC) to take note of the problems which the apex court had faced on April 3, when there was a problem with internet connectivity during the hearing of a case through video conferencing.The Director General of NIC, who was present for the hearing, told the bench that three things are required for video conferencing: good broadband connection; good devices; and observance of social etiquette and conduct of people, where if one person is speaking, others must put their devices on mute.Attorney General KK Venugopal said the NIC must look into the aspect as to which is the most efficient and cheap application that could be used for video conferencing by all lawyers across the country.The apex court adjourned the matter for four weeks stating that the directions issued by it will remain in force until further orders are passed.“This cannot be seen as a temporary issue. Technology is here to stay”, CJI Bobde remarked.[With PTI Inputs]||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courts-to-conduct-hearings-through-video-calls-says-sc/story-89OsWrARmgncVP0MpoqZCJ.html
07-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Dr Anthony Fauci, the United States’s top infectious diseases specialist, said on Sunday that between 25% and 50% of people infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, are asymptomatic – one reason why it makes sense to wear masks. And British PM Boris Johnson was, on Sunday evening, hospitalised (for tests, the announcement said), 10 days after he was found positive, highlighting just how bad the situation in the country is (51,608 cases as of Monday evening, with 5,373 deaths). While the UK gave up on its building “herd immunity” approach early, the hospitalisation of Johnson, a prominent votary of that theory, highlights just how foolish and wrong it was. And Fauci’s comment underlines the imperative of wearing masks – something many experts initially advised against. In hindsight, there’s nothing as dangerous as a little science in dealing with a new virus such as the one that causes Covid-19.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe big focus for India this week will be containment and enhanced testing, at least in the containment zones. Of the 4,780 cases as of Monday, 31% are from top five cities, 41% from the top 10, and 51% from the top 20. Parts of Mumbai and Delhi have been declared containment zones. Also Read: How India performs on 6 steps to flatten coronavirus curveAccording to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), around 500,000 of the 800,000 antibody testing kits it has ordered will arrive by April 8. States have also independently ordered these kits. The plan is to use them to test aggressively in containment zones using the protocol already established by ICMR. In Delhi, a private laboratory also launched drive-through testing . India will need more such – to repeat what is perhaps the most-used line in 20 editions of this column. India needs to test more.Also Read: Coronavirus case count to guide lockdown futureThat will likely turn up more cases, but it will also reduce two key ratios – the proportion of those who test positive to the total number tested, and the fatality rate.The week starting April 8 (when the use of antibody tests is expected to begin) will be critical for India, then; it’s also a week when the Prime Minister and the federal government team overseeing India’s response on the pandemic will have to take a call on the nationwide lockdown which is scheduled to end on April 14. Also Read: Hydroxychloroquine could become bone of contention between Trump and IndiaSome states are already believed to be veering towards an extended lockdown, and the thinking in New Delhi is that there should be one, at least in the clusters and containment zones. But there are other issues to be decided as well. Will interstate movement be allowed freely or will there be restrictions? What of air and rail travel? And what of retail stores and businesses?. The answers to many of these questions will depend, at least to some extent, on the data that emerges from the antibody tests. The decision will also have to factor in the economic impact of the lockdown, not just on people in the so-called unorganised sector and daily wage labourers, but also on businesses, large and small. On Monday, Japan announced an economic stimulus package of $988 billion to support struggling households and businesses . India has announced one, focused on cash transfers and food, aimed at the most vulnerable, but needs to do more to help businesses.On Monday, the number of cases worldwide stood at 1,323,641, with 73,608 deaths, and the number of cases in India 4,780, with 130 deaths. Monday’s fresh cases were similar to the increase in infections reported a day earlier. Meanwhile, work on a vaccine continues apace, both around the world and in India. But the timeline for one remains the same – not before the middle of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-OKtUsIJzzJv2WRgc3eOY8K.html

The Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: “It is with profound sadness that we must inform you that Mr Jitendra Rathod, Associate Specialist in Cardio-thoracic Surgery at the University Hospital of Wales, has passed away”.Indian doctors and nurses are among frontline NHS staff dealing with thousands of patients in hospitals across the UK. Doctors who qualified in India are the second largest group employed in the NHS, after those qualifying in the UK.The board added: “He died early this morning on our General Intensive Care unit after testing positive for Covid-19. Jitu had worked in the Department of Cardio-thoracic Surgery since the mid-1990s and came back to UHW in 2006 after a brief stint abroad”.“He was an incredibly dedicated surgeon who cared deeply for his patients. He was well-liked and greatly respected by one and all. He was a very compassionate and a wonderful human being. His commitment to the specialty was exemplary,” the board said in a tribute.Rathod is survived by his wife and two sons.The number of people dying of coronavirus in the UK rose on Monday to 5,373, most likely including many of Indian origin from the 1.5 million strong Indian community. The NHS does not disclose the ethnicity of the dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-greatly-respected-indian-doctor-dies-in-uk/story-60WkFw4AtzLQDcBqA3DvIJ.html
07-04-2020||India||Just 14 robberies as Delhi’s crime rate dips in lockdown||Delhi Police are in the middle of an extremely rare respite from all kinds of crime starting March 22, when stringent measures were put in place to stave off the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), before a nationwide lockdown took effect three days later. The police maintaining a higher profile outdoors to enforce the lockdown, and fear of the virus, has helped. Not a single case of abduction (of adults) or extortion has been reported since the lockdown. Crimes such as robbery, snatching, kidnapping (of minors) and theft have dropped significantly compared to the situation before the police and the state government enforced the complete lockdown in Delhi on March 22, when the nation observed a “Janta Curfew” on the Prime Minister’s call. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOn March 22, Delhi Police imposed prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, banning the assembly of four or more persons across the city. It was the first time in four decades that prohibitory orders had been issued for the whole capital city. On March 25, the three-week nationwide lockdown kicked in.The city police’s crime data in the three weeks (March 1 to March 21) before the lockdown period and after that(March 22 to March 31), accessed by Hindustan Times, shows that there has been an unprecedened reduction in all types of crime across the city. Sample this – between March 1 and March 21, 63 persons died in road accidents. At least 1,600 road accident deaths are reported each year – an average of around four deaths every day. The number of road accident deaths in Delhi each year is at least three times the level in Mumbai and Bengaluru. But between March 22 and March 31, there were only eight deaths. Public and most private transport vehicles have gone off the roads for the duration of the lockdown, explaining the dip.There is a dip in vehicle thefts too – on an average around 140 vehicles are stolen every day. Between March 1 and 21, 2486 vehicles were reported stolen, but after the prohibitory orders came into force, the vehicle stolen data was 409.There has been a significant drop in kidnappings -- at least 100 abductions are reported every week in Delhi. There were 325 cases in the first three weeks of March but after March 21, the total number of kidnappings reported was 43. While the city reports around 2,000 abduction cases every year, there has not been a single case of abduction since March 22(Between March 1 and 21, there were 29 abduction cases). “The numbers are coming down for the first time in decades. Let me give you an example. Kidnapping cases in Delhi are usually of minor girls who are kidnapped by their friends or neighbours. That also includes many cases of elopement. Now with everyone home and people practising social distancing, kidnapping cases have come down drastically,” a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said .Incidents of snatching, one of the most common crimes in Delhi, has decreased for the first time. There are typically around 150 snatching cases every week – there were 474 cases between March 1 and March 21 -- but after March 22, police have recorded only 49.With traffic thin and the roads empty, some criminals do go about their work. Rakesh Rana, a cinematographer from Kakrola had just stepped out of an ATM kiosk in Outer Delhi after withdrawing money when the city’s infamous bike-borne snatchers struck. “It was dark when I left the ATM. Two men on a motorcycle came out of nowhere and snatched my cell phone. All shops in the area were closed so there were no people around. Those bikers took advantage of the dark and the open road. Before I could react, they were gone. The empty roads helped them flee,” he said. Lawbreakers have also turned to new ways of committing crimes.On Friday, a milkman was arrested in South Avenue for allegedly smuggling liquor inside milk canisters. All liquor shops are closed in Delhi. Borders have also been sealed. Within Delhi, only those supplying essential services and products (milk included) are exempted from prohibitory orders. A police officer who is probing the case said, “The man is a Bulandshahr resident and was smuggling liquor posing as a milkman. He had the milk canisters fitted on his bike. He even managed to cross police barricades without being stopped. He had bought the liquor from Haryana and had planned to sell it in Uttar Pradesh.”Perhaps Delhi’s situation can be best described by a viral photograph on social media, which shows a policeman with a sanitiser bottle placed in his holster instead of a gun.Police say criminals are also wary of Covid-19 and have suddenly gone incognito. Last week, the video of a group of alleged gangster inside Tihar was widely circulated in social media, in which they are heard complaining about cleanliness inside the prison. The prisoners were heard talking about how scared they were of Covid-19. While Delhi’s criminals seem to be homebound in this lockdown period, police personnel across the city are now working to feed the hungry and the homeless. The police helpline – 011 23469526—for Covid-19 requests has received 474 calls from people who said they were starving and had no money.The police control room vans, which are the first respondents to crime, are also doubling up as ambulances. Since March 23, the police vehicles have rushed at least 143 pregnant women to hospital. Additional commissioner of police MS Randhawa, who is the police’s spokesperson, admitted that incidence of crime had come down drastically. The officer said police are focusing on feeding the hungry and transporting people to hospital.“Our officers are on the roads across the city to ensure the lockdown. Crimes have definitely come down. At every police station, our officers are working to feed the hungry citizens. Our officers have tied up with NGOs and Good Samaritans and are feeding the underprivileged every day. We will also ensure that the low crime rate remains the same in the days to come,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-14-robberies-as-delhi-s-crime-rate-dips-in-lockdown/story-Cg0rWWQfknuNc9wG7N14zI.html
07-04-2020||India||Delhi lab starts ‘drive-through’ Covid-19 test||Fill out an online form, drive to the designated collection centre, display your identity proof, roll down your car window, tilt your head back to allow the collection of swab samples from your throat and nose, and leave – a person suspected to have the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can now undergo testing in these simple steps at a private lab’s drive-through centre in west Delhi.The central government has so far allowed about three dozen private lab chains to detect Covid-19 cases, a move experts say is important to ramp up testing to flatten the curve of the disease. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), however, allows only symptomatic people with travel history, health care workers, people with severe respiratory illnesses, and people in direct contact with confirmed cases, to be tested. Those approaching the private facilities need a doctor’s prescription under these guidelines to qualify for testing.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOn Monday, the Punjabi Bagh branch of Dr Dangs Lab -- one of the eight private labs approved in the city -- organised a dummy run of its drive-through facility. Interviews and interactions with suspected cases were not possible in view of privacy and safety concerns.The process of drive-through testing begins at home, where a symptomatic person can use the lab’s website to fill out an online form with personal details, preferred date of sample collection, details of the doctor recommending the test, and clinical symptoms. The person also needs to submit the registration number, make and colour of the car they intend to use.Once the appointment is booked and online payment made, the lab makes a confirmation call and sends an e-mail with the details of the process.The facility is set up along a 100-foot stretch of the street outside the lab located in Punjabi Bagh’s West Central Market. The entry and exit points are controlled by iron chains manned by security guards. Multiple signs are fixed along this stretch to guide the suspected patients through the process.When the car arrived at the centre for the dummy run on Monday, a guard tallied the driver’s identity and registration plate with the form submitted online. The car’s parking lights had to be switched on – these instructions are e-mailed after the booking. While the guard lowered the iron chain to let the car through, a sanitation worker in a coverall sprayed the path with disinfectant. No words were exchanged.The car drove into a 15ft × 6ft rectangular painted patch, while a technician – wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) – approached the driver with a placard that instructed him to lower the window, tilt his head back, and allow the collection of swab samples from his throat and nose. The technician tore out a swab from a packet, collected a sample from the nose for about five seconds, and placed the swab in a cylindrical container. The process was repeated with the throat.The dummy patient rolled up the car’s window, as the guard lowered the iron chain to allow him to drive away. The sample collection process took less than five minutes.Another technician then wrapped the samples with cotton gauze, placed them in a larger cylindrical plastic container, which was stored in a thermocol box padded with ice packs. This process took another five minutes. Not more than two people are allowed to occupy a car at the time of testing. If the car driver is not the patient, he or she must sit on the right side of the rear seat to facilitate the collection of swab samples. Patients receive their results through email and phone within 36 hours. The cost of the test is ~4,500. To be sure, since the collection centre ran a mock collection process, an actual test was not performed for the purpose of this news report.Arjun Dang, chief executive officer of Dr Dangs Lab, said that the drive-through facility was looking at serving 25-35 patients per day, with 20 minutes assigned to each patient. “It will operate from 8.30am to 4.30pm, but we may increase the timing if the demand increases,” he said, adding that about a dozen people had registered for the tests since appointments opened late Sunday afternoon.Zoya Brar, CEO and founder, CORE Diagnostics, a private lab that has ICMR approval, said: “I appreciate that Dr Dangs has replicated what has been done in South Korea and other places to expand testing. On our end, we are focused on providing home collection since that is the lowest exposure for the patient to the outside world. We do this by default for all cases.”While one other private lab chain said they were assessing the process to begin a similar testing procedure, another lab did not comment on the matter. A third lab said it had no immediate plans of starting a drive-through testing facility. Public health experts say that wide and aggressive testing along with social distancing is the only way to control the outbreak of the new disease. A massive testing effort, largely by drive-through centres, has been touted as a major reason why South Korea has been able to slow the spread of the highly contagious disease, which has killed at least 71,000 people worldwide. At one point in March, South Korea had the second largest outbreak after China, but the country has since managed to flatten the curve of the infections. After an initial delay, the US has also begun wide drive-through testing to control the pathogen that has infected over 330,000 people in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-lab-starts-drive-through-covid-19-test/story-IbIzEEExFdvqxKWbaKYYrI.html

This is where he receives calls from those seeking medical advice or examines patients. In between, the president of the BJP’s Bihar unit also fields calls from party workers and bosses in Delhi.Jaiswal says it has helped that the government permitted doctors to advise patients on the phone.“Earlier, there was no permission for doctors to conduct consultations through tele-medicine, but now conditions have been relaxed by the MCI and we can at least see our patients online or speak to them on the phone,” the Lok Sabha member from Bihar’s West Champaran constituency said.Jaiswal said he volunteered to be deployed for coronavirus patients at his hospital that has set up a 140-bed isolation ward.“We have requisitioned PPEs (personal protection equipment) and cardiac monitors; since there is a shortage all across,” he said.Another doctor turned MP, Anil Jain, who is also the BJP general secretary has been monitoring the situation on the ground in Haryana and Chandigarh. A consultant surgeon with the Apollo Group, Jain has not been practising medicine after taking oath as an MP.But in view of the pandemic, the Rajya Sabha MP said he does have people reaching out to him for advice.“I hear their concerns and tell them what to watch out for and when to rush to the emergency,” said Jain, underscoring that he hadn’t restarted practising medicine.Jain says he is focussed on logistics on the ground to ensure hospitals have supplies and patients are being looked after. “We are making sure that patients who need dialysis, for instance, are being looked after. While the pandemic has affected regular services, we are ensuring that treatment is not stalled,” Jain said.Former minister and Gautam Buddh Nagar MP Mahesh Sharma has also been focussing on the hospital chain that he runs near Delhi. An aide of the BJP said he was examining patients as well.In Bhutan also, Prime Minister Lotay Tshering is known to practice medicine on weekends, In Ireland Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has re-registered as a medical practitioner and intends to work one shift a week to help out during the coronavirus crisis, his office said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-times-of-covid-10-doctor-turned-politicians-lend-a-hand/story-kLj8CCuNM7S71YGOy4ZCOK.html
07-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: A long war ahead but we’ll win it, says PM Modi||Categorically stating that the battle against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic will be “long”, and akin to a war situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that India has been proactive and “comprehensive” in its approach to fighting the outbreak, even as he encouraged citizens to take a series of measures to secure themselves and help the vulnerable.In an address to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) workers on the 40th foundation day of the party, the PM made five specific appeals to the cadre — to provide rations to the poor; wear and distribute face covers; organise letters of gratitude to frontline workers; get people to download the government’s Aarogya Setu App, which is both an information and tracking tool; and encourage citizens to donate to the PM-Cares fund. The PM said that India’s efforts to battle the pandemic set an example and was appreciated globally, including by leaders with whom he spoke. “India is among those countries which took the threat of the coronavirus seriously and began a comprehensive battle against it when there was time, even though so little was known about the disease. It took several decisions and we implemented it based on expert advice.” The remarks come in the wake of the Opposition, particularly the Congress, alleging that the government’s response was delayed.Questioning the pace of testing in the country, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted on April 4: “India is simply not testing enough to fight the Covid19 virus. Making people clap & shining torches in the sky isn’t going to solve the problem.”Outlining the measures taken by his government on Monday, Modi said the Centre introduced thermal screening for international passengers, evacuated Indian citizens who were stuck abroad, took the “difficult decision” of stopping all global flights to India, and prepared the medical infrastructure to deal with the pandemic. “The support of state governments has also ensured the effectiveness of these decision,” said the PM. The remark was seen as a signal of political outreach to other parties. The PM has held two video conferences with chief ministers and on Sunday, he called up top Opposition leaders to brief them on efforts being made to battle the outbreak. “India has worked comprehensively and rapidly,” he said on Monday. Modi also praised citizens for their sense of discipline, service and maturity during the ongoing lockdown, and referred to people switching off lights — and lighting candles and lamps — on Sunday night. “We saw the collective power of 1.3 billion people... it has prepared citizens for a long battle. I say this after careful consideration — this is a long battle, we can’t get tired, we can’t get defeated.” There was only one resolve, the PM emphasised — of defeating the pandemic. Turning specifically to the BJP workers, the PM said that he had five specific appeals. One was to provide rations to the needy. “Millions of BJP workers are engaged in providing ration. I want you to make this a major campaign. Bind all social organisations in one framework. And ensure not a single poor person is hungry.” He emphasised that while doing this, workers must cover their faces — and to make it a habit. His second appeal to workers was to produce such face covers and gift them to five to seven people each. The PM’s third appeal to workers was to go to 40 homes in their polling booths, and prepare and get five sets of letters of gratitude. These letters — meant for doctors, nurses and paramedical staff; police personnel; sanitation staff; government staff engaged in essential work; and bank and postal staff personnel — should then be distributed to the concerned individuals for whom it was meant within the area. His fourth appeal to workers was to get 40 people each to install the Aarogya Setu app and fill their details. This would give them relevant health information and also help them keep track of interactions with positive Covid-19 cases, he said. And finally, the PM asked workers to contribute themselves, and get 40 individuals to contribute to the PM-Cares fund. “During wars, women used to give their jewellery; even the poor used to give their meagre savings. Think of this situation as a war. It needs the same spirit of donation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-long-war-ahead-but-we-ll-win-it-says-modi/story-kPVqlMP2uVrxEpCMEC3zhK.html
07-04-2020||India||Coronavirus case count to guide India’s lockdown future||The group of ministers (GoM) headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh will meet in New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss, among other issues, whether the lockdown put in place to combat the spread of Covid-19 should be extended -- in the backdrop of comments from administrators in at least four states that they would recommend prolonging it beyond April 14, when it is scheduled to end. According to at least half-a-dozen ministers and senior bureaucrats Hindustan Times spoke to, the meeting of ministers, which will also be attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, will consider the recommendations of the 11 empowered groups set up to manage various aspects of India’s response to the pandemic. None of the people wished to be identified ahead of a decision which, many of them stressed, could be taken as late as the weekend, and depend on how the numbers stand then. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe 62 districts that account for 80% of all cases, however, will most probably continue to be in lockdown, one of the people said. That includes parts of Delhi and Mumbai, a second person added. Also Read: How India performs on 6 steps to flatten coronavirus curveOne of the big questions before the group will be lives versus livelihoods, according to Niti Aayog member Dr Vinod Paul, who is also the head of one of the 11 empowered groups. “There is no decision yet on how the lockdown will be lifted,’’ he said. “We are assessing the cost of the lockdown economically with the lives that need to be saved.’’But voices in favour of an extension came hard and fast on Monday, from the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, the chief minister of Telangana, and a senior bureaucrat in Punjab. On Friday, a Maharashtra minister too spoke in favour of an extension. Also Read: Hydroxychloroquine could become bone of contention between Trump and IndiaThe ministerial group will have to weigh this against concerns about the economic cost of a lockdown and the impact of a continued lockdown on daily wage workers and the unorganised sector. According to one of the ministers HT spoke to, in all likelihood, units in less populated and relatively remote areas, may be allowed to reopen -- as long as most of their workers lived in and around the unit. “There is also major pressure from foreign companies to start India operations with reduced staff,’’ said a third official. The ministers will also consider a plan on staggered opening of industries from the department of promotion of industry and internal trade, the third official added. This person said that the group is unlikely to spend much time on the status of IT companies, which seem to have made adequate WFH (work from home) provisions. But the group is expected to consider the status of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which are hurting badly, HT has learnt. “There is a wide ranging deliberation and consultation that is on now regarding the model to be followed after 14 April. The empowered groups are deliberating on their domains of focus. The IITs and other institutions of research are examining models too. This perhaps is the best way to bring about the most comprehensive and effective model.” said (retd) Lt Gen Syed Ata Hasnain of the National Disaster Management Authority and a member of one of the empowered groups.A second minister said that there were concerns about the migrant workforce, and how to get them back to work. “One proposal we have is that factory owners sign commitments saying they will maintain social distancing in the workplace and create a safe environment. If they do, then we will allow those factories,” he said, adding that the nearly two million daily wage workers stranded in quarantine centres were also at risk.A lot now depends on how the case numbers stack up in the week ahead. “If they see a sudden hike, then the lockdown will be extended despite the grim economic scenario,’’ said a third minister.“The Prime Minister has asked ministries and departments to prepare their plans. Respective ministries and departments have to prioritise, for example, the agriculture ministry will have to think of how to facilitate farmers in the harvesting season. Procurement will be another focus. But, it is a cautious approach, a graded plan is required. We cannot ignore the fact that the threat of Covid-19 is still there,” a finance ministry official said . A fourth minister pointed out that the Prime Minister will take a final call after also consulting with the states. “Unlike other decisions... this has to be one which involves consensus, he said.Also Read: Covid-19 update: States to get 500,000 rapid antibody test kits this weekSome states seem to be veering towards an extension. Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said India should not lift the nationwide lockdown, “at least not entirely”, until the outbreak is brought further under control. “At least some of the restrictions should stay for a bit more. Otherwise, India will not be able to handle things if the lockdown is hastily lifted,” he said in comments to media.In Uttar Pradesh, too, a top state government official said the lockdown may not be lifted after April 14, when the current three-week restrictions are set to end.“Covid-19 positive cases in the state are increasing daily...The state government wishes to make it clear that lockdown is not likely to be lifted till there is a single coronavirus case in the state. The lifting of the lockdown means UP has become coronavirus-free,” Awanish Kumar Awasthi, additional chief secretary, home, said at a press conference in Lucknow.Punjab, which was the first state to impose a curfew on March 21, is expected to continue with the lockdown in most parts, but issue curfew passes to allow harvesting from April 15. “A final call will be taken on April 12 or 13,” Suresh Kumar, Punjab chief minister’s chief principal secretary, said on Sunday.Last week, a minister in Maharashtra indicated that the government may extend the lockdown by a couple of weeks, especially in Mumbai and other urban areas of the state.“We are expecting a fall in positive Covid-19 cases by April 15. We will have to extend the lockdown period by a few more weeks. Lifting it fully in a city like Mumbai is unlikely,” health minister Rajesh Tope said on Friday.While the airline sector and Indian Railways are getting ready to restart operations, officials in the aviation and rail ministry confirmed that there is no confirmation yet that this will happen on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/case-count-to-guide-lockdown-future/story-2aMDAuae0sDUBqCmUxoUkO.html
07-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Entry of animals and birds in quarantine area can pose risks, says Govt||Entry of animals and birds in a quarantine area can pose a serious risk of infection spread, say the government’s latest guidelines on such facilities where suspected coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients are housed.A separate section on the prevention of the deadly infection in the health ministry document released on Sunday stresses that animals and birds should be prevented from entering a quarantine area, and security personnel should stop any undesired movement, including those by humans. “Separate fence needs to be raised around the building to prevent entry of animals, especially dogs, monkeys and even birds if possible. Well-informed and trained security personnel need to be deployed all around the building on 24*7 rotation basis to monitor the facility and to avoid entry of undesired persons or animals and even birds for eating any food remains or droppings inside the area,” read the document.Concerns have been raised over whether the infection caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted between animals and humans; there are reports of a pet cat in Belgium and two dogs in Hong Kong getting infected. Additionally, in quarantine homes, there is a risk that animals could take contaminated stuff, especially leftover food items, outside the facility and spread the infection.“The guidelines have been drafted as per the best practices followed globally regarding infection control during an outbreak of this nature. As it is an evolving situation, all previously issued guidelines can be modified based on the change in data to meet norms of the current available evidence,” a senior health ministry official said. A team of experts has done a thorough risk assessment with respect to probability of infection from not just movement of people but also animals and birds in the area.It is mandatory to have a special map of the facility prepared to outline the details of movement of health care and other personnel around the quarantine area and in the building so as to reduce the probability of fresh infections, according to the government’s guidelines. “To ensure that all health care personnel use personal protection equipment (PPE) as per guidelines, they need to be properly trained and assisted during wearing of PPE {personal protective equipment}. Separate areas to be earmarked for PPE donning and doffing. Compliance for same should be ensured by a nodal officer,” said the health ministry official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entry-of-animal-and-birds-in-quarantine-area-can-pose-risks-govt/story-SSJZFEp9Clfvc4lIEaepWN.html
07-04-2020||India||After Bronx tiger tests positive, zoos, reserves put on high alert||The environment ministry on Monday advised the chief wildlife wardens of all states to take immediate steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in national parks and tiger reserves, including restricting the movement of people near national parks and sanctuaries.This was in response to the report of a Malayan tiger testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in New York’s Bronx zoo.Is it far-fetched to imagine that wildlife in national parks or outside could be infected with Covid-19? No. In fact, scientists have flagged that information on potential animal hosts of the virus is crucial to deal with the pandemic. This is because the virus could find new hosts, which can infect other animals or lead to the re-emergence of the disease in humans. This kind of possible cross-species transmission of infection can be dangerous, they said.A few reports of pet cats and dogs testing positive have surfaced in the past couple of months from Belgium and Hong Kong but a Malayan tiger testing positive (first infection in a wild animal after outbreak) has got many scientists worried about the potential of new animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, outside China.“Inter species transmission is extremely worrisome, whether it be from pangolins, bats, civets or tigers. Clearly mammals are vulnerable but we don’t know enough at this point. From the science so far, it appears that there are multiple strains evolving and the potential to find new reservoirs exist,” said Krithi Karanth, Chief Conservation Scientist at Centre for Wildlife Studies and Adjunct Associate Professor, Duke University (USA).“Human activities, specifically consumption of wild meat, wildlife trade, habitat change and fragmentation, are leading to increasing contact between people and wildlife. Multiple zoonotic diseases have emerged, resulting in transmissions between wildlife, domestic animals and people. Covid-19 is perhaps the most destructive example,” she added.On Monday, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) also directed states to observe tigers for symptoms like dry cough or laboured breathing through direct observation and camera trapping, careful handling of post mortem of dead tigers in consultation with state veterinary officials and safeguarding of staff with personal protective equipment (PPE), among others. NTCA has asked states to send samples of suspected cases to laboratories approved by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research.The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI) also issued an advisory to all zoos in India, asking them to remain on high alert and monitor animals for any abnormal behaviour. Samples of any suspect animals, if any, have to be sent to animal health institutes to initiate Covid-19 testing, the advisory added. “Sometime in the past at an unknown time the SARS-CoV-2 crossed over to humans through an intermediate host. But we haven’t found that host animal. Cross-species transmissions happen all the time. The case of the tiger getting infected in Bronx tells me a few things. First, that there is a lot of infection in New York. Second, we should study if cross-species transmission is happening. Best would be to sequence the virus in the tiger and the humans working close to the tiger and to see the variables. We must also study the tiger very closely to see how long and how much virus it is shedding, and finally investigate if the human got infected by the tiger or vice versa. A body of knowledge on this is very important at this point,” said a senior virologist, who declined to be named because of government advisories on not commenting on Covid-19.This can be done with more tests in labs and natural conditions, scientists said. “I’m not sure we have enough evidence to say that the Covid-19 virus has several potential animal reservoir hosts based on current spillback (transmission from humans to animals) evidence. We need to do a lot more testing and lab experiments to see if any other species can maintain reservoir host status for this virus. Thus far, all we know is that a few cases of spillback have been observed. What are the consequences of this? Does the animal get sick? Is it able to transmit the virus via the same routes (aerosol or droplets)? These are all questions that need further investigation,” said Abi Tamim Vanak, fellow, Wellcome Trust and senior fellow at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment.“We do not know much about the condition of the animals inside the forests, There is a possibility of tigers contracting the infection. So we have asked field staff to observe the animals very carefully and look for signs of Covid-19 while conducting post mortem,” said AK Nayak, member secretary, NTCA.Several scientific studies in the past have shown how coronaviruses are common among several wild species, including bats, pangolins, racoon dogs, masked palm civet, monkeys and mice. According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 75% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic and that these zoonotic diseases are closely interlinked with the health of ecosystems.While scientists have been stressing on the impact of loss of biodiversity, a new study estimated that there has been a 71.5% reduction in large forest patches (> 10,000 km sq) in Central India and the Western Ghats if the existing size of forest patches are compared to a scenario that excludes land taken up by infrastructural projects. The study, by scientists from the Foundation for Ecological Research, Advocacy and Learning (India), Centre for Wildlife Studies (India), University of Goettingen (Germany) and Columbia University (US), was released on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-bronx-tiger-tests-positive-zoos-reserves-put-on-high-alert/story-GOQ8BCR9q2Jbr5roJoCopL.html
07-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: States to get 500,000 rapid antibody test kits this week||States across the country will soon receive half a million antibody testing kits from the Centre, as India embarks on more aggressive testing in so-called containment zones and clusters. “We have ordered about 500,000 rapid testing kits that we should get by April 8 or 9, and will be deployed in states as per the requirement,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, chief, epidemiology and communicable disease, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).According to an ICMR advisory, rapid testing kits (for antibody tests or blood tests) need to be deployed in areas where mass testing is required, such as evacuation camps, large cluster areas, and camps for migrant workers. But, the kits being provided may not be enough, with state governments estimating that they need at least two million kits to test health workers and others who are at the forefront of the nationwide effort to combat the spread of Covid-19, and also people in clusters and containment zones. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIndia has about 2.2 million health workers, according to Census 2011.To meet the requirement, states have asked the Centre for more and also placed orders with private firms to provide as “many kits as possible” . Some states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana have placed orders with firms in South Korea and Hong Kong for antibody test kits. Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have already started conducting antibody tests using kits procured from private firms and the ICMR. The tests in most states will be free of cost at government run institutions, and nominally priced at private labs, state government officials said. India has used the RT-PCR, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, test on nasal or throat swab samples of suspected patients to test for Covid-19. These tests can take between 12-24 hours to show results. In comparison, the rapid antibody tests identify disease-fighting antibodies in blood samples and can deliver results in 45 minutes to two hours.However, since antibodies are usually detectable only after around 7-10 days of being infected by the virus, such tests could throw up false negatives – an infected person may appear normal in the blood test. And they may also throw up false positives -- people who had the infection, but have since been cured (and who, therefore, possess the antibodies required to be immune). To avoid such false negatives, the ICMR, which is overseeing the country’s testing regime, has asked both government and private laboratories to stick to RT-PCR tests for diagnostic purposes and has allowed antibody tests only in the containment areas and clusters. For now, the ICMR has permitted states to also use the rapid antibody test kit used for tuberculosis patients for Covid-19 patients also. Last week, the health ministry identified 20 Covid-19 containment areas and 22 potential hot spots in the country.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said 100,000 rapid testing kits will be available with the state government by Friday and the mass testing will start. He added that Covid-19 testing has also been ramped up in the state with 500 tests being done every day. “From next week, 1,000 tests will be conducted per day.”Mumbai, another Covid-19 hotspot, is gearing up for conducting mass tests too. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to conduct at least 1,000 rapid tests every day but is handicapped by the unavailability of test kits. A senior health official said: “We have given orders to procure the kits but so far no one has responded. Once we get enough testing kits, we will start mass testing.” TP Lahane, director of Director of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said: “We are working on the policy; then the testing will start.”Uttar Pradesh has placed an order of 500,000 antibody test kits with the ICMR, according to Rukum Kesh, director general of health services. “If required, we will order more,” he said, adding that tests of health workers will be conducted first. On Monday, the number of infections in the state touched 305.According to Dr C N Manjunath, chief nodal officer for the Karnataka government task force to combat Covid-19, the state has placed an order for 1 lakh antibody test kits which it expects to receive on April 12. Manjunath added that another 10,000 kits have been ordered from a Pune based company, Mylabs Discovery Solutions Pvt Ltd, which will deliver them on April 7. “Till then, we have sufficient stock. Till date, we have tested nearly 10,000 people and once the additional kits come we will scale this up rapidly and we will be testing nearly 80,000 people in the next three weeks.”Both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have placed orders for 500,000 kits each. Andhra Pradesh’s special chief secretary (medical and health), KS Jawahar Reddy, said the kits could cost around Rs 20 crore. “We have placed an order with a couple of firms in Hong Kong. We are also trying to tap sources in South Korea and Taiwan. But it will take some time to procure them,” he said. The Goa government has partnered with a private company to get the antibody testing kits and will start the free tests from Tuesday. State Health Minister Vishwajit Rane said the test kits will help roll out mass testing for “Tier-II” suspects -- secondary contacts and those who are home quarantined. However, some states, such as Bihar and Odisha, are still assessing the number of kits needed to roll out rapid tests.“There are chances of false negative in the rapid test. What do you then?” asked Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Sanjay Kumar, adding that Bihar is was waiting for a response from the ICMR on how many kits the state can get. Odisha’s director health Shalini Pandit said it has not been decided whether rapid antibody tests would be done in the state. Madhya Pradesh’s health commissioner, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai, said the state will go ahead with the rapid testing once the kits are procured. The ICMR is also ramping up Covid-19 tests and has increased its testing capacity to 25,000 tests in a day in two shifts, Gangakhedkar said. Close to 200 government and private labs are authorised to conduct the Covid-19 diagnostic test.Union health ministry joint secretary, Lav Agarwal, said that all the states have been asked to form a district-specific containment plant even for districts that have no reported cases so far. “Our strategy is to remain proactive and overprepared to deal with any eventuality.” (With inputs from health bureau and state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-to-get-500-000-rapid-antibody-test-kits-this-week/story-kpWma2HPrKfsxdVf8CFSlK.html
07-04-2020||India||Maharashtra tally 868 with 120 new cases, 34 deaths in Mumbai||Maharashtra recorded 120 more coronavirus (Covid-19) cases on Monday, taking the total number of infected people in the state to 868, with Mumbai’s tally rising by 68 cases to 526. The death toll in the state, too, rose to 52, with seven more Covid-19 related fatalities on Monday. Mumbai alone has recorded 34 deaths.According to the state health department data, around 85% (752) of Covid-19 cases and 92% (48) of the deaths have been reported from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune district. This has led authorities to aggressively pursue cluster containment plans to combat the spread of the virus.The MMR – Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivali, Ulhasnagar, Mira-Bhayander, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, and Vasai-Virar – excluding Mumbai has recorded 85 cases and nine deaths. Pune has reported 141 cases and five deaths.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn Mumbai, where the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has earmarked 226 containment zones, Worli is the worst-hit area. Eleven fresh cases were recorded on Monday in Worli, taking the area’s tally to 68.In Mumbai, a containment zone is categorised when even a single person from any area is tested positive for Covid-19. The patient’s family and the building are identified as a cluster zone and at least four to five adjoining buildings on all sides are mapped in the containment zone, depending on the area’s population density. The greater the population density, the wider the radius of containment zone, a BMC health official said.In Worli Koliwada, after a BMC sweeper tested positive on April 2, civic health staffers have screened more than 50,000 people, said BMC officials. From Monday, the BMC initiated a second survey of all homes in the area, with the help of doctors.“The number of cases in this particular area is increasing. So we have imposed a strict ban on movement. We are rigorously tracking high-risk and low-risk contacts,” said BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi.Civic health officials said a team of four members identified containment zones in the area to conduct door-to-door surveys for suspected patients. Beyond the containment zones, the BMC has surveyed buffer zones, where the virus might have spread. As part of this survey, 320 high-risk contacts have been identified and quarantined at the local Potdar Hospital for 14 days.According to BMC protocol, families and immediate neighbours of positive patients are tested, as they are considered high risk. Other residents in their neighbourhoods are considered low risk and are asked to be under home quarantine. They are also asked to keep a tab on their symptoms. Residents of adjoining buildings in the containment zones are also surveyed. Entry and exit from a containment zone are restricted and severe lockdown protocols are put in place.State health minister Rajesh Tope indicated the state government would have to take additional “precautions” with respect to lifting the lockdown in Mumbai and Pune. He hinted that the lockdown in Maharashtra may not be lifted after April 15 and said that nobody should assume that things would come back to “normal” after that.“There is a protocol to follow on how to lift the lockdown. We have case studies of countries lifting the lockdown. The Centre, too, will send us advisories regarding this. We will study the situation between April 10 and April 15… Nobody should think the lockdown will be lifted completely. We will have to take all precautions. Wherever there are more cases, like in Mumbai and Pune, we will have to take additional precautions. So, nobody should assume things will be back to normal after April 14,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-tally-868-with-120-new-cases-34-deaths-in-mumbai/story-0PXx3eSNDfrlitobDC71EM.html
07-04-2020||India||‘Animal trials for the Covid-19 vaccine will be critical’: Krishna Ella||Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech announced last week that it is working on developing a nasal drop vaccine for Covid-19. Animal testing has begun in the US in collaboration with virologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and vaccine developer FluGen. Bharat Biotech’s chairman and managing director Kishna Ella spoke to Rhythma Kaul about trials for the new vaccine, how the animal testing phase will be crucial, the delivery mechanism, and the challenges that vaccine manufacturers face in India. Edited excerpts:What is this vaccine against Covid-19 that you are developing?We have got a total command over the pandemic vaccines; be it H1N1, Chikungunya, Zika,we have always chipped in when required. Our vaccine CoroFlu will build on the backbone of FluGen’s flu vaccine candidate M2SR. Based on an invention by the University of Wisconsin-Madison virologists and FluGen co-founders Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Gabriele Neumann, M2SR is a self-limiting version of the influenza virus that induces an immune response against the flu. Kawaoka’s lab will insert gene sequences from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease Covid-19, into M2SR so that the new vaccine will also induce immunity against the coronavirus. The refinement of the CoroFlu vaccine concept, and testing in laboratory animal models at UW-Madison, is expected to take at least three months. Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad will then begin production scale-up for safety and efficacy testing in humans. CoroFlu could be in human clinical trials by July.Why did you move to the US for trials? For Covid-19, we thought we should have the best experts in the world. Kawaoka is the best person in the influenza programme in the world. There is no second and third in the world on influenza, if you ask me. Why the area of influenza is important is because both influenza and Covid-19 follow the same pattern of infection -- you cough, it goes through the nasal and mouth route into the lungs. For this sort of respiratory pathogen, the lungs are the target, which is why mucosal immunity is very important for this kind of pathogen. The animal model trial is on. Our animal trials are going to be delayed because we have to establish safety and efficacy, but human trials will be very fast. It will take at least three months to do animal trials to establish the safety properly. Then Phase 1 is only a one dose vaccine with 30 days’ trial. Phase 2 we don’t have to do because the same platform (nasal route) has already established the concentration required already in humans - so it can be minimised. Then for Phase 3, we need to have 1,000 people, and that is going to be another 45 days of trial in India. Human trial is going to be very short; the worry is only the animal trials as we want to establish the safety and efficacy, which is extremely critical.Why a nasal vaccine?We want to use the same route that this pathogen uses - the nasal route. The ideal vaccine in a pandemic should have an easy delivery mechanism that can reach easily villages; even an anganwadi worker should be able to give it to the villagers. Look at the polio vaccine, it’s a great success because of the oral drop; it reached the last mile because of easy delivery of the vaccine. Similarly, nasal drop will work better. Also, the safety of the platform has been established in humans already. In the US, Phase 2 (human trials) trial of the influenza vaccine (company FluGen) has already completed. Safety of the platform is proven, so we can rely on the platform for use in human beings. So if the safety is proved in 3 months, we will go ahead, but if there is an animal problem then we may not even pursue the product further because the safety of people is most important. If you reach the human trials level, what category will you be looking at recruiting in India?While recruiting candidates later for human trials, our priority will be doctors and health care workers and police personnel, since they are at the forefront in India. It has to be in India because the country of origin has to approve the results. Phase 1 and phase 3 trials will be with them.What are the challenges vaccine manufacturers face in India?In a pandemic situation, everyone asks, when is the vaccine ready, why are you delaying, what is the capacity, when is the launch, what is the price etc. What we should actually talk about is long-term fundamentals such as innovation in India, start-ups in India; what do we need for all these biological scientific companies to sustain themselves; are reagents easily available in 24 hours because speed is of utmost importance for any start-up. We rely heavily on foreign countries for raw material, and even small things at times are not available in India. The correct animal model (a special type of mice) required for testing is not available in India. It is available in the US, and they will give priority to their country first or Europe next, so what kind of research can you do in vaccines? It is very tough. So what we did in this case is that we funded the animal trials at the University of Wisconsin. We need to build small islets of infrastructure in this country, which is what China did. They created infrastructure first, here we create institutes first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/animal-trials-for-the-covid-19-vaccine-will-be-critical-krishna-ella/story-0RTIhdVC9APh0kpPE3JVNL.html
07-04-2020||India||How India performs on 6 steps to flatten coronavirus curve||The respected New England Journal of Medicine, in an editorial titled Ten Weeks to Crush the Curve, on managing Covid-19, lists six steps needed to fight the pandemic. At the core of these steps is science, according to US public policy expert and physician Dr Harvey V. Fineberg who authored the editorial. “And with enough intelligence about the enemy — where the virus lurks, how quickly it is moving, where it is most threatening, and what its vulnerabilities are — we can begin to re-energize the economy without putting additional lives at risk,” he wrote in the piece published on April 1.So, how does India perform on each of the six steps1. INSPIRE AND MOBILISE THE PUBLICIndia has done reasonably well on this, as evident in the response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to cheer health care workers for five minutes (at 5 pm) on March 22, and light a lamp or shine a torch (after switching of all lights), for nine minutes at 9 pm on April 5. A collective action such as this connects people, said an expert. “Asking people to light diyas and candles helped them reconnect with society and break the monotony of being locked down for three weeks. It’s used in therapy to build resilience to help people cope with adversity,” said Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor, department of psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAnd for a country such as India, where people have trouble with queues, the kind of discipline shown in terms of adhering to the lockdown and social distancing when shopping for essentials is remarkable, although there have been some exceptions. “You beat a pandemic by collectivism, not individualism, and what we saw on Sunday night is remarkable. The lights-out on Sunday was a remarkable display of the power of messaging, the power of social connectedness, the sense of community, and of camaraderie and togetherness across socio-economic groups,” said Dr Samir Parikh, director, Fortis Mental Health Programme.But mobilisation must be taken beyond society to include research, technology, manufacturing and academia to develop vaccines, drug therapies, diagnostics kits and personal protection equipment, the NEJM article adds. “This epidemic has to be stopped by intelligence and speedy action. For that, we need to use the best and more appropriate technology to empower all people. Aarogya setu is the bridge that connects you, in this epidemic, to our health system... The more users, the more effective our pushback will be,” tweeted Dr K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor to the government of India, referring to the app launched by the government.2. ESTABLISH UNIFIED COMMANDIndia has done well on this too. It was quick to enforce the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, ensuring a unified response to the pandemic. There is a central command, with technical experts advising the government, but the decisions are still enforced by the states, customising them to the needs of each neighbourhood and district, all of which are at various stages of the epidemic. “Target responses to specific places and times, deploy and redeploy limited national supplies where they can do the most good, and learn from experience as we go,” NEJM said.3. MAKE MILLIONS OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AVAILABLEIndia hasn’t done well on this. It must scale up tests to identify and isolate the infection. Mass testing worked for South Korea and Germany. Rapid antibody tests for population screening should be expanded from outbreak areas to identify those who have had mild disease, recovered and developed immunity (and who can, therefore, return to work). This will be a game-changer in restarting parts of the economy quickly and safely, esperts say. This is why the antibody tests India will start using later this week are important. The protocol for their use, and the fact that some state governments have procured their own kits, will help widen testing.  4. SUPPLY HEALTH WORKERS WITH PERSONAL PROTECTIVE ELEMENT ( PPE) AND EQUIP HOSPITALS TO CARE OF THE SEVERELY ILL India’s performance on this is patchy. It has ordered 7.5 million PPEs, of which 1.75 lakh have arrived from China, but they need to reach health workers urgently, many who are infected at very early stages of the pandemic. “All staff, including health care providers and hospital administrators, need urgent training in infection-control and biomedical waste-disposal disposal. With several health staff getting infected across hospitals in several states, contamination because of poor infection-control is often as big a problem as shortage of PPEs,” said a public health specialist, requesting anonymity.In addition, India has sought to mobile 48,000 ventilators too. Ample supplies of PPE (personal protective equipment) should be standard issue to every health worker who is in the front lines caring for patients and testing for infection. “We wouldn’t send soldiers into battle without ballistic vests; health workers on the front lines of this war deserve no less,” said the editorial in NEJM.5. DIFFERENTIATE THE POPULATION INTO FIVE GROUPS AND TREAT ACCORDINGLYWhile the number of infected in India isn’t high enough to warrant this, there has been some level of differentiation. Testing and quarantine policies have to be different for those at high risk of infection, those presumed to be infected (persons with symptoms who initially test negative), those who have been exposed, those who is not known to have been exposed, and those who have recovered from infection and are immune.Quarantining people with symptoms till results come and hospitalising those with severe illness till they test negative at least thrice is happening in India, but there needs to be a clearer home-quarantining policy for people with mild symptoms and wider antibody testing for those who have recovered and are now protected. Some states have identified dedicated Covid hospitals and hotels to board health workers, but the implementation remains inconsistent.6. LEARN WHILE DOING REAL-TIME, FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCHIndia was quick to set up a highly qualified technical committee to advise it on its approach to combating the virus, but it hasn’t listened to all its recommendations, although it is understood that the initial idea for a lockdown did come from the committee.  Decisions to shape the public health response and to restart the economy should be guided by science, including when people can start working, and when schools, airlines, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues be reopened, said the NEJM editorial. But India needs to partner more closely with academia to build accurate predictive models for the emerging infection to improve preparedness.“If we persist with half-measures against the coronavirus, we risk saddling the economy with a long-term and avoidable burden of anxious consumers, illness, higher medical costs, and constricted business activity,” said Dr Fineberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-india-performs-on-6-steps-to-flatten-the-curve/story-IRBgnsvxlB4l7mTX44pxjO.html
07-04-2020||India||MPs take 30% pay cut for ayear, local area fund halted||The Union cabinet on Monday decided to cut the salaries of the Prime Minister, other ministers, and parliamentarians by 30% for a year, and to suspend for two years, a scheme under which parliamentarians get Rs 5 crore a year to spend on developmental work, with all the money saved going into the consolidated fund of India to be used to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. That’s expected to work out to approximately Rs 7930 crore. Of this, a total of close to Rs 29 crore will come from the salaries of MPs. According to an official, an MP gets a Rs one lakh salary and Rs 3 lakh and 60 thousand will be the annual contribution of every MP including the prime minister, other ministers, and parliamentarians. Another Rs 7900 crore will come from the Member of parliament Local Area development Scheme.In addition, the President, the Vice President and the governors of states have also decided to take salary cuts.Separately, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla too has decided to take a 30% cut in salary for the year starting April 1. “Charity begins at home,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said while announcing the cuts. “Cabinet has approved an ordinance amending the Salary, Allowances, and Pension of members of Parliament Act, 1954.” The cut is effective for the salary of 2020-21. Opposition MPs welcomed the salary cuts but there was a mixed reaction to the suspension of the MPLAD scheme, with some saying it would prevent them from caring for their constituents in need. “As an MP who represents a predominately rural constituency I fully support the 30% cut in my salary. However the suspension of MPLADS is a bit of an overstretch. At this time of grave humanitarian distress that will get only worse in the months ahead.MPLADS is a targeted & nimble instrument to customise micro level interventions to alliviate distress. I think MPLAD Funds need to be restored.Plz re-think it once again. It is a knee jerk reaction much like the lockdown at a 4 hour notice. It will hurt poor most,” said Congress MP Manish Tewari.His party colleague Jairam Ramesh, however, expressed different views.“I welcome the decision on MPLADS. I have been arguing for long that the approximately Rs.7000 crore given to MPs & MLAs annually for development works should be used as a corpus for State funding of elections,” Ramesh said.Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said his party supported the cut in MPs’ salaries. He, however, added that suspending the MPLADS was a disservice and will undermine the role of an MP.CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said there is enough evidence that COVID 19 is best fought at the state and local level. By suspending MPLADS, government is taking away expenditure which would have attended to unique requirements of an area. This centralization goes against federalism, development and will weaken our fight, claimed Yechury.If there is no money with the government why doesn’t it abandon the Central vista project in Delhi, Yechury asked.A member of parliament is paid a salary of Rs 1,00,000 plus allowances. A member of Parliament would contribute Rs 30,000 per month and Rs 3,60,000 in the year.The salary of the prime minister of India is the same as other MPs. The President of India is paid a salary of Rs five lakh per month while the Vice President is paid Rs four lakh per month. The president, vice president and governors have also volunteered to take a 30% cut. The governors are paid Rs three lakh and fifty thousand each.The Consolidated Fund of India is the fund into which all tax revenues flow, and the one used to make most payments.Significantly, only the salary, and not the pension and allowances of the MPs will be reduced.Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the cabinet meeting and then a meeting of his council of ministers. Both were conducted over video conference. .Responding to a question on whether the salaries of MLAs would also be slashed, Javadekar said this decision can only be taken by the states.Political scientist Nilanjan Sircar said that the economy was not doing well even before coronavirus so certainly some cuts had to be made in order to fund the response to the pandemic.“That being said, it clear that when the first place you are going to is cutting MPLADS, given the tenor of all the policies that we have seen especially in the elections since 2019, I think it is genuinely pointing towards far greater political and economic centralization in the system,” he said.Sircar added that while the fight against coronavirus necessitates some steps in funding but the question was whether this is the right one. “Taking a salary cut for MPs perhaps is okay, but I do think suspending, given that MPs especially have very little political freedom. There is anti-defection, they cannot vote against their parties, so this one area in which even those who were not necessarily connected to the ruling could distinguish themselves,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mps-take-30-pay-cut-for-ayear-local-area-fund-halted/story-ug973X308pqAnr69I3uREP.html

07-04-2020||India||‘People may die if lockdown is lifted’: KCR asks PM to extend lockdown||Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao on Monday said he will appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to extend Covid-19 lockdown.The 21-day lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus in the country came into effect on March 25 and is set to end on April 14.But chief minister Rao cautioned that if the lockdown is lifted it could cost lives. Follow coronavirus live updates here.“It is true that the country’s economy has taken a beating during the lockdown period. Telangana, too, suffered heavily – our revenue was just Rs 6 crore in the last six days, against the expected revenue of Rs 2,500 crore. But we can always revive the economy once this crisis is over, but we cannot bring back the lives of the people who could die in large numbers, if the lockdown is lifted,” he said.He said it will be difficult to control people if the lockdown is lifted. “All the efforts we had put in all these days, braving financial loss, would go waste, if situation comes back to square one due to the lockdown being eased,” Rao said.“The lockdown is the reason the country is saved and has seen very few cases. A country like India has to be careful otherwise it will become uncontrollable. The economy will get hurt but at least we are not seeing deaths like Italy, Spain and the US,” KCR said, adding that he had suggested to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the curbs be extended for two more weeks.“At least some of the restrictions should stay for a bit more. Otherwise, India will not be able to handle things if the lockdown is hastily lifted,” he said.Earlier on Monday, a top Uttar Pradesh bureaucrat also hinted that the lockdown may not be lifted in the state on April 14.Telangana has so far recorded 334 positive cases. Thirty three of them have recovered while there have been 11 casualties.Last week, Rao announced massive pay cuts for ministers, MLAs and government employees amid shrinking revenue. The government did not say how long the pay cuts would remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cm-says-will-appeal-to-pm-modi-to-extend-covid-19-lockdown/story-22saPUXU8scaLZZf2UWbNM.html

Four soldiers under the command of a junior commissioned officer from one of the most professional Para SF units were heli-dropped near the LoC after information on the infiltrators was received,” the army said.Three of the commandos were killed at the encounter site while two succumbed to their injuries while being airlifted to a military hospital.The army began hunting for this batch of terrorists on April 1 when they infiltrated into Kashmir with ground troops reporting footprints near the LoC fence that was covered under snow, said the first officer cited above.The army’s search teams made contact with the terrorists and engaged them in firefights four times between April 1 and April 4 before the commandos from 4 Para (SF) were called in to take over the operation and hunt the intruders, he said.Commandos from 4 Para (SF) carried out key missions during the 2016 surgical strikes against terror pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The strikes were India’s first direct military response to the attack on the Uri army base in September 2016 that killed 19 Indian soldiers and was carried out by Pakistan-based terrorists.’.“Based on visuals from unmanned aerial vehicles, the SF troops were staged forward to the nearest battalion headquarters by air as the location was winter cut off (due to heavy snow),” said the second officer cited above.At the crack of dawn on Sunday, the five commandos began tailing the infiltrators following their footmarks on the snow. Several hours later, the footprints indicated that the infiltrators had gone towards a nallah and were hiding there.“The SF men split into two squads and approached their target stealthily to prevent the terrorists from escaping,” said the third officer cited above. And that’s when tragedy struck.“One of the squads didn’t realise that they were on a cornice. The complete snow block collapsed taking the squad leader and the two scouts down all the way to the nallah where the terrorists were sitting... It led to a close-quarter battle at almost point blank range,” the officer said. The two commandos in the other squad rushed to provide support to their comrades who were locked in an intense close-quarter fight with the terrorists. In the ensuing engagement, the five commandos were successful in killing all the infiltrators but at the cost of their own lives.“Despite the fall, the commandos killed all the terrorists because of their superior training standards,” the officer said.The army on Monday identified the fallen commandos as Subedar Sanjeev Kumar from Himachal Pradesh, Havildar Davendra Singh from Uttarakhand, Paratrooper Bal Krishan from Himachal Pradesh, Paratrooper Amit Kumar from Uttarakhand and Paratrooper Chhatrapal Singh from Rajasthan.Army sources said while the world was fighting the Covid-19 pandemic with all its might, Pakistan was focused on abetting terrorism.“Pakistan and its army are fomenting terrorism in India to hide its failure to fight Covid-19. The Indian Army is not only fighting Covid with utmost professionalism both in India and in neighbouring countries but it is also concurrently defeating Pakistan’s evil designs along the LoC and in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” the sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-commandos-5-terrorists-killed-in-loc-hand-to-hand-battle/story-w3gdmbBaVjXNDHVd7pBKSP.html

Well-informed and trained security personnel need to be deployed all around the building on 24*7 rotation basis to monitor the facility and to avoid entry of undesired persons or animals and even birds for eating any food remains or droppings inside the area,” read the document.Concerns have been raised over whether the infection caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted between animals and humans; there are reports of a pet cat in Belgium and two dogs in Hong Kong getting infected. Additionally, in quarantine homes, there is a risk that animals could take contaminated stuff, especially leftover food items, outside the facility and spread the infection.“The guidelines have been drafted as per the best practices followed globally regarding infection control during an outbreak of this nature. As it is an evolving situation, all previously issued guidelines can be modified based on the change in data to meet norms of the current available evidence,” a senior health ministry official said. A team of experts has done a thorough risk assessment with respect to probability of infection from not just movement of people but also animals and birds in the area.It is mandatory to have a special map of the facility prepared to outline the details of movement of health care and other personnel around the quarantine area and in the building so as to reduce the probability of fresh infections, according to the government’s guidelines. “To ensure that all health care personnel use personal protection equipment (PPE) as per guidelines, they need to be properly trained and assisted during wearing of PPE. Separate areas to be earmarked for PPE donning and doffing. Compliance for same should be ensured by a nodal officer,” said the health ministry official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-entry-of-monkeys-birds-in-quarantine-facilities-govt-guidelines/story-0Xr7QExed0OA80QqbSOmpI.html
