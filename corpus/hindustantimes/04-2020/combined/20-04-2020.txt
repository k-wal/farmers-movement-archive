20-04-2020||News||Will force majeure apply to Covid, writes Abhishek Singhvi||Apart from fear, panic and uncertainty, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has generated a set of legal issues which will assume increasing salience in the weeks and months ahead.Can I, as a tenant, seek waiver of rent for inability to use my rented office/manufacturing facility during the lockdown? Am I obliged to pay full wages even if I am closed and not generating income? Can my building contract invoke force majeure (FM), freeing the party from legal obligation, and/or change in law, and claim not only extension of time but also compensation for an impossibility? Does the Covid-19 lockdown constitute change in law at all? These and innumerable similar questions are agonised over daily. This article cannot give in-depth answers but suggests some principles, in legal, non-consensual situations between warring parties.First, FM (usually used interchangeably with frustration) is, in law, quite different from what it is popularly perceived to be. Prevalent confusion in the Covid-19 context arises largely due to a lack of understanding of its true essence in law. Its 400-year-old English and 75-year-old Indian jurisprudence yields the following principles:a) The contract between parties is supreme; if it specifically anticipates a pandemic with consequences stipulated, it will govern above all else — 99.99% cases are of gaps and ambiguity, because parties are not prophets and lawyers are not astrologers.b) While English law is of persuasive value, Indian courts must be guided by the comprehensive codes in sections 32 and 56 of our Contract Act.c) Of the three underlying juristic principles — that the consequence of a frustrating event be implied by courts as something so obvious that parties excluded it because of its obviousness; be imposed by courts as the most just and fair result; or be adopted as that which law’s hypothetical reasonable man would do during FM — the last is the most preferable. The first is farcical because the very basis of FM is that which parties could not anticipate; the second involves rewriting of contract by a judge supposedly doing justice, smacking of the proverbial Chancellor’s foot.d) Critically and crucially, case law has used strong words and cast the threshold to successfully apply FM very high. It requires the entire foundation of the bargain to be shown to be upset. The basis of the adventure must be destroyed. Mere alteration, even significant change, or highly enhanced onerousness, or humongous increase in expenditure, or availability even of delayed performance alternatives, have all negatived FM. A radically new contract and a break in identity with the original have been judicially adumbrated. Price, cost and monetary changes have been specifically given the least judicial importance.Second, celebrated cases (despite distinguishing features) and cerebral judges have rejected FM in stronger contexts than Covid-19. Thus, requisition of land on which development was to contractually happen was not excused in 1954, despite requisition of the land in World War II. A ghee supplier during the same war was not allowed enhanced prices, despite huge scarcity and enhanced expense of procurement. The rejection of a licence to a jute supplier sourcing Pakistani jute post the 1965 war was held not FM-entitled, while, in 2017, a corporate was denied FM and benefits of change of law in electricity generation, despite proving a humongous increase in the cost of Indonesian coal which, by law of that country, increased exponentially and admittedly rendered the contract commercially impossible.Third, a little known Chinese judgment (applying English law in Hong Kong) in the identical context of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 2003, denied relief to a tenant who sought to exit his tenancy at the inception, but within the lock-in period because of a month’s disruption of occupation due to the SARS lockdown. Judges have emphasised the non-permanence and temporariness of such disruptions, and the full probability of resumption, albeit within an uncertain time frame, to deny FM. Indeed, the Hong Kong judge noted that he knew of no English decision over 500 years excusing tenancy obligations based on frustration.Fourth, applying the above, it would be well nigh impossible to argue that two-or three-month disruptions qua Covid-19 leases radically altered the bargain. While all governmental communications obliging wage payments are advisories with no legal effect, the ministry of home affairs document of March 29, 2020, is under section 10(2)(i) of the Disaster Management Act and constitutes law. Absent a successful challenge to the notification and to the validity of the section on the ground that that section does not address the issue of wages at all, the obligation regarding wages binds. Litigation experience tells me that in the current ambience of destitution and deprivation, no court is likely to arrive at that result.Fifth, the lockdown rules clearly possess all the attributes of law and are binding. They would, thus, qualify as change of law under appropriate clauses in construction contracts leading to proportionate extension of time for completion. Whether they would make the owner liable for additional compensation to the contractor, arising from change in law, remains an untested and vexed question. Arguably, the lockdown, though undoubtedly a change in law, is activity- neutral and not specific qua construction, apart from excusing the owner as much as the contractor. The jury may well be out on this last one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/will-force-majeure-apply-to-covid-writes-abhishek-singhvi/story-c73bYO3LDRtEJtFiCt8SvN.html
20-04-2020||News||The politics of power in times of a pandemic | Opinion||The disruptions caused by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) highlight the importance of electricity for modern societies. A reliable electricity supply underpins the essential services that sustain the social order and build individual preparedness during this lockdown. Ironically, however, even as electricity can make us more resilient, electricity is also vulnerable to the pandemic. How is India’s electricity sector placed at this moment?The problem is not on the supply-side of providing enough power. Due to the electricity demand slump in recent months, most domestic coal-fired power plants have more than enough coal to last them for 25 days. Moreover, the coal supply chain and electricity generation have been declared essential services, exempted from the lockdown. Renewable energy (RE) plants are not dependent on fuel.The challenge comes from the demand shock: Efforts to flatten the Covid-19 curve have caused the electricity load to plummet. Power demand has dropped around 25% nationally, with individual states reporting drops of 15-30%. On the first day of the nationwide lockdown, the spot price for electricity dropped to ~0.60/KWh, touching a three-year low. In the days ahead, supply was far greater than demand, to the point that the price dropped by more than half.The impact of this demand shock is two-fold. First, the demand drop is a direct consequence of reduced economic activities — the lockdown of commercial establishments, public institutions, transport, construction and manufacturing — and implies reduced commercial and industrial (C&I) load on distribution companies (discoms). While losing a significant part of the cross-subsidising load, discoms are spending more per unit (KWh) of electricity supplied (in part because they have to pay fixed charges to generators even if they don’t use the power). Consequently, discoms, reeling under persistent financial losses, will lose even more.Second, the pandemic response has impaired discoms’ billing and collection operations. Discoms have extended deadlines for payment in several states, and the chances of recovering the dues later are uncertain because those who have lost their livelihood may seek an electricity bill waiver. Enforcing recovery, however, comes with the risk of pushing the poor off the grid.As a relief to discoms, the Centre has directed a three-month moratorium on their dues to generators (barring the RE generators) and transmission companies. This may be a temporary relief, but revenue loss implies a surge in discoms’ overdues to generators that have accumulated to over Rs 80,522 crore. Simultaneously, the additional financial losses of discoms are unlikely to be passed on to the consumers, and will lead to a surge in their regulatory assets (a promise by the regulator that discoms can recoup the money in the future from consumers). Combined, the regulatory assets of discoms were around Rs 77,000 crore at the end of financial year, 2019.Both these effects raise the alarm for a looming financial crisis in the sector. For those observing the sector, this is a déjà vu moment. The sector is ready for yet another bailout. A bailout can be a formidable task for governments, given the fiscal stress due to the lockdown and planned stimulus. Even pre-pandemic, discoms’ debts had grown to the level of the last bailout under the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana. A failure to act in a timely and adequate way may impede the reliable electricity supply required to reboot the economy.In planning a response, the pandemic impacts offer some insights for the future of electricity. First, it provides a test case of impending load migration to RE. As RE costs have fallen, the chances have increased that high-paying consumers will move off the grid. The lockdown provides an indication of the consequences, ie, what happens when industry no longer provides a cross-subsidy to households and agriculture? Will the experience create pressure for alternative ways to manage subsidy demands? There are some efforts to deliver the low-cost benefits of RE directly to the poor through capital subsidies for solar panels, solar pumps and solar agricultural feeders, thus reducing the growing subsidy burden on discoms. Will the pandemic experiences drive a shift from electricity tariff subsidy to electricity infrastructure subsidy for RE to help the poor?Second, the crisis creates an impetus to find technology fixes to disruptions in system operation. Though unintended, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for lights out on April 5, was an exemplary test of grid balancing under sudden demand variation. Will the grid’s ability to manage a 27% (31 gigawatts) demand swing assuage the concerns for the integration of variable RE? In another example, smart meters, being pushed to check discoms’ loss, may be used to build the resilience of discoms in billing and collection.Finally, the choice between a networked and centralised electricity system and a network of decentralised systems is pertinent. Decentralised systems, advocated for faster energy transition, are also thought to be operationally resilient. Will the pandemic experience prompt a reconsideration of the electric power structure?The electricity system has been shaken by the pandemic. But a viable electricity system that can assure reliable supply is also crucial to the revival. It is time now to think about how to ensure that electricity is pandemic-proof.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-politics-of-power-in-times-of-a-pandemic-opinion/story-uG28pgZi7qptywFsLLPaYP.html
20-04-2020||News||To control Covid-19, address water, sanitation, hygiene and waste issues||The Coronavirus outbreak has laid bare the fault lines in human habits and habitations. Though it has affected millions across the world, it is the densely populated areas of large cities that have borne the brunt most. The outbreak highlights our shortcomings in addressing urban densification, growth, and adverse public health outcomes, which are further intensified by inadequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene practices.A March 19 World Health Organization guideline outlines the risks the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practitioners and providers, as well as policymakers and health care workers, face during the coronavirus crisis. The guideline summarises the findings of some of the ongoing researches on Covid-19 which have so far confirmed two main routes of transmission of the virus – contact and respiratory. Health professionals have so far emphasised on avoiding direct contact with infected people and wearing masks in their proximity. These prescriptions have been brought to the public’s notice through sustained advertising and instructions communicated through media. Though the medium of transmission are confirmed for two modes, WHO cautions people about the likelihood of the virus’ survival in drinking water and sewage for a limited number of days.The virus, with a fragile outer membrane that upon breaking renders it inactive, is not known to transmit through drinking water and sewage, but studies corroborate that they may survive in water for two days. Reports also confirm that 2-10% of people infected with Covid-19 suffer from diarrhoea and have viral RNA fragments in their faeces. That uncertainty should make us cautious. The WHO guidelines, which the UN body calls “interim”, lay down preventive WASH and waste management practices to ensure the safety of sanitation and health care workers. But how far such measures are implemented in practice remains debatable.There are three major corollaries for India in the WHO guidelines.First, provided the research on Covid-19 don’t corroborate water and fecal-oral as transmission mediums for the pathogen, India is still highly vulnerable. Given the ubiquity of dense neighbourhoods in the urban and peri-urban areas of India, contact and respiratory transmission are unavoidable. This was witnessed in the post-lockdown exodus of migrant labourers from large cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad .Second, if you consider even the slightest possibility of water and/or faecal-oral transmission, India would turn into a Covid-19 hotbed. The majority of the households in most of our cities doesn’t have piped water supply or sewer connections. Even in the cities where their coverage is better, water pipelines are old, which are a common cause of water-borne diseases such as typhoid, diarrhoea and jaundice.The sewage treatment plants are few, most of them are partially functional – treating sewage much lower than their installed capacities – and many of them dysfunctional. Most of urban India and almost all of rural India are largely reliant on groundwater sources for drinking and on-site sanitation systems such as septic tanks and pits, often flouting the basic design standards. Safe drinking water and treatment of waste remain a distant dream. This makes a wide range of people vulnerable to Covid-19, if the virus survives for long enough in water and the faecal matter.Sanitation workers are the most vulnerable, as states across the country have invoked the Essential Services Acts, which necessitates the continuation of the solid and liquid waste collection during the lockdown. New research shows that hospital waste has multiplied during the lockdown, necessitating proper disposal of potentially infected waste. But the unavailability of protective gear such as gloves and masks or soaps and sanitisers intensifies their vulnerability. In addition to that, they are not trained to operate under epidemic outbreaks.Third, irrespective of the virus’ medium of transmission, India’s health care workers find themselves in a precarious position. While providing care and treatment to the serious cases, the health-care workers operate in close proximity with each other and patients. Naturally, shortages of protective gear such as masks and gloves and sanitisers have invoked both anger and exasperation among the health workers across the country. To make matters worse, they, like sanitation workers, are often stigmatised as a carrier of the virus. The coronavirus outbreak should serve as a wake-up call for authorities and policymakers to scale up the WASH and waste management infrastructure and services across the country.Aditya Bhol is a senior research associate with the Scaling City Institutions for India initiative under the Urbanisation vertical at the Centre for Policy Research, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-control-covid-19-address-water-sanitation-hygiene-and-waste-issues/story-fkBbFDAujvvifcYfjxEOzJ.html
20-04-2020||News||Covid-19: What India has done right and what next||As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spreads across the world, we are reminded of the frailty of the human condition and of a world that has been halted in time like a deer caught in the headlights. We hear about historic pandemics and biblical plagues, but seldom has there been such a challenge to modern civilisation, one that has pressed the pause button on lives and livelihoods. With over 2.3 million cases and over 150,000 deaths, this pandemic has put more than 100 countries and a third of the world’s population in lockdown. Economists warn that the damage to the economy is likely to be similar — or worse — to the Great Depression.How India, with one of the largest working-age populations in the world, battles Covid-19 will determine how the future unfolds for the world. While the West’s policy sages are painting a grim picture of a post-pandemic world, India is charting out a path to recovery and redemption. The Government of India’s (GoI) policy responses to Covid-19 have been stellar, and have evolved from precaution to prevention and now, to precision.First, India was expeditious in taking precautions to curtail the spread of the coronavirus — from issuing travel advisories, introducing temperature screening of foreign travellers at airports, and establishing quarantine centres to being one of the first countries to ban international and domestic travel. These measures significantly contributed to reducing the case count. In fact, 46 days since the first reported case, Italy’s daily case volume was over 1,000 times larger than India’s. Similarly, despite similar caseloads in India and the United States (US), 40 days since the first reported case, the daily volume in the US was 25 times that of India’s two weeks hence. The growth rate of daily and cumulative cases in India has been consistently linear and lower.Second, India undertook one of the boldest measures ever seen by implementing a lockdown of over 1.3 billion people to break the transmission chain of the virus. This move was implemented sooner than it was in China, the United Kingdom and Spain, and it has estimated to have reduced the number of people infected by about 150 times. India’s three-week lockdown is showing results in terms of a flattened pandemic curve. Consequently, the growth rate of cases has declined by over 40%. At a national level, while the doubling of cases has slowed from three days before the lockdown to 6.2 days now, as many as 19 states and Union territories (UTs) have demonstrated progress with better-than-average doubling rates. India’s federal setup is a model of cooperative partnership, bolstered by constant interaction and consultation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers.Third, with the extension of the lockdown till May 3, the GoI’s focus is on precision policy, mapping out hotspots and moving towards restarting the economy. While the first phase of the lockdown focused on saving lives, the core objective of the extended lockdown is finding a balance between lives and livelihoods, particularly in rural India.With the graded lifting of curbs from April 20, the guidelines provide autonomy to states and districts in charting out their plans. In fact, this decision indicates the GoI’s willingness to ease the economic crisis for the hardest hit — the poor and the migrant workers. The GoI has disbursed almost $4 billion to over 320 million people via the direct benefit transfer mechanism.With states recalibrating the resumption of core economic activities, the latest guidelines follow a traffic light approach. There will be colour-coded zones — red, orange and green. The red zones (hotspots) will continue to have a lockdown; orange zones (with some cases) and green zones (with no cases) will witness a relaxation in restrictions on economic activities. So far, 170 out of 718 districts have been identified as hotspots. On average, about seven out of 10 cases in each state have been reported from three districts. Further, one in two districts in India has no reported cases and will be allowed to restart economic activities.These guidelines allow for an entire ecosystem of primary and agro-based industries to gear towards production. This is significant considering the total area under the summer crops (including rice, pulses, coarse cereals and oil seeds) has jumped significantly, registering an 11.64 lakh hectare increase over the last year. The country is even moving towards a bumper harvest in the coming months.The coordination between a proactive political leadership, an agile bureaucracy and the supportive public has led to a semblance of life returning back to normal. We have pan-ministry guidelines being issued in rapid succession to ensure supply chain bottlenecks are dismantled, and beneficiaries in non-hotspot areas, particularly farmers and small and medium entrepreneurs, kick start economic activity.Since the beginning of the lockdown, about ₹16,000 crore have been released under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme benefitting 8.31 crore farmer families. Similarly, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PM-GKY) about 4,000 MT of pulses has been dispatched for delivery to the States and Union Territories. The eNAM platform is being leveraged to debottleneck agri-logistics by creating an interface for large transport aggregators and an All India Agri Transport Call Centre launched for coordination between States for inter-state movement of perishables like vegetables and fruits, inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilisers etc.The Indian Railways has been running 134 Parcel Special Trains on over 65 routes for perishable commodities, and 247 flights have been operationalised by the ministry of civil aviation under the “Lifeline UDAN” scheme to transport essential medical cargo to remote parts of the country.Besides unlocking the agri sector, which is the primary source of livelihood for about 60% of the country, the guidelines also allow for the unlocking of other sectors such as construction - which has one of the largest number of informal daily wagers, e-commerce, self-employed services of plumbers, electricians etc. and manufacturing and industry in special economic zones. In fact, these measures will significantly contribute towards restoring livelihoods for a majority of the country.Despite the easing of restrictions, there is a need to remain vigilant, as the battle against coronavirus will have to continue to be fought by each citizen, through self-discipline, wearing of masks, and social distancing. Technology is a critical tool in this battle. Contact tracing is being extensively done through Arogya Setu - a unique app built by the best of India with quality, privacy, security, and scalability. It has reached an astounding 60 million users within 15 days of its launch and added immense value in our fight against an unknown enemy.India has already proven its success in terms of saving lives. With only 0.4 Covid-related deaths per million population, India is far ahead of “advanced” countries like Spain, the UK, the US and even Germany which have recorded 441, 228, 118 and 54 deaths per million, respectively. On aggregate, just four countries --- France, Italy, Spain and UK account for half the Covid-related deaths worldwide. While the US accounts for 25% of the total deaths, India accounts for only 0.3% of the total. Even in terms of testing, India is reporting 4.7% positive cases as a proportion of total tests while this number is at least five times more in countries like France, Spain and the US.In fact, the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization have lauded the government’s proactive response, and India has also received the highest score in Oxford University’s Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. Going forth, India’s measures to augment a post-pandemic economy will also attract the international eye, serving as a template for the world to follow.The Prime Minister in his recent address struck a chord with the 18th century Urdu idiom jaan hai toh jahaan hai! (Only if you are alive, will the world survive). While the phrase uniquely captures the struggles of our current time, India’s consistent strategies and evolving policy priorities will ensure the gears of India’s economic engine take flight, taki jaan rahe aur hamara jahaan bhi (so that our people survive and so does the world we have built.)Amitabh Kant is CEO, NITI Aayog.

20-04-2020||News||Life, liberty and law in times of a lockdown | Opinion||The established discourse on rights says that the enjoyment of your rights ends where it affects the ability of another person to enjoy theirs. The idea is to ensure the enjoyment of rights by all, in equal measure. Today, however, we are facing an unprecedented situation: By your presence alone, you can threaten the well-being of another human being. The Constitution guarantees the right to life and liberty under Article 21. But never before have these fundamental rights been treated as antithetical to each other. But they are today. To preserve life, in its real, actual and most basic sense, we are ready to give up liberty. The more liberty we surrender, the higher the likelihood that we preserve the right to life. As much of the world enters various phases of lockdowns, scholars are trying to find a legal basis of the lockdowns and other legal measures undertaken by governments to fight the coronavirus. In every country, including India, there is confusion between “government advice” and measures that have the force of law. Some countries such as the United Kingdom (UK) and Singapore have hastily passed legislation to facilitate the collective surrender of the right to move freely and to enforce it through law enforcement authorities. However, despite the enactment in the UK, there have been many instances of confusion between legally enforceable restrictions, and “advice”, even among law enforcement officials. In India, two laws have been used to tackle the virus: The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, a two-page relic from our British colonial past that arms the State to put in place temporary measures, which the public needs to follow, to prevent the outbreak of diseases. Anyone disobeying the Epidemic Diseases Act can be penalised under the all-purpose, all-weather Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, which prescribes a punishment of imprisonment for up to six months, or a fine up to ~1,000, or both. The second is the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The pandemic is a “disaster” under the wide definition of the Act. However, in its design, the Act is structured to address natural calamities. To secure compliance of directives issued under this Act, broad unspecific provisions are relied upon. For instance, the guidelines issued on April 15 by the home ministry under the Act include a slew of directives such as wearing masks at workplaces. Apart from the prohibition on spitting, the violation of which entails a fine, specific punishments for other violations are not indicated. Any other violation would fall under Section 51 of the Act, which prescribes a maximum punishment of imprisonment for a year or a fine. This increases to two years, if the violation results in loss of lives or imminent danger. The notification issued by the home ministry also cites the trusty old Section 188.No existing law is designed to address the coronavirus pandemic. So repurposing outdated legislation, or using legislation not designed for this purpose, may have enabled swift measures, but at the same time, it has a one-size-fits-all approach. It would be ideal to have a law that tailors punishments proportionately to the behaviour it seeks to secure.Then there are the faultlines that emerge when law enforcement and public health collide. When three residents of an affluent neighborhood in Delhi tested positive for Covid-19, the police circulated a WhatsApp message, stating that their preliminary inquiry raised a “doubt” about a guard working with the family, who was suspected of attending a religious gathering. The message stated that the guard was now “on the run”. The police registered an FIR against him. A week later, it turned out that the guard tested negative for Covid-19. We see the word “suspect” used for people afflicted with symptoms of the disease. This is an epidemic, not a bank robbery. Yet, as we rely on law enforcement authorities to grapple with a difficult public health situation, we expect them to shift gears. We need to change the vocabulary to encourage honest reporting of symptoms and exposure. How do we do this when India presents more complex issues about social distancing than perhaps any other country in the world? People do not observe physical space or boundaries, nor do they often have the luxury of them. We are hardwired to not be solitary creatures. Will we be capable of the behavioural change required to keep us all safe after complete lockdown measures are lifted, or will the change in behaviour continue to be demanded and imposed on us by the law?We now seem to be part of a global consensus supporting the necessity to trade off one right to preserve another. In India, it is the poor that have disproportionately borne the burden of this. A trade implies receiving something in return for what you forfeit. Did the poor participate in a trade at all? The right to life has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the right to live with dignity. Yet, we failed to provide a life of dignity during lockdown to our most economically vulnerable people. This is a cross that the nation will carry forever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/life-liberty-and-law-in-the-times-of-a-lockdown/story-8uqeCaOFaw2FJkHfPz6A7O.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||Monday morning blues on Mumbai’s western and eastern express highways||Traffic jams were reported on both western (WEH) and eastern express highways (EEH) and other areas in the suburbs on Monday morning. This came after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced on Sunday night that restrictions would be relaxed only in zones designated as orange and green in Maharashtra, to allow industries to operate. Lockdown conditions remain in effect for the general public in Mumbai and Pune.The WEH and EEH both saw an increase in the number of private vehicles on Monday morning. More vehicles were also seen on the Sion-Panvel highway and traffic was reported in parts of Andheri, Goregaon, Malad and Kurla. In some areas, traffic jams were caused by the barricades installed by the police.Traffic police sources said the private vehicles on roads belonged to those involved in essential services. “Officers of the rank of deputy secretary and above have to attend office. For other government offices, 10% staff is allowed. Special economic zone (SEZ) and healthcare-related services are functional. Those in essential services are not using public transport and hence traffic is bound to increase,” said senior traffic police officer, adding that strict action would be taken against anyone stepping out for non-essential reasons.A senior traffic police officer, requested anonymity, confirmed there were more vehicles on the WEH. “There was a rise in number of vehicles seen at Goregaon stretch,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monday-morning-blues-on-mumbai-s-western-and-eastern-express-highways/story-Xueo6hUch1EYyJXr2V9MsO.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||‘RBI moratorium valid for all credit facilities’||Observing that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted moratorium not only for term loans but for all financial arrangements between banks and customers, the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday granted the benefit of a 90-day moratorium on loans to a Mumbai-based electrical engineering firm.Justice KR Shriram said in the case of IMP Powers Limited, the 90-day period for declaring an account a non-performing asset (NPA) will stop accruing from March 1 and will restart from June 1. Thus, the firm’s cash credit account will not be declared an NPA till June 1, despite the 90-day period ending on April 16.IMP Powers Limited, a medium enterprise involved in the manufacture of electrical equipment, moved the HC apprehending that its banker, Karnataka Bank, may declare its credit facility an NPA, as mentioned in a circular issued by the RBI in September 2001.The circular provided that if any account enjoying credit facilities with a bank has remained overdrawn beyond the sanctioned limit for a continuous period of more than 90 days, it will be classified as an NPA.Counsel for IMP Powers, senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf, pointed out that Karnataka Bank had sanctioned a fund-based cash credit limit of ₹2 crore; packing credit limit of ₹7.50 crore; bank guarantee limit with interchangeability to letter of credit of ₹36.75 crore to IMP Powers. However, the account has remained overdrawn since January 16, primarily due to the lockdown.Justice Shriram also took into consideration the RBI circular dated March 27, 2020, issued to all the banks and financial institutions, stating that all commercial banks, including regional rural banks, are permitted to allow a moratorium of three months for payment on instalments of all term loans outstanding on March 1, 2020. “The Reserve Bank of India has granted moratorium not only for term loans but all kinds of financial arrangements between a customer and the bank,” said the judge, while granting relief to the firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rbi-moratorium-valid-for-all-credit-facilities/story-XYHeuA48lz3eHtWNd9ZoZM.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||‘Covid-19 forces us to rethink how we decongest Mumbai’||In December 1898, two years after the first case of bubonic plague was detected in Mandvi, the Bombay City Improvement Trust (BCIT) was formed. By this time, tens of thousands had been killed in the city and thousands had been forced to evacuate. The plague exposed infrastructural weaknesses and forced a redesign of Bombay. The BCIT was tasked with decongesting the city and its efforts led to not only new east-west roads like Princess Street, but new residential neighbourhoods like Dadar, Matunga and the now-famous landmark of Shivaji Park. Today, with the outbreak of Covid-19, urban planners say there is urgent need to once again rethink the city’s design and how it may be decongested.  “We have to take a major re-look at our development codes where we must use densification as a planning tool,” said Pankaj Joshi, executive director of the Mumbai-based Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI). Densification refers to the number of people in an area. “It is possible to decongest the city in a phased-manner as large parts of the city are still being redeveloped,” said Joshi. With a density of 31,700 people per square km (sqkm), Mumbai is the second-most crowded city after Bangladesh’s Dhaka, as per the World Economic Forum. “The density on an average would be almost 43,000 per sqkm if we do not take the mangroves and Sanjay Gandhi National Park into account,” said Joshi.Experts say the primary challenge facing Mumbai is the uneven spread of population and amenities. “Density is not bad per se. Mumbai’s problem is its unequal densities. Compare Malabar Hill to Dharavi,” said Hussain Indorewala, a professor and an urban planning expert. Dharavi, which has several containment zones and has reported 168 cases of Covid-19 since April 1, has a current density of 66,000 per sqkm. “Slum rehabilitation schemes in the city allow 1,200 tenements per hectare, which not only produces poor living conditions but poses a great danger to public health,” said Indorewala.While the state government has been planning the redevelopment of congested areas like Dharavi, Bhendi Bazaar and Bombay Development Directorate (BDD) chawls, urban experts agree that the existing plans are unlikely to improve conditions. “Dharavi needs a comprehensive plan. In the past, we have looked at self-redevelopment or community-based models for Dharavi to manage its densities. Those need to be re-looked at,” said Abhay Pethe, economics professor at the Mumbai School of Economics and Public Policy. So far, the state has leaned towards the cluster development model, which monetises the land to finance new construction. Experts say this model will only serve to further crowd the already-crowded clusters with additional tenements being built in the same area. “The ideal scenario is when rehabilitation schemes do not exceed by 300-400 tenements per hectare but as long as profiting from land is a major motive, that will not happen,” said Indorewala. Architect Vilas Nagalkar said current redevelopment plans are not likely to give families the amount of space ideally allotted to them. “The Development Plan 2034 of Mumbai looks at 125 square metres (sqm) per family as an ideal housing scenario. At present, lower middle class families occupy 10-15 sqm space. After redevelopment, it will change to 40-50 sqm per family,” said Nagalkar. Additionally, there is the issue of creating more public spaces, which is a critical part of decongestion. Joshi gave examples of Hong Kong where multi-storey towers are interconnected at ground-plus-two floors to create more public space. In the Chinese city of Shanghai, the problem of densification was tackled by merging 243 sqkm into the city between 2000 and 2004. Shanghai is among the most densely-populated cities in the world and while questions remain about the sustainability benefits, experts agree that general liveability has improved after residents were relocated from the city centre. Expansion with an eye to decongesting Mumbai has been tried in the past. In the 1970s, Navi Mumbai was conceived for precisely this reason.  “The most important component of Navi Mumbai was to move the state government headquarters to the new city. That did not happen. There were also proposals to develop smaller satellite cities around Mumbai. That also did not happen as envisioned by the planners,” Indorewala said. In March 2019, as part of his lecture titled “Re-imagining Mumbai as the Indian Ocean Capital”, urban planner Pedro B Ortiz suggested a “Navi Navi Mumbai” to decongest the city. Ortiz said the city needs 14 sqkm of service land every year to meet its ever-increasing growth and avoid slum encroachment. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has been looking at establishing growth centres since 2012, which would expand help ease the pressure on Mumbai. Its regional plan 2016-36 zeroed in on four growth centres: Kharbao in Bhiwandi; Nilje in Dombivili; Shedung in Panvel; and Gass in Vasai-Virar. In 2013, the Maharashtra government had announced the formation of the Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area (Naina), a new township spread over 600 sqkms of area (larger than Mumbai) to avoid unplanned growth around the proposed international airport at Navi Mumbai. The state expects these centres to ease the transit burden towards Mumbai.An important factor contributing to congestion is traffic and access to public transport. “Biking and cycling have to be encouraged as last-mile connectivity options. Data has to be used to predict travel patterns and manage dispersal of crowds.Transit frequency also has to be increased for a safer, distanced and comfortable travel,” said transport expert Amruta Ponkshe, who is with the the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) and has written a paper on transit after Covid-19.  According to the TomTom Traffic Index of 2018, Mumbai is the most traffic-congested city in the world. Daily, local trains in Mumbai carry 7.5 million passengers, which 2.6 times the trains’ capacity on an average. The city continues to be dependent on its overburdened railways to connect to far-flung areas within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), like Thane, Kalyan-Dombivili, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Dombivili and Ulhasnagar.“We have to look at the metropolitan region as a whole unit for a cohesive decongestion plan but that is not happening with so many agencies handling different projects,” said Joshi. To this end, the 13 lines of the Mumbai Metro, being implemented by the MMRDA, is expected to significantly decongest the city. A recent study commissioned by the MMRDA concluded that traffic congestion would reduce from 137% to 33% by 2031 once all the Metro lines are constructed. (Congestion percentages represent the extra time required to reach a destination.) With infrastructure projects coming to a standstill in the lockdown period, the timelines of all projects will be severely affected, a senior official from MMRDA confirmed. At present, of the 337-km Metro network, eight lines are in various stages of development. These include line 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) and its extension to Gaimukh; line 5 (Thane, Bhiwandi and Kalyan); line 8 (Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport to Navi Mumbai International Airport); line 9 (Dashisar East, Mira Bhayander); line 10 (Gaimukh to Shivaji Chowk); line 12 (Kalyan to Taloja); line 13 (Shivaji Chowk to Virar); and line 14 (Kanjurmarg to Badlapur). Road congestion should also be eased by the Mumbai trans-harbour link, a 22-km long sea-bridge connecting Sewri in south Mumbai to Nhava Sheva in Navi Mumbai. The government rolled out the project in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-forces-us-to-rethink-how-we-decongest-mumbai/story-LibOhzM8CSfYvdNj2BwGsM.html

20-04-2020||Mumbai||Cops didn’t fire rounds to disperse crowd: Palghar lynching witness||Kashinath Chaudhary, a ZP member from Dahanu, who claimed to be an eyewitness to the lynching in Palgar incident, on Monday alleged that the Kasa police did not fire any rounds in the air to disperse the 600-odd group of tribals, most of whom were drunk. Gaurav Singh, SP, Palghar has suspended API Anandrao Kale and PSI Sudhir Katare.Chaudhary said: “The main occupation of the tribals is farming. Some of them even work in the units in adjoining Dadra, Nagar and Haveli union territory. Some tribals own land, where they grow rice, jowar and other crops.” “With most industrial units closed owing to the lockdown, the tribals are finding it difficult to make ends meet,” said Vinod Nikole, an MLA from Dahanu. “The police should have taken steps to stop rumour mongering.”“The tribals are in fear owing to the lockdown. That explains the April 13 attack on two waiters of a hotel in Dhanivare in Dahanu, who were mistaken to be thieves or even the April 14 attack by 250 tribals on four Kasa policemen and the SUV of skin specialist Dr Vishwas Valvi of Thane at Saarni village in Kasa, when he was returning home after distributing foodgrains and conducting door-to-door thermal screening of tribals,” said Brian Lobo, member, Kashtkari Sanghatana, a tribal welfare outfit.Fifteen people have been arrested in the April 14 case. “On April 17, too, a man was thrashed by 17 locals in Gholwad in Dahanu, mistaking him to be a thief…We have now got permission from Dahanu tehsildar Rahul Sarang to visit villages like Jamshet, Gangangaon and Dapcheri to hold meetings with tribals to tell them not to believe rumours. We have also got ID cards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cops-didn-t-fire-rounds-to-disperse-crowd-palghar-lynching-witness/story-AFl550MA6Xgz7DtZm2VMYI.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||Palghar lynching sparks war of words between Sena and BJP||The Palghar lynching incident has sparked a political war between former allies turned foes Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the ruling Shiv Sena.The mob lynching of three people including two sadhus in Gadhchinchale village, a remote tribal village in Palghar district on Thursday night, went viral after a video clip of the incident came to light. The clip, which has not been independently verified by HT, reportedly of the incident, showed unarmed policemen present, but failing to curb the violence.On Sunday, the lynching incident was trending on social media, with several Twitter handles squarely targeting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for lawlessness and even alleging a cover-up and a conspiracy in the murder of two seers. This is the second time in less than a week that Thackeray finds himself under a straight attack from the BJP. Last week, the chaos at Bandra, where hundreds of migrant workers had gathered, led to a similar social media war with #Uddhavresign trending.The Shiv Sena and its allies in Maharashtra have termed it a desperate ploy to politicise the issue during a humanitarian crisis, even as the BJP has tried hard to showcase that the Thackeray government is failing. Both Union home minister Amit Shah and UP CM Yogi Adityanath called Thackeray over the incident; Shah had called him last week after the incident at Bandra station too. “Our CM has made it clear that politics can wait and that we need every deck on hand while tackling a challenge of this proportion. But there has been a desperate pattern by the BJP to show that the state government is not doing enough. We have been very sincere in our efforts to address the challenge and people can see that,” said Priyanka Chaturvedi, Sena spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member. She questioned how Shah called Maharashtra CM over the Palghar and Bandra incidents, but not Gujarat CM over the Surat incident (where migrant workers had gathered in hundreds) or the Madhya Pradesh CM over several attacks and failure to curb the outbreak.State BJP leaders termed the Palghar incident a complete failure of law and order in Maharashtra. “The most shameful aspect in this horrific incident is that police were mute spectators and allowed the lynching. The entire law and order machinery seems to have collapsed in Maharashtra. There should be a high level inquiry in the entire incident, including a probe over whether the police are under pressure to allow locals to have their way,” said former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis.Sunil Deodhar, national secretary of BJP, incharge of Tripura and Andhra Pradesh, tweeted: “No adivasi in India can attack a saffron clad person unless brainwashed over years. The area where Palghar lynching happened is a communist bastion, even the local (Dahanu) MLA belongs to the CPI.” Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant however pointed out that the village where the incident occurred was controlled by the BJP. The village head or sarpanch, Chitra Chaudhary, is from the BJP, he said. “It is a mockery that UP, the capital of mob lynching, and its CM call Thackeray to demand a probe into this incident. The village where this incident occurred is under the BJP’s control; for the past 10 years, the sarpanch is from the BJP,” said Sawant.Thackeray also mentioned the social media war through his direct address to people both in Marathi as well as Hindi. “I don’t want to bring politics in this. We all know where all and for what reasons mob lynchings have happened in the country. Even in our state there have been instances of mob lynchings… This incident is unfortunate and very tragic,’’ said Thackeray. He also called for arrest and action against those who were spreading lies and hate on social media and said there was no communal angle to this attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/palghar-lynching-sparks-war-of-words-between-sena-and-bjp/story-ugPlvHSjOewOxFJ3WO0mRO.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||Don’t give communal colour to Palghar mob lynching, says CM||Amid the uproar over the lynching of three men in Palghar last week, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday warned of strict action against those trying to give religious colour to the incident. He asserted that those involved in the incident will not be spared and Criminal Investigation Department’s (CID) chief Atulchandra Kulkarni will conduct a high-level probe.On April 16, two sadhus and their driver were lynched to death by a huge mob outside Gadhchinchale village, 110km from Palghar, on the suspicion of being child-lifters. It later emerged that the sadhus — 70-year-old Swami Kalpvriksha Giri and 35-year-old Sushil Giri — belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were on their way to Gujarat to attend the last rites of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri. “The police have arrested more than 100 suspects, including five key accused responsible for the incident. The key accused have remanded in police custody till April 30. We have suspended two policemen, holding them responsible for the incident,” said the CM. He said he has spoken to Union home minister Amit Shah and apprised him of the details of the case. “Even Amitbhai Shah knows that the incident had no religious connection as the village in which the incident took place has no such background. Even he has admitted it. I have requested him to take strict action against people fanning passions and trying to spread communal tension using social media. Those active on social media never bear the brunt of the repercussions, but they cannot go scot-free now,” Thackeray said on Facebook Live.He also said the two sadhus had reached Union territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli, but the authorities did not allow them to enter and hence they were forced to return through internal roads. “The persons killed were sent back from the border of the Dadra-Nagar Haveli amid the lockdown restrictions. Had they been given shelter by the authorities or coordinated with us, this could have been averted,” he said.Thackeray, who also spoke in Hindi, said he has also spoken to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath over the incident. Taking a potshot at the leaders of the opposition Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), who have attacked the government for the incident, Thackeray reminded them about incidents of mob lynching during the government under Devendra Fadnavis. “I do not want to play politics over the issue.Lynching is not the culture of Maharashtra. But this is not the first incident of lynching in the state. Similar incidents have taken place in Dhule, Chandrapur in the past five years,” he said.BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said his party has not politicised the incident, but the lynching was politically patronised. “Palghar district council president belonging to the Nationalist Congress Party and panchayat samiti members belonging to the left parties were present when the incident took place. Most of the arrested accused are from the Left parties. There is direct involvement of political leaders and highlighting facts cannot be termed politicisation,” he said.While reacting to CM Thackeray’s reference to the lynching during the five-year rule of Fadnavis government, Bhandari said, “The Shiv Sena was part of the Fadnavis government and they were equally responsible for those cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-give-communal-colour-to-palghar-mob-lynching-says-cm/story-Et2A37BG9Rb5UuhY4FJtuN.html
20-04-2020||City||4 positive patients test negative within 24 hours, Vij marks inquiry||Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Monday ordered an inquiry after four patients tested negative within 24 hours of being declared infected. All the patients had tested positive on Saturday and Sunday as per the reports of a private lab based in Gurugram. However, results from government labs have confirmed their negative report on Monday.The district health department received the latest reports of three family members from Shahzadpur town, who had tested positive on Sunday. They were the contacts of Panchkula doctor who had been treating a positive patient. Besides them, the department also got a second negative report of an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) worker who had tested positive on Saturday as per the reports of the said Gurugram private lab. She was discharged from the hospital on Monday.Talking about the decision, Anil Vij said, “I’ve issued an enquiry after this disparity in Covid-19 reports came to my notice and have asked the additional chief secretary (health) Rajiv Arora to constitute a team to investigate this matter. I’ve also ordered not to send any sample for testing at this private lab forthwith.”“The private lab was approved by the central government. This disparity is a serious issue as the SOP (standard operating procedure) was strictly followed by the district administration and hospital authorities. The four patients were isolated and their residential areas were declared containment zones,” Vij added.ALL WERE ASYMPTOMATIC, SO SENT SAMPLES AGAIN: CMOChief medical officer (CMO) Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “Earlier, the ANM worker, who had tested positive as per the private lab’s report, was found to be asymptomatic, so we decided to send her samples again to a government lab and the tests turned out negative. To be double sure, before discharging her, we sent the samples to another government lab and she tested negative again. The same happened with the three latest cases from a family and they too were found asymptomatic. The same procedure was followed and their second reports are awaited. The same private lab had tested them positive.”On being asked about the possible reasons of the difference, he said, “Some extra sensitive machines show the results as ‘false positive’, but I think this should not happen at such a level. I’ve been asked by the additional chief secretary to investigate this whole matter and have informed other districts about this disparity from the lab. I’ll discuss this with public health experts and microbiologists before arriving at a conclusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-positive-patients-test-negative-within-24-hours-vij-marks-inquiry/story-gbGnQPTgVIvNOKceZToGcL.html

He has been wearing the same set of clothes and his bedsheet has not been changed either,” said Sandeep, adding that their mother had died on March 29, becoming the first Covid-19 casualty from the district.Complaining about no source of entertainment in the ward, Sandeep’s brother said, “It gets quite boring here as smartphones are not allowed inside the isolation ward. There is no television or radio here as well. I feel cut off from the outside world as I haven’t been able to catch up on the news.”He said that some patients have asked their relatives to get bedsheets from home.Already struggling with the illness, the Covid-19 patients have demanded to install washing machines in the ward so that they could wear clean clothes time to time and stay hygienic, as the department was reluctant to offer any help.On being contacted, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said there is a laundrette in the civil hospital and instructions have already been issued to the concerned hospital authorities that bedsheets and clothes of Covid-19 patients should be washed on regularly.NEW SMO’S THROAT SWAB TAKENA day after Dr Geeta Kataria joined as SMO of the Ludhiana civil hospital, her throat swab has been collected and sent for testing. Geeta underwent the test after she complained of a sore throat. She has been given leave till the test reports arrive.RAPID TESTING AT SABZI MANDIDeputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal said that huge quantity of rapid antibody testing kits have arrived and the testing process would be started in the area around Sabzi Mandi. On Sunday, Sabzi Mandi was sanitised. The decision of carrying out rapid testing was taken after the death of ACP Anil Kohli. Besides him, district mandi officer Jasvir Kaur, Jodhewal Basti SHO Arshpreet Kaur, her driver ASI Sukhdev Singh and constable Paramjot have also tested positive.ASI SHIFTED AS HIS HEALTH WORSENSASI Sukhdev Singh, who was isolated at the community health centre (CHC) near Vardhman Chowk in Sector 39 after testing positive, was rushed to SPS Hospital after his health deteriorated due to the lack of healthcare and power outage at the CHC. After the matter came to the authorities, a hotline was installed at the CHC to end the problem power cuts.FOUR DEATHS OVER THE WEEKENDThree persons, including a 30-year-old woman from Satjot Nagar, 35-year-old man from Rarri Mohalla and 55-year-old man from Ramgarhia Mohalla died under mysterious circumstances at the civil hospital on Saturday, while a 27-year-old youth, Sunny, died due to multiple organ failure on Sunday night.

On Saturday, the varsity started a community kitchen in their Kalina campus, with the help of city NGOs as well as the Bandra collectorate’s office. “We got in touch with the Bandra collector and shared the idea of opening another community kitchen, especially for the migrant workers. With his permission, we decided to use Garware canteen at Kalina as a community kitchen. The food will then be distributed amongst those in need,” said Ajay Deshmukh, registrar, MU. For starters, food grains including rice and lentils have been provided by the Bandra collectorate office itself, while other grocery items including vegetables have been provided by NGO Chingari Shakti Foundation. “Even gas cylinders are being provided by the NGO, Human Rights Foundation, whereas MU is providing manpower and other services,” added DeshmukhBy the third day since it’s conception, hundreds of food packets have been delivered from the kitchen to migrant communities living in and around Kalina and Vakola areas. “We found out about 300 migrants from Manipur who are currently stuck in the city with no means of earning a living or transport to go back to their hometowns, so we started providing food to them as well,” said Deshmukh.To sustain this community kitchen, the university is also appealing to all staff and other acquaintances to donate for this cause either by pledging money or food grains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mu-initiates-community-kitchen-at-kalina-campus/story-usdGH9wHWLmNwRZlpSFXAL.html

For the last 10 years, the state government has not increased the stipend, which is one of the lowest in the country. They should hike it now when we are risking our lives while performing duty.” He added, “The state government has temporarily recruited doctors and medical staff as paid volunteers to fight against coronavirus. The government is ready to pay Rs 5,000 per day to private specialist doctors, Rs 3,500 to MBBS volunteers and Rs 1,000 to a staff nurse. But the government is not ready to give incentives to the junior doctors.”“I have done 18-hour shifts in past weeks because my senior doctors were on mandatory 14-day quarantine after coming in contact (without adequate protective equipment) with a Covid-19 patient. The junior doctors in other states are getting higher stipend and we also deserve to be paid more”, tweeted Dr Aryan Mehta of GMC Amritsar.Dr Bir Ghuman of GMC Patiala said, “We have started tweeting to Punjab CM to increase our monthly stipend. We are working with only face masks. We are more prone of getting infected.”“The government must increase our stipend and should give us incentive for fighting the battle against Covid-19,” said Dr Anchal from GMC Faridkot.Blurb: MBBS interns of govt medical colleges in Amritsar, Patiala and Faridkot, who get Rs 300 per day, demand hike in stipend||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fighting-on-frontline-junior-doctors-feel-discouraged-by-meagre-stipend/story-e6cp4Ulvfu4UBkSYxpnBkO.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||53 journos test positive for Covid-19 at health camp||Fifty-three journalists from across the city were confirmed to be positive for Covid-19 on Monday after they were tested at a health camp last week. Mayor Kishori Pednekar, who was also present at the event, tested negative for the coronavirus but has quarantined herself at the Mayor Bungalow in Byculla as a precautionary measure.The 53 infected are among 171 journalists whose swab samples were collected by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday, at a special health camp organised for media professionals. Pednekar interacted with journalists at the camp. In a video posted on Twitter, Pednekar said, “Even though I have tested negative, I will remain home quarantined for two weeks. All official work will be done from my home. My staff will also remain in the house under quarantine. After two days, we will get all the staff tested. At the end of two weeks, we will get all the staff tested again.” All 53 of the reporters, video journalists, and photojournalists who tested positive were asymptomatic. The BMC has decided to move them to a Covid care centre (CCC) in the western suburbs.Daksha Shah, BMC’s deputy executive health officer said on Monday evening, “BMC is working out the logistics of moving all 53 journalists to an institutional quarantine facility, where they will be observed over the next two weeks. We have set up a facility in the western suburbs with a doctor and a nurse on call to observe these persons. They can also self-report any symptoms.”The BMC received the results of the journalists’ tests on Monday morning and began calling them individually, asking them to stay put where ever they were. “When we informed these journalists, we told them not to leave their homes, offices, or whatever indoor rooms they were in until BMC healthcare staff reached there to move them to a hospital, as was initially planned,” said a civic official. “Some of the journalists volunteered to travel to a hospital, but were told them not to do so, as it would risk them coming in contact with at least a few more people on the way,” the official added.Families of these journalists have been placed under home quarantine for now and will be monitored for any symptoms over the next two weeks.On the seventh or eighth day from Thursday, BMC will collect samples of all family members of the 53 journalists. Amey Ghole, BMC’s health committee chairman said, “There is little point in testing family members before the seventh day.

20-04-2020||Lucknow||What led to change in plan for relaxation of lockdown in UP||A lot changed between two Sundays and that was enough to throw a spanner in the Uttar Pradesh government’s plans to relax the Covid-19 lockdown for a partial resumption of economic activities from Monday.On Sunday, April 12, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath held two meetings and spoke about lockdown relaxations.He said the state would look forward to initiating partial relaxation in the lockdown to support economic activities. These meetings were held with cabinet members and the Covid-19 management Team-11.At that time, the chief minister had been highlighting that Uttar Pradesh was doing far better than other states on Covid-19 containment, despite being the most populous state.Initially, the date for partial relaxation was April 15, the end of the first phase of the lockdown, but then it was extended to April 20.But, things were not looking up by Friday, April 17, when the chief minister held a meeting with district magistrates and district police chiefs.The chief minister expressed displeasure over violation of the lockdown, rising number of Tablighi Jamaat related Covid-19 infections, and an overall rise in positive cases.He got his feedback on the situation from the state intelligence wing, Covid control rooms and CCTV footage. The next day, additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi sent a letter to all the district magistrates and the district police chiefs, noting that the performance of 40 of the 75 districts was ‘unsatisfactory’ in adherence to the lockdown.All the high Covid-19 incidence districts fell in this category-- Agra, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Lucknow, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Kanpur. The letter had set the tone for the state to rethink the proposed relaxations in lockdown.The primary criteria on which the districts’ performance was gauged were: high number of Covid-19 cases, high number of Tablighi Jamaat members, attacks on police and healthcare providers.The number of positive cases rose drastically in several districts between the two Sundays. For instance, Agra had 104 cases on April 12 and the number rose to 240 by April 19. Lucknow’s case count jumped from 32 to 165, Gautam Buddha Nagar’s from 64 to 95; Ghaziabad’s from 27 to 41, Meerut’s from 51 to 74 and Saharanpur’s from 28 to 72. The number of total positive cases in the state shot up from 483 to 1,100.The death toll went up from five on April 12 to 17 on April 19, according to state health department figures.Additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said: “The idea behind the communication to the districts was to make the underperforming districts get their act together, go intensive in the containment of Covid-19 and wage a war against the virus to eradicate it from Uttar Pradesh.”Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday (April 19) night made it clear to district magistrates that there would be no easing of the lockdown in hotspots and asked the principal secretary, health, not to open 19 sensitive districts, which have reported 10 or more coronavirus cases each. Issuing these instructions at separate meetings, he empowered district magistrates to take a call on lockdown relaxations. He underscored that DMs of 19 sensitive districts should decide on the basis of ‘awareness and alertness’ after intimating the government.All the district magistrates announced the status quo on the lockdown and continued the restrictions as they were.On Monday evening, the additional chief secretary announced: “The state now has 322 hotspots.”HOW CASES JUMPED IN SEVEN DAYSThe number of positive cases rose drastically in several districts between the two Sundays. For instance, Agra had 104 cases on April 12 and the number rose to 240 by April 19. Lucknow’s case count jumped from 32 to 165 during the same period, Gautam Buddha Nagar from 64 to 95; Ghaziabad from 27 to 41; Meerut from 51 to 74 and Saharanpur from 28 to 72. The number of total positive cases in the state rose drastically--from 483 to 1,100.The death toll went up from five on April 12 to 17 on April 19, according to state health department figures.40 UNSATISFACTORY LOCKDOWN DISTRICTSMeerut, Baghpat, Hapur, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahar, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Agra, Mathura, Firozabad, Mainpuri, Bareilly, Badaun, Moradabad, Bijnor, Rampur, Amroha, Sambhal, Lucknow, Kheri, Rae Bareli, Sitapur, Barabanki, Sultanpur, Kanpur City, Kanpur Dehat, Kannauj, Jalaun, Prayagraj, Pratapgarh, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Kushinagar, Basti, Gonda, Bahraich and Balrampur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/what-led-to-change-in-plan-for-relaxation-of-lockdown-in-up/story-lPrEaWbK6pscqVXqY0A9WJ.html

20-04-2020||City||Most firms remain shut as Capt govt flip flops on order||Even as 700 odd units in the state’s financial capital, Ludhiana, continue to function amid a month-long curfew in Punjab, no other industrial unit in the city and other parts of the state could start operations on Monday.Revising its order on not allowing any relaxation in curfew in the state till May 3, except for wheat procurement, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday asked the deputy commissioners to oversee opening of industrial units in non-containment areas in compliance with the government’s April 18 instructions .Though some of Ludhiana’s over 95,000 units were expected to resume functioning, the district administration, in a late evening decision, rescinded an earlier order permitting relaxations. The U-turn by the administration followed chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s orders to continue with the restrictions.About 99% of Ludhiana’s industry, known for manufacturing bicycles, bicycle parts, sewing machines and hosiery, will remain closed until at least May 3.TEXTILE INDUSTRY MAKING PPE KITSThe silver lining in a grim situation, however, has been some enterprising innovations. A section of Ludhiana’s famed textile industry has diversified to making personal protective equipment (PPE) in bulk. Currently, 15 textile firms located in the city have been accorded approval by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to make personal protective equipment (PPEs).Permission had been accorded for manufacture of essential commodities, including bread, biscuits, packaging, pharmaceuticals and PPEs on a daily basis. There are currently 600 units for manufacturing essential commodities and around 100 units for some non-essential commodities that had been given permission earlier to function.Ludhiana is home to about 95,000 micro, small and medium industrial units (SMEs) and about 250 large-scale units.BICYCLE UNITS UNABLE TO RESUME WORKLudhiana’s bicycle industry, which forms 80% of India’s bicycle manufacturing and home to giants such as Hero and Avon among others, remained closed as industrialists expressed their inability to start work because of the strict guidelines imposed by the administration.They also said sustaining would be difficult in the absence of demand in these times. “Where are the shops (retailers) to sell bicycles? What will we do even if we start manufacturing cycles?” asked SS Bhogal, managing partner of Bhogal Sales Corporation, a major bicycle manufacturer in the city.Bhogal also said strict safety guidelines imposed by the administration were not feasible.SK Rai, managing director of Hero Cycles, said there is no question of them re-opening their unit before May 3. “There are strict restrictions on transport. Re-opening in these times is just not feasible,” he said.The president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), DS Chawla felt it was not possible to function with conditions such as quarantining of the labour imposed by the administration. Likewise, the president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), Upkar Ahuja, said nothing could be gained by opening a certain sector or industry amid a lockdown until the complete chain was permitted to operate. The industry would need raw material and a functional market to sell products.However, Ludhiana DC Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said the decision to recall the order permitting relaxations was taken to keep the situation under control. The district has so far witnessed five Covid -19 deaths, including that of an assistant commissioner of police and a revenue department official. There are currently 14 Covid-19 cases in the district.No unit gets permission in Jalandhar, AmritsarMeanwhile, no industrial unit was given permission to resume operations in Amritsar and Jalandhar on Monday.Jalandhar industries department general manger Bhola Singh Brar said, “We have received nearly 100 applications from different industrial units seeking and still looking into them.”Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said permissions will be granted as per the state government guidelines. There are around 12,000 industrial units in the district that manufacture auto and spare parts, sports, rubber, food and others.In Amritsar, officials said they have got a few applications but they are scrutinising them to send them to higher authorities.450 PLEAS REJECTED IN BATHINDAMeanwhile, the Bathinda administration has rejected 450 pleas from industrialists and traders seeking to resume their operation received so far. The district has about 150 room cooler manufacturing units.Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said the top priority for the administration is to ensure that the district continues to remain free from Covid-19.In Gurdaspur, district magistrate (DM) Mohammad Ishfaq said banks will remain open from 10 am to 4pm for public and industries will be allowed to open as per the guidelines.(With inputs from Jalandhar, Amritsar, and Gurdaspur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/most-firms-remain-shut-as-capt-govt-flip-flops-on-order/story-m0xAPhd7lrtUJm6gUEczqI.html
20-04-2020||City||Delhi hospitals to set up media cell||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Monday directed all hospital administrations to set up a media cell to monitor the social media after a video tweeted by a young girl, demanding prompt action into alleged mishandling by Lok Nayak hospital staff went viral. Pratibha Gupta took to twitter on Monday morning urging authorities in a video message to help her Covid-19 positive father admitted at Lok Nayak hospital. The family had taken the patient to one of the private hospitals in the city on April 16 after he had fainted. “The hospital suspected that he had corona and tested him. When the test came positive, he was shifted to Lok Nayak hospital. We were told that this was as per the government orders. He had to wait for two or three hours for admission and he did not get any meal till next morning. He has diabetes and hypertension,” said Gupta in a video message.She alleged that her father had 102 degrees fever on Monday morning, but no one attended him, she said.“Senior doctor of COVID19 team has consulted the patient, already. Shifting the patient will not be feasible at this hour. The highest of authorities, along with the Health Min @SatyendarJain has been monitoring this,” said Shaleen Mitra, officer on special duty to the government, in a tweet.Health department officials said all Delhi government hospitals will now have media cells to present the factual position from the hospital’s side regarding posts about services on social media.The girl later took to twitter again in the evening thanking people for the support and updating about her father’s condition in another video message. “Thankyou everybody !! My father is safe and his test samples have been collected. He has been alloted a separate room and is under constant supervision of supreme doctors. I had a talk with him recently and he is feeling much better now,” the girl said in a tweet from her sister Shweta Gupta’s account. Lok Nayak hospital has constituted a fact finding committee regarding the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hospitals-to-set-up-media-cell/story-pxR32M4hcyWL12Ch7gjElK.html
20-04-2020||City||Keeping fingers crossed to maintain covid-free status, says Bathinda DC||Bathinda With samples of 129 persons it has tested so far coming out negative, and reports of three awaited, district authorities put their covid-free status to chance. “Our effort is to scan every symptomatic person. Adjoining districts in Punjab and Haryana have coronavirus patients and we are maintaining a strict watch to ensure no unauthorised person enters Bathinda. We are keeping our fingers crossed,” says deputy commissioner B Srinivasan.Mohan Pal Singh Ishar, vice-chancellor of Bathinda-based Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University (MRSPTU) said, “Though it is tough, but we should not mind staying back more few more days for larger public health. Media deserves high appreciation for creating mass awareness. District authorities are playing a constructive role. Social distancing is the key.”Vice-chancellor of Central University of Punjab Prof RK Kohli said strict enforcement of lockdown will yield desirable results. “The district authorities’ effort of easy availability of essential commodities makes things easier. Though Bathinda is lucky not to have a single case, we should not have a casual approach. It is important to chalk out a post-Covid-19 screening programme when large groups of students and teachers will gather in the next few weeks,” he adds. Public health rights activist Dr Vitull K Gupta says city residents must practise strict social distancing not only for themselves, but for safety of slum dwellers. “During my free medical camps in urban slums around the city, I have seen that for the underprivileged hand hygiene is the key, as they are not sensitised towards social distancing,” he adds.For farm-dependent Fazilka, fewer number of NRIs might have helpedGathering of wheat growers and vegetable traders at mandis is a cause of concern for residents of Fazilka district on the Indo-Pakistan border. Of 110 samples taken, 97 have been negative with rest awaited. A cross-section of residents favour no relaxation in curfew. They credit a fewer number of NRIs from the district behind the clean slate. However, with the wheat procurement season in the semi-arid region set to pick up next week, locals favour stricter enforcement of social distancing.A farm rights activist and entrepreneur from Fazilka town Vikram Ahuja says the district has a farm-dependent economy. “Curfew is no problem for farmers, but the administration should ensure that wheat procurement is done while following social distancing,” says Ahuja.Chairman of Punjab State Farmers’ Commission Ajay Vir Jakhar, a resident of Abohar, also favours no unnecessary relaxation in curfew. “Our main winter crop of kinnow is almost harvested. Wheat growers entering mandi should follow social distancing norms,” adds Jakhar.For 28-year-old kinnow orchardist Geet Setia, the interstate movement of transportation is worrying. He wants the administration to strengthen door-to-door supply of essentials to check large gatherings at Abohar vegetable market. “Fazilka is a gateway for transporters from Gujarat via Sriganganagar in Rajasthan. A large number of vehicles carrying fruits and vegetables from other states enter Punjab from here. A single unchecked case in mandis can trigger a number of cases,” he says. DC Arvind Pal Singh Sandhu said, “Fazilka is lucky to have no cases, we are making efforts to screen every person entering the district. Data of vehicles and those travelling with any consignment is being maintained.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/keeping-fingers-crossed-to-maintain-covid-free-status-says-bathinda-dc/story-2gdqFuBTQuehk9spKmsijP.html

20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Will be difficult to operate industries under new rules, businessmen tell Haryana govt||Entrepreneurs from Haryana on Monday sought a more affirmative approach from the state government to resume industrial operations in the state during the ongoing lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19. JN Mangla, president of Gurgaon Industrial Association said the government seems to be in an ambiguity over the resumption of industrial activity.“The impression that I get is that the government does not want economic activity to be resumed. They just want to bide time till May 3. The conditions imposed make it practically impossible for us to run our businesses smoothly,” he said.Mangla said the industry is apprehensive about the provisions of challan and prosecution. A Panipat exporter, Amit Goel said the guidelines did not seem to be practical. “We should be allowed to start administrative operations by allowing 3-4 persons from the management staff. Subsequently, permission to scale up the manufacturing can be given. Also, we suggest that workers who want to come on bike or cycle should be allowed. That’s better than bringing them in buses,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-be-difficult-to-operate-industries-under-new-rules-businessmen-tell-haryana-govt/story-CufknPSDxZpktqrNRpBTYJ.html
20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Government schools in Chandigarh record 20% spike in Class 9, 11 results||Government schools in Chandigarh have registered a 20% rise in the number of students who have cleared examinations for Classes 9 and 11 compared to last year.The results were announced by the education department on virtual platforms on Monday. In 2019, 55% students passed the Class 9 examinations, whereas this year, it is 72.2%. For Class 11, 70.5% passed last year, while this year, it is 95.15%. All students have been awarded 30 grace marks in all subjects they were unable to clear. The additional advantage was awarded due to academic disruption caused by classes being suspended amid the Covid-19 lockdown. A teacher of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 16, said, “Giving a student the bare minimum grace marks to make them pass is understandable, but, 30 grace marks per subject is too much. This is as good as tampering with the results.”Apart from the grace marks, the department has also given students a chance to reappear for the subjects in which they have compartments. In class 11, 14,000 students appeared for the examination, of which 560 got compartments. In Class 9, 12,000 students appeared and 4,100 have to reappear for exams.District education officer, Alka Mehta said, “We have not failed any student. Those with reappears have to take compartment examinations after May 15, the datesheet for which will be shared.” A teacher’s union leader said, “Even students who will be appearing in compartment exams will be awarded the additional 30 grace marks. This decision will be promoting incompetency in schools. Education department decided to discontinue the practice of grace marks last year, then why has it been started again? The syllabus was completed long before the schools were closed and exams were also conducted in peace.”Director school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We have helped our students and their parents during these difficult times. We don’t want to put them through any additional stress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/government-schools-in-chandigarh-record-20-spike-in-class-9-11-results/story-kPpN1MlUxB0ZeBBM93p9nL.html
20-04-2020||Patna||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar announces relief measures for people in Covid-19 camps||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said people staying in disaster relief camps within the state during coronavirus prompted lockdown will get utensils, clothes, milk and other facilities like that given at the time of flood.In addition to providing quality food at the camps to daily wage earners, cart vendors, rickshaw pullers and other needy persons, the government will give them other amenities as given in the flood relief camps, Kumar said in an official release.Kumar gave a direction to this effect at a high level meeting to review measures taken to contain spread of COVID-19 in Bihar.Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar and a host of other senior officials were present during the meeting.Faced with floods frequently, the state government has laid down rules for comfortable stay of victims of inundation in relief camps set up at the time of the calamity.The chief minister took stock of the door-to-door screening campaign for the infection, distribution of Rs 1,000 to ration card holding families and wheat procurement.Kumar instructed officials to increase the number of relief camps in different parts of the state as per requirement.The CM assured those stranded outside the state that they need not worry about their relatives back home as the state government is taking proper care of the people.Over 50 state-funded camps are functioning in Delhi, Mumbai and other parts of the country for migrants held up during nationwide lockdown.The door-to-door screening on the pattern of pulse polio campaign is underway in the virus affected districts, he said, adding 1386 people had symptoms of general disease like cold, cough and fever out of 36.14 lakh households surveyed so far under the drive.The screening drive should be extended to other parts of the state, Kumar told the officials.The CM said figures related to Covid-19 suggest that enforcement of lockdown has helped a lot in containing the spread of infection besides protecting citizens from other diseases.Kumar gave directions to expedite the wheat procurement through PACS (Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society) so that farmers can get handsome price for their produce.He also asked officials to provide Rs 1000 assistance and other facilities to those whose applications for ration cards have been found valid during the verification.Kumar appealed to the people to be alert and beware of those spreading rumours related to the virus on social media.The social media cell of Bihar police is not only keeping a tab on rumour-mongers but is also taking action against them.The CM said a diligent obedience of social distancing will help overcome challenges of coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, the CM expressed grief at death of a ASHA worker from snake bite in course of door-to-door campaign to indentify virus infectants in Nawada district and gave an instruction to pay Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the victim’s family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-announces-relief-measures-for-people-in-covid-19-camps/story-UHvLuhAXgLGKgeYnWYaHTO.html
20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Be practical, have trust in us: Haryana entrepreneurs to govt||Entrepreneurs from Haryana on Monday sought a more affirmative approach from the state government to resume industrial operations in the state. Industrialists and their associations said that instead of threatening prosecution, the government should trust them to follow the standard operating protocols and other measures.Jagan Nath Mangla, president of Gurgaon Industrial Association (GIA), a body having around 400 big, medium and small industries as members, said that the state government itself seems to be in some ambiguity over the resumption of industrial activity.“The impression which I am getting from the GIA members is that the government does not want economic activity to be resumed. They just want to bide time till May 3. The kind of conditions which have been imposed makes it practically impossible to run the enterprise smoothly,” he said.Mangla said that there is unavailability of labour as most of them are either in camps or have gone back home. Those in camps need to be contacted. Making arrangements for boarding and lodging is a difficult task and maintaining social distance is a challenge, he said.“The industry is apprehensive about the provisions of challan and prosecution. The government has not been able to give confidence to the industrialists,” Mahal remarked.Not wanting to be named, another Gurgaon-based entrepreneur said providing masks, maintaining social distancing and making hand sanitisers available to the staff is their duty. “But the government should be able to infuse confidence. The message which is required from the government is that they are supportive. Why is there so much confusion,” he asked.An exporter from Panipat, Amit Goel said that the guidelines do not seem to be practical. “The kind of details being asked from the industry is complicating the process. They should have allowed us to start operations by filling a simple application. Only 3-4 persons from the management staff could be allowed in the beginning to start administrative operations. Subsequently, we can be scrutinised and allowed to scale up the manufacturing. The government should trust us. Also, we suggest that workers who want to come on bike or cycle should be allowed. That’s better than bringing them in buses,” said Goel.A Faridabad-based manufacturer, who also requested anonymity, said the government needed to take some immediate short-run measures to kick-start the economy. “I am concerned about prices of raw material and costs of freight getting shot up. An artificial shortage has been created due to non-functioning of the supply chain. The government should come up with guidelines to regulate pricing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/be-practical-have-trust-in-us-haryana-entrepreneurs-to-govt/story-0xkljERuuZrZPFUXZ3FwFI.html
20-04-2020||City||Restricted access, strict vigil & people’s support keeping virus at bay in Tarn Taran||The administration acting forthwith and police maintaining strict vigil have played a key role in keeping the district secure from Covid-19, say health experts.“Besides the administration’s dedication, people have also been supportive. Most of the district’s villages have been sealed by the volunteers, who are not allowing outsiders to enter,” said Dr Samsher Singh, former civil surgeon of Tarn Taran.Tarn Taran deputy commissioner (DC) Pardeep Kumar Sabharwal had started holding back-to-back meetings with the officials of various departments, asking them to remain available “24x7” in the district, way before the alert of possible spreading of the disease was sounded in Punjab.Similarly, when the curfew was enforced, the police sealed the Tarn Taran’s borders with its neighbouring districts — Kapurthala, Amritsar and Ferozepur. “We have given only one access to the district from the Amritsar-Bathinda national highway and movement of only essential services is allowed from this point,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya.Soon after the curfew, the SSP had directed his force to deliver daily meals to the needy at their doorstep so that no one would come out of their homes, besides staying guard. He himself, with the help of NGOs, approached various slum areas to ensure the distribution of ration.“Our village-level officers not only made the residents aware, but also enforced the law strictly,” said the SSP.All slum areas have been screened and daily announcements on social distancing are being made from the gurdwaras, the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restricted-access-strict-vigil-people-s-support-keeping-virus-at-bay-in-tarn-taran/story-O2IUP29C3zMxpyLhptN03L.html

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) opened the flyover after five months, during which repair work was carried out. A chunk had fallen off the structure once in 2018 and again in 2019. The NHAI contractor at the site said that after they had opened the flyover, all restrictions that were put in place below the structure were also lifted. Rakesh Mathur, deputy manager, Valecha Engineering Limited, the contractor for the project, said, “With the opening of the flyover, we had removed all the restrictions that were put in place below the flyover.” He said that vehicular traffic was allowed to move straight from Sector 10 to Subhash Chowk but the traffic police put all the restrictions back in place under the flyover. Traffic police officials said that they harve closed the carriageway as there is less traffic on this route presently. Also, in the coming days, as the traffic volume increases, they will open the flyover. Azad Singh of traffic police station-1, said, “We saw that there was less traffic on the carriageway. Further, we have been instructed to check each vehicle. Although, there are two checkpoints below the flyover, if a vehicle travels towards Delhi on the flyover then it is hard to check it .” On April 16, traffic police officials had put back the plastic jersey barriers in front of the carriageway. “NHAI has nothing to do with the closure of the carriageway. The decision was taken by us. We will open the flyover once traffic volume increases,” added Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-traffic-police-closes-hero-honda-chowk-flyover-a-day-after-it-was-opened-to-public/story-OkbaNvDAfyrc6qQiX7N29L.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||Over 50 daily wagers stranded without ration, wages in Jor Bagh||Over 50 daily wagers, including some women and children stranded at a Delhi government school under-construction site at south Delhi’s Jor Bagh, have been struggling to get two square meals a day. The workers said that they have not been paid ever since all work was halted post-lockdown and have nearly exhausted their savings. They have been approaching the local authorities but to no avail.The group includes 37 men, eight women and six children. They have been trying to reach out to agencies to help them with dry ration so that they can cook their own meals, as they are not able to get food on a daily basis from the nearest food distribution centre and have to sleep hungry at times.Saddam Hussein, 22, who came to Delhi just a year ago and has been working on the site, said that the contractor has not even asked them about their well-being, let alone provide help. “We haven’t got our wages for last month. We tried reaching out to the contractor. He did assure us of help, but nothing happened. All of us have almost run out of money. Initially, we could manage, but now there are days when we have to do with very little food or just go hungry,” Hussein, who belongs to West Bengal, said.He added that the queue at the nearest food distribution centre is long and the portions they get are little. There are days the centre runs out of food while people are still in the queue.His wife Raina (who goes by her first name) said that she has two children aged 5 and 3, but she hasn’t been able to get milk for them for days. “It is like we are being punished for being labourers,” she said.“It is better that we get some dry ration so that we can cook. I heard it was being distributed for free, but we don’t know how to go about it. We don’t step out much except for going to the hunger centre for fear of the police hauling us up,” Javed Akhtar, 28, who belongs to Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur, said.He added that a sanitation worker in the area helped the group approach an NGO working for the homeless, which finally came to their rescue on Monday.“I got several calls from people stuck here on Sunday. They are not registered with the labour welfare board. We are trying to get through the local administration to get them help to survive the rest of the lockdown period,” Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist working for the homeless and founder of Centre for Holistic Development (CHD), said. Meanwhile, a senior official from the Delhi government’s labour department, who did not wish to be named, said, “We will definitely ask the employer regarding the disbursement of wages. We will also ensure food/ration reaches them at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/over-50-daily-wagers-stranded-without-ration-wages-in-jor-bagh/story-OETwyzgnsaaPscKzujydOK.html

The two high-rises will now be identified as epicentres. An area of 5km radius from the hot spot, which has a population of about 32,000, will now be under real-time monitoring.” The officials said that the regular sanitization of the area will be done with the help of local agencies. “Under real time monitoring, our 60 teams will randomly go for door-to-door survey in order to find out suspected cases. In case need be, we will also take up random sampling of such suspected cases,” Gupta said.The real-time monitoring in Ghaziabad is being carried out in 21 different areas ,which now include areas of Indirapuram, the officials said, adding that the district has a total of 15 hot spots .On Sunday, KDP Grand Savana at Raj Nagar Extension and Girnar Apartments in Kaushambi were moved out of the hot spot list.

He has also given directions for strict enforcement of lockdown norms in 19 districts (including Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaizabad) having 10 or more Covid-19 positive cases. The police and medical teams have been directed to take every precaution. The cops have been asked to mandatorily use mask, shield and gloves during duty,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).The officials said that 52 districts in the state have 1,176 Covid-19 positive cases, but eight other districts have not reported any active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/32-000-in-indirapuram-under-real-time-monitoring-after-3-covid-19-positive-cases-use-of-rapid-test-kits-on-hold/story-sbvirK5mM2stZIk78e9WlN.html
20-04-2020||City||Four new Covid cases in Ghaziabad, high-rises sealed, travel to Delhi banned||After 12 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases came to light in Ghaziabad on Sunday, the district on Monday saw another round of four fresh cases whose reports arrived on Monday. The Ghaziabad district magistrate then issued an order late Monday night under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act and prohibited travel between Ghaziabad and Delhi.“The order has been issued as there are six infected persons in Ghaziabad who have travelled to Delhi for various reasons. So, in order to avoid more residents being infected that wayß, we have prohibited travel between Ghaziabad and Delhi with immediate effect. Only people involved in essential supplies or valid pass holders will be allowed to move. This order will be applicable for all our borders with Delhi,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, said.The health department officials said that the fresh cases are people who have attended religious congregations or are receiving treatment from hospitals in neighbouring cities. They added that one of the four cases found positive on Monday was a 41-year-old woman from the ATS Advantage high-rise who was being treated for cancer at a Delhi hospital, while the three other positive cases were people who had attended religious congregations in Kolkata.“The four tested positive on Monday. One of the cases is a woman who is being treated for cancer. Our teams have sealed the tower of ATS Advantage where she lives. One tower of Niho Scottish high-rise, Indirapuram, was sealed on Monday after a Covid-19 positive case emerged on Sunday,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said.“The other three positive cases on Monday are persons who had attended religious congregations in Kolkata. Presently, most cases are related to such instances as well as to treatment from medical facilities outside the district. Cases nowadays are not related to people with travel histories,” Dr Gupta added.He added that three previous positive cases—two resident doctors of Max Hospital, Vaishali, and one male nurse (a resident of Oxy Home high-rise)—have now tested negative.“Two consecutive test reports of the three are negative. The two doctors will be discharged soon; the nurse has already been discharged. His neighbours had opposed his return, but we intervened with the help of administration officials and allowed him entry to his flat,” Dr Gupta added.On Monday afternoon, nurses and healthcare staff members of Sanjay Nagar staged a protest in a bid to get themselves quarantined in hotels.“They were demanding that all of them should be allowed to stay at a hotel we have hired. But we made it clear to them that only those attending to Covid patients will be allowed to quarantine themselves after duty hours. Others will not be allowed,” Dr Naresh Vij, chief medical officer of Sanjay Nagar hospital, said.Meanwhile, officials of the Uttar Pradesh government said that about 3,000 people who attended religious congregations have been identified in 20 districts of the state. Besides this, there are about 325 foreigners who also attended religious congregations. They added that 45 FIRs have been filed against them so far for violating visa conditions.With the addition of four new cases, the tally of Covid-19 positive patients in Ghaziabad has risen to 46; and 13 of them have already been discharged. The district now has 14 hot spots; two areas—KDP Grand Savana, Raj Nagar Extension and Girnar Apartments, Kaushambi—were removed from the list of hot spots on Sunday.Across the state, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases stood at 1,176, with 139 of them having been discharged from various hospitals, said officials of the UP health department. They added that the positive cases have affected 52 districts so far.“There are eight districts in the state wherein there are no active cases left. But they have been told to continue monitoring and sanitising. We have also made arrangements for about 10,000 beds in isolation wards and 15,000 beds in quarantine wards so far. The L1 attached category hospitals to admit asymptomatic patients will also come up in every district. These are proposed to have 10,000 beds,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).According to the latest age profile of the Covid-19 cases in UP, 19.39% are in the age group of 0-20 years, while the highest, 48.04%, are in the age group of 21-40 years.

20-04-2020||City||Navjot Sidhu finally wears mask in public||After defying Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s order of mandatorily wearing a mask in public a number of times in recent days, Congress MLA from Amritsar (East) Navjot Singh Sidhu made an appearance with his face, nose and mouth masked with a handkerchief on Monday. He, accompanied by local councillors, distributed ration to the needy in Daburji area, on the outskirts of the city. Last week, he had visited Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, which is part of Government Medical College, Amritsar, thrice to distribute masks, PPE kits, etc to health personnel and others, without a mask. When questioned, Sidhu had said according to World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, wearing a mask was not required for a healthy person. On Friday, the CM had ordered strict action against anyone violating his government’s orders on wearing a mask. On whether the course correction had anything to do with the CM’s reiterating of his order, Sidhu repeated his WHO argument, adding, “If our government wants me to wear a mask, I have no objection to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navjot-sidhu-finally-wears-mask-in-public/story-Uty3Oso0LzMMqUljee20kO.html
20-04-2020||Noida||GB Nagar labour dept launches app to locate migrant workers, transfer them ₹1,000||There are nearly 38,000 registered daily wage earners in Gautam Budh Nagar district, but the labour department is unable to locate even half of them to transfer a monthly financial assistance of ₹1,000 to help them tide over the lockdown and lack of employment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, to get the bank details of remaining workers, the district labour department has recently launched a mobile app, on which the workers can upload their bank details themselves.The amount is being paid to workers as a direct benefit transfer (DBT) on the orders of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, on March 21. He had ordered that ₹1,000 be provided to each of the 20.37 lakh construction workers registered with the labour department and to each of the 15 lakh self-employed cart owners, small shop owners and rickshaw pullers on an immediate basis. The amount, funded by the labour cess , will be transferred to their accounts as DBT.Gautam Budh Nagar deputy commissioner (labour) Pradeep Kumar Singh said of the 38,000 bona fide workers registered with his department, the bank account numbers of only 18,000 were available. “The amount of ₹1,000 has already been transferred to each of these accounts. To locate the remaining workers, we have launched a mobile application ‘UPBOCW’, which is the abbreviation of Uttar Pradesh Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board. After downloading this application, the workers will be asked to fill their registration and Aadhaar numbers. Thereafter, they will get a one-time password (OTP) and after entering the OTP, they will be eligible for the DBT,” he said.Surprisingly, contrary to the figures given by the state labour department on its website, which shows 1,46,380 under ‘last year renewal eligible labour’, the district labour department claims that only about 38,000 of them are bona fide. “Most of those overall figures are from when registrations were done manually with the labour department, prior to the digitisation. So, we are considering only those who have registered with their Aadhaar numbers,” Singh said. He also said since most construction workers in the district are mostly migrants, his department is working hard to locate all of them. “While all construction companies and other firms have been asked to share their workers’ bank account details, we are also making calls and sending messages on numbers available with the labour department,” he said. Singh further said that unlike other districts of Uttar Pradesh, Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a large number of MGNREGA workers. “The labour department is repeatedly making appeals, through all business establishments in Gautam Budh Nagar, to all workers, asking them not to leave for the home towns,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-labour-dept-launches-app-to-locate-migrant-workers-transfer-them-1-000/story-meCMKtEAvNFa38sekbH6kN.html

20-04-2020||Noida||With status quo on lockdown restrictions, small and medium business owners stare at an uncertain future||With no relaxation in lockdown restrictions in Gautam Budh Nagar, owners of many small and medium businesses in the district are now uncertain about their future.A three-week nationwide lockdown was imposed in the country on March 25 to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus diseases (Covid-19). The lockdown was subsequently extended till May 3, however, the Central government had suggested conditional relaxation in some lockdown norms from April 20. After a video conference with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, which was attended by all district magistrates in the state, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration decided to continue with the lockdown as it is, in light of the rising cases in the district. “Given the high number of hot spots in the district and the rising number of Covid-19 positive patients, the district has to be careful and precautionary measures need to stay in place. In light of this, businesses or commercial services, private or public, will not start. All citizens, officials, and workers will have to continue to follow the lockdown rules as before,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate in an order on Monday.While daily wage workers suffer amid the lockdown with no source of income, the business class is also incurring sizeable losses and small and medium business owners being the worst hit.“For now everything is at a standstill. We continue to pay our employees who have been with us for years, while we are not generating any income. The gravity of the situation will hit us when the store will eventually be opened,” said Anita Singh, owner of a stationery shop in Sector 18.“ Many offices, that have been allowed to operate, keep contacting us for stationary, but we are unable to supply them with anything because of the lockdown,” said Singh adding that despite students being in need of basic stationery items and notebooks for their online classes, many shopkeepers like her are unable to provide them. The retail sector in the district has taken a huge hit, and many business owners believe that their problems will not end even when the lockdown will be lifted.“ We are only spending money and not generating any income. Even if the lockdown is lifted next month, the consumers will not rush to shops to buy items. There will be no gatherings any time soon. People will prefer to purchase goods online. We will need a lot of outside economic help to restore the balance. At least, for the rest of this year, buying shoes and garments will not be a priority for anyone,” said Sachin Paul, owner of a shoe shop.There are about seven crore traders in the country out of which 15 million traders deal in essential commodities.“Due to the lockdown, between March 25 and April 14, the retail trade has suffered losses to the tune of ₹3.15 lakh crore,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, convener, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Delhi-NCR. Amid the lockdown, most shopkeepers and business owners who deal with non-essential services and items have not been able to check in on their stocks for more than three weeks.“Electronics, garments among other things require regular maintenance, but that is not an option during the lockdown. Even after the lockdown is lifted, the situation won’t go back to normal for months, and some businesses may never be able to recover at all. The most affected are the small and medium business owners,” said Jain who is also the president of Sector 18 market association.For smaller businesses, the economic crisis has hit their means of survival. Neelam Devi, who ran a tea stall with her husband in B block, Sector 63, has been trying to make ends meet for her family for over a month now. “There were so many offices around that the tea stall always had people coming over. We had a steady income and would make around ₹1,200 on a good day. But now we have no idea when will we be able to get back on our feet and set up our stall again. We have four children and we don’t know how will we continue to feed them. We are from Bihar, and we could neither return home nor do we have any means to earn now. It took us four days to get ration from the government,” said Neelam. “We have received a food packet from the government which has rice, wheat, pulses, mustard oil, and salt. It should last us for about 8 to 10 days.”Suman Rai, an electrician who lives in Shahdara village, Sector 141 was hopeful of starting his work again after he had heard that the lockdown might be relaxed from April 20. “I stay with my nephew in Noida, and with no work, for almost a month all my savings have dried up. We got free ration once about two weeks ago, but it has also finished. With no money and no work, it’s becoming very difficult to survive. Although many of my clients are calling me for repairing jobs and other things, I cannot do anything because of the lockdown,” said Rai, who is from Samastipur in Bihar. Rai used to earn more than ₹25,000 per month and had employed a daily wager to help him out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-status-quo-on-lockdown-restrictions-small-and-medium-business-owners-stare-at-an-uncertain-future/story-4nmeMSLHbeCXVjvKM7l8bL.html

20-04-2020||City||Greater Noida officials help UP man working in Jammu attend father’s funeral amid lockdown||GREATER NOIDA: Amid the nationwide lockdown imposed to mitigate the Covid-19 spread, senior officials of the Greater Noida authority and the district police have helped a teacher working in Jammu, who is a native of Uttar Pradesh, to perform last rites of his father in his hometown Lakhimpur Khiri.Distressed Hindi teacher Ashish Kumar working with Kendriya Vidyalaya in Jammu sought help after he came to know that his father passed away in Lakhimpur Khiri.“We received a call on April 18 at 7pm from the teacher from Jammu. Being the eldest son, he wanted to perform the last rites of his father and reach on time. We immediately took steps to help him,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority. The Uttar Pradesh government had on March 28 appointed Bhooshan as nodal officer to look after operations to take care of people from the state who got stuck in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh due to the nationwide lockdown. He has set up a call centre in Greater Noida authority office to handle calls from these states.Bhooshan called principal secretary for home (Jammu and Kashmir) Shaleen Kabra and asked for arranging a cab and lockdown pass. After getting instructions from Kabra, senior Jammu officials helped arrange a cab and pass at 8pm on April 18.“We spoke to officials of Jammu and ensured he not only gets a taxi but also a pass for the journey. The control room officials were given contact details of the person to ensure that he travels smoothly,” said Alok Singh, police commissioner of Gautam Budh Nagar.Kumar started his journey at 9pm with a driver named Narendra Singh. They travelled through Punjab and Haryana to reach UP’s Lakhimpur Khiri at 9.30am on April 19. The teacher travelled 990 km to perform his father’s last rites. After reaching his hometown, Kumar could not hold back his emotions and broke down while thanking officials. “Initially I thought I will not be able to perform last rites of my father due to lockdown. However, UP government officials made this possible,” said the teacher. “These two persons were only ones who travelled while following lockdown norms,” said Bhooshan.The team at Greater Noida call centre kept calling Kumar every two hours to ensure safe journey during this time of crisis, the officials said, adding that there are at least 50 people from UP in Ladakh, 500 in Jammu and Kashmir and thousands in Delhi who got stuck due to the lockdown.“We are counselling them to stay safe at their respective locations. In emergency cases such as death of a relative, we help them to get a pass for their journey back home,” said Bhooshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-officials-help-up-man-working-in-jammu-attend-father-s-funeral-amid-lockdown/story-qK7S0pYeBNXvotv0d89COK.html
20-04-2020||Gurugram||Six hybrid lanes opened at Kherki Daula toll plaza||Three canopy lanes on each side of the 25-lane Kherki-Daula toll plaza became functional on Monday, more than three weeks after toll collection was stopped due to the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of Coronavirus. These lanes will be hybrid and will accept both cash and FASTag for the time being, though use of cash was discouraged to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, officials said. On Monday, Gurugram traffic police personnel were deployed at the canopy lanes to check curfew passes of commuters and jersey barriers were still in place in front of the remaining 19 lanes. Systems manager with highway concessionaire MCEPL, Anish John, said, “Vehicles are moving through the canopy lanes as there is less traffic. Each vehicle is being checked by the police for curfew passes. On Monday till 3 pm, 6,342 vehicles, mostly trucks, had crossed the toll plaza.”The Kherki-Daula toll plaza was closed on March 25, day 1 of the 21-day lockdown now extended till May 3, after the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) took a decision to make the toll plazas across the country free. Toll officials said during the lockdown period, 1,70,658 vehicles crossed the toll. MCEPL chief executive officer S Raghuraman, said, “We are preparing the amount which NHAI can compensate us during the lockdown period.”Meanwhile, the toll booth operators have raised concerns about accepting toll payment in cash. “The booth operators are scared to take cash from commuters because of coronavirus. We are encouraging commuters to pay through FASTag,” Kherki-Daula toll plaza project director Rajender Bhati said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-hybrid-lanes-opened-at-kherki-daula-toll-plaza/story-amBwQy2ewlBMJlWfQUro8J.html
20-04-2020||Gurugram||Property registration resumes in Gurugram but finds few takers||The registration of property in the city resumed on Monday, although hardly anyone turned up for executing their deeds of conveyance, transfer of property and any other related activities. Not a single person showed up for registration in Gurugram and Manesar tehsils, which otherwise witness on an average 35 to 40 and 100 to 1,110 daily registrations respectively in normal times. Only one deed was registered in Wazirabad sub-tehsil whereas Badshahpur, Kadipur and Harsaru sub-tehsils also did not witness much activity on the registration front, district revenue officials said, adding that they are waiting for a final report. Revenue from registration of property is a major income source for the Gurugram administration as around 300 to 350 such instruments are usually registered daily in Gurugram and Manesar taken together. The daily revenue generated on account of stamp duty and registration fee is substantial but collection came to a naught after March 24. The resumption is now aimed at generating revenue again, said officials. Arrangements for social distancing, providing sanitisers and staggered entry inside the tehsil offices were made by the revenue officials, who have been asked to ensure that social distancing norms are followed. The timing for property registration has been fixed between 2pm and 4pm every day and each tehsil and sub-tehsil can carry out 24 registries in a single day, said revenue officials. Persons, who are selling and buying the property, would be allowed to enter the tehsil offices, while the sale of stamps would take place online. All those entering the offices are required to wear a mask, they added.Jivender Malik, tehsildar, Gurugram, said that two tokens were issued by them to executants on the first day for registration of property deeds but none of them turned up. “We waited for the applicants and adequate arrangements were made to ensure that documentation is carried out in a safe and secure manner,” said Malik, referring to the guidelines prescribed by the government.In normal days prior to the lockdown, the Gurugram tehsil saw around 35 to 40 registrations of property deeds daily, says Malik, adding that those sub-tehsils where apartment complexes are built see more conveyance deeds.Similar scenes were witnessed even in Manesar as no property owners turned up for registration of deeds, said Bijender Rana, tehsildar, Manesar. “There was no registration of deeds on Monday but we are hoping that things will start improving in the next two to three days. In normal times, we carry out 100 to 110 registrations ,” said Rana.With large number of condominium complexes located in the tehsil, Rana said that a conveyance deeds of apartments/flats generated around ₹30 crore revenue every month but things had slowed down considerably after March 24. “Apart from the regular arrangements, we have also stocked masks and will give to persons who are not wearing it,” he said. Wazirabad sub-tehsil was an exception, where only one property deed was registered, said Jai Prakash Garg, naib tehsildar. “A single registration was carried out but we hope things will improve in the coming days,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/property-registration-resumes-in-gurugram-but-finds-few-takers/story-ULloM0XU9BlbzrMeJnZcNP.html
20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab: Frontline staff, including docs, wary of state directive on taking HCQ dose||Most doctors, para-medicos and other ground-level health staff in the state, engaged in the frontlines of battling the corona pandemic, have rejected a Punjab health department directive that asks them to take a dose of anti-malarial drug, Hydroxychloroquine. The medicine is supposed to act as prophylactic (preventive measure) against covid-19. “As there are no strong studies or proofs that HCQ has prophylactic benefits, we are advising our colleagues and staff not to take it. It is causing trouble in some heart conditions and exacerbating some ailments, so if any healthcare worker associated with us wants to have it for prophylaxis, we are discouraging them, or they can have at their own risk,” said Dr Aslum Parvez, state president, Rural Medical Services Association, Punjab.On April 7, Punjab director for health and family welfare Dr Avneet Kaur sent a directive to all civil surgeons on the use of HCQ. This letter cites an advisory from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). This advisory, ironically, mandates that HCQ is to taken only after consulting a physician. According to the advisory, asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of covid-19, should take a 400mg tablet twice on Day 1; followed by a 400mg tablet once a week for the next seven weeks, with meals. “For asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases, the dose should be a 400 mg tablet, twice on Day 1, followed by 400 mg once weekly for next three weeks,” the ICMR advisory adds. State Punjab Civil Medical Service (PCMS) association president Dr Gagandeep Singh said they remained apprehensive. “There is confusion, so we have asked fellow doctors and staff to consume the HCQ at their own risk.” He added that the majority of PCMS doctors were not taking any HCQ dose. A doctor, not wishing to be quoted, claimed that a journal in England had published a study that negated the role of HCQ in covid-19 positive patients.“The ICMR has already said that it has launched a study to know the side-effects of HCQ using data of healthcare workers taking the medicine. So, it appears that the recommendation to us, without the backing of any study, is part of that experiment being done, at the expense of healthcare workers,” a doctor posted in Barnala claimed. “We issued our directive for frontline staff based on an ICMR advisory. To date, the department has not received any representation from doctors and other staff on their apprehensions on the use of HCQ,” director, health, Dr Avneet Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-frontline-staff-including-docs-wary-of-state-directive-on-taking-hcq-dose/story-C8aN2oIt862Pvkje0NvQBM.html

What does he have do? Does government has to take approval from him for the measures it takes and its functioning...it looks like he is supporting and instigating such activities, what does he mean?” the Chief Minister asked.A person who had to seek strict action, if he is giving such statements, it is height of irresponsibility, he added.Though he condemned the incident, Khan had tried to defend the attackers stating they were uneducated labourers who didn’t know what they were doing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/padarayanapura-incident-an-act-of-goondaism-karnataka-cm/story-YbGuQVz81JIoNKKNMikt0J.html

20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Rain throws wheat lifting in Punjab mandis out of gear||Moderate to heavy rainfall in different parts of Punjab brought ongoing wheat procurement as well as the crop harvesting to a halt on Monday afternoon, besides leading to increased moisture content in the grain. Patiala district was the worst-hit with 15mm rainfall in a span of an hour, followed by Ludhiana at 5mm. On Monday, the field staff of the agriculture department remained on their toes, carrying out surveys to assess the damage caused by inclement weather. The rain further delayed harvesting as reports of crop flattening poured in from various places. “The rain disrupted procurement in Patiala and Ludhiana districts. It also slowed down operations in Fategarh Sahib, Khanna, Jalandhar, Rupnagar, Kapurthala, Patiala and Mohali districts,” said additional chief secretary Viswajeet Khanna, who heads the state-level committee on harvesting and procurement.‘Farmers already at the receiving end’Arshdeep Singh, a farmer from Bhadson town in Patiala district, said the rain flattened nearly half of his crop that was yet to be harvested. “Rain at this stage of the harvesting season is a cause of concern. The farmers are already facing a lot of difficulties in harvesting and selling their produce in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak,” he said.“The farmers who are yet to harvest the crop will have to wait longer. Also, there will be delays in procuring the produce lying in open areas at the grain markets,” Patiala chief agriculture officer Surjit Singh Walia said.Harbans Singh Rosha, chairman of the committee at the Khanna mandi, the second biggest grain market in Asia, said, “The farmers are already facing an acute shortage of labour. Now, inclement weather is adding to their woes. We got a rain alert and kept the grain under cover but some grain markets have no sheds.”Anup Singh Grewal, a farmer from Ludhiana district, said, “The bad news is that the meteorological department has predicted rain in the next few days as well.” ‘Govt should provide relief to those affected’ Kulwinder Singh, a farmer from Mehatpur town in Jalandhar district, said, the state government must assess the losses and provide compensation accordingly. District agriculture officer Naresh Gulati said, “Our field officers are collecting reports on damage to the crop caused by the rain.” District mandi officer Devinder Singh said the produce that arrived in the district’s grain markets in the morning was lifted or was kept under the sheds. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU Ekta-Ugrahan) leader Jhanda Singh Jethuke said high-speed winds and hailstorms along with rain has only worsened the situation.As per the state agriculture department, wheat harvesting on 16% area in the state was over and 13 lakh tonne produce was procured till Monday. It will cause serious damage to crops: PAUPunjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said the rain caused a serious damage to the crops.“Not only the standing crop has suffered a damage, but also the produce kept or stored in the open will be spoilt due to rain. Now, it would be difficult to harvest the crop with a combine. Besides, prolonged drying may lead to shattering of grain. Also, there is a fear of fungus and discolouration of grain,” said Dr Dhillon.Surendra Paul, regional director of the India Meteorology Department (IMD), said 5 to 15mm rainfall was reported in different parts of state and it took the relative humidity up to 64-90%.The Punjab food and civil supplies department, which drives procurement along with four state government procurement agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI), has asked the farmers to bring produce to grain markets with moisture content not beyond 12%. The advisory was issued to follow the medical protocols to avoid crowding and ensure social distancing at grain markets to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rain-throws-wheat-lifting-in-punjab-mandis-out-of-gear/story-6EMgz8KvJ77GXIOhncUhnM.html

She was part of a group of 13 labourers returning from Telangana. Jamlo Madkami, who went to Perur village in Mulgu district of Telangana to pluck chilly along with thirteen others, died in the jungle on Saturday evening. She started walking from Perur on April 15 along with other labourers, official said on Monday.The district administration said that the other 13 labourers were quarantined after the death of girl.“On Monday, the postmortem of the girl was conducted because the body was preserved. We had sent the samples of the girl on Saturday to Jagdalpur for tests of COVID-19, which was found negative,” said chief medical and health officer, Bijapur, Dr BR Pujari.The medical officer also said the group of 14 labourers took the route of jungles as due to lockdown, the entry though roads was not allowed.“She walked along with the group crossing difficult terrain of Maoist-affected forest and on Saturday evening she collapsed in Bhandarpal jungles,” said Pujari, adding that the route is extremely difficult to walk.The girl’s village was about 50 kilometers from the place she died.The medical officer said the girl from Aded village under Toynaar police station had gone to Telangana in search of employment along with her relatives.A senior government official of Bijapur district, who was not willing to be named, said that hundreds of labourers, who went to Telangana in search of employment were returning to their villages on foot through the dense forest. “The forest route is surrounded by severe Maoist affected areas hence no one can monitor their movement,” said a senior police official involved in anti-Maoist activity, who was not willing to be named.“We conducted the post mortem but the exact reason behind the death is yet to be ascertained. Her visra has been preserved and will be sent for further examination,” the CMHO said.The CMHO said primarily the postmortem suggests that she died because of electrolyte imbalance.“Since she travelled on difficult terrains for three days, she could be facing muscle fatigue which could led to some imbalance. Secondly, as per the people who were walking with her, she fell from a hillock and sustained injuries also,” the CMHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/12-year-old-girl-walks-100-kms-in-dense-forest-in-chhattisgarh-dies/story-jwgMVE16Vm1WCdo2IXqbEO.html

20-04-2020||Lucknow||KGMU gets nod for plasma therapy||Plasma therapy shall soon start for Covid-19 patients in Uttar Pradesh as the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) has given permission to King George’s Medical University in this connection. Five coronavirus patients, who were treated successfully at the medical university, are ready to donate plasma. Under plasma therapy, plasma from cured patients is transfused to other patients who are under treatment for Covid-19. KGMU has also sent a proposal to Indian Council of Medical Research, asking the apex research body to make the medical university a nodal centre for plasma therapy for Covid-19 patients.“Covid patients, who complete treatment, develop antibodies and they can be used after 28 days of completing the treatment. We have our first lot of such patients ready,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, head of the department of transfusion medicine at KGMU. The work will be done in collaboration with Dr D Himanshu of KGMU’s medicine department, who is treating patients in the isolation ward.Plasma will be obtained with apheresis, the process of separating the cellular and soluble components of blood using a machine. Apheresis is often done on donors where whole blood is centrifuged to obtain individual components (eg, RBCs, platelets, plasma based on specific gravity) to use for transfusion in different patients. The plasma obtained will be transfused to patients. “We are already following the highest protocols of transfusion,” said Prof Chandra.She said plasma donation will be completed first and then a plan will be made for transfusion. The plasma donors have been treated at KGMU and are residents of Lucknow.About the proposal to make KGMU a nodal centre for plasma therapy in the state, Prof Chandra said once the ICMR gives the nod, work can start to make a pool of plasma from treated patients in the state and then transfusion can be done.A team of doctors will closely monitor the transfusion, its impact and change in the health condition of the admitted patients at KGMU. The medical university has treated 16 Covid-19 patients till now and discharged 11 of them after they recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kgmu-gets-nod-for-plasma-therapy/story-YdBXiJ2FfiqACjyvlWFDwK.html
20-04-2020||Lucknow||Agra: Govt hospital refuses admission to pregnant woman||A full-term pregnant patient was denied admittance into Agra’s Lady Lyall (district women’s) Hospital on Monday, after the hospital’s demand for two packets of blood was not met.When all the efforts of the patient’s labourer husband failed in getting her admitted and he tried to take the woman back home, he had to do so on a rickshaw, as the ambulance services too were not available.Parvez (Shabeer Ullah) 35, a resident of Nagla Mewati, in Agra, said, “I informed them that being a daily wage labourer, it was tough to arrange blood as I had no money left. I also offered to give my blood, but they refused and insisted that I get the required blood.”However, Lady Lyall Hospital officials denied that any such patient came to them, though they said that they are trying to find out more from hospital staff on duty at that time. The incident happened with pregnant Rubeena Begum. “My wife was in the last days of pregnancy and on Monday, early in the morning, she experienced severe pain. I took her to Lady Lyall hospital around 5:30 am but hospital staff present there did not admit her.“I requested almost everyone present there, but all efforts went in vain. At about 10:30 am, an attendant of one of the patients intervened and apprised the doctor on duty and other staff about my wife’s case. Doctors and other staff members asked me to arrange for two packets of blood for my wife and said that only then would they admit her,” Parvez said.“Thereafter, I decided to take my wife home, as she was crying due to severe pain. But after I called on 102 and 108 ambulance numbers, nothing worked and I got no response despite many requests,” he added. “So, I went outside the hospital to arrange a private vehicle, but did not find anything. I requested policemen, passers-by, but nobody assisted me,” he said.“After some time an Agra Nagar Nigam employee arranged for a rickshaw on which I brought my wife back home. I would like to thank the man who arranged the rickshaw during this tough time and only because of his efforts was I able to take my wife home and she is safe. She has given birth to a baby boy at home with the help of a ‘daayi’ (a nurse),” Parvez said.Lady Lyall Hospital superintendent Asha Sharma said, “I am unaware about such a patient and this case. But when I enquired about it, doctors and other staff claimed that no such case came to their knowledge. We are trying to find out more details in this regard with the staff on duty at that time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/agra-govt-hospital-refuses-admission-to-pregnant-woman/story-SWhOtNbiC7kUutgIYFqi5N.html
20-04-2020||City||Delhi: Five ‘high risk’ employees quarantined after senior engineer of NDMC tests Covid-19 positive||New Delhi: Two days after a senior engineer of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, the district administration quarantined at least five “high risk” employees of the civic body who had come in direct contact with the patient.According to officials of the New Delhi district administration, at least 19 employees of the NDMC came in contact with the senior engineer who tested positive on Saturday.“Five of these 19 are among high-risk contacts and are being quarantined while 10 are those who had met the patient more than 14 days back. All the remaining contact persons have been instructed for self-observation of any flu-like symptoms (ILI Symptoms),” New Delhi district magistrate Tanvi Garg said.The officials said CCTV footage was checked and staff members were also questioned about their meeting with the senior engineer. The exercise was conducted to ascertain the number of people who might have come in contact with the engineer and also the places where he might have visited. “Samples of some of the staff members who came in contact with the Covid-19 positive official would be taken tomorrow. A survey regarding their travel history and contact history was also conducted,” the district administration official said.If more samples test positive, the building might be declared a hot spot. An order issued by New Delhi additional district magistrate D Karthikeyan said: “The medical officer in charge is directed to conduct contact tracing of the case...station house officer of the area shall ensure the implementation of lockdown orders and ensure that all contacts of the positive case, who have been recommended home quarantine, shall observe home quarantine strictly.”A senior NDMC official, requesting anonymity, said over 50 employees were screened and a surveillance team of doctors also met the engineer on Sunday to know if the patient had any travel history and to ascertain the contact-tracing. Officials said the senior engineer had been working during the lockdown period and had been “visiting the office till Wednesday and had also attended some meetings”.NDMC officials said that last week, the senior engineer fell unwell and was taken to a dispensary, from where he was referred to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where he was tested for the Sars-Cov-2.He was engaged with the building maintenance division in the municipality and his office was on the 16th floor of the NDMC building.The NDMC officials said that the entire building has been sanitised twice by the health department of the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-five-high-risk-employees-quarantined-after-senior-engineer-of-ndmc-tests-covid-19-positive/story-2sfnvgI8TaCMcTAxz9gX9H.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||ASHA workers’ body demands PPE kits after one of them contracts Covid-19||A day after an ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker, deployed in Central Delhi district’s Sadar Bazaar area for containment activities, tested positive for Covid-19, the Delhi ASHA Workers Association (DAWA) Monday stepped up their demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for all ASHA workers who are on Covid-19 containment duties. The 32-year-old ASHA worker was deployed in Sadar Bazaar for door-to-door survey to identify infected persons. According to DAWA, she completed a field survey of over 300 houses in Sadar Bazaar area last week. As she wasn’t feeling well, she got herself tested for Covid-19 and her results came positive Sunday. A senior district official said, “The worker, who is a resident of the same area, was admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital on Sunday afternoon after her test reports came positive for Covid-19.”Kavita Yadav, state coordinator for ASHA workers, All India United Traders Union Centre (AIUTUC), said, “She is the first ASHA worker to test positive in Delhi. A lot of ASHA workers are not getting protective kits to carry out their work. Now that so many ASHA workers are deployed in containment zones, we want the Delhi government to give them PPE kits which are given to all front line workers. They are going door-to-door in containment zones to identify infected persons, thereby putting themselves at risk.”However, a senior Delhi government official said ASHA workers are provided gloves, masks and shoe covers and they did not require PPE kits. “They don’t require PPE, as they are supposed to maintain a social distance while collecting information from people during the door-to-door survey. They are provided a basic kit comprising masks, gloves and sanitisers. PPE kits are to be used by hospital staff,” the official said. But Yadav said, “The chances of ASHA workers contracting the infection are very high, as it is difficult to say which resident is a carrier of the infection, and they interact with so many. So PPE kits should be given to them.”ASHA workers have also been demanding better wages and timely payments. Of the 5,900 ASHA workers in Delhi, a large number of them is currently conducting door-to-door surveys to identify Covid-19 infected persons, especially in containment zones.The Delhi Asha Workers’ Association said they were not paid salaries for the month of March and that the incentive assured by the government is less than the financial assistance given to construction workers and auto drivers to compensate for loss of work due to the ongoing lockdown.The association wants the Delhi government to pay workers minimum wages or at least ₹10,000 per month till the time they are on Covid-19 duty. It had also written to Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in this regard. But a senior official said a decision is yet to be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/asha-workers-body-demands-ppe-kits-after-one-of-them-contracts-covid-19/story-ArE1YUPX5lWEpKIQD7Gh1N.html

20-04-2020||City||‘Virtual learning is okay, but no replacement for classroom lessons’||Virtual teaching is beneficial only to an extentVirtual or online learning provides various channels such as mail, online chat and video conferences, through which students and instructors can interact with each other. In the classroom, there is only one channel to communicate with each other. Many students have a visual memory and seem to learn more willingly and are interested in online modes of teaching. Virtual learning is opted these days due to the shutdown of schools and institutions. It is beneficial to an extent because it does not require waking up early, there is no fear of getting scolded and one can study in a comfortable manner. But, a teacher-student relationship can be best established in a classroom only. The interaction and the questions a student asks the instructor in the class cannot happen in an online interaction. Virtual learning offers a good substitute to classroom learning in the time of emergency but it cannot replace the classroom. Classroom learning still remains the main option as discipline can be taught through it and it is a better mode of imparting education and knowledge. Sanskriti Verma, via emailClassroom teaches life skillsI agree with the fact that it is the need of the hour to conduct virtual classes as the situation calls for it. But, in my opinion, classroom teaching will always be preferred over virtual classes as juniors or young adolescents learn much more. Daily interactions with teachers and peers improve their skills to deal with and teach them how to live in a society. Moreover, schools organise competitions and exams which result in the formation of skills required in day-to-day life. Harleen Kaur, via emailTechnology has proven its meritsIn this situation of a global health crisis, the virtual system of learning has proved its merits. As the technology advances, this system is here to stay. But, accepting the virtual method doesn’t mean rejecting the traditional classroom pedagogy. The convenience and low-cost model of virtual learning cannot replace the experiential learning of human values and character development of the classroom setting. Gurkirat Singh, Model Town ExtensionBoth forms have their own placeBoth virtual learning and classroom lessons have their own importance. In these times of pandemic, virtual learning is more important so that the education of children is not hindered. Classrooms are important as the children sit together and concentrate on a particular topic. They are able to learn new skills in such an environment and the teacher has their full attention. Thus, both forms of teachings have their own place. Srishty, via emailMany distractions in online learning Online education is a necessity these days. Although it gives a student an opportunity to learn, it also distracts them. Once the educational lessons are done, they start surfing other things. Hence, the impact of learning is uncertain and not always optimum. Education is not limited to the syllabus only; it also includes discipline, manners, morals and interaction with other students and teachers. These traits are difficult to inject through online teaching. In fact, I am of the opinion that the education system in schools should not be much inclined towards smart classes. Rather, in every school, some time should be devoted to teach moral values and discipline. Moreover, access to online platforms is not healthy for the students as their ability to remember and retain information diminishes. Neeraj Kumar Bhatt, BRS NagarVirtual learning is the only option right nowThe students are left with no option other than virtual learning due to the coronavirus pandemic. The teachers are trying their best to teach the children online and have also asked them to contact whenever they face any difficulty in studying. Despite that, classroom learning is better than virtual learning and understanding concepts in the class is easier. Manisha Baria, via emailMaybe not perfect, but serves the purposeIn such times when desperate measures are being taken, virtual learning has proven to be a shred of hope for the students and teachers. I am undertaking six months of industrial training via virtual classes. We can outline that this method has its pros and cons. For instance, in this virus outbreak, many software solutions and applications such Zoom, Webex, Amazon Chime, and Microsoft team allow video conferencing. Technical resources and facilities to aid the learning process can be shared, but we can only interact virtually, whereas classroom learning involves direct interaction between the students and the instructor. We also need to take care of the fact that the software or application used for the virtual classroom is secure. Moreover, virtual classrooms have some requirements, like a steady internet connection and an interface such as laptop/computer or a mobile phone. Hence, virtual learning may not be a convenient option for the economically weaker section. Virtual learning may not be as perfect as classroom learning, but in a pandemic, it serves the purpose. Raghu Mahendru, via emailNot everyone has access to internetIn current times, most of the institutes have switched to online classes. But it has a drawback that not everyone can access online education. In remote areas, many people don’t own Android phones or gadgets, which is a harsh reality. Also, there are some who have these gadgets but are unable to pay the price of the data packs. Though the teachers send assignments in WhatsApp groups, but the students are experiencing difficulties as there is no direct contact or interaction with the teacher. Sometimes, the signal is lost and the class is missed. Virtual learning is useful but not successful. One of the reasons is the lack of preparedness for it. The other is the unavailability of the books as the new session had to begin and students didn’t have the material for their next class. Aliza, via emailSomething is better than nothingVirtual learning by no means can be a replacement for classroom learning. But it can be used effectively to enhance the learning process. Due to the lockdown, many schools and colleges have started online classes but things like understanding the concepts, clearing doubts, interaction with the teacher are not possible in online classes. The environment of a classroom is quite different and it itself makes learning effective. But as something is better than nothing, it’s good to have virtual classes in this period. Rajni Matta, Vishwakarma TownOnline teaching can harm the eyes of the studentsOnline teaching is a good platform but it is not for everyone. It has some requirements like a good internet connection and an interface, but not every student can afford these things. Lack of accreditation and low quality is another problem. Moreover, the blue screen of these gadgets can affect the eyes of the students if one continues to look at the screen for a long duration. There is another drawback that a teacher cannot monitor the body language of the students and ensure their focus. Vishali Kalra, via emailClassroom teaching is the clear winnerIrrespective of the technology available, classroom teaching is the clear winner. No amount of virtual learning can match the environment that you one gets in the classroom. Studies suggest that children learn better through face-to-face interaction and group study also helps in developing the communication skills. Moreover, some students who are from rural backgrounds do not have access to the internet or the required electronic gadgets. Khushboo Singla, via email Virtual learning is the only solutionCovid-19 is a pandemic which has turned the world upside down and it will take time for things to be normal again. It is not possible for the government to find a substitute for all the normal lifestyle activities which we were involved in. Virtual learning is a good substitute to classroom learning. It’s true that it may not clear our doubts completely and we won’t be able to interact with our teachers and professors. However, to avoid the lag in our lives in terms of education and to save the time, virtual learning is the only solution. It will help students to get back on track once we get out of this pandemic. Nidhi Jain, via emailMake the most of technologyVirtual teaching is not the perfect substitute to the classroom setting, but there is no better alternative for now. Learning should never stop and technology is the best channel for that. Teachers should make videos and share them with the students through WhatsApp, YouTube or school homework applications. There should also be some provision for clearing the doubts. Besides, the students should utilise this time and learn life skills. In any case, there is an ocean of videos on every topic on YouTube, which the students can access for free. Inderpal Singh, DugriDigital learning is inevitableOwing to the lockdown, the education system has shifted from classroom teaching to virtual teaching to avoid learning gap. This was inevitable as we can’t step out of our houses. College and university students can adapt to this mode easily as they have their own smart phones. Early learners can gain access to digital learning with the help of their parents. This in no way will ever substitute the need of a teacher though. Loveleen Sarao, via emailClassroom learning better than virtual learningAmid the lockdown, we have no other option but to opt for virtual learning. That’s why most of the institutions are holding virtual classes. If compared, classroom learning is better than virtual learning because the latter involves many technical problems. Teachers give lessons online but are not able to keep a check on the students. Virtual learning is good but only if it is clubbed with classroom learning. Diya Baria, via emailOnline teaching: Best way to impart education right nowAll educational institutions are shut owing to the lockdown because of which students are unable to go for classroom learning and have to instead opt for online classes. Online learning is an interesting medium as students can attend classes taught by teachers from across the world. If one doesn’t understand a concept taught by one teacher, he/she can refer to another one. We can even get a three-dimensional view of objects online which helps us understand certain scientific concepts better. Amid such critical times, online teaching is the best way to impart education. Sneha Pathak, via emailCollective effort importantIn India, we don’t have a lot of experience in digital learning but we had to resort to it as finding a substitute for classroom teaching was the need of the hour. The concept of online classes is not new but amid the COVID-19 lockdown, it has become our only option. Digital classes are managed through app management systems. Regular feedback from parents plays a major role. A collective effort of teachers, students and parents is important to ensure that students’ education is not affected by the pandemic. Mehak Arora, via emailStudents don’t take online classes seriouslyThough virtual learning is a good initiative taken to continue to educate children during the COVID-19 lockdown, classroom learning is definitely better. Classroom learning facilitates a better understanding of concepts. No one takes online classes as seriously. It is difficult to cover the entire syllabus through digital mode of learning. Swarika Garg, via emailVirtual learning is the best optionInstead of halting the process of education, virtual learning is the best option amid lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. Though the online platform is not as convenient as classroom teaching, but it is still very effective in educating students during these difficult times. Teachers have been using new tools and technologies to teach pupils. The e-learning platform is the only and the best substitute to classroom learning for now. Besides, it is more innovative and makes learning interesting and creative for students. Therefore, it is important that we support teachers and educators in their endeavors to educate students from home. Laveena Sharma, Haibowal KalanClassroom learning more effectiveClassroom learning is always better than virtual learning as it is more effective and engaging. For attending online classes, students require technology, which might not be affordable and available to those living in rural areas. Besides, virtual learning requires prolonged exposure to mobile phones, which might cause strain to eyes and ears on overuse. The classroom setup provides students a platform to engage themselves in group discussions and boost their overall self confidence. It also helps them establish a rapport with teachers. Ishita Katyal, via emailClassrooms have less distractionsFor me, classroom learning is anytime better than virtual learning and has many advantages. A classroom set-up is more engaging with less distractions for students. Besides, it is dynamic and provides more opportunities for group interaction among children. It also promotes kinesthetic learning among students as they are not just restricted to their phone screens and technology. Jassica Goyal, via emailEach mode of learning has its own pros and consWith the coronavirus outbreak, the whole world has changed drastically. In the sphere of education, shifting to online learning was the only option left for students and teachers. Both the teaching methods, online and offline, are accompanied with their own set of pros and cons. While the working students and professionals prefer online mode, others like to opt for offline mode. However, presently, there is no choice but to go for virtual learning and embrace the changes with a positive mindset. Right now, our main motive should be to get education and not complain about the circumstances. Taranjot Singh, BRS NagarOnline learning follows social distancingOnline mode of learning is the best choice during the pandemic as it adheres to the norms of social distancing as laid down by the government as a precautionary measure against the spread of the virus. However, it does have a few backdrops, including lack of technical awareness among students and network issues during online sessions. Also, under regular circumstances, classroom learning is a better choice as a teacher has full control over the class and there is much better communication among teacher and students. Harshpreet Kaur, Haibowal KalanStudents now using gadgets for study purposesEach mode of learning has its own merits and demerits. In these times when people have to stay at home, online learning has had a great impact on students’ education. Prior to the lockdown, children used to kill their time playing games on mobile phones, but now they are using the gadgets for study purposes. Despite its advantages, online learning has negatives too. During online classes, a teacher cannot pay attention on every student. Also, there is a lack of understanding between a teacher and students at times. Jasleen Kaur, via emailOnline classes will help students complete syllabus Switching onto online learning is a great step taken by education institutions amid lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. E-learning will enable students utilise their time and cover the syllabus on time. This method will ensure that students spend their time productively during the tough times. It’s important that we appreciate the efforts of institutions and teachers who are working recklessly towards betterment of students. Vivek Marwaha, via emailE-learning saves time, money and energyTechnology has narrowed the bridge between virtual and classroom learning in the modern world. Unlike traditional mode of learning, e-learning saves times, money and energy. It is the most preferred method that promotes knowledge enhancement among students while they are in their comfort zone. On the other hand, classroom lessons are good for primary students as they learn to become disciplined and follow a daily routine. In classrooms, students learn about their weakness and strengths besides focusing on social interaction as a means to boost self confidence. Pawan Kumar, via emailRepeat recorded lectures to understand conceptsTeaching and learning in a virtual classroom is a unique experience both for teachers and students. Online classes are more effective as compared to the offline ones as these save students’ time and money. In a virtual set-up, students only need to go through a video to understand the topic instead of spending hours at school as in a classroom set-up. The best part about online learning is that the students can watch recorded lectures as many time as they want to understand a concept better, which is not possible in regular classrooms. Ishmanpreet Kaur, via emailNo substitute to classroom learningThere is no substitute to classroom learning. Though teachers are doing their best to help children in all ways, but it is not possible to handle so many students on a virtually platform. Online learning is helpful to complete written work only. It is not effective in getting an individual’s doubts cleared. Besides, its biggest drawback is that it makes students more prone to using gadgets, which thus affects their health. Simranjeet Kaur, DugriEffective in times of crisisOnline learning is an effective mode in times of crisis. However, it is not as impactful as classroom learning in general. Studying requires coordination between a teacher and students, which is possible when the two are in a face-to-face set-up. In classrooms, students can learn about concepts better and get their doubts cleared easily. Shagun Mahajan, via emailClassrooms teach real essence of learningDue to the closure of schools and academic institutions, teachers have switched to taking classes on virtual platform. Online video interactions, concept videos and PDF files have enabled educators to continue with the teaching and learning process amid the lockdown. However, this new mode cannot take over the traditional mode of learning as it is the classrooms that teach the real essence of learning to students. Mohit Raghav, via email Virtual classrooms are boringOnline studies not only affect students’ health but also impact their learning as they find virtual classrooms boring. Students learn the best in a group or a collective environment with their friends. Moreover, classroom lessons help children form many cheerful and carefree memories. To get education via online mode, students also need smart phones, laptops and computers, which are not affordable for all. Presently, teachers are going for online mode as there is no other option available to them in these tough circumstances. Gurvir Kaur, via emailCommunication is better in classrooms Some students feel that classroom lessons are more effective as compared to virtual learning. In classrooms, students can interact with their teachers and ask them questions. However, during online classes, communication is hindered as students and teachers are sitting remotely at their homes. The biggest disadvantages of learning through e-platform is that it requires technology and gadgets that not every student can afford. Tanya Bajaj, New Janta NagarVirtual learning is a blissVirtual learning is a bliss if students and teachers have easy access to technology and internet. The platform enable students to attend lectures while being in the comforts of their home. Students can also ask questions and clear their doubts instantly. The only hindrance to online learning is poor internet and lack of technological awareness among students. Apart from this, online mode of education is highly beneficial.

20-04-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank fraud case: CBI court grants Wadhawans protection from arrest till May 5||DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan obtained interim protection from arrest in connection with the Yes Bank fraud case till May 5 from the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court.Last week, the court granted protection to the two accused considering their arrest is not possible during the period in which they have to be under quarantine (till April 23) and also due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown. “There appears no urgency to execute the warrant issued on March 17, till May 5, when the lockdown is likely to get over,” the court observed while granting them relief.The CBI had obtained non-bailable warrants against the two on March 17, after they were found in Mahabaleshwar with their family. The Wadhawans, with a group of 23 other individuals, had flouted lockdown orders and travelled to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala on April 8. The family had managed to leave the city with a permission letter issued by senior officials, who are now under investigation.After they were caught, the family was required to stay under quarantine by local authorities at Panchgani till April 23. CBI was preparing to arrest them when the family approached the special court for anticipatory bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-case-cbi-court-grants-wadhawans-protection-from-arrest-till-may-5/story-B17a0aMw5DQstGAGjTIUBP.html

Zaid was taken to Deoria Jail where he was tortured by Atiq and others over the transfer of a property.The duo was hiding at their respective homes and was nabbed after receiving an accurate tip-off.With the implementation of lock-down, not only civilians but even the convicts are forced to stay at home. Amid tight security and a large number of checkpoints in the district, they were unable to change their hideouts frequently as they usually do to escape the police.SSP, Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said that the police teams were alerted after receiving inputs that wanted criminals and other persons involved in illegal activities can be traced and nabbed at their homes or their regular hideouts that are known to police.At least 1150 FIRs were registered during the lock-down and action was taken against 800 persons. While notorious and wanted criminals were sent to jail those held for violating lock-down were released on a personal bond.As per the records, there were two encounters between cops and criminals, in one of those, notorious criminal Shera was injured and arrested.Seventeen persons accused of murders, 10 looters, six rape accused, two gangsters, 36 thieves, bootleggers and cattle smugglers have been arrested so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lock-down-helps-police-nab-wanted-criminals-in-up/story-WigByi3Sc3Q54DabICKxkO.html

Kaler said that the Congress was even withholding the ration sent by the Centre for distribution among the poor amid the lockdown. Leader of opposition and SAD councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang also condemned the distribution system, stating, “While ration is being distributed smoothly in wards led by Congress councillor, the same cannot be said about wards of opposition councillors. We have told the mayor that if the distribution will not be streamlined within three days, opposition councillors will stage a protest.”On the other hand, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu downplayed the matter and said, “There is no bias and ration is being distributed equally.

No sane person will agree. We cannot be aggressive or mute spectators. We have to tell people that such incidences weaken our morale,” Shankar, who works at the flu clinic of the hospital, said.In this hospital, four more health workers joined Shankar to protest against the ‘atrocities’. Around 50 nurses work in the hospital run by the Union ministry for labour and employment.At the region’s tertiary care, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, the nursing staff too found it ‘suffocating’ to hear the news of attacks.“While we at the front-line are fighting pandemic, health workers were targeted in Moradabad, Indore, Ramganj in Jaipur, and Hyderabad. Strict action should be taken against the guilty,” Satyaveer Dagur, one of the protesters from PGIMER, said.“If miscreants cannot respect us, they should not pelt stones. We have sympathies with them who lose their near ones due to coronavirus, but they have no right to hit us. Same stands for the people who hit the survey teams working on ground,” Dagur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nurses-in-chandigarh-tonsure-heads-over-attacks-on-covid-19-front-line-workers/story-FJ6fb1rkFqw6TnS9GakD8J.html

In this matter the government may share the responsibility with owners,” he said.He added that the state should also collaborate with banks or financial institutions which provides funds at low-interest rates.“To revive the tourism industry, new schemes should be introduced according to the prevailing circumstances. Once the lockdown is over the government must focus to bring tourism back on track,” said Sharma.Revival is not enough and the government must ensure that the holiday destinations of the state remain virus-free for which the authorities may limit the number of tourists from outside the state, he said.The influx of tourists will likely increase after lockdown and the government should provide subsidy on installing sanitisation equipment at the entry of hotels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-seeks-relief-measures-from-hp-govt-for-coronavirus-hit-tourism-industry/story-wpbmFsrhi3H6rNWYSweH9M.html

While addressing the mediapersons at a government-run hotel here, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur apprised the people of the unfolding situation and said that economic losses due to the lockdown were tremendous. “So far, the state has suffered a loss to the tune of ₹450 crore,” he said.While speaking about Himachal residents stranded outside the state Thakur said, “I have been receiving over 70 calls a day for evacuation and I tell these people to act with restraints. The government is constantly in touch with the authorities of other states and making all arrangements for their stay. Those still trying to enter the state will be kept in quarantine for 14 days.”Defending Mandi MP Ramswaroop Sharma who travelled from Delhi to Mandi in the lockdown period, Thakur said, “He was permitted to enter the state. He self quarantined himself after reaching Mandi.”Meanwhile, the government has deferred its plan to grant permission to start units with 30% attendance. Considering the current situation, the movement of persons will not be allowed, CM said adding that curfew will continue in the state till May 3.CM lauded the efforts of his government and the frontline workers fighting Covid-19. Taking a dig at the opposition, he said, “This is not the time for politicking. Everyone should join hands to fight the grave crisis. Thakur also set aside the allegations leveled by the opposition leaders against his government. Lone CPI(M) legislator Rakesh Singha on Monday staged a sit-in protest outside the office of the sub-divisional magistrate in Shimla demanding the government to make food and stay arrangements for migrant workers. Singha claimed that many labourers are without shelter in the state.Speaking about the isolation facilities, chief secretary Anil Khachi said that the government has provided quarantine facilities with 9,200 beds to people in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-suffers-450-crore-revenue-loss-due-to-lockdown/story-wtJExMRvLPb0lVbOVRMf1K.html

My legs do not support me at all, but I still want to be productive for the society, especially in this dire situation,” he says.Singh informs he had all of ₹4,000 in his bank account that included his monthly pension of ₹1,000 and an additional amount of ₹1,000 that was disbursed to lakhs of marginal labourers and physically disabled persons on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their sustenance during the lockdown.“Since there is a nationwide lockdown, I had nothing to do because my small outlet of mobile phone recharge has been shut since March 25. During this period, I watched our PM address the nation several times. He repeatedly insisted upon maintaining hygiene, social distancing and wearing masks. I thought that instead of sitting idle, I should start making masks at home,” he says recalling how the idea came to him.Subsequently, he along with his family members started making the face masks.Singh is being helped by his sisters and members of his NGO ‘Prayas - EK Nai Disha’.“I started this NGO some time ago with the sole motive of helping people like me and make them a productive part of the society,” he adds.Singh and the members of his NGO distribute these masks to the slum dwellers. “Distributing masks not only help people, but also create awareness among them,” he says.He has not been helped financially by the administration so far. However, his initiative has earned him praise from Union minister and Udhampur legislator Dr Jitendra Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/differently-abled-udhampur-resident-makes-masks-with-meagre-pension/story-6WDMziv1LARtEBGSEiAo9H.html

The cabinet meeting was held as the nomination has to be done within six months of the election of Thackeray as the chief minister.The single bench of justice S J Kathawalla was hearing the petition filed by Ramkrishnan Pillay, a social worker and an acclaimed sportsman who is affiliated to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and is a member of the Working Committee of BJP in the State of Maharashtra. In his petition Pillay not only challenged the April 9 decision of the cabinet of ministers but also the very meeting itself as it was convened by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.Pillay submitted that as the meeting was convened by Pawar without getting the consent of the chief minister and that the post of deputy chief minister was only a formal post and did not have any authority to convene such meetings, hence the meeting convened by Pawar was not valid, thus the decision taken by the cabinet also was not valid and hence should be set aside.On April 9, the cabinet had decided to recommend the name of Thackeray to be appointed to one of the two vacant posts on the legislative council. The posts were to be filled through the nomination by the Governor based on the recommendation of the cabinet. As per the Constitution, Thackeray has to become a member of the legislative council within six months of his appointment as chief minister or else he would cease to hold the post. It was submitted that on account of the pandemic, it was unlikely that the elections for Legislative Council would be held hence the cabinet of ministers arrived at the proposal.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that the petition was not maintainable.After hearing the submissions, the court held that as the Governor had not taken a decision on the recommendation by the cabinet it was too premature to pass any orders on the same. The court further held that the Governor was empowered to decide on the validity of the proposal by the cabinet.“In my view, the Court’s interference at this stage is not at all required since any such interference at this stage would amount to preventing the Hon’ble Governor from taking an independent decision inter alia qua the validity of the proposal received by him. The reliefs sought in the Writ Petition therefore appear to be premature. The Petitioner at this stage is not entitled to any urgent reliefs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-refuses-to-stay-cabinet-decision-recommending-thackerays-appointment-to-legislative-council/story-MTBES4ZFCpqN6UObHrS7UL.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||Refund air passengers who booked tickets before March 25:Consumer groups||A consumer protection forum, Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, has requested the government to bring modifications in their order dated April 16, that laid out rules for refund to passengers booked for travel during the lockdown period. The advisory issued by the aviation ministry, states that the airline will refund the full amount collected without cancellation charges to the passenger, if a passenger has booked a ticket during the first lockdown (from March 25, 2020 to April 14, 2020) and the airline has received payment for booking of the air ticket during the lockdown period for travel during the same period.The forum said that since thousands of passengers would have booked tickets much prior to March 25, 2020, it is unfair to restrict the benefit of full refund only to those who booked the travel for the first lockdown period during that period itself.The forum asked the government to focus on the date of travel which is more important than the date of booking. “Hence if a passenger has booked a ticket for travel during the first lockdown i.e from 25th March 2020 to 14th April 2020 and the airline has received payment for booking of the air ticket during the lockdown period for travel during the same period for both domestic or international air travel that airline, travel agent or travel web portal, as the case may be, shall refund the full amount collected without levy of any cancellation charge,’ the forum requested. The first travel advisory that was issued by the health ministry on March 11 restricted non-essential travel. The forum, therefore urged full refund be granted to such passengers too- who cancelled their tickets due to such government advisory and necessary instructions. Shirish V Deshpande, chairman of the forum said that the advisory (issued on April 16) directed only the airlines to give full refund without cancellation charge. However, as most of the passengers book air travel through a travel agent or through travel web portal/ aggregator, concerned air lines might not have received money which the passengers paid to these agents or web portals. ‘It is therefore not enough to only direct the airlines to give full refund to passengers. The advisory must also specifically direct the travel agents, web portals and aggregators to grant full refund in such cases without any conditions or offer of utilising the said money for future travel,’ stated the letter.The advisory also mentioned that refunds will be given to passengers who booked tickets during the first lockdown period and the airline too has received the payment for the booking of air ticket during the first lockdown period for travel period during the second lockdown period (April 15 to May 3, 2020) for both domestic and international air travel. Mumbai Grahak Forum said that passengers who have booked their tickets well in advance cannot be denied full refund under any circumstances. ‘Their money has remained with the airlines or travel agents for a longer period which should, in fact, entitle them for refund with interest,’ the forum said.It thus insisted that the rule needs to be amended and it should be stated that; if a passenger has booked a ticket for travel during the second lockdown period (from April 15 to May 3, 2020) for both domestic or international air travel and the passenger seeks refund on cancellation of the tickets, the airline, travel agent or web portal as the case may be, shall refund the full amount collected without levy of cancellation charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/refund-air-passengers-who-booked-tickets-before-march-25-consumer-groups/story-mEn6SN6b6iRP0NDajut9SJ.html

It’s high time that the government shows empathy towards the people in distress and stop asking them to pay bills at least for the next three months,” he said.He also criticised the Punjab government for lack of management in tackling coronavirus crisis. “The Punjab government lacks sense of management. While the administration makes a public announcement, it changes the same later, leaving many confused,” he added.“The last date for paying bills is likely to be extended by the department. The PSPCL will not disconnect power supply of any consumer during the lockdown period. All the relaxations announced by the department recently will continue,” said DPS Grewal, engineer-in-chief PSPCL (central zone).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-ex-bjp-councillor-flays-pspcl-for-asking-consumers-to-pay-bills/story-gT4eOFCmJyavsrDL1HReRP.html

This is in accordance to the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry, even as local industrialists criticised the move.Construction companies will also have to furnish a similar undertaking, Dayalan said. Criticising the move, the president of the Mohali Industries Association (MIA), Yogesh Sagar said it was impossible to let the workers stay on the premises. “We have requested the administration to allow us to transport them as we have already suffered huge losses. Also, the workers staying nearby should be allowed to come on their own,” he said.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Girish Dayalan said with the spike in Covid-19 cases it was not possible to allow movement of workers. “We will allow industries and construction companies to operate only if owners submit an undertaking declaring that they will house the workers and labourers on their premises and will not allow them to go home.”If transportation of workers was allowed, “we will have to allow opening of telecom industry where 400 to 500 workers work on a daily basis and if a single person gets infected in the group it may prove fatal,” he added.Earlier in the day in a video conference with the additional chief secretary of the state, members of the Industry Association of Punjab requested that they be allowed to operate their industrial units.The Punjab chief minister’s office, after the conference, empowered DCs to permit industrial units to function in non-containment zones in alignment with the government’s earlier orders and also according to the guidelines of the Union home ministry.The DCs were also asked to facilitate opening of industrial units in non-containment areas by meticulously complying with the detailed instructions to this effect issued by the state government on April 18. All MHA guidelines and conditions should be strictly complied with by the district administration, the CM’s office added.What the MHA orders stateOnly such industry/ establishment which can make all arrangements for stay of workers within their premises and/ or adjacent buildings will be allowed to operateOnly such construction activity/ site where workers are available on site and no workers are required to be brought in from outside (in situ construction) will be permissible.Stone crushers, mining of sand and gravel and its transport, sale outlets of cement, steel etc shall be permissible only to service the construction activities carried out after obtaining due permission GM Industries who shall verify all such applications and accord necessary permission to commence and shall also specify the hours of operation The management of all these establishments shall be responsible for implementation of the directives and standard operating protocols (SOP) by MHA, as applicable to themAny violations shall invite criminal proceedings under the Relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Indian Penal Code,1860||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/let-workers-stay-on-premises-if-you-have-to-operate-industries-construction-firms-told-in-mohali/story-CqthjxIR6Nv4ZWTpUgBy2K.html

20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University students seek fee concession for EWS candidates amid Covid-19 lockdown||Days after demanding hostel fee waiver in view of the ongoing coronavirus lockdown, Panjab University (PU) students have urged the varsity authorities not to charge fee from the students of economically weaker section (EWS). In an online petition, around 500 students have asked the PU administration to either give relief or concession to such candidates. “Nearly 50% students in the university belong to poor and middle classes of the society. As these students do not receive any scholarship, it’ll become stressful for them to pay their fee,” the letter read. The students also said, “Due to the lockdown, there’s no work, no pay and no surety of the jobs too.”‘VARSITY TO TAKE A CALL LATER’National Students Union of India (NSUI) president of PU, Nikhil Narmeta, said, “The coronavirus crisis will have a long-term impact on the varsity students financially as most of them belong to middle class and the source of their family income is shut. This will create problem for the students after the university reopens as they will not be in a position to pay their fee.” “The university authorities have replied positively, saying that they will look into the issue once the lockdown is lifted,” he said.PU advisory committee chairman Navdeep Goyal said, “Right now, we are tackling the day-to-day issues faced by the students. We can decide on this once the university starts functioning again.”In view of the coronavirus outbreak, PU administration had suspended classwork on March 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-students-seek-fee-concession-for-ews-candidates-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-SQmfQcSNmpwzZEYvy5wJFJ.html
20-04-2020||City||With unique COVA app feature, you can check distance from nearest Covid-19 patient||Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal has urged the residents to use COVA mobile app inlarge numbers as a unique in-built feature in the app allows people to maintain distance from the nearest Covid-19 positive person. It also alerts the district administration if a quarantined patient or suspect moves beyond 100 metres of her/his base location, he said.He informed that the feature is helping the authorities enforce quarantine restrictions and enable the people to keep themselves and their family members safe through a self-control mechanism.By geo-tagging the positive patients, the app helps the district administration trace locations that the positive individual have visited in the last few days. If the phone Bluetooth is on, the app will alert the citizen on coming in the Bluetooth range of a Covid-19 suspected or positive persons. This also helps the health department and the district administration trace the contact history of positive patients.Agrawal informed that for the app to be effective, the GPS location and Bluetooth need to be switched on.These mobile numbers can also be used by the telecom providers to track movement if the location or Bluetooth is disabled. The telecom companies send hourly reports to the department of health on breaches in each district.Notably, the COVA app has had more than 10 lakh downloads till now and is enabling the citizens as well as the government officials to effectively execute lockdown and social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-unique-cova-app-feature-you-can-check-distance-from-nearest-covid-19-patient/story-hLWYRAK2PR5U0nOhP9ys3L.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||Schools shut, distribution of sanitary napkins stops||Sixteen-year-old Shagun — a resident of Delhi’s largest unauthorised colony, Sangam Vihar — has been using cloth pieces instead of sanitary napkins during her monthly cycle for the last couple of months. The Class 9 student at government girls senior secondary school in Sangam Vihar used to get a packet of sanitary napkins every month from her school. But with her school shut for more than a month due to the ongoing lockdown in place to stop the spread of Covid-19, the distribution of sanitary napkins too have come to a halt. Daughter of a mason and a domestic help, Shagun said that her family is not being able to makes ends meet due to the lockdown. “My father has not earned a penny in the last one month . We are collecting food twice a day from a food distribution centre at a nearby school. We can’t even think about buying sanitary pads at the moment. I had received my last packet of pads from the school in February. Now, me and my sister (14) are both using cloth pieces. It’s really uncomfortable, but we can’t help,” she said.Savita Devi, vice chairperson of the management committee at Shagun’s school, said that majority of the girls studying in their school in Sangam Vihar are dependent on the sanitary napkins they receive from them. “Even during normal days, they cannot afford to buy sanitary napkins. It’s impossible for them to go buy them now, as a pandemic rages on in the city,” she said.The female students of classes 6 to 12, studying in government schools across the country, are given sanitary napkin packets every month under the Central government’s Kishori Shakti Yojna. Every month more than 8 lakh girls benefit from the scheme in Delhi government schools.However, distribution has been disrupted these days as schools are closed due to the lockdown, adding to the woes of students, a majority of who come from lower income group families. Rashmi, 17, a student at a government school in east Delhi’s New Kondli area, said that her mother has stitched sanitary napkins using cloth and cotton at home for her and her two sisters. “People like us who can’t afford to buy sanitary napkins have to make alternate arrangements. I hope my school can provide some by next month. It will become really difficult for us to survive without pads, she said, adding that her school last distributed sanitary napkins in February. The Class 10 student said that her father, an e-rikshaw driver and sole bread earner of the family of five, has not been able to go to work due to the lockdown since last month. “We can sacrifice other things, but periods don’t stop because of a pandemic,” she said.Several government school teachers said they have been receiving distress calls from their students. Arti Qanungo, a teacher at a government school in Shakarpur, said that some of her students have switched to using cloth in the absence of sanitary pads. “Some others said that they have stock for this month. But the situation will become really difficult for them now that the schools are not going to re-open anytime soon,” she said.Binay Bhushan, Director of the Directorate of Education (DoE), said that the department will discuss the matter with schools. “The situation is very difficult these days. It will be difficult to distribute sanitary pads from schools and we do no have any mechanism for home delivery. We will have to come up with an alternative,” he said.Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli — an NGO that works on menstrual health with Delhi government in its schools — said they are also going to discuss the matter with government officials. “The only solution is that schools should provide sanitary napkins at the food distribution centres and the government school students can pick them from there. Our NGO has also begun to distribute packets of sanitary pads at these centres now,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/schools-shut-distribution-of-sanitary-napkins-stops/story-MrJ71Aw4uO16AakyigLHJL.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||Sisodia interacts with 300 private school principals, discusses fee issue, happiness classes||To discuss teaching-learning practices in private schools and other issues, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia Monday interacted with over 300 private school principals via video conferencing.During the hour-long session, Sisodia discussed the fee issue and the online happiness classes of the Delhi government. Started in 2018, the curriculum was, until now, exclusively for students of Delhi government schools. However, to improve mental well-being of parents and children, the government Saturday announced online happiness classes on Facebook and YouTube which would be accessible to all.Monday, Sisodia also spoke about the fee issue. The government had last week said schools could not stop students from attending online classes in case their fee was not cleared.“Considering the unusual times that we all are going through, students should not be allowed to suffer because of this. We need to take the utmost care while dealing with this issue. So let the students attend online classes, even if their parents are unable to pay the fee,” Sisodia told the principals.Supporting the government’s initiative, Nikita Mann, principal, Tagore International School, said, “We are concerned about the EWS (economically weaker section) students and have been able to bring 100% EWS students [of our school] on board for online classes. Focus for primary classes is on taking numeracy and literacy, instead of homework.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-interacts-with-300-private-school-principals-discusses-fee-issue-happiness-classes/story-qM25bQjB9Vop5usYHQx94L.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||Traffic marginally increases as central govt employees are allowed to return to offices||There was a marginal increase in Delhi’s road traffic Monday, after the government relaxed the lockdown norms so that central government employees are able to attend office during the lockdown From April 20. Senior police officers said in areas with a large number of central government buildings, pickets were rearrangedto ease the approach for government employees, while at the same time ensuring that stringent checking is continued.Special commissioner of police (traffic) Taj Hasan said because there was only a marginal rise -- of less than 10% --in road traffic, the traffic police were able to manage the situation with the staff already on duty. “We had pickets raised all across the city to check vehicles and traffic police personnel were also deployed there. No additional deployment was required,” Hasan said.A Delhi Police order, dated April 19, said “several officers of the central government commute in hired taxis. Therefore, such vehicles carrying officers must be allowed on the basis of identity cards.”The order mentioned that all central government employees above the rank of deputy secretary will be attending office 100% while only 30% of the lower level staff will be coming to office. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said, “We increased our number of pickets from 40 to 49. These pickets were strategically placed in order to provide smooth passage to government employees and at the same time, continue our stringent checking. All government employees heading to office were also checked and allowed to pass on the basis of their identity cards.” The Delhi government, however, on Saturday had issued an order to maintain ‘status quo’ in all Delhi government offices/departments. “Only those catering to Covid-19 related activities will be reporting to the field, while the rest would continue to work from home as was being done before April 20,” an official said.Delhi Police on Monday also wrote to the police chief of adjoining states of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, requesting them to ensure that the Delhi Police personnel who live in these states and need to cross borders, do not face any problems in reporting for duty. A senior Delhi Police officer said many personnel living in these states had been complaining that locals in their residential neighbourhoods were not allowing them to enter or move out, saying that they may be exposed to the virus and allowing their entry or exit may result in the spread of Covid-19 among residents. “As these issues were frequently being brought to our notice, we have requested the police chiefs of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to look into the matter and ensure that Delhi Police personnel are not stopped from coming to duty or returning home after duty,” the officer added, wishing not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-marginally-increases-as-central-govt-employees-are-allowed-to-return-to-offices/story-ZBvCTQ7K31ONkjZJC9xUxN.html
20-04-2020||City||Rain adds to Punjab farmers’ woes amid Covid-19 crisis||Already grappling with acute labour shortage, farmers from across Punjab suffered crushing blow on Monday as thundershowers caused damage to the standing wheat crop.Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon said, “Not only was there damage to the standing crop, the produce kept in open in the grain markets and in the courtyards of farmers were also damaged.”He said that the prolonged winter season followed by incessant rain in the month of March had delayed the ripening of wheat crop. “Now it would be difficult to harvest the crops with a combine. Besides, prolonged drying may lead to shattering of grains. Moreover, there is a fear of fungus and discolouration of grain that has dampened due to the rain,” said Dhillon.Fortunately, there has been no report of hailstorm or strong wind, otherwise the wheat crops would have suffered an irreparable loss.On the other hand, Harbans Singh Rosha, chairman market committee, Khanna Grain Market, the second biggest grain market in Asia, said that the rain has caused a double blow to farmers. “Already they are facing an acute shortage of labour, farmers’ problems have intensified due to the inclement weather conditions. We got the rain alert and kept the grain under shelter, but some grain markets have no sheds. At those places, the grain may catch moisture which may result in loss to the farmer,” said Rosha.Anup Singh Grewal, a farmer, said the rain has further delayed the harvesting process by a few more days. “But the bad news is that the meteorological department has predicted rain for the coming days too,” said Grewal.Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head of the department of the school of climate change and agricultural meteorology, PAU, said that till 5.30pm on Monday, 3.6mm rainfall was recorded. The rain led to a dip in the temperature. While the maximum temperature was recorded at 31.2 degree Celsius, the minimum temperature was 18.4 degree Celsius.She said that as per the weather forecast available, April 21 and 22 will remain dry while light to moderate rainfall is likely at isolated places thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rain-adds-to-punjab-farmers-woes-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-TMGYikAevszWWq6cBI5xtO.html

20-04-2020||Mumbai||Trump-backed drug to be tested on thousands in Mumbai slums||India’s financial capital Mumbai is fine-tuning a plan to administer an unproven but much touted anti-malarial drug in neighborhoods including Asia’s most crowded slum, the first-of-its-kind mass experiment to ward off the coronavirus.The city officials are identifying a target group which will receive hydroxychloroquine, according to Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner at Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Medical experts are being consulted on the duration of dosage, he said, adding that a decision was expected in a couple of days.The move underscores the desperation and mounting pressure on health care officials for solutions against a novel pathogen which has infected over 2.1 million people globally and killed over 146,000. It also explains the frenzied excitement over a decades-old drug -- U.S. President Donald Trump called it a “game changer” in the fight against the virus --despite a patchy efficacy record in some small studies and a documented list of side effects.“This is a one-time window available to us and may give answers for the pandemic the world is struggling with,” Kakani said. “We are taking utmost care to understand the side effects before implementing this.”Mumbai, which has seen more than a tenth of India’s over 13,800 cases and a quarter of its deaths, has emerged as the biggest virus hotspot in India and is racing against time to curb the contagion in several clusters.The densely-packed slums of Dharavi are one of the two locations -- Worli, the worst-hit Mumbai neighborhood is the other-- where the city officials plan to start a hydroxychloroquine or HCQ-dosing drive as a prophylaxis or a preemptive medication aimed at warding off the disease.There’s no conclusive scientific evidence that the drug works on virus patients, not to mention its use as a preventive therapy.“For use of HCQ as prophylaxis in a hotspot, there is simply not enough evidence. No preventive studies published to say that this approach really protects people,” said Leena Menghaney, a New Delhi-based activist with Médecins Sans Frontières. “Potential risk may surpass the potential benefit of providing it widely for people without the disease.”‘Too Many Uncertainties’There have been reports of heart-rhythm problems in some people in France, especially if used in a larger dose or if it interacts with other drugs, according to Menghaney. “There are too many uncertainties to say if it will help or if it will be futile in the public health response” against the coronavirus outbreak, she said.The anti-malarial drug didn’t help patients clear the virus better than standard care and was much more likely to cause side effects, according to a study in China. There were more side effects in the group who took hydroxychloroquine, but they were mostly mild, the most common being diarrhea, the study found.Aware of the deeply divided stance on this drug, Mumbai’s city officials are being careful.The original plan to dose 50,000 people between the ages of 18 years and 55 years, with no pre-existing liver and heart ailments, has now been scaled down as regular follow-up and surveillance of such a huge group would have been a challenge, said Kakani who is responsible for execution of this initiative.The medicine will be given to only those people who are willing, he insists, after recording their personal and medical history, including any medication they may be on.Spot Side EffectsAs many as 4,500 health care workers in Mumbai can be roped in this initiative. Each health care worker will be alloted 25-30 houses to track during the tenure of the medication and will be well-trained to spot any side effects for three to seven weeks over which the drug may be administered.Kakani refutes that the two locations were chosen because they are slum settlements.“In Dharavi and Worli we have created quarantine zone with high risk patients. We are anyway monitoring that group for 14 days, so we are able to observe these people and provide medical services,” he said. “We are not going ahead just because this is a slum.”Mumbai’s municipal authorities have completely sealed some areas, created quarantine zones, and are conducting door-to-door contact tracing of those found infected.As the death toll mounts despite India being in a lockdown for nearly a month, local governments have begun weighing the risks and rewards of some unprecedented policy measures.“We can try newer things if it’s permissible and advisable by relevant experts,” Kakani said. “Just because no one has tried it out yet does not mean we shouldn’t also. We can’t sit back and relax.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trump-backed-drug-to-be-tested-on-thousands-in-mumbai-slums/story-Wc7iJDI7ZriveGRTQtNfDL.html

The girl was found near the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on Saturday.Investigations revealed that the girl had eloped with a boy of her class and was “scared” of returning home, fearing that her parents would get to know that she got physically intimate with the boy. The child rights’ team found that the girl’s parents had lodged a missing report at Maloya police station about a month back.ADMITTED TO QUARANTINE FACILITY Director of the child helpline, Chandigarh, Ravi Bedi, said, “After medical examination of the girl, a case has been registered against the boy under Sections 376, 363 and 366 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Maloya police station. As the girl was in an unknown place for nearly a month, she has been admitted to a quarantine facility for 15 days.”A hunt is on for the boy who is absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/child-rights-body-rescues-17-year-old-girl-in-chandigarh/story-YF39jPy6whm1JCBPdqn4HL.html
20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Deluged with hundreds of calls, Chandigarh opticians set sight on permission to open||What if suddenly, you cannot see clearly, and you have to study, or cook, or look after children and the elderly, all without a pair of spectacles. Such is the plight of many people in the UT, who after breaking their glasses were in for a rude shock when they found that opticians were closed during curfew despite other medical faciliites being open. With their services not considered ‘essential’ by UT administration, opticians have not been allowed to open shop since the curfew was declared on March 24. However, with hundreds of distraught customers, the optician association has written to the UT administrator to permit them to open shop. Their services, they say, are fundamental for those who suffer weak eyesight, as blurred vision is not a simple difficulty, but a handicap.Amarjeet Singh’s 23-year-old daughter, who is studying to be a chartered accountant is short-sighted with a vision of –8D and –9D in both eyes. Unfortunately, her glasses broke a few days ago. “My daughter has no option but to continue. Squinting and reading without glasses gives her a severe headache. A few opticians must be allowed to open as it is causing great inconvenience,” he said.A retired judge from Punjab and Haryana high court, RS Madan, too, has been carrying on without his spectacles for a while. His son Raghujeet Madan said a tiny screw from the frame has fallen out, and would have taken an optician only a few seconds to fix it. “Most people did not plan for such contingencies during a curfew. The administration could look into starting a delivery service of spectacles directly to those in need,” he said.Samrat Arora, general secretary of Chandigarh optical association, said he has been receiving at least three calls a day from distraught customers asking him to help them but he can do nothing about it. “Some states such as Rajasthan and Kerala have made concessions for opticians. Even doctors need to get their glasses repaired,” Arora said.The association had reached out to the UT administration in an email on Saturday, but are still awaiting a response.Proprietor of Weldon Opticians in Sector 17, Harjit Singh, said he has been receiving calls from more than 50 customers everyday, most of whom required repairs. “We really want to help. The administration must allow a few opticians to open their shops while maintaining social distancing. This is in fact an essential service for those who wear glasses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/deluged-with-hundreds-of-calls-opticians-set-sight-on-permission-from-chandigarh-admn/story-k9mHsTfSKtjJwjmkurcgQM.html

In a message sent to the community members, he said that Taravih namaz, which is an additional prayers performed at night during Ramadan should happen from home.“Because of lockdown, a lot of people have expressed concerns about how can they pray taravih namaz at home and that everyone needs to gather in a mosque. Even if a limited number of people offer namaaz from mosque, it is acceptable,” said Qadri.He also appealed to them to help poor families during the holy month, so that they can observe fasts as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pray-taravih-namaz-with-family/story-41X6X1MmMEEOrLfmDeP0gK.html
20-04-2020||City||99% industrial units remain closed in Ludhiana||Even as 700 odd units in the state’s financial capital, Ludhiana, continue to function amid a month-long curfew in Punjab, no other industrial unit opened here on Monday.The Ludhiana deputy commissioner on Monday announced that industrial units in rural areas and designated industrial areas keen to start operations could submit their applications online with the general manager District Industries Centre (GMDIC).The GMDIC will oversee whether guidelines and labour quarantine norms are being followed at the units and then these can be allowed to operate. The guidelines say that the owners should make arrangements for labourers to be given accommodation at the units.About 99% of Ludhiana’s industry, known for manufacturing bicycles, bicycle parts, sewing machines and hosiery, will remain closed until at least May 3.TEXTILE INDUSTRY MAKING PPEThe silver lining in a grim situation, however, has been some enterprising innovations. A section of Ludhiana’s famed textile industry has diversified to making personal protective equipment (PPE) in bulk. Currently,15 textile firms located in the city have been accorded approval by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to make personal protective equipment (PPEs). District Industry Centre (DIC) general manager Mahesh Khanna told Hindustan Times on Monday that PPE samples from 37 more firms had been forwarded for government approval. “It seems the entire textile industry is keen to manufacture them”, he said.Permission had been accorded for manufacture of essential commodities, including bread, biscuits, packaging, pharmaceuticals and PPEs on a daily basis. There are currently 600 units for manufacturing essential commodities and around 100 units for some non-essential commodities that had been given permission earlier to function.Ludhiana is home to about 95,000 micro, small and medium industrial units (SMEs) and about 250 large scale units.BICYCLE UNITS UNABLE TO RESUME WORKLudhiana’s bicycle industry, which forms 80% of India’s bicycle manufacturing and home to giants such as Hero and Avon among others, remained closed as industrialists expressed their inability to start work because of the strict guidelines imposed by the administration.They also said sustaining would be difficult in the absence of demand in these times. “Where are the shops (retailers) to sell bicycles? What will we do even if we start manufacturing cycles?” asked SS Bhogal, managing partner of Bhogal Sales Corporation, a major bicycle manufacturer in the city.Bhogal also said strict safety guidelines imposed by the administration were not feasible. “There are practical problems. It is not possible to house over 100 labourers and also arrange for their medical facilities,” he said.SK Rai, managing director of Hero Cycles, said there is no question of them re-opening their unit before May 3. “There are strict restrictions on transport. Re-opening in these times is just not feasible,” he said.The president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), DS Chawla felt it was not possible to function with conditions such as quarantining of the labour imposed by the administration. Likewise, thepresident of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), Upkar Ahuja, said nothing could be gained by opening a certain sector or industry amid a lockdown until the complete chain was permitted to operate. The industry would need raw material and a function market to sell products. The district administration had allowed industrialists with permissions to run factories to operate their respective units. However, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said that the decision to recall the order permitting relaxations was taken to keep the situation under control. The district has so far witnessed four Covid -19 deaths, including that of an assistant commissioner of police and a revenue department official. There are currently 15 Covid-19 cases in the district, the state’s largest in terms of both geographical and population (35 lakh) size.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/99-industrial-units-remain-closed-in-ludhiana/story-aIEwv52pGTW1GORsFVGKoJ.html
20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn faces criticism for declaring entire city containment zone||The Chandigarh administration’s move on Monday to notify the entire city as a containment zone to control the Covid-19 outbreak is being questioned in certain circles that prefer selective sealing of affected spots.The Union health ministry had declared Chandigarh a Covid-19 hotspot (red zone) on April 15, leaving the Chandigarh administration to specify the geographical area of the containment zone in the city. A containment zone is geographical area with high incidence of Covid-19 positive cases where no unchecked outward movement of population except for maintaining essential services (including medical emergencies) and government business continuity is allowed.The UT’s containment order dictates there will be no relaxation in curfew imposed from March 24 and industries as well as the IT sector will be closed up to May 3 even though they are facing heavy losses with layoffs as the curfew extends into the second month.When the matter was raised with the UT authorities to seal select spots similar to what had been done by other states, including Haryana, the response was that cases were scattered around the city, because of which demarcating zones would have been difficult, says Dr JS Thakur, professor at department of community health of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).Services provided by self-employed persons, for instance electricians, IT engineers, plumbers, motor mechanics and carpenters, will remain prohibited.Construction of roads, irrigation, buildings and all kinds of industrial projects including MSME in rural areas; construction of renewable projects; continuation of works in construction projects within MC limits; and private vehicles for emergency services could have been allowed if entire city wasn’t declared a containment zone.Businesses ‘won’t survive’“But now, no economic activity will be allowed in the city for a month. The administration should have done selective sealing of areas. The city’s economy cannot survive another month of complete lockdown. Some relaxations were warranted,” says Charanjiv Singh, chairman, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, Another major impact would be that people needing medical care from neighbouring areas will not be able to enter the city during medical emergencies, says Dr RS Bedi, former president, Chandigarh Chapter of the Indian Medical Association.“The UT administration has allowed inter-state migration of officials for essential services, but has ignored patients who require better medical care here. There’s panic among medical professionals and also for the people who need medical care in Chandigarh. The authorities should allow this,” he added.“Only time will tell how wise this decision is, but we are denying healthcare services provided by PGIMER to the patients in the region as they cannot visit the institute due to curbs imposed by the administration,” says Dr Neeraj Nagpal, convener, Medicos Legal Action Group. Sporadic, non-contiguous spreadTechnically, a containment zone is spread around three kilometers with a buffer zone of five and seven kilometers for urban and rural areas, respectively. “But, in case of Chandigarh it was not possible as the cases of outbreak of Covid-19 are scattered, non-contiguous and sporadic spread,” says Manoj Kumar Parida, UT adviser.Under the red zone too no relaxation is allowed except for essential services, he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/entire-chandigarh-declared-containment-zone-because-of-scattered-covid-19-clusters/story-a2th7PrwuYlM0v1OdfrC8I.html
20-04-2020||City||Punjab dispatches nearly 1,200 J&K residents stuck in Pathankot amid lockdown||Around 1,200 J&K residents, who were stuck in Punjab’s Pathankot after the state borders were sealed off in view of coronavirus outbreak and subsequent curfew imposed by Punjab on March 23, started leaving for their state after nearly four weeks in a fleet of 18 special buses on Monday.As the J&K administration had earlier refused to allow entry of these residents into the state, they were accommodated by Punjab and lodged in some banquet halls, schools and other places.The Punjab Roadways buses arranged to ferry these passengers were fully sanitised and physical distance was maintained by allowing only 26 passengers in one trip. SP Hemraj Pushap, DSP Sukhjinder Singh and other senior police officials escorted the buses to J&K where the residents were handed over to the UT officials.On March 27, 17 Kashmiri migrant labourers, who had started walking towards Ramban (J&K) from Pathankot in the absence of any transport, were stopped by the UT administration and denied them entry. They all were later accommodated by a Pathankot resident, Randhir Singh Bitta, who also provided them food. After HT published the story of their plight, the district administration had started accommodating many such J&K residents in Pathankot who had reached here in large numbers.“I am happy now that they are going to their respective homes,” said Randhir Singh Bitta. The J&K administration should have allowed them to enter their native state earlier and taken care of them, which the Punjab government did here, he added.DSP Sukhjinder Singh said, “We hope to drop all of them by Monday evening. Their safety is our duty so we have ensured that distance is maintained among them in the buses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-dispatches-nearly-1-200-j-k-residents-stuck-in-pathankot-amid-lockdown/story-gfUmDJ3JJKd0NetKGCDe4N.html

Now, the university has resumed the first round of online counselling on Monday following the recent notification of the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) regarding the resumption of counselling for PG courses. Vice-chancellor of the university Dr Raj Bahadur said that they have begun the first round of online counselling for state quota PG seats. “It has been decided by the competent authority to conduct the first round of online counselling instead for this year’s session in the state,” he added.As per a notification issued by the university, the last date of submitting an online application ended on April 19 and the provisional merit list will be displayed on the university’s website on April 21. “The candidates will inform the objections if any in the provisional merit list by April 22.

This means the selected students can also join the allotted college by sending a confirmatory email regarding the acceptance of the seat.“The candidates can report in person to the college for taking admission. As reporting to the allotted colleges could not be possible for some students due to the lockdown, we will provide an online option as well. They can join the allotted college by sending a confirmatory email regarding the acceptance of seat and uploading scanned copies of relevant documents and pay the requisite fees to the account of university,” said Dr Raj Bahadur.BFUHS also advised candidates to beware of any fake website. “Confirm the account number and particulars of the college from the official website or by personally contacting us before paying the fees,” the university stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridkot-medical-college-resumes-online-counselling-for-postgraduate-courses/story-E3jecrNZhBO7M1V5tg2obN.html

20-04-2020||City||Lockdown: Demand for health insurance plans surges in Ludhiana||For 42-year-old Ashwani Kumar, a cashier of a private firm based in Feroze Gandhi market, health insurance plans seemed like a waste till about two months ago. He believed that one should rely on one’s personal savings for emergencies. But all that changed since Covid-19 outbreak. Anxious after hearing about cases where the whole families got infected, Kumar rushed to purchase a family insurance plan to cover his wife and 12-year-old son.Kumar is among the many for whom the outbreak served as a wake up call. They are soon realising that along with storing sufficient grocery items at home, it is also important to purchase a health insurance plan.In Ludhiana, many insurance companies have reported 25 to 30 per cent rise in sale of health policies since the lockdown.Arjun Kumar, health planner Punjab, Religare Health Insurance, said that while earlier the insurance company had to approach individuals for plan benefits, now the reverse is happening.“We have seen a 30% increase in the number of clients since the lockdown. With the rising positive cases, people are concerned how they would bear the medicine expenses in case someone in their family gets infected with the virus,” told Kumar.Kumar said primary query regarding any health plan that they receive these days is whether the insurance plan covers coronavirus or not.“Earlier people used to enquire aspects of the insurance cover, including accident cover, however, all the other things have become less important. People just want to get a health cover for their loved ones against coronavirus,” he said.Unlike earlier, when a health checkup would be carried out before sanctioning the insurance plan, the insurance firms are providing the cover within few hours of basic verification and digital payment of the premium.“We ask the client to send all the details through email and after verifying their particulars , we give them a go ahead for payment. They get the plan only after a few hours of clearing all required formalities. Other than the new clients, we are also working on settling the claims of our clients undergoing treatment for coronavirus in different cities on priority basis,” he informed.Recently, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had asked the insurers to decide on authorisation for cashless treatment to the network provider (hospital) within two hours from the time of receipt of authorisation request and last necessary requirement from the hospital. The move is aimed to ensure that health insurance claims of all coronavirus patients are dealt with swiftly.Individuals opting family health cover plansJiwan Sharma, sales manager of Star Health Insurance, informed that a majority of their new clients are opting for family health insurance plan. “Since the coronavirus spreads with the contact and the whole family is potentially at risk if one person gets infected, people are largely opting for family health cover plans. Presently, the ratio of the demand for family plan against individual plan is 7:3. Moreover, the premium of family health insurance is comparatively less than the individual plan,” he informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-demand-for-health-insurance-plans-surges-in-ludhiana/story-l5qLJVNRswGfenBRrfcEgK.html

We all need normalcy and freedom but I think it will be with the terms and conditions this time. Things will not be the same! I’m sure lots will change in our lives after the pandemic ends,” says ‘LOC: Kargil’ actor.The suave actor was last in Lucknow to promote his theatrical release ‘Guns of Banaras’ which was extensively shot in Varanasi. “Shooting in majestic Varanasi and putting up there was an interesting and memorable experience for me.

Last year, I denied a few series including a pivotal role in recently streamed ‘Special Ops’ as I was shooting for my film in the same period. It was a great role and has shaped up really well in the series.”He is happy that his father Rikku Rakesh Nath, a producer, asked all his family including his sisters and their families to shift in together as the lockdown was announced. “My father thought it was a time when the entire family should to be together and takes care of each other.

His father Dr DN Mishra, also a Lucknowite, passed away on April 2.“My sister could not come. Later, we did a small puja at home. He suffered a heart attack. Now, I am taking care of my mother and slowly started with my normal life,” he said over phone.The ‘Hazaaron Khwaishen Aisi’ director was wrapping his next film ‘Serious Men’ based on Manu Joseph’s novel when the lockdown happened.“I have already shot the film in Mumbai and Goa with Nawazuddin Siddiqui. It’s a story of a father and son. The editing part has also been done. I just need a month or so to complete the VFX and other parts. The film is for Netflix,” he said.Mishra also supervised the season 2 of OTT series ‘Hostages’. “I directed the first part, but in this season, I am the show runner (creative director). This series has already been shot and its editing and background work in on. The team is working from their homes using whatever possible technology.” Both projects are expected to hit the digital space later this year.He feels the storytelling will change after everything reopens after the lockdown.“Will we be able to tell the stories post-Covid-19 phase that is a big question for all film makers. Creatively there will be a conflict in mind of writers on what kind of stories to tell and what will be accepted. Tall talks of humanity…for poor and needy have been exposed and they are the ones who are suffering the most. We need to live with this truth!”The ‘realistic’ filmmaking spaces will see a tremendous change post-pandemic phase. “It’s fine for those who make fantasy films but for makers like us who make ‘Yatharth apne samay ki filmein’ (realistic cinema of current times) will have to consider these aspects too,” Mishra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/realistic-filmmaking-spaces-will-see-a-change-mishra/story-2mFDFApkE54Mup5tQZUXQP.html

However, the basis on which the Centre is proposing to deploy IMCTs in select districts across India including a few in WB under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is unclear,” said Banerjee in a tweet.The Chief Minister urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to share the criteria used for the deployment of IMCTs.“I urge both Honb’le Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji and Home Minister Amit Shah Ji to share the criterion used for this. Until then I am afraid, we would not be able to move ahead on this as without valid reasons this might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism,” she said in another tweet.Six IMCTs have been constituted by the Centre to assess the situation regarding the violations of lockdown, social distancing norms and attack on doctors, and submit a report to the Central government.Earlier in the day, the Central government said that the reported violations of lockdown measures pose a serious health hazard to the public and risk for the spread of COVID19.According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, IMCTs will focus on compliance and implementation of lockdown measures as per the guidelines, supply of essential commodities, social distancing, preparedness of health infrastructure, the safety of health professionals and conditions of the relief camps for labour and poor people.

20-04-2020||Chandigarh||1.3 million tulips bloom amid lockdown in Kashmir, tourists miss chance to behold the sight||The 1.3 million tulips that have bloomed in one of Asia’s largest tulip gardens in Kashmir make for a spectacular sight. Sadly, these dainty flowers will wither away in a week with neither tourists nor locals getting an opportunity to appreciate their beauty due to the lockdown imposed to check the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The 30-hectare tulip garden at ‘Siraj Bagh’ has transformed into a sea of colour but looks desolate without any visitors. Director floriculture Farooq Ahmad Rather said, “This year, we had increased the number of tulips to 1.3 million. We were hopeful that the garden will give a fillip to tourism. However, Covid-19 wrecked havoc on our plans. The tulips have started withering and within the next week or by the end of this month, the flowers will fade away.” Located on the foothills of Zabarwan Mountains along the banks of the Dal Lake with over 55 varieties of red, yellow, pink tulips, the tulip garden had bloomed around the same time last year with around 1.2 million bulbs attracting 2.58 lakh visitors. Of the visitors at least one lakh were outsiders.People would look forward to the Tulip Festival, an annual event, which showcased the large variety of flowers and promoted tourism in the stateIn 2018, around 1.9 lakh people had visited the garden.“This year we had increased varieties of tulips, increased the area of the garden and had formed interesting patterns hoping for a heavy footfall but there is no one here to appreciate the fruit of our labour,” Rather said.The department annually spends Rs 70 lakh on its maintenance. “The tourist season began with the Tulip Festival and lasted a month. The garden brought business to hoteliers, transporters, traders and houseboat owners,” he said, adding that the gardens brought hundreds of crores to the tourism industry. The department hasn’t suffered much of a loss but the tourism industry has been severely hit.KASHMIR’S CONNECTION WITH TULIPSKashmir’s connection with tulips dates back to hundreds of years. Initially, the flowers were grown on muddy roof tops. As time passed, the tulips were grown in kitchen gardens and flower beds when in 2005-06 the then government decided to turn the ‘Siraj Bagh’ in Srinagar into a Tulip Garden. Around 20 hectares of the 30-hectare garden is covered with flowers. The Tulip Garden had opened in 2007 on a slope with multiple terraces. It overlooks the scenic Botanical Garden. The tulip bulbs were brought from Holland and other European countries. Besides tulips, others flower such as hyacinth, pansy, daffodil and ranunculus add glamour to the garden.The life-cycle of a tulip flower is 15 days but officials had increased the span of the overall bloom by adding late-blooming varieties of tulips.“We have early blooming and mid-blooming tulips and now we have added four new varieties of late blooming tulips so that the garden remains open for a month,” floriculture officer Shayeq Rasool had told HT last month.Tourism nosedived last year after the Jammu and Kashmir government issued a travel advisory asking tourists and pilgrims to leave a few days before the central government revoked the special status under Article 370 of erstwhile state and split the region into two union territories on August 5. For months, restrictions remained in place with no phones and internet as the region remained shut.Though the restrictions were later removed, phones restored and the travel advisory revoked, but the tourists did not visit the place. Now, with the Covid-19 lockdown, Kashmir’s tourism has been hit again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/1-3-million-tulips-bloom-amid-lockdown-in-kashmir-tourists-miss-chance-to-behold-the-sight/story-AdlSOupKp6GqKjsXOSgx3M.html

20-04-2020||Pune||700 special officers on lockdown duty in Pune||For the next eight days, police will enrolled more than 700 special police officers to support the lockdown efforts in the city, said Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham on Sunday.This decision was taken after a day after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar instructed the administration to strictly implement lockdown rules in the city for at least eight days more, to control the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus).Crowds were reported from several areas in the city as the rush to buy vegetables, mutton and chicken amplified in the wake of the deputy CM’s announcement.According to Venkatesham, the police have started being more strict in the implementation of lockdown, he said, “We have to break the chain of increasing Covid-19 (coronavirus) cases in the city. We request residents to cooperate with the police department. With the stricter implementation of lockdown rules, there will be more pain in terms of supply of essential supplies in the city. I would like to appeal to everyone to come out only if it is absolutely necessary. We request people over the age of 60 not to come out of home at all,” said Venkatesham.According to statistics shared by police, actions were taken against 642 persons on Sunday, while many were made to sit and perform yoga as punishmentThe city currently has 586 Covid-19 positive cases, with 50 deaths, till Sunday.Taking note of surge in infection, Pawar on Saturday pulled up officials from the administration and police department, asking them to implement the lockdown rules strictly.To increase efforts to reduce crowd on streets, district collector Naval Kishore Ram held meeting with officials. “To bring down Covid-19 positive numbers, we have to make every possible effort in next eight days so that people will stay at home,” said Ram.Vinit Kadam, a resident of Katraj, said, “We are not getting enough vegetables and at some shops, they are sold at a very high price. So today (on Sunday) we preferred chicken.”While chicken was sold between Rs 180 to Rs 200 per kg, mutton was sold at Rs 650 to Rs 750, depending on type and quality.Another resident Asim Banekar from Swargate said, “It has become difficult to get basic vegetables like potatoes and onions.

20-04-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Sassoon’s doctors, nurses deserve our applause||The abrupt removal of a popular General from the midst of a raging war demands close scrutiny. What were the extraordinary reasons for the sudden removal of Dr Ajay Chandanwale as the dean of BJ Medical College – Sassoon General Hospital last week? After all, he was at the forefront of Pune’s response to the global Covid-19 pandemic, with our city being one of the hotspots. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been repeatedly saying that we need to applaud our doctors, nurses and other health workers for fighting on the frontlines, and not demoralise them in any way. It is our health workers-- and not the politicians and bureaucrats-- who are the backbone of India’s war against the coronavirus. If something was seriously amiss in Dr Chandanwale’s leadership, then, certainly, an inquiry should have been instituted and appropriate action taken after the pandemic was brought under control- not in the midst of the battle.Predictably, a large section of the rank and file of Sassoon Hospital protested publicly against Dr Chandanwale’s removal. They met Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar to register their protest and demanded the reinstatement of Dr Chandanwale. The next day they worked with black bands. At least one senior doctor and four nurses from Sassoon have tested positive and are in quarantine. The nurses and lower health staff have been demanding safer working conditions and this is the reality of all government hospitals across the country. As is well-known, the completion of Sassoon Hospital’s new 11-storeyed building was delayed by the public works department (PWD) for almost nine years. Once the coronavirus pandemic hit Pune, it was hurriedly made operational with intensive care unit (ICU) facilities and isolation beds in a matter of two-three weeks.Credible voices in the medical fraternity are unanimous that Dr Chandanwle’s abrupt removal was wrong. Politicians, such as the senior city Congressman Arvind Shinde, have blamed the former dean for the high number of Covid-19 deaths at Sassoon, and other alleged acts of mismanagement. Indeed, as of April 18, 42 of the total 51 Covid-19 deaths in Pune, did occur at Sassoon. As Dr Chandanwale and the Sassoon administration explained, the biggest reason for these deaths was late admissions and high co-morbidity. The political-bureaucratic bosses chose to blame the former Sassoon dean for this rather than examine and address the delay in admissions and rectify the weak links in the ‘referral chain’ of Covid-19 patients. Is this a case of fire happening somewhere and the fire fighting happening somewhere else? We will know in a matter of just a few weeks from now.

20-04-2020||Kolkata||Covid-19 kits supplied by ICMR-NICED defective, says West Bengal||The West Bengal government has alleged that the Covid-19 testing kits supplied by the NICED, ICMR’s nodal agency in the state, a fortnight ago, are “apparently defective” as they show “inconclusive results” leading to repeated confirmatory tests and delaying diagnosis of the disease.The ICMR-NICED authorities said it could be possibly because the kits “have not been standardized” and it is considering the matter “very seriously”.West Bengal has reported 12 deaths and 276 cases of COVID-19 affliction.“The apparently defective test kits supplied by ICMR-NICED, Kolkata, have started to throw up a large number of inconclusive results, necessitating a repeat/confirmatory test run, thereby causing a delay in the generation of the final test report,” the West Bengal department of health and family welfare has tweeted.The “high number of repeat/ confirmatory tests are causing delays and other attendant problems at a time when we are battling a pandemic,” it said, adding the Incian Council of Medical Research needs to look into it immediately.The department claimed that the problem of defective kits has been faced not just by government labs in the state but other testing labs in the country.The state health department had faced no such problem when the testing kits were supplied directly by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, it said.Recently, the supplies to government laboratories in West Bengal have been routed through ICMR-NICED, Kolkata, the department tweeted.When contacted, NICED Director Shanta Dutta said,”It is unfortunate that test kits have not been standardised to yield appropriate results. It is difficult for each medical college to standardise them, because of which there were different and inconclusive results.” She said the matter was “very seriously considered” by the ICMR.“Initial NIV kit was an assembled one where the NIV had procured the primer and probes from the US, standardised the kit in their laboratory with other reagents and controls, and distributed it directly to other VRDLs (Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory).“When demand for the kit icreased, it was difficult for the NIV to cope up with it. Then ICMR started procuring readymade kits and supplied to VRDLs through 16 depots across the country,” she said.West Bengal on Sunday received 10,000 rapid antibody testing kits from ICMR and is expected to start using them soon in areas with a high number of COVID-19 patients.The rapid tests will be conducted at the hotspots, clusters, containment zones or as a surveillance tool for epidemiological purposes in areas which have not reported any case so far.

The daily wage earners, the homeless and the migrant labourers are still facing difficulty in procuring even a meal a day. In such times, it’s the NGOs that have come forward to extend help. The Satsang Seva Mission is one such initiative by The Satsang Foundation (TSF), which is enabling distribution of cooked food and other essentials to those in need. READ | This is how good Samaritans are helping Delhi survive in lockdownDuring the initial days when the lockdown was announced, a number of migrant construction workers appeared before a gated colony in Noida, saying they hadn’t eaten for a number of days. A member of TSF, who resides in that colony, cooked and fed a cluster of about 15 of their families. Upon informing TSF about this situation, dry rations were organised for the labourers living in this location. Sri M, TSF’s founder and social reformer, says, “While the government under the leadership of the Prime Minister is working round the clock to deal with the situation, solutions to such serious situations can only be found through public cooperation and active participation.” Joining the fight against Covid-19 crisis, the foundation distributed Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), masks and sanitizers to health care providers. And the volunteers of the foundation in Delhi got some cloth masks made from requisitioned tailors — who are currently out of work — after sourcing some surplus cloth from exporters. About 400 regular three ply masks were also provided to cancer patients at the night shelters outside All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Besides, the NGO has carried out several activities, for the larger cause of humanity. Bela Mahendru, executive secretary of TSF’s Delhi Kendra, adds, “We distributed 470 ration bags for four weeks, in Noida and Gurugram, and also provided AIIMS, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital with a number of N95 and 3 ply masks. Dry ration was also provided to feeding about 8,000 people in a shelter for the homeless at Yamuna Pushta. Currently, we are distributing 10,000 cloth masks to the families of daily wagers, slum dwellers and the homeless throughout the city. We have also received a request to provide dry ration to 500 homeless rickshaw pullers.” READ | The power of social media: Strangers across India connect to help the needyBut this pandemic can’t be fought alone. That’s why Sri M encourages everyone to help each other brace the present situation where lockdown is essential to stop the spread of coronavirus. “It will be a good idea to help the lesser privileged understand how to protect themselves and assure them that this shall also pass. You may add to these activities by joining hands in any way, including funding the projects [for relief] to the best of your ability.

20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Show us the way home, moan Chandigarh’s rickshaw pullers||There is no work, no earning, no certainty of food and no home to quarantine in. Such are the conditions of a majority of the rickshaw pullers in Chandigarh.Rameshwar a rickshaw-puller of Uttar Pradesh says, “Every year, at this time of the year, I used to return to my village to harvest wheat. Can I not get a pass to go home somehow?”He lives along with four others in roofed rickshaws meant for school children. The rickshaws are parked by the wall of the Government High School, Sector 35-A. The stove built by the wall of the school has not been lit for many days.Sunder, yet another rickshawala from UP, says, “We are not earning anything. I am very unhappy. I want to go home but how do I do that? Even the money I had saved for my family has been spent.”He breaks down while speaking to noted psychiatrist Simmi Waraich, a resident of Sector 35, who has taken it upon herself to provide a helping hand to the homeless daily wagers living in the corridors of the market and other open spaces.“They are now getting some food but it is not enough so some people are providing them with sugar, tea leaves and milk so that they can make some tea.”ELITE WORRIED ABOUT CLUSTERS What is sad is that some of the elite of the sector are worried that the rickshaw pullers are not safe because they live in clusters. However, an effort has been made to tell them the do’s and don’ts and the police has provided them with masks.Pramod Sharma, founder-coordinator, Yuvsatta (Youth for Peace), says “This section need to be treated with empathy for they are the most disadvantaged of the labourers. They have been providing services to the city while living in the open”.The rickshaw-pullers’ presence in the prestigious city is as old as the city itself. The cycle rickshawalas with their spacious Saharanpuri rickshaws started pedaling on the city roads from the 1950s as the earliest mode of transportation for the inhabitants here.Pinky Rani, project manager of Yuvsatta, in Bapu Dham Colony in the city’s Sector 26, points out that they are in dire straits and they only get meals once a day.“Earlier the pradhan of the colony was distributing some rice and dal in the evenings but that too has been stopped,” Rani says.‘PEOPLE LIVING AT HOME, RICKSHAW PULLERS WITH STRAYS’Raj Kumar, 38, says “There are around 1,000 rickshaw peddlers and vegetable sellers with carts who are on the brink of starvation here in our colony and the administration should help us.”In spite of the travails he is facing Sunder of Sector 35 says, “I know that I am not the only one in trouble, everyone is suffering but I just wish I was with my family in the village home!” Waraich says, “We need to reach out to these hapless people. We live in homes and some of us have two floors and a garden. They live in the open with stray dogs!”Vinod, a rickshawala living with eight others outside the quiet offices in Sector 35, says, “At present, there are only women are in our villages and they cannot do the harvesting so we are hoping we will get passes to return home!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/show-us-the-way-home-moan-chandigarh-s-rickshaw-pullers/story-4ZJmVpMYgOP4sAGmvWpzYK.html

For community surveillance and epidemiological analysis, too, we are taking influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) cases in community.”At present, the state government is only testing people coming from outside the state and exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Fever was so far considered a major symptom.“The solution to this problem is strict home quarantine as these asymptomatic positive people will soon turn non-contagious as their immunity will overpower the sub-clinical infection,” he said.QUARANTINE COMPULSORY FOR RECOVERED PATIENTSAfter a patient who had recovered from Covid-19 tested positive for the virus again on Sunday, the health department has make it mandatory for recovered patients to stay in quarantine after being discharged.The man who tested positive again had been treated at Rajendra Prasad Medical College in Tanda in Kangra district and had been quarantined at Cheb after treatment.As many as 7,381 persons have been put under quarantine in the hill state so far, of which 2,188 are under active surveillance, while 5,193 have completed their observation period. As many as 2,553 persons have been tested for Covid-19, of which 2,337 persons have been found negative.RAPID TEST KIDS AWAITEDThe Himachal Pradesh government had requested the centre to provide 30,000 rapid testing kits but so far it has only received 4,800. Una, Solan , Sirmaur, Kangra, Hamirpur, Chamba are the worst affected districts in Himachal and as many as 85 panchayats in these districts have been declared red zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/84-cases-in-himachal-pradesh-asymptomatic-health-department-worried/story-IVlbBccucUdSHja6bHwR0I.html
20-04-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand starts screening 4000 migrant labourers after 1 tests positive for coronavirus||A day after a 24-year-old migrant labourer in a relief camp in Roorkee tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Uttarakhand government has stepped up screening of about 4000 other such workers across the state. The migrant labourer, who tested positive for the coronavirus, had come to Rishikesh from Hathras in Uttar Pradesh to work but was caught on March 30 near Roorkee and sent to a relief camp. He along with three others were going back to Hathras by taking a lift from a truck driver. After he tested positive for the deadly virus on Saturday, 24 other migrant labourers who were staying in the same relief camp, were isolated by the health department. Their samples were also sent for testing to detect possible infection. Amit Negi, secretary of the state disaster management department who is looking after various government operations to contain the virus spread in state, said there are about 40,000 migrant labourers in Uttarakhand with 4000 of them in government relief camps.“The 4000 migrant labourers staying in relief camps are being screened by doctors daily to detect any rise in body temperature as a symptom of Covid-19 infection. They are being continuously monitored by the health department to ensure none gets infected,” Negi said.The senior bureaucrat added that most of the relief camps are in Haridwar, Dehradun, US Nagar, Pithoragarh and Haldwani areas of the state. “Doctors have been instructed to thoroughly examine migrant labourers in the relief camp. Apart from this, precautionary measures like maintaining social distance at the camps as well as while eating are also being strictly ensured to prevent the spread in the relief camps,” he said.The Uttarakhand government has said it is taking care of labourers from other states stranded in the state due to the Covid-19 lockdown. “We are taking all the necessary care of these migrant labourers here by providing them food and shelter for those who have nowhere to go. We are ensuring that nobody faces any problem regarding food and shelter,” Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and government spokesperson, said.Uttarakhand has allowed industrial activities in rural areas and industrial estates of the state from April 21 with prior permission from state government and concerned authorities.It has, however, asked the industries to resume operations only with the available local labour and not from outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-starts-screening-4000-migrant-labourers-after-1-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-Jx38luAduVHIwNIBHB96jJ.html

They had tested positive for Covid-19 along with their mother, and were admitted to the Sirsa civil hospital. Their mother, however, was in the isolation ward of PGIMS in Rohtak. When the health department gave permission to their father Amit Makkar, who runs a paying guest facility in Chandigarh and has tested negative thrice for the infection, to meet them at the isolation ward, the only demand his kids presented before him was of mobile phones.Amit said, “I was quite worried after my wife and both children tested positive for Covid-19. But, I heaved a sigh of relief as no one else was found infected and doctors finally allowed me to look after my kids.”He said the hospital staffers were polite and took best possible care of his children. “When I went to see them, Arush came running to me and asked me for a mobile phone so he can play games. I arranged phones for both of them,” he added. “They hardly knew about the seriousness of the disease, but I was worried. The medical staff gave me a PPE kit whenever I went to meet them,” Amit added. Chief medical officer Surender Nain said the condition of both the kids was stable and they have been spending time with their parents. “The health department is visiting their house daily to keep track of them. During their isolation time, we had also seen them studying in the ward, which was a sight to behold,” Dr Nain added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mobile-games-rescued-sirsa-siblings-from-boredom-in-isolation-ward/story-cTGzuNMVIiQxwNvOX0LfYN.html
20-04-2020||Mumbai||552 new Covid-19 cases; Maharashtra tally 4,200||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded its highest 24-hour jump in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases with 552 more infections, even as the state government plans to ease restrictions and resume industrial operations in rural areas from Monday. Of the new cases, which took India’s worst-hit state’s tally to 4,200, 456 of them were in Mumbai, taking the financial capital’s case count to 2,724. The Sunday spurt in cases rendered a blow to the rate of doubling of cases, after the relatively lower number of cases over the past four days. Maharashtra took 30 days to cross the 1,000-case mark on April 7, while it crossed the 2,000 mark in just six days on April 13. From 2,000 cases to 4,000, the state took six days.According to officials, the sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai is because of the backlog from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and a few private laboratories. The state health department said that some cases from Saturday evening had been waiting for confirmation. “We have to verify all the cases that we get, which takes time. Private labs send us the data first, then to BMC, so sometimes we observe discrepancy in reporting of cases,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare ) and director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra. “We have increased the number of daily tests, so of course, the detection of new cases will rise. We shouldn’t say that the curve is falling depending on the data of one-two days. We have to consider data for at least a week before we can come to a conclusion,” he said.The state also reported 12 deaths on Sunday, taking the toll to 223. Of these, six were in Mumbai, four from Malegaon and one each from Solapur and Ahmednagar. Six of them were above 60 years of age, while five were between 40 and 60 years, according to the report released by the state health department. “Some of the test reports added to today’s tally are from tests conducted since April 12 in Mumbai, thus increasing the tally,” the report stated. According to officials from the health department, the verification of private laboratory reports by government laboratories takes a few days. “It leads to a sharp spike in numbers on the day the verification is done,” an official said.Maharashtra has conducted 72,023 tests, of which, 67,673 samples tested negative. A total of 507 patients have fully recovered. There are 87,254 people under home quarantine across the state, while 6,743 are under institutional quarantine. The number of containment zones in the state has reduced to 368, most of them being in Mumbai. State authorities have so far screened 23.97 lakh people, with the help of 6,359 teams, as part of its containment strategy.Earlier in the day, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, while announcing the relaxation of lockdown restrictions in rural parts of the state, clarified that the strict restrictions in containment areas and in Mumbai and Pune will continue at least till May 3. “We are relaxing restrictions in green and orange zones, which have zero or fewer Covid-19 patients, to a certain extent. The industrial operations in these zones will be allowed, but the employers will have to ensure arrangements for stay and food for the employees. The district borders will, however, remained sealed and no intra-district activities be permitted,” he said.The state government has also directed 10% of its employees to resume work from Monday. By doing this, the government wants to resume public services step-by-step. Maharashtra has only four districts (Nanded, Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli) with no patients, while in 18 districts, the number (of Covid-19 cases) is in single digits. “We expect the industrial units in pharmaceuticals, agricultural sectors to begin operating from Monday. They are expected to follow the standard operating procedures laid down under the lockdown restrictions for their employees. There are 10.26 lakh registered MSMEs in the state, while 4.5 lakh are in areas which are partially exempted from April 20. We want 60% of them to be operational by the end of the month. However, major industries are in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune, where operations are unlikely to begin at least for the next few weeks,” said an official from the industries department.Some of the industries have been directed to operate at 50% of their workforce. The vehicles carrying workers will have to be restricted to 30-40% of the capacity of the vehicles, the restrictions imposed on the industries stated. The exemptions for e-commerce activities, shops selling sweets, snacks like farsan will begin operating from Monday in the areas that are not affected by Covid-19. “All these activities continue to be banned in MMR, Pune city, Nagpur city, which have been largely affected by the virus. We still are apprehensive about the pace of industrial and commercial activities in the state and urban parts will still continue to be under restriction. The industrial and commercial activities are majorly controlled in urban areas, which are still under the restrictions,” said an official from the state government.The MMR and Pune city remains to be the hotspot of Covid-19 cases, as 89.4% of the cases (3,262 of 3,648 on Saturday) and 90.5% of the deaths (191 of 211, as of Saturday) were from these regions, which are mostly urbanised areas. MMR and Pune accounts for less than 25% of the state’s population. The Maharashtra police have registered 55,393 cases related to violation of lockdown rules since March 22, the day the chief minister announced a complete lockdown in the state. The police helpline received 72,644 calls related to the pandemic, while 11,645 citizens have been arrested over the past four weeks. Of the total offences, 105 were for assault on policemen, while 567 were for violation of quarantine measures. The police have also booked 15 foreigners for visa violations. A total of 241 cases over objectionable posts on social media were also registered in the state.Meanwhile, Thackeray, in his video conference with district collectors and divisional commissioners on Sunday evening, said the last week of April and two weeks of May could prove to be crucial to judge the trend of the pandemic. “During this period, we will be in a position to judge if the trend is moving downwards or upwards. The battle has just started and will go on for the next three months. We have to convert the red zones into orange ones and orange zones into green ones,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has received 75,000 rapid test kits from the Centre. “We will begin the tests in the red zones very soon,” he said.Additional chief secretary, finance, Manoj Saunik, elaborated on the red, orange and green zones in the video conference. “The red zones are areas divided into outbreak area and cluster area, with more than 15 and less than 15 patients respectively. A red zone is converted into an orange zone after it sees no patient in 14 days. A green zone is converted from an orange zone after it does not register a patient in 14 days,” he said. Toll collection to resume from April 20Mumbai: The Maharashtra government will resume toll collection on state highways from April 20. The state government had stopped collecting toll on March 29. In Mumbai, toll operations on the five entry/exit points (Dahisar, Mulund, LBS Marg, Vashi and Airoli) along with the Bandra-Worli sea link will also resume from April 20, a government official confirmed.

All decisions will be taken keeping the best interests of students in mind.”Jha has asked HoDs for their suggestions on steps to be taken and directed them to send their feedbacks by Tuesday.Earlier, the V-C had directed departments of the university and affiliated colleges to complete the syllabus by May 9 through virtual platforms. The decision was met with criticism from students and teachers and later, the varsity said enough time will be given to them once the lockdown is lifted. “Around 60% syllabus was completed by departments before the lockdown was imposed. So, two or three weeks will be enough to complete the syllabus after classes resume,” the chairperson of a department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-seeks-information-on-completion-of-syllabus-from-departments/story-WdlPmtkaT0rVGjsDCMQpfP.html
20-04-2020||City||All eyes on corona, TB patients face neglect, cases may rise in Mumbai, warn experts||With most healthcare professionals focusing on Covid-19 cases, patients suffering from tuberculosis (TB), considered one of the biggest killers in Mumbai, are facing neglect, which doctors fear could lead to a rise in the number of cases. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data shows that last year, 27,664 new TB cases were found in Mumbai. According to data on the civic-run Sewri TB hospital available with HT, diagnosis of individuals with TB in outpatient department (OPD) has dropped to 1,235 in March from 1,418 in January; follow-up of old patients has dropped to 1,050 from 1,125. In the past three months, 337 patients succumbed to the infection at the hospital. Data from the civic body shows 1,601 TB patients died in 2018 in Mumbai; data for 2019 is yet to be compiled. The situation is no different in private hospitals where footfall of patients has plunged by more than 70% since March, said health experts.“Medical experts are neglecting the treatment of TB patients even though the death rate of TB in Mumbai is much higher than Covid-19. Every day, around three people in Mumbai die of TB,” said Ganesh Acharya, a TB survivor. On March 24, the World Health Organization (WHO) also directed countries with high TB burden to “ensure that essential health services and operations are continued to protect the lives of people with TB”. “Patients with TB suffer from compromised lungs. If they contract Covid-19 infection, their survival chances will be extremely low. Keeping their immunity high and avoiding outside contact is therefore essential,” said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent, Sewri TB Hospital. Moreover, currently, almost 40% Covid-19 cases are reported from the slums of Malad, Dadar, Govandi, Sion, Bandra and Andheri (East), which are also TB hotspots. Maintaining social distance in these overcrowded slums with community toilets is the biggest challenge for TB patients.“TB cases will rise drastically post this pandemic. The central government will have to take proactive steps for TB along with Covid-19 if it is serious about ending TB by 2025,” said Prabha Mahesh, TB advocate who is dealing with TB cases for 17 years.. “With symptoms of TB similar to Covid-19, many patients in overcrowded slums may go undetected with improper screening.”The civic body, however, has no concrete plan for hundreds of TB patients residing in Covid-19 hotspots. “We have instructed TB patients to avoid travel and home-quarantine. We are also testing TB patients for Covid-19 if he/she comes in close contact with an infected patient,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.Currently, most doctors in the city’s 250-odd health posts are on Covid-19 duty at various hospitals. Many patients – including those suffering from multidrug resistant (MDR) TB – aren’t getting their regular supply of medicines owing to the lockdown, said experts and doctors. “For the first six months, MDR-TB patients need injections that can only be taken under the supervision of medical experts. With several private DOT clinics shut, they are unable to take the injections,” said Nandita Venkatesan, a TB survivor.Refuting the allegation, Dr Pranita Tipre, head of TB, BMC, said, “We are providing door-to-door medicines to patients, so they don’t miss their dose. We have started an isolation ward for TB patients at Sewri TB Hospital.”Many Covid-19 centres such as the Jogeshwari Trauma Centre and Seven Hills hospital (city’s biggest Covid-19 isolation centre) do not have sputum testing facilities, which doctors said is likely to delay treatment of suspected patients as the symptoms for Covid-19 and TB are similar. “TB survivors and patients are living in fear. I am treating a 35-year-old woman who gets anxiety attacks even if someone around her coughs or sneezes,” said Dr Sagar Mundada, a city-based psychiatrist. “She has developed severe obsessive compulsive disorder, and keeps cleaning rooms with disinfectants.”‘How do I administer injections without doctor?’ Last month, a 32-year-old Malad resident was diagnosed with multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Her fight against the ailment has become more difficult during the ongoing lockdown, as clinics are closed and her medicines are not available easily. She needs to take Clofazimine tablets. She also needs to be administered with Mikacin injections either by a doctor or a nurse. “Finding a doctor or a nurse to administer injections has become a nightmare every day,” she told HT. The woman has been going to small nursing homes to get the injections administered but is worried as they are not following proper hygiene standards. “I develop anxiety as non-coronavirus patients walk around without masks and I am already suffering from one infection,” she said.Doctors suspect pregnant Covid patient had TBOn April 4, a nine-month pregnant woman, who was admitted to BYL Nair Hospital with severe respiratory distress, died within hours after her admission. Doctors conducted a coronavirus test on her, but also suspected that she had TB and informed about it to Sewri TB Hospital. “I asked Nair Hospital to send her X-ray and culture test, but the hospital didn’t conduct these tests, so her TB diagnosis were never confirmed,” the Sewri hospital doctor said. Two days later, her coronavirus results came positive. “As the post-mortem is not conducted for Covid-19 patients, we didn’t get the autopsy report,” said the doctor said. Sion woman was diagnosed after two weeks A 35-year-old slum dweller from Sion had to wait for more than two weeks to find out that she has TB. Later, Mushtaq Ansari, a local activist, helped her get her illness diagnosed. Ansari had come across the woman while distributing food in her slum on April 7. The woman told him she had undergone a TB test at Sion Hospital on April 1, but the doctors from the chest department were assigned duty in the Covid ward. “I went to the hospital with my reports but the doctors weren’t available. All the private clinics were also closed, so I couldn’t show my reports there either,” she said. It was on April 15 that doctors confirmed she has TB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-eyes-on-corona-tb-patients-face-neglect-cases-may-rise-in-mumbai-warn-experts/story-o3ZlMmz5TFEwEDjCKIUqrL.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||35 people in Delhi’s Tughlakabad Extension test Covid-19 positive||As many as 35 people living in two lanes of Tughlakabad Extension in South East Delhi tested Covid-19 positive on Sunday, prompting authorities to step up vigilance and preventive measures in the area. According to government officials, the area has emerged as a new cluster within an already notified containment zone. Lanes 26 and 27 of Tughlakabad Extension were declared a containment zone on Friday after three people were tested positive for Covid-19.“Those who have tested positive are being shifted to a hospital. Containment measures are already in place in the area. Vigilance has been increased,” a senior district administration official said. The official said that their contact tracing is still underway.Poonam Bhati, councillor of Tughlakabad Extension, said that the area was initially declared a containment zone after three residents had tested Covid-19 positive on April 15.She said that during a house-to-house survey, some people exhibited symptoms, following which their samples were taken.“Samples of 93 people were collected on Friday from the area and 35 tested positive today (Sunday). The positive cases include children and elderly people,” Bhati said. The entire area has been sanitised, she addedBhati said that these 35 people are part of six to seven families.A similar incident was reported in Jahangirpuri of North Delhi on Saturday, wherein at least 26 members of an extended family had tested positive in the containment zone. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday had expressed concern over the movement of people among their relatives’ houses within containment zones.Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Sunday declared three new Covid-19 containment zones taking the count to 80 from 77 on Saturday. Delhi reported 110 Covid-19 positive cases on Sunday.Containment zones can comprise apartment blocks, gated communities, slums, streets or neighbourhoods. It is a complete quarantine zone and no one is allowed to step out even to buy essential goods. All entry and exit points, and internal lanes are barricaded in these zones. The authorities allow only select vendors to supply groceries and other essentials to the neighbourhood, with the help of residents’ welfare associations and civil defence volunteers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/vigil-stepped-up-as-35-in-tughlakabad-extension-test-positive/story-n6wATfGcm4j3KMYSfPSGSJ.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||All 11 Delhi districts now Covid-19 hotspots; NE district joins the list||Declaring all 11 revenue districts of Delhi as hot spots, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday directed the city administration to conduct a fresh assessment of the Covid-19 situation in Delhi – in terms of numbers, trends and patterns pertaining to the outbreak – by April 27. Based on this review, the government will decide on whether to relax the extended lockdown curbs.The move comes as the last district in the city (North East), which had reported no cluster cases of the coronavirus transmission till Saturday, was also identified as a hot spot after three containment zones were notified here on Saturday.“Delhi has 11 revenue districts. All of them have been declared hot spots,” said Kejriwal at a press briefing where he added that the Delhi government will not be relaxing curbs from Monday, which the Centre had allowed. The city also has 80 containment zones.A hot spot is a geographic area, which is put under surveillance and scaled-up test standards to check possibilities. A containment zone within a hot spot is a sealed area that is subjected to stricter surveillance, scaled-up testing, quarantine, periodic sanitisation, door-to-door health checks and supply of essentials at collection points or doorsteps.According to a senior official from the chief minister’s office, on April 15, when the Centre released a list of hot spots across the country, the North East and North West districts were not included as they did not have any notified containment zones. But, on April 17, North West Delhi got its first notified containment zone and the next day, North East Delhi got three. Both were technically notified by the Centre as hot spots on Saturday.Till Sunday, Delhi had around 2,003 active cases - with 45 dead, 26 in ICU and six on ventilator support.After extending the nation wide lockdown to May 3 the Union government on April 15 had allowed relaxations to certain “additional activities” from Monday provided that they did not fall under containment zones, among other conditions. In Delhi’s context, it included allowing self-employed service providers such as electricians and plumbers, and construction work where sites have provision for safe accommodation of workers.HT reported on April 19 that the Delhi government did not want to ease restrictions on grounds that the city-state is a “high-risk zone”.“The coronavirus is spreading fast,” said Kejriwal. “The situation is concerning but not out of control yet. With strict adherence to quarantine and social distancing norms, we need to keep it under control… For the safety of the people of Delhi, we have taken a decision. For now, there will be no relaxations in lockdown (in Delhi). One week later, we will conduct an assessment with the help of experts. Further calls on possible relaxations, if need be, will be taken on the basis of that.”HT accessed an order from chief secretary Vijay Dev issued soon after Kejriwal’s briefing that said: “The situation of Covid-19 in Delhi has been assessed, and in view of the present scenario, it appears to be necessary to maintain status quo, in larger public interest.”“Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 22 of the Disaster Management Act 2005, the undersigned (chief secretary) … hereby issues directions to all departments of Delhi to ensure status quo is maintained with respect to strict implementation of the consolidated guidelines enclosed in the order dates April 15 without any relaxation and additional activities till another comprehensive assessment on 27th April or further orders, whichever is earlier,” the order said.A senior government official said that for this assessment, the central government’s list of “additional activities would be under consideration. “There is no deliberation on expanding the relaxations beyond that as the revised guidelines of the Union government clearly said that the flexibilities should not dilute its purpose at any cost,” he said.Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said Delhi was not in a position to relax the lockdown.“Delhi is vulnerable because of its high population density. Mobility is directly proportional to chances of transmission and that is already visible to some extent after the first phase of 21 days’ lockdown. So, stricter restrictions is a necessary step at this juncture,” said Kishore, who is leading a roped in by the Delhi government to monitor testing.Kejriwal said that random tests in containment zones showed that those which maintained strict quarantine, showed better results. “Imagine the situation without a lockdown,” said Kejriwal. “If 3,000 people suddenly need ICU (intensive care unit) beds, 2,000-2,500 need ventilators, what would we do? We don’t have that many ICUs and ventilators. Countries such as Italy, Spain and USA have witnessed such tragic circumstances. Without lockdown, we too could have seen such a situation. The lockdown has saved the country.”“According to the guidelines issued by the central government, areas where cases are less, can be subjected to relaxations,” he said. “Hot spots and containment zones can’t be relaxed. In Delhi, all 11 revenue districts are declared hot spots now and the city currently has 77 containment zones.”.Citing findings of Delhi government’s own assessment, the chief minister said: “We have witnessed increase in the number of cases. Yesterday, out of the 736 test results processed, 186 people tested (Covid) positive and all individuals were asymptomatic which suggests that they would have compromised with isolation norms and potentially spread the virus without even knowing. This is a scary situation.”“I understand the pain of people,” he added. “We too could have allowed relaxations. But, if we give relaxation, what if cases go up and the ICUs and ventilators fall short. And people lose lives? We won’t be able to forgive ourselves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/all-11-delhi-districts-now-hotspots-cm-calls-for-fresh-assessment-by-april-27-for-possible-relaxations/story-vgDn8cdxsrMGtWwo5kNm6O.html

The Central government, in a set of guidelines issued last week, had allowed these migrant workers to begin work from April 20, however, leaving the final decision of implementation on the state governments.The Delhi government on Sunday said it will not implement the guideline, as the number of Covid-19 positive cases were rising in the state.On Sunday, 35-year-old Mithun Kumar, a labourer who works for the Public Works Department (PWD) projects, opened his torn wallet to show two currency notes of ₹ 20. “This is all I have left. This epidemic has left me with nothing,” he said..Like Kumar, many construction workers, self-employed electricians, plumbers, carpenters and mechanics that HT spoke to said they were waiting for Monday, hoping they will be able to finally resume work after nearly a month. However, the Delhi government’s decision had left them dejected and in dire straits.“Our contractor has not given us our dues yet. He keeps saying that he will pay us when he has money. We can’t work and we can’t even go back home,” Kumar said.At the Barapulla Phase-3 construction site opposite Mayur Vihar, dozens of labourers sat playing cards, most of them unaware of Delhi government’s decision.“Even if construction work is allowed to begin, many of us will not stay. We will go home once the train services resume,” said Dileep Dev Sharma from West Bengal.These men said that their contractors has given them an assurance of payment for the time they weren’t working, but they haven’t been paid anything since March 10.Not only workers, but government agencies are also worried that the ban on construction work will only result in the delay of infrastructure projects. At present, at least five government projects are under construction only in south Delhi’s Chattarpur, for which 1,000 to 1,200 labourers have been kept in-situ.“This is a health emergency but stopping work would not just mean that the project deadlines will extend by several months. It will lead to heavy cost escalations too,” said a senior PWD official.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which is also undertaking construction of phase-4, said that they will abide by the government order and no construction activity will be undertaken until further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-lockdown-relief-govt-in-delhi-migrant-labourers-brace-for-more-hardships/story-XuAz4Z5TWyosesJtsCUUqK.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||110 new cases in Delhi push Covid tally across 2,000||With 110 new cases on Sunday, Delhi’s total number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases crossed the 2,000 mark. The total stood at 2,003 on Sunday, according to daily data provided by the Delhi government.Two more deaths were recorded on Sunday, taking the total death toll of the city to 45.The people who died on Sunday were a 70-year-old male and a 71-year-old female. Both deaths were reported from Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital.Over 64% of these cases were recorded among people below the age of 50, according to a break-up of the case profile provided by the government. Of the 1,989 cases for which this data was available, 320 were in the age group of 50- 59 years and 386 were 60 years or older.However, more than half the deaths were among those aged 60 years and above, with 25 of the total 45 deaths in this age group. As per the data, 10 were aged less than 50 years, while 10 were aged between 50 and 59 years.Among those who died, 84% had co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease.The data also shows that Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths from the city, with 20 of the 45 deaths being reported from the hospital.The hospital had earlier said, “Most of the Covid-19 deaths that have occurred in our hospital are of patients who were referred from other hospitals at an advanced stage and had significant co-morbidities. The patients who are attending our hospital early in their course of the disease or do not have significant comorbidities are faring very well.”Lok Nayak Hospital, which has been treating the highest number of Covid-19 positive and symptomatic patients, has reported five deaths so far. Apollo Hospital, a private facility, has reported five Covid-19 deaths.Of those who have tested positive so far, at least 73 are healthcare workers.Of the 682 Covid-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms admitted to nine government and private hospitals across the city, 26 are in the intensive care unit, with six persons on the ventilator.Another 912 Covid-19 positive people, with very mild or no symptoms, have been admitted to the 10 ‘Covid Care Centres’ created by the Delhi government in the DDA and DUSIB flats.Although Delhi missed the target of performing 20,000 RT PCR tests in five days, it has scaled up testing, with 2,104 samples being collected on Sunday. This takes the total number of samples collected in the city since mid-January, when the screening began, to 24,387.Delhi saw a second spike in the number of cases when the government scaled up its testing. The first spike in numbers was seen when a gathering of over 2,300 people were evacuated from Nizamuddin Markaz in March-end. The government did not provide data on how many of the samples collected on Sunday were from those connected to the gathering.Community testing with the rapid test kits was yet to begin in Delhi on Sunday, a day after the state government received 42,000 rapid test kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/110-new-cases-in-delhi-push-covid-tally-across-2-000/story-KrFWgnI603MgSxIsEGTSIJ.html

20-04-2020||Delhi||45-day-old is India’s youngest Covid victim||A 45-day-old baby infected with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) died on Saturday at Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC), making him the youngest person to die of the infection in the country. The baby had been admitted to the hospital’s paediatric intensive care unit soon after birth on developing the respiratory ailment.“Soon after birth, the baby had developed a severe acute respiratory infection and was admitted to the paediatric ICU. As per protocol, a sample of the baby was collected for Covid-19. The report came back positive on Friday and the baby died on Saturday morning,” said an official of the hospital, on condition of anonymity.Officials said the father of the baby tested positive for the infection on Saturday. But the authorities say it is still unclear how the baby was infected. Another 10-month-old child admitted to the same ward tested positive for the infection on Saturday evening, according to officials from the hospital. There were unconfirmed reports from the hospital that the baby had died on Friday before the test results came back.The 377-bed Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital associated with LHMC is one of Asia’s biggest paediatric hospitals. The ward in which both the babies were admitted was not a Covid-19 designated ward. The hospital has a Covid-19 ward in another building, where 15 positive patients are admitted currently.There were seven children on ventilator in the same ICU unit as the 45-day-old. After all of them tested negative and moved to another location in the hospital. Officials said the ICU has been sanitised.After the Delhi State Cancer Institute, the paediatric ICU ward of Lady Hardinge Medical College has become a hotbed for Covid-19 infections, with at least nine staff members – doctors, nurses, and sanitation workers – from the ward testing positive for the infection. One of these resident doctors tested positive on Sunday morning.“Initially, one of the resident doctors working in the paediatric ICU had gotten himself tested and the report turned out to be positive. After that, the surveillance teams traced the contacts of the doctors. Yesterday, two nurses tested positive and today five others have tested positive for the infection,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.At the Delhi State Cancer Institute, 25 healthcare workers had tested positive for the infection, resulting in a temporary shutdown of the hospital. The hospital will resume its out-patient clinic from Monday morning.So far, at least 70 healthcare workers across the city have tested positive for the infection.The authorities are still contact-tracing to decide who all should go into quarantine and get tested. Another emerging hospital hotspot is Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, where four nurses tested positive for the infection on Saturday. Two doctors, four nurses and one member of the sanitation staff have tested positive from the hospital so far.“At least 65 doctors who had come in contact with these hospital staff have been asked to go into quarantine. Apart from that, an ICU had to be shut down in the hospital and its staff quarantined. There will be more nurses and workers who might have been asked to remain in quarantine,” said a doctor from RML hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/45-day-old-is-india-s-youngest-covid-victim/story-5r0cZFVmAMjU1L6e3cmTaL.html
20-04-2020||Pune||Primary-level screening responsible for identifying 87% of Pune’s Covid-19 cases||As per data shared by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department, of the 501 positive cases reported in the PMC jurisdiction as of April 17, 438 or 87% were referrals from PMCs flu centre OPDs, hospitals or detected through house-to-house surveys.Only 50 positive cases were close contacts of Covid-19 patients and 13 had a foreign travel history. In the cases of the deceased too, of the 44 deceased as of April 17, 36 did not report any foreign travel history.According to Dr Sanjiv Wavare, assistant health chief, PMC, primary-level screening at various hospitals and also at high-risk areas, followed by isolation and quarantine of suspected patients has become crucial. “Screening at a primary level helps in alleviating fear from the minds of many people who think that they might have Covid-19 and it also helps contain the spread of the virus and break the chain,” he said.India’s apex research body, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) denies any community transmission yet. Dr Rajani Kant, scientist and head of research management, policy planning and coordination, at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “We are closely watching things. We need to be vigilant, so that community transmission should not happen. But there are pockets where number of cases is more. These are identified as hotspots. But this does not mean that there is community transmission in all these hot spots yet.” According to the PMC data, patients who have flu-like symptoms are sent to flu clinics, if the symptoms are moderate, they are referred to one of the 11 dedicated covid health centres in the city. If the symptoms are severe they are referred to one of three dedicated covid hospitals. In case the person is negative, but has flu-like symptoms then the person is isolated at the Navle Engineering College hostel, Sinhgad; if the person is from a slum or a densely populated area s/he is advised home quarantine. Private hospitals like Ruby Hall Clinic are also focusing on screening patients showing any signs of flu. At least 30,000 patients have been screened here.Dr Nita Munshi, director of the laboratory and infection control department, Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We have referred many suspicious cases post our three-stage screening to Naidu hospital to ensure that no corona patient enters the hospital premises. This also makes the hospital a safe place for other patients who come for other treatments. Till now we have sent the swabs of at least 100 patients admitted in our isolation ward to Naidu hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/primary-level-screening-responsible-for-identifying-87-of-pune-s-covid-19-ve-cases/story-gc6RRB7M1ODMZC7GMaRMEK.html
20-04-2020||Pune||Police provide food to labour camp at Guru Nanaknagar in Pune||PUNE Police commissioner K Venkatesham promised to fulfil the supply and demand gap of essential commodities at the labour colony in Ambegaon, Guru Nanaknagar in Katraj which he visited on Saturday.HT had reported about the plight of the labourers in the edition dated April 16.The often neglected colony of Vadar community, which is a 600-700 metre long steep uphill trek away from the beginning of Guru Nanaknagar, also received relief after the police commissioner took note of their struggle to get basic necessity like water.“A day after you (HT reporter) came here, the big (senior) police officers showed up with relief and there was food in our house that will last for good 8-10 days,” said Ranjana Jadhav, 30, a mother of two who lives in the Vadar colony.With a 12-day old baby, Annuradha Jadhav, barely 20-years-old herself, was able to have a complete meal after days due to the relief provided by the police. She was left alone in a hut with her two daughters as her parents and extended family left for another house down the hill.“I live here with my daughters. I finally got some milk and she is sleeping,” said Jadhav.Saleem Shaikh, a volunteer from the region, has been providing meals in the area. However, the food provided by him was not nearly enough, according to the labourers living in Guru Nanaknagar.As a result of the severe shortage of food during the lockdown and the lack of information regarding the extension of the lockdown, the workers had tried to walk from Pune to their native places in Madhya Pradesh.They were intercepted by Kondhwa police station officials at Khadi Machine chowk and sent back to their houses on the hill in Guru Nanaknagar.The police joined forces with Shaikh and deployed the newly formed social policing cell for the task.Police sub-inspector Mahendra Patil of Bharti Vidyapeeth police station ensured that the shortage of food is met with.“On April 18, police commissioner paid a surprise visit to the labour colony and praised the work that we had put in. This form of encouragement is much more valuable than any award,” said PSI Patil.Five kg wheat or flour (whichever was available), 5kg rice, oil, sugar, tea powder, sugar, salt, and milk were among the relief package provided by the police. The supplies are sourced from multiple NGOs and volunteer donors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-commissioner-channels-relief-to-labour-camp-at-guru-nanaknagar/story-F376j15ZRiwhlr9LYxb7AK.html

20-04-2020||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar: Two more test positive for Covid-19, 59 active cases||As two more people from the district tested positive for Coronavirus disease, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases to 97 by Sunday evening, the district health department said it will start conducting rapid antibody tests (RAT) in the 30 hot spots to speedily assess the number of suspected cases. The two identified persons include a 12-year-old girl from Sector 8, who has been admitted to Sharda Hospital, and 40-year-old man from the Kendriya Vihar 2, who has been admitted at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences. Though officials were yet to ascertain the source of infection for either of the patients, health officials, since April 8, have shifted hundreds of people from the slums in Sector 8 and 5 to government quarantine centres as a precautionary measure. The step was taken after four persons, with one linked to Ceasefire, tested positive for Covid-19 in the Sector 5 JJ Colony. The girl, a resident of the slums in Sector 8, was confirmed as infected in her second test which was conducted as she was symptomatic.Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to start conducting rapid antibody tests—a supplementary tool which detects Covid antibodies in the bloodstream in about 15 minutes as opposed to the 24- to 48-hour testing time for the Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) molecular tests—to speedily assess cluster spread. However, RAT is known to show negative result during the initial stage of the infection.The district has received 1,000 RAT kits. Officials said they would go in vans to conduct random testing of suspects in and around hot spots. Meanwhile, GIMS has come up with a Covid triage kiosk with cubicles for doctors so they can talk to the patient through microphones, reducing the risk of contracting infection.“With this system in place, the doctor can observe patient at close quarters and ensure there is no communication gap. It will also help in keeping the medical staff safe. We are expecting that the initiative will help us in creating a better system to fight Covid-19,” GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta said.As on Sunday evening, there were a total of 4,212 cluster containment teams in the district, 4,15,369 houses had been surveyed and 13,24,278 persons screened. The health department had notified 1,967 travellers and 1,119 people were under surveillance. A total of 2,289 samples had been collected. Currently, there are 59 active Covid-19 cases in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gautam-budh-nagar-two-more-test-positive-for-covid-19-59-active-cases/story-AcoQZoWI2CJ0ERFHRP8EyL.html

Considering the current situation, 30 locations have been identified as hot spots and have been completely sealed under lockdown. For the hot spots containing a single case, we have decided to quarantine the zone up to a radius of one kilometre. However, there will a three-kilometre quarantine zone for a cluster with more than one Covid-19 case. The time has come for us to follow the lockdown rules in a more disciplined way,” he said.Stating that a two-kilometre buffer zone has been created outside quarantine zones, Suhas said that no activity other than the supply of essential commodities and visits from medical and sanitation teams will be permitted in these quarantine and buffer zones. “If no infection is reported during the next 28 days, the hot spot will be converted into a green zone. But since a major part of the district is divided into quarantine and buffer zones, we can’t allow other activities. Even the people involved in the door-to-door delivery of essential goods will be investigated for Covid-19 randomly,” he said.The district magistrate further said that no housing project or any other construction work will be allowed in the district. “Taking cognisance of the prevailing situation, permission for any type of operations in new industrial or commercial establishments will not be granted. Except for essential services, no activity will be allowed even in government offices. Even the passes issued earlier for the operation of essential goods and services in quarantine zones will be reviewed by the competent authority,” he said.Announcing relaxation for rural areas outside the quarantine zones, the DM said that work related to agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries may be allowed, provided the guidelines on social distancing under the prescribed protocol of Covid-19 are followed. “Violation of orders issued for lockdown will be considered an offence under sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act-2005 and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/no-relaxation-in-commercial-activities-lockdown-rules-to-become-stricter-in-noida/story-zEOo26mWLjvCQboNiV1amI.html

According to the Gurugram police, the reason behind the incident is yet to be known. However, the local police and family members of the officer said that he was suffering from work-related stress. The police said that the deceased man, an inspector, was a resident of Rewari and lived with his family on rent. He used to travel to Gurugram for work every day. The officer was earlier posted as a station house officer (SHO) at a police station in the city and was transferred to the traffic unit recently. The incident took place when he returned home after finishing his shift. Dinesh Kumar, sub-inspector (SI), Model Town police station, Rewari, said, “He returned to his house around 11pm and had dinner. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, he was sleeping in a separate room at home, as a precautionary measure. On Sunday around 7am, when his wife went to his room, she saw him hanging.” He added that the family immediately took him to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead on arrival.“The family has informed us that the deceased man was suffering from work-related stress,” the SI said.

20-04-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 lockdown: Construction, sweet shops to reopen today||Starting today, construction activities at private and public projects, courier services, opening of farsan and sweet shops will be allowed in the city. E-commerce websites, too, can begin deliveries, but only of essential commodities. However, these activities will not be allowed in containment zones. Also, those operating need to get a permission pass issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The state had issued a circular dated April 17, giving permission to operate several non-essential activities in order to boost the economy. The BMC then on Sunday issued a circular listing the relaxation that will be granted in non-containment zones, such as allowing delivery of electrical appliances, subject to a pass from local ward offices of the BMC. The passes will be issued at ward offices between 7am and 9pm daily. However, after the Centre banned the delivery of non-essential items, the BMC said it will also follow suit. Praveen Pardeshi, municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We shall be revising the same [earlier order] as informed by the state govt.”The BMC, meanwhile, has allowed carrying out commercial activities such as those related to fisheries, home delivery by restaurants and cable services. The civic body has urged that not more than two people should be in the lift at a time. The circular allows construction activities for public projects, construction, resurfacing, repairs of water supply, sewer and storm-water drain lines, construction repairs and pre-monsoon desilting. In case of private projects, the BMC will grant permission if workers are available at the site and all precautions are taken, states the circular.Agricultural product related trades, those involved in medical or health care and essential services will have to get passes from the ward office. The civic body has not allowed any industrial activity, considering the city is in the red zone. “As per directions, industries/industrial establishments will not be allowed to operate in Mumbai limits. No worker from a containment zone will be permitted to go to a workplace in industries/industrial establishments, permitted outside Mumbai,” stated the circular.Meanwhile, on Sunday, seven medical staff members of Bombay Hospital tested positive, taking the case count to 19. The Bombay Hospital has so far tested around 440 medical staff members. Dr Gautam Bhansali, consulting physician, Bombay Hospital, said, “All are in stable condition. We are going to ensure that our OPD for non-Covid patients starts in the coming few days.” The BMC has also made 810 community toilets free for public use. The city’s Covid-19 hotspot, Dharavi, saw 20 new cases on Sunday, bringing the count to 138 with 11 deaths, according to the BMC. Of the 20 new cases, the highest (6) cases were recorded in Fatima Chawl, followed by three cases from Kalyanwadi.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G-North ward, said, “Most of the cases were detected in fever clinics.”A team of 17 doctors and 50 nurses has screened more than 40,000 people in the fever clinics and 223 have been identified and sent for laboratory tests, said a BMC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-lockdown-construction-sweet-shops-to-open-from-today/story-KMHDwqFo0isl8dbuyRBZQO.html
20-04-2020||Gurugram||To operate in Gurugram, industries with MHA go-ahead must seek state approval through Saral portal||Industrial units and businesses in the district, which are eligible as per home ministry guidelines to resume operations, will have to apply to the Haryana government through the Saral portal and seek approval to do so. VS Kundu, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), who is also the monitoring official for the district for Covid-19, said on Sunday that there would be no automatic approval for resuming industrial operations in the city from April 20. The clarification came after the Haryana government brought out guidelines for the gradual easing of the lockdown across the state. Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal and Nuh are included in the red zone due to the high number of Covid-19 positive cases in these districts. “Committees for the review of applications will be formed at sub-divisional level, municipal level and district level. Once these are approved, only then industries can operate,“ Kundu said, adding that though Gurugram is in the red zone (with 37 Covid-19 cases), certain areas will be open for industries to operate but not without approval.The Gurugram labour department, meanwhile, said that industries will be given permission gradually but the keyword would be preventing the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “The industries that want to operate must be adequately prepared. We have to see whether there is space for workers’ lodgings, are facilities created to ensure safe work and travel, how many workers are required,” said Munish Sharma, additional labour commissioner, NCR.As per the labour department, there are around 1,400 small and large units in the Manesar industrial township and around 1,400 in Udyog Vihar, and they would have to route their applications through the Saral portal of the Haryana government to seek permission. “As per the SoP issued by Haryana government, applications of these firms would be processed in a decentralised manner so that decisions can be taken speedily. However, we will have to ensure that guidelines pertaining to safe working are followed,” said Sharma.Outlining the conditions under which the operations will be allowed, the additional labour commissioner said that cross-border movement of workers from Delhi or Faridabad will not be allowed, or if required, they will be allowed to cross over only once. “There will be no daily movement across the border. We prefer that people walk, cycle or take two-wheelers to work. The workers can also stay inside the units or nearby,” said Sharma, adding that permission for operating cabs and buses will also not be given.The department will also seek an affidavit from industrial and business units regarding their acceptance of the norms.In exceptional cases, the administration can allow the use of cars, but only one passenger and driver will be allowed. “It is not that we don’t want industries to resume operations but the priority is to contain the spread of the virus. So we want business units to take the precautions very seriously and adopt them in letter and spirit,” he said.As per the guidelines issued by the Haryana government, block-level committees will approve applications of industries or commercial establishments with 25 employees. As for companies with employees between 25 and 200, their applications will be scrutinised by the additional deputy commissioner or the municipal corporation. For companies with more than 200 employees, a committee headed by the deputy commissioner will provide approval.For the construction industry also, the labour department said that permission will have to be sought via the Saral portal and only those projects, which have labour on-site, will be considered for permission. Based on the area of operation, the administration will also issue passes to the workers to allow their movement and access to their respective workplaces. The industrialists of the city, meanwhile, said that they hope to get permission by the end of the week as both Manesar and Udyog Vihar industrial estates are outside containment zones.“We are expecting that the entire process of permission to smoothen within three to four days. It would be wise to start economic activity gradually so that we can move towards normalcy,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries’ Welfare Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/to-operate-in-gurugram-industries-with-mha-go-ahead-must-seek-state-approval-through-saral-portal/story-480ngFHt78qchJlBvpj9ZP.html
20-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram to begin rapid antibody tests with 750 kits in Sohna containment zone||Gurugram will launch rapid antibody testing to detect cases of Covid-19 from Monday in Sohna containment zone. Health officials said they will be use the Rapid Testing Kits or RTAs only for those who show symptoms of influenza like illness (ILI).Gurugram so far has registered 37 Covid-19 positive cases, of which the highest number (14 cases) has been reported from Sohna. The 14 cases in Sohna includes 10 Tablighi Jamaat attendees, who are natives of Himachal Pradesh. The remaining patients are those who came in close contact with a Rajasthan-based Covid-19 caset.On Friday, the Haryana government received 10,000 RTKs from the central government. As per plan, blood tests to detect coronavirus antibodies through RTKs will be done at three Covid-19 hotspot districts – Gurugram, Nuh and Hathin in Palwal. “We have received 750 RTKs in the first phase and will be using it in the Sohna contamination zone. Our teams will be doing house to house surveillance and if any person with ILI symptom is traced, he/she will be taken to the Sohna sub-division hospital for antibody testing,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer of Gurugram. There are six contamination zone in the city — Devil Lal Colony, Sun City Sector 54, Sector 39, Fazilpur village in Jharsa, Village Raipur in Sohna and Ward no. 11 Pataudi.The medical team designated for Covid-19 cases at the Sohna health facility will be trained by three to four rapid response team members on procedures to use the kit. “By collecting blood samples, we can now analyse whether antibody to fight against coronavirus is present in the body. The presence of antibody means the person has contracted the virus. The testing process in not lengthy, it takes only 15-20 minutes to deliver results. If anybody is tested positive, then nasal and throat swabs will be taken for Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR),” said Punia.PGIMS, Rohtak, the nodal hospital for Covid-19 in Haryana, has prepared a detailed plan for the usage of RTKs after the Indian Council of Medical Research issued a letter to the states on April 4 on starting rapid antibody tests for Covid-19 in clusters with containment zones and large migration gathering or evacuees. As per the state guideline, even if a suspected case with flu-like symptom tests negative for antibody, his/her swabs will be taken for RT-PCR and the person have to isolate or quarantine themselves for 10 days. Antibody tests will not be done on those having signs of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and high risk cases. Their samples will be directly collected for RT-PCR.The state is also conducting pool testing of Covid-19 samples. As per ICMR guidelines, pool testing allows tests of at least two to five samples together. “A specimen pool comprises of samples from multiple persons. They are mixed and tested together. It saves time and cost if the entire pool is negative. If one of the individual samples is positive, then all samples are tested separately. To ensure that the samples are not diluted in pooling and there are no false negatives, we are taking only three samples in a pool,” said Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana and the head of the department for pulmonary and critical care at PGIMS, Rohtak.He said that not more than five samples can be pooled for there is a higher possibility of missing positive samples with low viral load.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-to-begin-rapid-antibody-tests-with-750-kits-in-sohna-containment-zone/story-SzHOOYOlzPcZlQvejs6X8O.html
20-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Small-scale industries may not reopen before May 3 as owners say they can’t meet guidelines||The standard operating procedures (SOP) or the Covid-19 lockdown guidelines issued by the Haryana government have put many challenges before small-scale industries. Industry owners said they are unlikely to resume operations during the lockdown as the SOPS are not friends to their methods of operations.Of the 11 lakh industrial employees in the district, about 60% are engaged in small-scale industries, which work as feeder companies for big ventures such as Maruti, Honda and others.In light of the coronavirus outbreak, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown from March 25, which he later extended till May 3. However, the PM announced relaxations in resuming economic or business activities from April 20.Industry owners had been waiting for resuming operations here but as Gurugram has been notified as a Red Zone due to the number of Covid-19 cases and several containment zones, they are rethinking options.Firstly, owners say a major challenge for industry owners is the fear of FIR lodged against them, which is a provision in the SOP.“In case an employee gets infected with Covid-19, the government will register a police complaint (FIR) against the industry owner and the infected person, and his or her dependants will be put in 14 days’ quarantine,” says the SOP.VS Kundu, chief executive engineer of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority and the Covid-19 in-charge of Gurugram, said: “Two years of imprisonment can also be awarded in case an employee gets infected with coronavirus at factory unit during lockdown period. There were many challenges before the government. Keeping all these in view, detailed guidelines have been issued so that lockdown guidelines are followed perfectly as per MHA (Ministry of Human Affairs Government of India) orders. Industries should resume only with minimum employee strength of 25-30%, as well as following other guidelines such as social distancing, sanitisation, transportation responsibility of respective employees and their movement passes, health, etc. All these will be the sole responsibility of industry owners.”Industry owners, on the other hand, say they prefer not to take risks lest their employees get Covid-19 infection.Sanjiv Bansal, a Basai-based industry owner, said, “I have told my employees to wait for May when lockdown ends. We are small scale industry owners and we cannot follow the SOP guidelines which we believe a majority of industry owners in the district will be reluctant to do.”Secondly, industry owners have been asked to upload pictures daily showing disinfection of plants, units, entry and exit gates, thermal screening of employees, social distancing guidelines being followed at their units, which owners say is not feasible.Atul Jain, a Manesar-based industry owner, said: “We cannot run our unit if our employees sit one metre apart, more so while sitting down for work. It is impractical and the nature of our operations does not allow and our product will suffer. For clicking and uploading pictures onto government portals, we will have to permanently engage at least two employees. If we engage a lesser number of employees, as per the SOP, then why would we put two out of this already reduced strength towards work that would not benefit us? I believe the SOP guidelines are not suitable for our small scale business models. Rather, they are very risky in the current scenario. I’d rather wait for the lockdown to end before restarting operations.”The third major issue, industry owners say, is the transportation of employees and products to and from Delhi.“Most of the buyers of our product are from Delhi and they cannot continue to operate during lockdown. In the Capital, the lockdown might just continue longer. The SOP does not allow any relief in this regard. We will not resume operations and wait for lifting of lockdown,” said Deepak Maini, a Sector 37-based industry owner.So far, there are six containment zones in Gurugram -- Devi Lal Colony, Sector 39; Sun City, Sector 54; Fazilpur village in Jharsa; Ward no, 11 Pataudi; Raipur village, Sohna. Till now, there have been 37 positive cases of Covid-19 from Gurugram.The SOP does not give clarity on the industries and commercial establishments qualify to apply for passes.TVSN Prasad, additional chief secretary, Industry department, Haryana, said, “Passes will be approved after scrutiny of applications by a committee as per the guidelines at local administrative level.”As per the SOP, one can apply online at Saral Haryana portal and the applications were allowed to be sent to concerned committee for scrutiny and approval from April 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-small-scale-industries-may-not-reopen-before-may-3-as-owners-say-they-can-t-meet-guidelines/story-cGW0RxxHX5wIayerPF0QjI.html
20-04-2020||Delhi||North MCD teachers on Covid duty yet to be paid for February, March||Teachers employed by the north civic body, who are currently deployed at the government’s food distribution centres in schools, are struggling to make ends meet due to non-payment of salaries since February.The teachers have been assigned this duty for the last few weeks, to help those in need due to the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19).A 37-year-old teacher, employed at a school in Budhh Vihar, cycles through deserted roads to reach the school every alternate day. He measures the ration, distributes cooked food among the poor and maintains records of the centre. He says that despite performing the assigned tasks, he is unable to even purchase groceries and shops are refusing to give items on credit. “I’m the only earning member of the family. It’s become difficult to survive without a salary. We don’t know how to make our ends meet in this lockdown. The grocery shop near our home has stopped giving us ration on credit, since we could not clear bills of February and March. I don’t know what to do,” he said.Around 8,000 teachers working in 714 north civic body schools are facing hardships due to non-payment of salaries. The teachers’ association has reached out to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in this regard as well. In a letter sent to Kejriwal and Sisodia’s office on Friday, Ramnivas Solanki, the president of teachers’ association of the municipal corporation of Delhi (MCD) schools, said, “While the teachers of east and south MCD schools have received their salaries, those working in north MCD schools are not being paid since February. However, the teachers are given the responsibility of disturbing the cooked food and ration to the poor. They are risking their lives to help people amid the lockdown. Kindly please ensure that these teachers receive their salaries.”Officials of the north civic body said that they have not received funds from the Delhi government to pay the salaries. “We are waiting for the funds to be released by the Delhi government,” said north MCD commissioner, Varsha Joshi. However, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that is not the case. “We have paid all dues. North MCD has to check where all the money is going,” he said.The teacher’s association stated that the government should issue a notice for payment of salaries to MCD teachers, on the lines of directions issued to private schools. “The government has recently asked all private schools to pay the salaries of their staff on time. Why this discrimination with the MCD teachers?” said Solanki.A senior Delhi government official said that they have received the complaint and transferred it to the authorities concerned for further action. “We are looking into the matter. The Delhi government is also in contact with the north civic body officials,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-mcd-teachers-on-covid-duty-yet-to-be-paid-for-february-march/story-k4D3Z7phpSsI4RNoycBZXJ.html
20-04-2020||City||Maharashtra govt to probe Palghar lynching; 1 more incident in Dahanu||The Maharashtra government on Sunday ordered a high-level investigation into the Palghar mob lynching incident, in which three people were killed on Thursday night, even as another man was lynched on Friday night in Dahanu by a mob of 17 in the third such incident in the area within a week.The Palghar incident, which led to an uproar on Sunday as the video went viral, occurred when three men from Kandivli in Mumbai were heading towards Gujarat’s Surat in a car to attend a funeral on Thursday night. They had taken an internal road, as all major roads are shut owing to the lockdown. Their vehicle was stopped in Palghar district. The trio – Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri, 70, Sushilgiri Maharaj, 35, and their car driver Nilesh Telgade, 30 – was dragged out of their car and beaten to death on suspicion that they were thieves. “Police have detained 101 people involved in the killing of three Surat-bound people in Palghar. I have also ordered a high level inquiry into these killings,” Deshmukh tweeted. The Maharashtra home minister also warned officials against giving any communal colour to the incident, as two of the three deceased were allegedly seers.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “The Palghar incident has been acted upon. The police have arrested all those accused who attacked the two sadhus, one driver and the police personnel on the day of the crime itself. “Nobody guilty of this heinous crime and shameful act will be spared and they will be brought to justice in the strongest way possible,” Thackeray said in a tweet. Former chief minister and leader of Opposition in Assembly, Devendra Fadnavis said: “I urge the government to immediately set up a high-level enquiry.”Elaborating on the Dahanu incident, assistant police inspector Prakash Sonwane said: “The man hails from Tamil Nadu and was walking in the area. Due to the lockdown, he did not have means to find food. He doesn’t understand Marathi. We rushed to the spot and rescued him from the mob and brought him to the police station.” The police on Sunday arrested the 17 people and produced them before a local court. The man is being treated for his injuries in a hospital.Earlier last week, four personnel of Kasa Police were injured and the SUV of a skin specialist Dr Vishwas Valvi of Thane was destroyed by a mob at Saarni village in the district.

20-04-2020||Chandigarh||His leave extension rejected, PGIMER medical superintendent expected to join active duty from today||The medical superintendent of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research has been asked to join duty after he had proceeded on a leave following the outbreak of novel coronavirus in the city in March. His application for leave extension was rejected on Sunday.A senior official of the institute, on the condition of anonymity, told the Hindustan Times that the leave application of Dr AK Gupta, medical superintendent and head of hospital administration, was accepted on April 1 keeping in view orders of the department of personnel and training (DOPT) allowing commuted leave without production of medical certificate to those officials who are above 50 years of age, and have conditions like diabetes, respiratory problems and renal disease.“The medical superintendent stopped coming to the office from March 23 and was working from home till March 31. In between he applied for medical leave from April 1 to 14, which was accepted by the administration. However, he further wanted to extend the leave which has been rejected by the administration keeping in mind the requirement of the officer who heads an important department involved in the management of the hospital and holds an administrative post,” the official said.The employees of the institute had written to the Prime Minister’s Office and the ministry of health and family welfare stating that it was unfortunate that the medical superintendent had been allowed leave at a time of national crisis under the garb of DOPT orders, and the stop gap arrangements made in his absence had miserably failed.“It is the need of the hour that office orders granting leave to medical superintendent are revoked, or alternately, a senior professor is appointed as the medical superintendent with all financial and administrative powers to effectively deal with the emergent situation,” said Ashwani Kumar Munjal, president of PGIMER employees’ union in a letter to the PMO.Director of PGIMER Dr Jagat Ram confirmed that Dr Gupta had proceeded on a leave that has not been extended and he is expected to join the duties from Monday.Dr AK Gupta, when contacted for his version, refused to comment.NEHRU EXTENSION BLOCK CONVERTED INTO COVID WARDThe UT administration has designated the Nehru Hospital Extension Block of the institute as a Covid-19 hospital where patients from Chandigarh and critical patients from the neighbouring states are admitted. At present, 13 patients from the city and seven patients from neighbouring states are under isolation and treatment at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/his-leave-extension-rejected-pgimer-medical-superintendent-expected-to-join-active-duty-from-today/story-GWNX6o4v49yv6WQvkwdfbJ.html

20-04-2020||Pune||With 1,320 CCTVs in Pune under scanner, crowd tracker, keeps city police alert; helps trace lockdown violations||The violations of the countrywide lockdown by residents of Pune has prompted the city police to undertake innovative methods to track the unlawful gatherings of people. Between March 19 and April 16, the Pune police registered 6,558 cases of violation under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). At least 23,290 vehicles were seized for violating vehicle movement prohibition orders in the same time period and 38,613 warning notices were also issued in the same period.With limited number of police personnel on ground to enforce the lockdown in a city like Pune, technology has come to the rescue. Deployed 5-6 days ago, the ‘crowd trackers’ help in identifying lockdown violations in realtime. “The Pune police have deployed a crowd tracker in their control room that has access to 1,320 close circuit television (CCTV) cameras all over the city,” according to Ashok Morale, additional commissioner of police, Crime, Pune. Without sharing details of how the cameras generate the alert, additional CP Morale said that the cameras keep track of at least 90 main spots in the city.The screen flashes red when more than five people assemble in an area, according to Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Crime, Pune.“The objective is to improve enforcement and help the people on the ground. Once the alert is generated, the message is passed on the respective police station,” said DCP Singh.The project is run in association with the Smart City programme implemented by Allied Digital Services Ltd (ADSL), according to a police official.Quoting an example, Additional CP Morale said, on a single day, a place called Gotiram chowk had flashed an alert 78 times.In addition to technical support, the Pune police is also getting help from State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and Crime Investigation Department (CID) officials wherever required. For example, 35 officials of CID and one company of SRPF are helping the officials of Kondhwa police station. Alternatively, volunteers of a private security company are helping the officials of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.As form of immediate punishment, the police have started catching violators and making them perform yoga or sit-ups or release their pictures holding banners announcing them as violators.Action under Section 188 of IPC (March 19-April 16) Sr. No.-Police station- No. of cases registered- Seized vehicles- Warning notices 1- Samarth- 223-848- 7292- Faraskhana- 139- 842-9053- Khadak-159-717-4594- Deccan-65-246-4985- Shivajinagar- 25-1,915-7496- Vishrambaug-117-768-1,3437 -Zone 1 total-728-5,336-4,683 1- Shakarnagar-496-1,145-7132- Swargate-379-1,052-1,5333- Bharati Vidyapeeth-230-3,150-8334- Bund Garden-78-955-1,5805- Lashkar-103-492-9796- Koregaon Park-61-411-6517- Zone 2 total- 1,347-7,205-6,289 1-Kothrud- 404-242-2,6052- Warje Malwadi- 421-622-2,5013- Uttamnagar- 150- 1,578-2,2904- Sinhgad road- 506-2,088- 3,6825- Dattawadi- 555-1,093-4,7636- Alankar- 219- 217- 1,9877- Zone 3 total- 2,255-5,840-17,828 1- Khadki-112- 122-9392- Vishrantiwadi- 216- 213- 1,3523- Chatuhshrungi- 281- 512- 3664- Chandannagar- 160- 125- 6835- Yerawada- 469- 0- 1,7906- Vimantal- 200- 205- 7797- Zone 4 total- 1,438- 1,177- 5,909 1- Hadapsar- 234- 665- 6392- Mundhwa- 76- 966-4973- Kondhwa- 178-895-6184- Bibvewadi- 91-553-9435- Market Yard- 62- 140- 3416- Wanowrie- 147- 513- 8667- Zone 5 total- 788-3,732-3,904 Total all- 6,558- 23,290-38,613||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-1-320-cctvs-in-pune-under-scanner-crowd-tracker-keeps-city-police-alert-helps-trace-lockdown-violations/story-k70pwOvCPqTg2DkmeClgrI.html

20-04-2020||Chandigarh||With 40.3mm rain, April 18 was wettest day of the month in Chandigarh since 1953||With 40.3mm of rain late on Saturday and in the early hours on Sunday, Chandigarh experienced its heaviest shower in a single day in April. The monthly rainfall of April at 58.6mm is also the highest since 2012, according to the weatherman. India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials also said there could be more rain in the coming week.As per IMD data, from 8:30am on April 18 to 8:30am on April 19 (period considered for tabulating 24-hour data) considered, the city received 40.3mm of rain, the highest ever in a day since the IMD started keeping records for Chandigarh in 1953. Previously, it was on April 26, 1998, that the city recorded 39mm rain, the highest in a single day.Explaining the reason behind this, IMD regional director Surender Paul termed it a freak weather occurrence which he said was becoming a more common phenomenon these days.“The unexpectedly high intensity of rain in Chandigarh can be attributed to the confluence of low level easterly winds with western disturbances. Usually easterly winds start in the region around the monsoon months, but this year they have started much earlier. Since Chandigarh is on the foothills of Himalayas, this region received the most rain. However, it is unlikely we will experience this again in this season,” he said.IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said that rain combined with thunder can be very unpredictable. “The Sector 39 IMD observatory recorded 40.3 mm rain, while in the same time period the Chandigarh airport observatory recorded only 4 mm rain. There were continuous light spells of rain due to thunder and they were concentrated in a small part of the city. Stations across the region only registered light to moderate rainfall, going only up to 20 mm.”IMD officials said there are chances light rain will continue in the city till Monday morning. After that, a brief dry spell can be expected with a rise in temperature. However, another system of western disturbances is likely to affect the region round Thursday, so the city can expect more rain in the coming week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-40-3mm-rain-april-18-was-wettest-day-of-the-month-in-chandigarh-since-1953/story-HMTBrj1cXhH5xCFv4R7e3K.html
20-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Vihar Seva group distributes 2,000 food packets daily to those in need... and in service||From day one of the lockdown (March 25) the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)-based Vihar Seva group is distributing food packets to the needy. Starting with 150 packets, the organisation now delivers 2,000 daily. These food packets are also delivered to people involved with essential services and to shelter homes. Group member Manish Sonigara, gives us a peak into the method behind the outreach. What exactly is your role in the crisis?Our job is to provide food packets to all the needy people who are unable to get food due to the lockdown. We have a team of 55 people who are working for this initiative and we have donors who provide the finance for the initiative. While distributing cooked food packets we got to know from people that they have the required facility to cook food, but don’t have food supplies. So we provide rations to such people. I coordinate with the volunteers, right from purchasing raw material to ensuring the packets reach their destination.How does your day begin and roll out?Work is distributed in three teams – a group of volunteers prepare food, a group is involved in packing and a separate group distributes the packets. We deliver food packets in two shifts. By 7 am we start cooking. At 11 am another group of volunteers collect the packets and distribute them according to requirements. Same is followed in the evening shift, but fewer packets are distributed in the evening shift. These mostly go to security personnel, police officials and some NGOs.What precautions are you taking?We are following all the guidelines suggested by the government. All the volunteers use masks, hand gloves, sanitiser and even face shields. We follow social distancing while undertaking this initiative. The volunteers involved especially in distributing food packets are extra careful and make sure they take all the necessary precautions and even maintain distance while distributing packets. After my work is done when I reach home the first time I do is take a bath and get my clothes washed. I even avoid using the lift and use the staircase to avoid touching metals and to maintain social distancing.Food packets are distributed atDehu gaon, Talwade, Chikali, Nigdi, Akurdi, Bhosari, Kasarwadi, Chinchwad station, Ravet, Dange chowk, Theragaon, Pimpri, Pimpri gaon, Kalewadi, Pimple Saudagar and WakadIf food packets needed in these areas contactManish Sonigara 9822077617Bhadresh Shah 9423569815Santosh Lunkad 9372568688||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-000-food-packets-daily-to-those-in-need-and-those-in-service/story-dXFwUkjyY1PPHMoS9cjJqK.html
20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Visitors to be thermally screened at Chandigarh’s Sector 40; Sector 30 EWS Colony sealed off||UT adviser Manoj Parida inaugurated the initiative undertaken by the Sector 40 Fighters Welfare Club to thermally screen all outsiders coming into the area, take their contact details and sanitise their vehicles, on Sunday. Local area councillor Gurbax Rawat donated masks and gloves to the adviser on the occasion. A helpline for elderly and differently-abled residents of the sector was also launched.Parida said since Chandigarh had been declared a containment zone, other neighbourhoods should also follow suit. Taking a cue from this, councillor of Sector 30, Devinder Singh Babla, reached out to the police and got the EWS Colony in Sector 30 sealed, after four positive Covid-19 cases cropped up from there recently.“After talking to the police and administration, the whole area has been sealed and is being sanitised. We will provide essentials to residents, but, they can’t leave the area. I have urged health authorities to properly screen residents and ensure the disease doesn’t spread further,” Babla said.Both areas will remain sealed till the lockdown stays in effect and volunteers will be present at entrances to ensure those without passes aren’t allowed to enter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/visitors-to-be-thermally-screened-at-chandigarh-s-sector-40-sector-30-ews-colony-sealed-off/story-4gaR6QoTCLjq7TGtDS6xoK.html

The NGO has signed an MoU with DMCH last year. “The hospital is visited by a huge number of people daily, which is why there is always a risk but I’m taking all necessary precautions like practising social distancing, wearing masks and gloves and using sanitisers,” she said. A resident of Vishwakarma Town, Chanchal is the only breadwinner of her family. While supporting her grandmother, mother and two siblings, she ensures that all children taking cancer treatment at the hospital receive proper medication and treatment even during the lockdown. “Currently, 21 children are receiving chemotherapy in the hospital. Many parents do not want to bring their children to the hospital during the curfew, so we are providing them information about medicines on their WhatsApp. For the patients from other cities, we are ensuring that their treatment is not affected in any way,” informs Chanchal. Chanchal says it is support and motivation by her seniors that make the journey easier.“This is the time of uncertainty and difficulty. The news of positive cases and deaths due to coronavirus leaves one concerned about their loved ones and working with a positive attitude gets tougher at times, but I have supportive team members,” she says while especially thanking Shruti Kakkar, assistant professor, department of pediatric, for her support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-in-the-times-of-pandemic-can-t-give-up-on-responsibilities-in-trying-times/story-bap3l1jocWIuwWFJMDCmUK.html
20-04-2020||Chandigarh||Ahead of earning season, lockdown slugs potters’ wheel into slow motion||Lali was only a teenager when she migrated from Haryana with her husband to ferry soil on their donkeys from the excavated area at the Capitol Complex in Chandigarh, where Le Corbusier designed the iconic buildings like the Punjab & Haryana high court, assembly and secretariat.Seen the ‘City Beautiful’ being built from a scratch, Lali, along with other potter families from her home state, decided to stay back and start a new life here. These potters were settled in the Kumhar Colony in Sector 25 and later 50 more were allocated land at the western corner of the city, New Kumhar Complex in Maloya, Sector 39.For the first time in the seven decades of being in Chandigarh, is Lali seeing the potter’s wheel move in slow motion and worries that the lockdown might put brakes on it ahead of their earning season — mid March to June. In this duration, potters earn enough money to for six to seven months.“Potters work mainly five-to-six months in a year – three to four months in summer and then two months around Diwali – and for the rest part, they live off the money earned during the said time. Now because of the lockdown, potters are unable to sell their products. This time, earthen pots for plants were in great demand and if the lockdown continues, no potter is going to make any money and will be forced to wait for Diwali to make a living,” says Lali, who is in her eighties and but doesn’t know her exact age. “My son Randhir makes the pots and other earthen products, and I used to sell them on a roadside.”The settlement of potters in Chandigarh is the largest in the region and apart from the Tricity, they sell their products in parts of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal. There are over 60 families, fulltime into the pottery business, residing at the New Kumhar Complex in Maloya. They mainly make earthen pots besides piggy banks and ewers (pitchers) during the summer season. Around Diwali, they make most earning by selling diyas and other small products. In the Sector 25 complex, over 50 families are in the potter business who make and diyas throughout the year.“In summer, my wife and son make products that fetch us around ₹1.25- ₹1.5 lakh in the wholesale market. Deducting raw material and other costs, we make enough to survive for six-seven months. If the lockdown is not lifted soon, we will lose our entire earning season and face unprecedented losses. The small potters might have to borrow money to make ends meet,” says Ved Prakash, 46, whose family hails from Koka Kulana in Jhajjar.“As the school dropout rate is quite high in our community, youngsters hardly get any job elsewhere and they are forced to stay in the family profession. Day-by-day the scope for pottery business is shrinking, so we can’t expect a good life from this line of work,” says Ved Prakash’s son Umesh, who left studies after Class 12 and doubles up as a part-time instructor in a small gymnasium in Maloya. “There is not much awareness about coronavirus in our area, and social distancing is not practiced much,” he reveals.The lockdown has also halted the supply of clayey soil, which is used to make earthen pots and other products. The soil (clayey) comes from Punjab.“With whatever soil stock is left with us, we are making earthen pots out of it and storing the finished products in a hope that things will be normalised very soon and we will be able to sell them in the market,” says Ishwar Singh, 48, whose father came to Chandigarh in 1952 from his native village Mangleshwar Majri in Rewari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahead-of-earning-season-lockdown-slugs-potters-wheel-into-slow-motion/story-2MaEZsa8acPUrcpqG3c5sI.html
20-04-2020||World||Israel’s Netanyahu, Gantz agree emergency unity govt||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached a historic deal Monday with one-time rival parliament speaker Benny Gantz to form an emergency unity government, ending the country’s worst-ever political crisis.The three-year agreement will allow Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving premier, to stay in office for 18 months as he stands trial over corruption charges. He denies wrongdoing. Gantz will then take over as premier for another 18 months before Israel heads to a new round of elections.Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, had squared off against Gantz in three inconclusive elections over the past year, but neither had secured enough support to form a viable governing coalition.As the COVID-19 epidemic intensified following the last election on March 2, calls mounted for them to unite and offer the country a rare period of political calm as it battles an unprecedented health crisis.“I promised the State of Israel a national emergency government that will act to save the lives and livelihoods of Israeli citizens,” Netanyahu tweeted shortly after the deal was announced. Gantz stressed that the deal had prevented “a fourth election.”“We’ll fight coronavirus and we will take care of Israeli citizens,” he tweeted. The deal reportedly includes an agreement to move towards annexation of Jewish settlements and other territory in the occupied West Bank, actions that would defy international law. Extending Israeli sovereignty over those areas had been approved in US President Donald Trump’s controversial Middle East peace plan, condemned by the Palestinians and much of the international community. Judicial appointmentsPresident Reuven Rivlin mandated Gantz to form a government following the most recent vote. But for a third time, he was unable to forge a coalition given the deep divisions within the anti-Netanyahu parliamentary bloc. But in a surprise move, the former army chief was elected speaker last month. He pledged to use that position to seek a deal with Netanyahu, saying the coronavirus pandemic and grinding political deadlock demanded tough compromises. His decision led to the break-up of his centrist Blue and White alliance. Many had speculated that Netanyahu would capitalise on Gantz’s weakened position to take Israel to a fourth election in 18 months.But Monday’s deal averted such a poll.The prime minister was indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in January and some experts had argued he would seek to win a parliamentary majority to push through legislation protecting him from prosecution. A major hold-up in the unity talks was over the appointment of senior justice officials, notably those who will oversee Netanyahu’s trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-netanyahu-gantz-agree-emergency-unity-govt/story-mcBXTQockuukupenpLahDK.html
20-04-2020||World||Trump says governors play ‘political game’ with virus tests||President Donald Trump accused Democrats on Monday of playing “a very dangerous political game” by insisting there is a shortage of tests for the coronavirus, and Vice President Mike Pence told governors the federal government is working around-the-clock to help them ramp up testing.The vice president sought to soften the Trump administration’s message with governors amid growing clamor from the states for a national testing strategy to help secure in-demand supplies like testing swabs and chemical reagents. Trump said Sunday that he could use the Defense Production Act to compel one company to manufacture swabs.“When it comes to testing, we’re here to help,” Pence told governors during a videoconference from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Associated Press obtained audio of the call.Pence said the administration sent an email to officials in each state on Monday detailing current testing capacity by state. But Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said much of the unused lab machinery listed for his state by the administration was in federal labs that the state does not have access to. Pence agreed to open up federal labs to help states.Meanwhile, Trump took to Twitter with a more combative tone, complaining that the “radical left” and “Do Nothing Democrats” were playing politics with their complaints about a lack of tests.The president in recent days has repeatedly compared governors’ concerns about a lack of screening capacity to earlier complaints that the states did not have enough ventilators to keep up with the federal government’s projections of individuals who would become hospitalized during the virus outbreak.“Now they scream ....’Testing, Testing, Testing,’ again playing a very dangerous political game,” Trump tweeted. “States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!”Public health experts say the country needs to dramatically increase its testing infrastructure if it is going to safely roll back restrictions and reopen businesses without risking a major spike in infections that would negate weeks of social distancing and economic strife.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” Monday that the country is currently running about 1.5 million to 2 million tests per week. But, “we really need to get up to, at least, you know, maybe two times that, three times that.”Administration officials have insisted that the U.S. currently has enough testing capacity to safely implement “Phase One” of a plan they released last week to begin a slow return to normalcy. And they have argued that states could be running twice as many tests as they are now if only they were using all the equipment they already have access to.“So we really gotta help them to get to it. And that’s what’s being done right now, to try to make the connectivity between what’s unused capacity as well as tests within that capacity to help them,” Fauci said. “We gotta keep going.”Separately, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced Monday that the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have agreed to extend restrictions for nonessential travel across their shared borders for an additional 30 days, one sign of a recognition by the federal government that limitations need to continue for some time.Trump on Sunday complained during his daily coronavirus task force briefing that states were unaware of equipment they already have in hand.“They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there,” he said.But governors of both partieshave been complaining for weeks now that they can’t ramp up testing without federal assistance, especially when it comes to accessing supplies.“We really need help,” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said Sunday on NBC’s ”Meet the Press.”Hogan told CNN Sunday.that testing was “probably the number one problem in America, and has been from the beginning of this crisis.”“To try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing, and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” he said. “Every governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world.”Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, another Republican, on Friday called on the federal government to take a larger role to stop states from competing against once another for supplies.“It’s a perilous set of circumstances trying to figure out how to make this work, and until we’ve got the testing up to speed — which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping — we’re just not going to be there,” he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.In recent days, protesters have taken to the streets in some states, flouting their governors’ stay-at-home orders and social distancing regulations as they demand an end to restrictions.Fauci told ABC that “if you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re gonna set yourself back. It’s gonna backfire. That’s the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-governors-play-political-game-with-virus-tests/story-OUtm6r7AB3yIqVwGpyLPqL.html
20-04-2020||World||WHO insists it sounded virus alarm from the start||The World Health Organization insisted Monday that it sounded the alarm on the novel coronavirus right from the very start and had hidden nothing from Washington about the deadly pandemic.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there were no secrets at the UN agency after facing scathing criticism from Washington, which has accused the organisation of initially downplaying the outbreak in China.“We have been warning from day one that this is a devil that everyone should fight,” Tedros told a virtual briefing in Geneva.The virus, which emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has so far infected more than 2.4 million people globally and killed more than 165,000, with nearly two thirds of the victims in Europe, according to an AFP tally.Tedros said the presence of embedded US government secondees working at the WHO headquarters in Geneva meant there was nothing being concealed from Washington.The WHO said that since January 1 there were 15 staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US national health protection agency, detailed specifically to work with the organisation on its COVID-19 response.“Having CDC staff means there is nothing hidden from the US, from day one. Because these are Americans working with us. It just comes naturally and they tell what they are doing,” said Tedros.“WHO is open. We don’t hide anything. Not only for CDC, them sending messages, or others -- we want all countries to get the same message immediately because that helps countries to prepare well and to prepare quickly.Tedros also urged leaders not to exploit the pandemic for their own political capital.“Don’t use this virus as an opportunity to fight against each other or score political points,” he said.“It’s like playing with fire. It’s the political problem that may fuel further this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-has-been-warning-from-day-one-about-virus/story-wL8mbBjJpvKA99kvspf1AM.html

I think when you look at the totality of what we are doing it is more significant in scope and scale,” he added.Germany and Switzerland have offered 100% state guarantees on some small business lending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-finance-minister-rishi-sunak-rejects-100-guarantee-for-small-business-loans/story-k3nZWuy48OIDEhpm3U5niN.html
20-04-2020||World||Italy says current virus cases fall for the first time||Italy on Monday reported its first symbolic drop in the number of people currently suffering from the novel coronavirus since it recorded its first infection in February.The civil protection service said 108,237 people were either being treated in hospital or were recovering at home after testing positive -- down 20 from the total reported on Sunday.“For the first time, we have seen a new positive development: the number of currently positive has declined,” civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli told reporters.The Mediterranean country’s death toll still rose by 454 to 24,114 -- second only to the United Sates.But most Italian doctors believe the country’s deaths and infections are far higher than those officially reported.People who died at home or in care facilities for the elderly are not included and some of the hardest-hit regions have only been testing those who appear the most visibly sick.But the decline in the number of current official cases marks an important data point in Italy’s calculation of what restrictions to lift and which to extend when the current lockdown expires on May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-says-current-virus-cases-fall-for-the-first-time/story-AxfYfZmngGvDWV7MOQaxCN.html
20-04-2020||World||Canada’s worst mass shooting leaves at least 18 dead||Canadians on Monday mourned the shocking rampage that left 18 dead in a rural community in Nova Scotia, after a gunman disguised as a police officer opened fire on people hunkered down in their homes, setting many ablaze in the deadliest mass shooting in the country’s history.Officials said the suspect, identified as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, was also among the dead in the weekend attack. Police did not provide a motive for the killings.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the gunman killed at least 18 people over a large swath of northern Nova Scotia.“The vast majority of Nova Scotians will have a direct link with one more more of victims. The entire province and country is grieving right now as we come to grips with something that is unimaginable,” Trudeau said.“The pandemic will prevent us from mourning together in person, but a vigil will be held virtually to celebrate the lives of the victims,” Trudeau said, adding it would take place Friday night through a Facebook group.Trudeau asked the media to avoid mentioning the name of the assailant or showing his picture.“Do not give this person the gift of infamy,” he said.Police began advising residents overnight Saturday in the rural town of Portapique, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Halifax, to lock their doors and stay in their basements. The town, like all of Canada, had been adhering to government advice to remain at home because of the coronavirus pandemic and most of the victims were inside their homes when the attack began.Several bodies were later found inside and outside one home on Portapique Beach Road, the street where the suspect lived, authorities said.Bodies were also found at several other locations within about a 50-kilometer (30-mile) area from the neighborhood where the shootings began late Saturday, and authorities believe the shooter may have targeted his first victims but then began attacking randomly. Several homes in the area were set on fire.At least four white forensic vans were seen Monday morning entering the neighborhood where the shootings began.Authorities said the suspected gunman wore a police uniform at one point and made his car look like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.“That fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,” Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said. He said many of the victims did not know the shooter and authorities believe he acted alone.According to his high school yearbook, Wortman long had a fascination with the Mounties.“Gabe’s future may including being an RCMP officer,” the yearbook profile said.The dead officer was identified as Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two and a 23-year veteran of the force. Another officer was wounded.Also among the dead was school teacher Lisa McCully, who worked at a local elementary school. Nova Scotia Teachers Union President President Paul Wozney said. “Our hearts are broken along with those of her colleagues and students at Debert Elementary,” he said.Two health care workers at local nursing homes were also among those killed, according to Von Canada, a long term health care company, which identified them as Heather O’Brien, a licensed practical nurse, and Kristen Beaton, a continuing care assistant.Wortman, who owned a denture practice in in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, lived part time in Portapique, according to residents of the town.Police initially said Wortman had been arrested Sunday at a gas station in Enfield, outside Halifax, but later said he had died. It was not clear how, and they did not provide further details, although one police official said that there was an exchange of gunfire between the suspect and police at one point.Cpl. Lisa Croteau, a spokeswoman with the provincial force, said police received a call about “a person with firearms” late Saturday night, and the investigation “evolved into an active shooting investigation.”Christine Mills, a resident of the area, said it had been a frightening night for the small town, with armed officers patrolling the streets. In the morning, helicopters flew overhead searching for the suspect. “It’s nerve-wracking because you don’t know if somebody has lost their mind and is going to beat in your front door,” she said.Tom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the Municipality of Colchester, said the quiet community has been shaken.“This is just an absolutely wonderful, peaceful quiet community and the idea that this could happen in our community is unbelievable,” Taggart said. He said he didn’t know Wortman well, but spoke to him a few times when he phoned about municipal issues and described knowing Wortman’s “lovely big home” on Portapique Beach Road.Wortman is listed as a denturist — a person who makes dentures — in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, according to the Denturist Society of Nova Scotia website. Atlantic Denture Clinic, the practice Wortman owned, was closed for the past month because of the coronavirus pandemic.Leather, the police superintendent, said authorities were investigating whether the attack had anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic but no link has been found thus far.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada. The country overhauled its gun-control laws after gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989. Before this weekend’s rampage, that had been the country’s worst mass killing.It is illegal to possess an unregistered handgun or any kind of rapid-fire weapon in Canada. The country also requires training, a personal risk assessment, two references, spousal notification and criminal record checks to purchase a weapon.A van attack two years ago in Toronto left 10 people dead and 16 wounded. The suspect, who drove his van on a busy Toronto sidewalk, said he carried out the attack in retribution for years of sexual rejection and ridicule by women, is awaiting trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-worst-mass-shooting-leaves-at-least-18-dead/story-6cOMTpA7wZ4dAUJQQbfUhL.html
20-04-2020||World||Merkel issues stark warning as Germany begins opening up||Chancellor Angela Merkel urged discipline in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, warning that Germany is not “out of the woods” even as the country took small steps in easing curbs imposed to slow contagion.With small shops opening on Monday for the first time in a month, Merkel said the authorities can only allow such small cautious steps each time to avoid a devastating relapse.“We must not lose sight of the fact that we stand at the beginning of the pandemic and are still a long way from being out of the woods,” she told journalists after chairing a cabinet session on the coronavirus battle.It would be a “crying shame if we were to stumble into a relapse with our eyes wide open,” she added.Merkel and regional state premiers announced the decision to reopen last week -- but were careful to cast it as a cautious first step.From florists to fashion stores, the majority of shops smaller than 800 square metres (8,600 square feet) were allowed to welcome customers again in much of Germany, in a first wave of scaling back lockdown measures introduced last month.But the government is facing increasing pressure from other sectors still facing curbs to move faster and let them get business back on track.Merkel said loosening restrictions too hastily could be counterproductive as the effects of the first steps would only be seen in two weeks.“We must remain vigilant and disciplined,” she stressed.Germany has been largely spared the worst of the coronavirus pandemic that has devastated some of its European neighbours, with deaths well below hard-hit Italy, Spain and France.It currently has 141,672 confirmed coronavirus cases and 4,404 deaths, among the lowest fatality rate in Europe due in part to widespread testing and intensive care capacity.Widespread lockdown measures were rolled out last month in line with many of its neighbours, restricting non-essential outings and closing most shops except for supermarkets and pharmacies.As its closely watched person-to-person infection rate fell below one last week -- meaning each infected person was contaminating less than one person, down from five previously -- Merkel and state leaders decided to ease the lockdown.But each of Germany’s 16 states is taking action at a slightly different pace.In eastern Saxony state, pupils taking final examinations began streaming back to classrooms, two weeks ahead of their peers in other states, where school gates will reopen only from May 4.Masks have however been required on public transport and in shops in the eastern state.In the Saxon city of Leipzig, people waiting to get on trams and buses had their faces covered.Though not yet obligatory, the government “strongly advises” wearing a mask in public.Bavaria on Monday said that it was joining Saxony in requiring face coverings.Manuela Fischer, opening up her clothing store in Leipzig, said she was “incredibly happy” to be welcoming shoppers again.In some states such as the capital Berlin, meanwhile, it will be a few more days before shops reopen.Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn declared the virus “under control” last week after the infection rate stabilised.Yet Merkel, who was herself quarantined for two weeks this month before testing negative for the virus, has repeatedly warned that Germany’s success remains “fragile”.Some of her conservative party colleagues echoed her caution.In an interview with Der Spiegel weekly, state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet warned that some coronavirus restrictions could last until 2021.Cultural venues, bars, leisure centres and beauty salons will remain closed for the time being, and large-scale public events such as concerts and football matches have been banned until August 31.With larger shops unable to open, the German Trade Association warned Friday of a possible “distortion of competition”.Germany hopes to combine the lifting of restrictions with even more efficient tracing of the COVID-19 outbreak and the rollout of protective gear.The country of 82 million plans to ramp up testing -- it has already tested around two million people -- and aims to produce around 50 million protective masks per week from August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-issues-stark-warning-as-germany-begins-opening-up/story-msxR4VYpawIg2qLZNtCgkN.html

20-04-2020||World||Donald Trump eyes probe on Covid-19 outbreak origin in China, wants to send a team||President Donald Trump on Sunday said he has wanted to send a team to China to investigate the start of the coronavirus outbreak that had killed more that 40,000 Americans till Monday and shut down the country with increasingly unpopular stay-at-home orders, but without any success yet.“We’re talking to China. We spoke to them a long time ago about going in. We want to go in; we want to see what’s going on,” President Trump told reporters at the daily briefing by the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak. “And we weren’t exactly invited, I can tell you that.”Trump has escalated calls in recent days for increased scrutiny of China’s version of the start of the outbreak — from a wet market in Wuhan, as China has claimed and maintained — to the true magnitude of its outbreak, which is suspected to be grossly under-reported.There are news reports in US media that the outbreak may have started at a virology lab in Wuhan. There has been no official confirmation of it, or denial. Fox News has reported that US intelligence is investigating this version of the origin of the outbreak and is to give the president a report shortly.US toll of coronavirus fatalities went up by 1,997 to 40,683 Monday morning and the number of confirmed infections by 26,889 to 759,786. New York state accounted for nearly half the deaths as the continuing epicenter of the American outbreak with 18,298; 14,451 in New York city alone.But hospitalization numbers have dropped in the state and other hotspots like New Jersey, Michigan, Louisiana and Illinois have shown signs of improvements which has given authorities the confidence to start reopening the country, and lifting stay-at-home orders, that are being protested across the country.Stay-at-home protests took place Sunday in Florida, Colorado, Illinois, Tennessee and Washington, following up similar protest in Maryland, New York, Michigan, California, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah and Virginia. They are demanding the removal of restrictions.Trump has backed them and there is a growing consensus around reopening the country. Most states agree, but insist they must be careful otherwise there could be a resurgence of cases.State governors have sought more testing kits for an enhanced surveillance system before they begin easing restrictions and have sought federal government’s help, triggering a clash with the president, who have maintained it’s for states to ensure they have enough testing kits, and has called for governors to do their bit.“To say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland and chair of the governor’s association, said to CNN Sunday. Trump has not backed out of the ongoing confrontation, but has said he will help them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-eyes-probe-on-covid-19-outbreak-origin-in-china-wants-to-send-a-team/story-bYKuj3OZjiBfYQNizGfdlL.html
20-04-2020||World||UK PM Johnson resists easing lockdown on second wave fears||Boris Johnson is resisting pressure to ease the UK’s coronavirus lockdown too soon, fearing a second wave of the pandemic could hit the country, a person familiar with the matter said.The prime minister, who is yet to return to work after being struck by the virus himself, spoke with colleagues including his deputy, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, late on Friday to express caution, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private.The government is facing calls to lift restrictions on movement that have brought the UK economy to a near halt and triggered a surge in furloughs and welfare applications. On April 16 Raab extended the lockdown for three weeks amid signs the outbreak is near or at its peak, but there is now an open debate in government about how and when to ease.“The big concern is a second peak,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack said on a call with reporters on Monday. “If you move too quickly, the virus could begin to spread exponentially again.”Slack said Johnson is focusing on his recovery at Chequers, his country residence, and while he is receiving daily updates, he is not doing government work.The government is also under increasing pressure to explain elements of its response, including delays in getting vital equipment and on testing health workers and others for the virus. On Sunday, the government issued a furious defense of Johnson’s handling of the crisis.Furious RebuttalAfter a report in the Financial Times criticizing the procurement of ventilators and a Sunday Times story which suggested Johnson failed to take the virus seriously in its early stages, the government published two separate rebuttals, one 2,900 words long and the other 2,100 words long.“This article contains a series of falsehoods and errors and actively misrepresents the enormous amount of work which was going on in government,” the response to the Sunday Times began. It went on to question several of the assertions in the piece.Since Johnson declared at the end of February that the virus was the government’s top priority, ministers have struggled to deliver on their own targets, with shortages of tests and protective equipment for health workers. By Sunday afternoon, 16,060 people with coronavirus had died in hospitals. The numbers who have died elsewhere, particularly in care homes, are still being counted.UK Reports 5,850 New Coronavirus Cases, 596 DeathsSome parts of the government’s response are still coming. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will on Monday launch a 1.25 billion-pound ($1.56 billion) support package for companies focused on research. It’s made up of a 500 million-pound loan fund for high-growth companies, where the government will match private investments with loans that convert to equity if they’re not repaid, and 750 million pounds of grants and loans for smaller firms.Five TestsMonday will also mark the moment companies can apply for support paying their staff through the Treasury’s furlough plan. The Resolution Foundation think tank estimated the plan would cover 8 million people. It said it expected almost half of workers in the hospitality and retail sectors will be furloughed.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, one of those leading the response while Johnson recovers from his Covid-19 infection, said the government will continue to refer to the five tests set out by Raab on April 16 before deciding to lift restrictions. There are signs that the number of deaths is leveling off, but officials say it’s too early to call the peak of the virus.Sunday saw newspaper reports that the government had drawn up a three-stage plan for ending the lockdown that could see schools reopen as soon as May 11. “That is not true, we have not made that decision,” Gove told the BBC.But Gove confirmed the idea of a staged easing of the lockdown when it does come, saying the hospitality industry would be “among the last” to exit. He said that a contact-tracing phone app, which would help Britain resume public life by enabling the government to see who people with the virus might have passed it to, was in beta testing.Too EarlyEngland’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said it was too early to say whether the UK had responded well or badly to the virus compared to other countries, because the final totals of deaths weren’t yet known.She also hinted at frustration with the discussions about personal protective equipment (PPE), calling for a “more adult and more detailed conversation” about the issue. She said there had been unprecedented demand and that supply had nevertheless been maintained.On Monday, Slack said 12 million items of PPE had been delivered yesterday, bringing the total to date to 1 billion items. The government has also put the Royal Air Force on standby to speed up a shipment of supplies from Turkey which has been delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-resists-easing-lockdown-on-second-wave-fears/story-CUyFXYkpGXgR4o1sHGCtQL.html
20-04-2020||World||New York mayor says lack of coronavirus testing may delay city reopening||April 20 (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday that it could take weeks if not months before the country’s most populous city reopens due to a lack of widespread testing, even as officials elsewhere began rolling back restrictions on daily life.De Blasio, whose city is at the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the United States, said New York needed to be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day and to see hospitalizations decline further before reopening the economy.“We could get there but we can’t do it without widespread testing and so far the federal government still can’t get their handle on that,” de Blasio said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” adding that ending social distancing too soon could rekindle the virus.“The federal government, especially, needs to get the memo that this thing ain’t over and if you pretend it’s over it is only going to boomerang back and make it worse.”De Blasio’s warning on testing echoed comments by several governors over the weekend disputing President Donald Trump’s claims that they have enough tests for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The United States has by far the world’s largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 750,000 infections and over 40,500 deaths, nearly half of them in the state of New York, according to a Reuters tally.Trump’s guidelines to reopen the economy recommend a state record 14 days of declining case numbers before gradually lifting restrictions. Yet the Republican president appeared to encourage protesters who want to reopen sooner with a series of Twitter posts on Friday calling for them to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, all run by Democratic governors.An estimated 2,500 people rallied at the Washington state capitol in Olympia to protest Democratic Governor Jay Inslee’s stay-at-home order, one of several protests.Residents in Florida were allowed to return to some beaches after Governor Ron DeSantis approved the relaxing of some restrictions.Charlie Latham, mayor of Jacksonville Beach, said the first weekend the beach there was reopened with limited hours went well, with no arrests for people violating social distancing rules, which included a prohibition of chairs or blankets.“We thought that the public was ready to maintain the social distancing standards and to exercise good judgment. And it’s paid off, it’s paid off really well,” Latham told Fox News. (reporting by Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut and Doina Chiacu in Washington D.C.

20-04-2020||World||Fauci tells protesters no recovery if virus not ‘under control’||Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert on the White House coronavirus task force, pushed back against protesters demonstrating against stay-at-home orders, saying the U.S. economy won’t recover until the virus is “under control.”Fauci said his message to the protesters is that “this is something that is hurting from the standpoint of economics” but that re-opening too soon could cause even more harm. His comments on ABC’s “Good Morning America” contrasted with remarks made by President Donald Trump, who has encouraged the protests.”Unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery economically is not going to happen,” Fauci said. “So what you do if you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re going to set yourself back.”Fauci acknowledged it can be “painful” to carefully follow federal guidelines recommending a phased re-opening, but failing to do so is “going to backfire.”Protests have erupted in Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and other states demanding that governors lift strict social distancing policies that have battered the U.S. economy. Some demonstrators have called for Fauci’s firing.Trump has encouraged the protests, tweeting that protesters should “liberate” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia. The president said Sunday he watched footage of the crowded protests, called them “orderly” and said people “were all six feet apart.”“Some have gone too far, some governors have gone too far,” Trump said when asked about his advice to the protesters. “Some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-tells-protesters-no-recovery-if-virus-not-under-control/story-Al5EDSFRUR2Sz90E1mRvpI.html
20-04-2020||World||White House to hold call with governors on testing supplies||After insisting it was up to governors to ramp up coronavirus testing in their states, the Trump administration is finally acknowledging their pleas for help.Vice President Mike Pence will lead a teleconference with the nation’s governors Monday morning from FEMA headquarters in response to calls for a national testing strategy to help secure in-demand supplies like testing swabs and chemical reagents — a day after Trump announced that he would be using the Defense Production Act to compel one company to manufacture swabs.Pence will “review what more they can do and do together to develop locally tailored testing strategies,” Trump said at a White House news conference Sunday. “We want to help them out.”Officials and health experts say the country needs to dramatically scale its testing infrastructure if it is going to safely roll back restrictions and reopen businesses without risking a major spike in infections that would negate weeks of social distancing and economic strife.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” Monday morning that the nation is currently running about 1.5 to 2 million tests per week. But, “we really need to get up to, at least, you know, maybe two times that, three times that.”Administration officials have insisted that the U.S. currently has enough testing capacity to safely implement “Phase One” of a plan they released last week to begin a slow return to normalcy. And they have argued that states could be running twice as many tests as they are now if only they were using all the equipment they already have access to.“So we really gotta help them to get to it. And that’s what’s being done right now, to try to make the connectivity between what’s unused capacity as well as tests within that capacity to help them,” Fauci said. “We gotta keep going. It’s gotta be done together really in a partnership.”Trump on Sunday said the White House would be sending sending governors a list of the large laboratory machines in their state before the call.“They have a lot of machinery in the states that some aren’t that aware of, but they’re there,” he said.But governors on both sides of the aisle have been complaining for weeks now that they can’t ramp up testing without federal assistance, especially when it comes to accessing supplies.“We really need help,” Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said Sunday on NBC’s ”Meet the Press.”Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN Sunday.that testing was “probably the number one problem in America, and has been from the beginning of this crisis.”“To try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing, and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren’t doing our job, is just absolutely false,” he said. “Every governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world.”Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, another Republican, on Friday called on the federal government to take a larger role to stop states from competing against once another for supplies.“It’s a perilous set of circumstances trying to figure out how to make this work, and until we’ve got the testing up to speed — which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping — we’re just not going to be there,” he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.In recent days, however, protesters have taken to the streets in some states, flouting their governors’ stay-at-home orders and social distancing regulations as they demand an end to restrictions.Fauci told ABC that, “clearly this is something that is hurting from the standpoint of economics,” but warned that, “unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery economically is not gonna happen.”“So what you do if you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you’re gonna set yourself back,” he said. “It’s gonna backfire. That’s the problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-to-hold-call-with-governors-on-testing-supplies/story-kxUjVp40tKcDXrYngWAS1J.html
20-04-2020||World||‘The more transparent China is on Covid-19, ‘the better for all’: Merkel||German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday urged China to be as transparent as possible about the coronavirus outbreak, as Beijing faces mounting pressure over its management of the crisis. Critics have accused China of downplaying the scale and scope of the outbreak when it first emerged late last year, while conspiracy theories have swirled in the US the virus could have been leaked from a lab. Merkel urged for more information about the early days of the outbreak, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. “I believe the more transparent China is about the origin story of the virus, the better it is for everyone in the world in order to learn from it,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin Monday.Chinese scientists say the virus was likely first transmitted to humans at a wet market where wild animals were sold. Unproven theories that the virus came from a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan have been raised by US officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who has said an investigation was under way into how the virus “got out into the world”.The Wuhan Institute of Virology has strongly rejected claims it could be the source of the outbreak, calling it “impossible”.Chinese authorities have been accused of initially downplaying the outbreak and last week authorities in Wuhan admitted mistakes in counting their death toll and revised the figure up by 50 percent.French President Emmanuel Macron last week told the Financial Times it would be “naive” to think China had handled the pandemic well, adding: “There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.”In Britain, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said China will face “hard questions” about the coronavirus outbreak, namely “how it came about and how it couldn’t have been stopped earlier”. Australia meanwhile has called for an independent investigation into the global response to the pandemic, including the World Health Organization’s handling of the crisis.Its foreign minister has said the country would “insist” on a review that would probe, in part, China’s response to the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-more-transparent-china-is-on-covid-19-the-better-for-all-merkel/story-aAaB3S5HY04pJDkQ4qc0FJ.html
20-04-2020||World||Russia quarantines thousands of troops after calling off Red Square parade||Russia’s ministry of defence said on Monday it had ordered thousands of troops into a two-week quarantine after a vast Red Square military parade in Moscow they had been rehearsing for was called off because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.Up to 15,000 troops were due to parade alongside military hardware on May 9 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s World War Two victory, an event the Kremlin hoped would showcase Russia’s military and diplomatic clout.But a sombre President Vladimir Putin was forced to push back the commemorations last week to a later, unspecified date.Putin said the Victory Day events, including the parade he personally oversees from a raised stand every year, were “sacred” to Russians, but that the coronavirus outbreak in Russia meant the event was too risky to hold.TV footage of rehearsals showed thousands of troops marching in lockstep next to one another at a training ground outside Moscow earlier this month. There was no evidence of social distancing and none of them were shown wearing masks.All of the soldiers who took part in the rehearsals in Moscow would be sent back to their permanent garrisons across the country where they would be isolated for a fortnight, the defence ministry’s Zvezda TV channel said on Monday.The ministry did not say if the quarantine was anything more than a precaution and whether any of its soldiers had fallen ill or been put under observation, but that all military vehicles, trains and aircraft used to rebase them would be disinfected.The soldiers had been issued personal protective equipment to be rebased, it said.Russian media reports suggest the virus has in fact spread among those who took part in rehearsals.The head of St Petersburg’s Nakhimov cadet school, who had been rehearsing for the parade, told the Fontanka media outlet on April 16 that he was in hospital with a fever and had been tested for the coronavirus, though his results had not yet come back.Confirmed infections in Russia have risen rapidly this month, despite authorities imposing lockdown restrictions in Moscow and elsewhere.Russia’s Kommersant newspaper last week reported that, as of the end of March, three people in the military had caught the coronavirus and at least 133 people been put under observation.Later that day, the defence ministry said the coronavirus situation was stable and entirely controllable, the RIA news agency reported. On Thursday, however, the ministry said 14 servicemen and a civilian had been diagnosed with the coronavirus at a cadet school in the Siberian region of Tyumen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-quarantines-thousands-of-troops-after-calling-off-red-square-parade/story-usPFaXlT0cP8RdkokgrgdI.html
20-04-2020||World||Brazil President Bolsonaro mixes with crowds again in push to reopen economy||President Jair Bolsonaro escalated his campaign for the reopening of the Brazilian economy after he attended a protest against restrictive measures imposed by state governors to slow the coronavirus’ spread.The Brasilia demonstration on Sunday, similar to others that took place in several Brazilian cities the same day, was organized by his more radical supporters -- some of whom demanded a military intervention in Congress and the Supreme Court, institutions that have mostly sided with the governors.“We don’t want to negotiate anything,” Bolsonaro said in an improvised speech delivered from a flatbed truck, according to videos posted on social media. “We want action for Brazil.”He had previously shared on Twitter a newspaper report about the growing number of Brazilians unable to pay their bills, saying it’s not difficult to guess what comes next if lockdown measures remain in place.The far-right president, worried about the impact of a looming recession in Latin America’s largest economy, has defied medical guidance on social distancing, repeatedly mingling with the population and greeting supporters. He has urged Brazilians to resume work even as deaths from Covid-19, which he has called “just a little flu,” near 2,500. Last week, he fired his health minister after repeatedly clashing with him over the handling of the pandemic.AuthoritarianismWhen leaving his official residence early on Monday, Bolsonaro said that he hopes this is the last week of lockdowns. Meanwhile, health officials say Brazil is probably still weeks away from the peak in Covid-19 cases. The state of Sao Paulo, the epicenter of infections in Brazil, has extended quarantine orders until May 10.Bolsonaro also said Brazil is a democracy, and that he respects the constitution as well as bodies such as Congress and the Supreme Court. “My role is to preserve the people’s liberty without chaos,” he said.Still, his attendance in a demonstration where participants called for the shutdown of democratic institutions caused outrage among political leaders and members of the top court.“The whole world is united against the coronavirus,” Lower House Speaker Rodrigo Maia, one of the main targets of Bolsonaro and his supporters, said in a Twitter post. “In Brazil, we have to fight against the coronavirus and the virus of authoritarianism. It’s a lot of work, but we’ll win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-bolsonaro-mixes-with-crowds-again-in-push-to-reopen-economy/story-GATn7zMC3jeskcy0GfYQxI.html
20-04-2020||World||Coronavirus sent influenza into hiding, but at a cost||At least one victim of the coronavirus pandemic will not be mourned.Influenza, which each year kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, all but vanished in Europe last month as coronavirus lockdowns slowed transmission, according to EU data and scientists.The northern hemisphere’s winter flu outbreak normally runs from October until mid-May and in some seasons has claimed lives on the scale of Covid-19, despite the existence of a vaccine.Influenza killed 152,000 people in Europe in the 2017-18 winter. So far, Covid-19 has taken nearly 100,000 lives across the continent, albeit in a shorter period of time.“The flu season ended earlier than usual this year and this is probably due to the measures taken regarding SARS-CoV-2, such as social distancing and mask wearing,” Holger Rabenau, virologist at the Frankfurt University Hospital, told Reuters, using the scientific name of the new coronavirus.Although that is welcome, the dearth of cases could slow progress towards a vaccine for next season’s flu.Laboratories have been overwhelmed with Covid-19 and have had fewer flu samples at their disposal, meaning they “may not have the full picture of the virus circulating in the last part of the season,” said Pasi Penttinen, a senior flu expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).Fewer data and delays in processing information could affect the quality of the vaccine for the 2021 winter season in the southern hemisphere, whose composition is usually decided in September based on samples collected at the start of the year.“It might be a problem,” Penttinen told Reuters, as less information on the possible mutations of this year’s virus lowers the chances of assembling the most effective jab against strains expected to be prevalent the following year.The problem is unlikely to affect next winter’s vaccine for the northern hemisphere because its composition was agreed in February, Penttinen said.Decisions over the composition of vaccines are taken early because it takes several months to manufacture the millions of flu jabs needed every year.UNDER-REPORTING?Data on flu-related fatalities are not yet available but early estimates point to much lower mortality this year.Only 4,000 flu patients needed intensive care treatment this season, according to data from 11 European countries, around half the number in the same period of the previous two seasons.Denmark, which went into strict lockdown in early March, saw only a fraction of its usual death toll of around 1,000 people from flu this winter, said Lasse Vestergaard, an infectious diseases expert at Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut.Denmark had 355 Covid-19 deaths as of April 20, according to a Reuters tally.Even without the arrival of coronavirus, this flu season had been mild, with the peak of detected infections reached at the end of January and a steep drop in cases thereafter, according to EU data and experts. By the end of March, after lockdown measures had been in place for a few weeks across Europe, reported influenza outbreaks had all but disappeared.Seasonal flu activity was also lower this season in Japan, possibly due to coronavirus measures such as wearing masks or washing hands more frequently, according to a study published this month by experts at the University of Tokyo and the Japanese centre for disease control.While lockdowns appear to have hampered the transmission of flu, it is unclear whether under-reporting may have also contributed to its apparent early demise. People with milder flu symptoms have mostly steered clear of hospitals during the Covid-19 epidemic, experts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-sent-influenza-into-hiding-but-at-a-cost/story-wBt3EgBRQthD6oCJ8uRBUP.html
20-04-2020||World||China rejects Australia’s call for probe into virus response||China on Monday rejected Australia’s call for a probe examining the global response to the coronavirus pandemic -- including Beijing’s early handling of the outbreak.Washington and several allies have accused China of failing to adequately respond to the viral disease threat in the weeks after it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. US President Donald Trump also cut funding to the World Health Organization after accusing it of mismanaging the crisis and covering up the seriousness of the initial outbreak before it spread around the world and killed more than 165,000 people. But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations disrespected “the Chinese people’s tremendous efforts and sacrifices” in fighting the contagion. “Any question about China’s transparency in the prevention and control of epidemic situation is not in line with facts,” Geng told a regular press briefing.He was speaking in response to a question about Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, who a day earlier said her country would “insist” on the probe into the response by Beijing and the WHO. Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online in December.There were also questions about China’s recording of COVID-19 infections, as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the outbreak.Chinese scientists have rejected conspiracy theories pushed by some in the US government claiming the virus could have originated at a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan. But Trump has suggested that China could have been “knowingly responsible” for spreading the infection and could face consequences as a result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rejects-australia-s-call-for-probe-into-virus-response/story-qs4liSWr8USNdxRfhpczlO.html
20-04-2020||World||China’s only Covid-19 high-risk zone is Beijing’s central district||Beijing’s Chaoyang district which houses several embassies and the swanky central business district with malls and skyscrapers is now the only “high risk” Covid-19 zone in the country after a case of cluster infection was discovered last week.Two other medium risk zones in China are two districts in the southern province of Guangzhou and the town of Suifenhe located near the Russian border in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.In all the remaining 2587 districts and counties in China, the risk level has been downgraded to low including in Wuhan, the capital of hard-hit Hubei province and the first epicentre of the pandemic.An area is classified as a high-risk zone when it has more than 50 cumulative confirmed cases and a cluster of outbreaks within 14 days.According to this standard, an imported case confirmed in Chaoyang district on April 14 caused three more infections in the family and became a cluster outbreak.According to 2019 population data, more than 3.47 million people live in the district.Chinese health authority said Monday that it received reports of 12 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland Sunday, of which eight were imported.The other four new cases were domestically transmitted, the national health commission (NHC) said in a daily report.Overall, China has reported 4632 deaths and 82747 confirmed cases.The entire number of imported COVID19 cases is on the decline in China, but the risk of imported cases from land borders gradually increased, causing emergence of local cases linked to such imported ones, which in turn led to cluster epidemic, an NHC official was quoted as saying by the state media.Health authorities in Beijing has identified eight groups that must take nucleic acid tests for Covid-19, including confirmed cases and their close contacts, visitors to fever clinics, patients planning to be hospitalised and inbound travelers from overseas or other regions in China, the city government said on Sunday.The tabloid Global Times reported that the move to designate Chaoyang as a “high-risk zone triggered heavy concern on social media platforms amid viral reports on Monday.“Chaoyang residents expressed worry over the epidemic situation in the district and how the ranking would affect their lives, wondering if they would be asked to undergo a 14-day quarantine if they leave the district,” the report said.Meanwhile, Beijing has reopened 73 major tourist sites, or 30.7 percent of the total in the municipality.It includes parts of the Great Wall of China that could be accessed from the city.“All of them are outdoor landscape resorts as required by the Beijing municipal bureau of culture and tourism in a plan for the reopening of tourist sites. The reopening time of indoor sites is yet to be announced,” official news agency Xinhua reported.The tourist sites that resume operation should receive no more than 30 percent of the maximum real-time number of visitors, and no more than 30 percent of the daily visitor capacity, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chaoyang-china-s-only-covid-19-high-risk-zone-is-beijing-s-central-district/story-mET9FmWxeKzeqcTym01NHP.html
20-04-2020||World||Crops rot as Italian farmers hit by coronavirus, drought||Floriana Fanizza gazes desolately at her celery crop, lost to the coronavirus because it could not be harvested.Italian farmers are being brought to their knees by a six-week lockdown aimed at stopping a deadly epidemic in its tracks. They are also suffering a drought caused by the driest spring in more than half a century.Border blocks, restaurant closures and a lack of seasonal workers mean nearly four out of 10 businesses in the fruit and vegetable sector are struggling, according to Italy’s biggest agricultural union Coldiretti.On the Fanizza family farm in Fasano, a town near the Puglia coast in southern Italy, some pickers, fearful for their health, stayed at home as the country went into shutdown at the start of March.That meant there were not enough hands to harvest the celery and turnip crops, which were ruined. The clock is now ticking on seeding vegetables for harvesting this summer.“To sow properly, we need seven or eight people,” 41-year-old Fanizza says.“We hope we’ll be able to find them, otherwise we will have to reduce production.” Some 350,000 foreigners are usually employed seasonally in Italy’s agriculture sector.The coronavirus crisis means this year there is a shortage of between 250,000 and 270,000, according to the farming ministry.Urgent action needed “Something must be done urgently, as the harvests of strawberries, asparagus, artichokes and greenhouse fruits (such as melons, tomatoes and peppers) are already underway,” Coldiretti said in a note.And others will soon begin, such as cherries, apricots and plums, it said.The production crisis could impact food availability.Italy’s agricultural sector is the third biggest in Europe in terms of overall value -- it was worth 56.6 billion euros ($61.5 billion) in 2019 -- after France (75.4 billion euros) and Germany (57 billion euros).With Romanians alone accounting for 110,000 of the country’s 350,000 foreign seasonal workers, Rome is in talks with Bucharest over “green corridors” to ease movement between the two countries.Minister of Agriculture Teresa Bellanova has also called for mass regularisation of undocumented migrants in Italy in order to get the economy moving again.Many are currently living in shanty towns and are exploited by the mafia and an illegal labour system known as “caporalato”, where intermediaries who bring workers to farmers take a large part of their meagre wages.The proposal, approved by Coldiretti, was slammed by the far-right. Driest spring in 60 yearsThe virus is not the farmers’ only problem. Italy is also experiencing its driest spring in the last 60 years.It has seen just over half its usual rainfall since the beginning of the year, creating a water shortage the size of Lake Como -- the third largest lake in Italy, according to weather experts.“It hasn’t rained for a long time and the land is arid, especially for wheat,” farmer Fanizza says. “The situation is critical, we need to irrigate our fields”.The government has set up a 100 million euro fund to support agricultural businesses.Rome has also forked over 50 million euros to buy food and distribute it to Italy’s poorest, a three-pronged approach aimed at helping the hungry, cutting waste and preventing price drops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crops-rot-as-italian-farmers-hit-by-coronavirus-drought/story-WQzZ9FDTBf8tBWrfg30AlO.html

The hospital was closed several days ago after the first COVID-19 case was confirmed, he said.Regarding the lack of testing kits in Kabul and other provinces, Mayar said: “We will receive 5,000 kits today from the UN,” adding that “more will be bought to solve the problem.”The number of deaths from the COVID-19 disease globally is more than 165,238, and more than 2.4 million have been infected with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-s-covid-19-cases-climb-to-1-026/story-4POvbrSGYZ90GTroVj1vFI.html
20-04-2020||World||Iran opens up as economic woes trump coronavirus infection fears||Iran on Monday began opening intercity highways and major shopping centers to stimulate its sanctions-choked economy, gambling that it has brought under control its coronavirus outbreak — one of the worst in the world — even as some fear it could lead to a second wave of infections.Stores from high-end malls to the meandering alleyways of Tehran’s historic Grand Bazaar opened their doors, though the government limited their working hours until 6 p.m. Restaurants, gyms and other locations remain closed, however.There are still lingering questions over Iran’s outbreak and the safety of those returning to work. Taxi drivers partitioned their seats from the customers with plastic shields and wore masks, having seen colleagues sickened and killed by the virus and the COVID-19 illness it causes.“We, the taxi drivers, are at the highest risk than anybody else because we are constantly in touch with people,” cab driver Nemat Hassanzadeh said. “Despite that, we have no choice but to work because we cannot afford to sleep at home and not to work with these high prices. ... I am a tenant and need the money to pay the monthly rent and also pay off my car loan.”Iran’s outbreak has killed over 5,000 people in over 80,000 reported cases, though even Iran’s parliament suggests the death toll is nearly double that and overall cases remain vastly underreported. Deaths and new cases continue to be reported.Iran downplayed the crisis for weeks, even as top officials found themselves sick with the virus. The country’s civilian government, led by President Hassan Rouhani, has declined to implement the 24-hour lockdowns seen in other Mideast nations.Authorities have defended their response by pointing to the harsh economic impact such a lockdown would have. Iran already struggles under severe U.S. sanctions blocking the sale of its crude oil abroad, measures imposed after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. That has led to a monthslong period of increasing tensions between the nations — tensions that have persisted through the pandemic.The state-owned polling center ISPA found the virus has hurt the income of 50% of those surveyed, with 42% saying their businesses closed as a result. Of those polled this month, 13.5% said the outbreak left them jobless. The survey interviewed 1,563 people and offered no margin of error.Iran’s economy suffered from over 20% unemployment among its youth and over 40% inflation even before the outbreak.“I only pick passengers with masks. I cannot put my health at risk,” said Ali Qomi, who uses his personal car as a gypsy cab, like many other unemployed Iranians. “We poor people have no way except working to afford the increasing prices of our daily needs.”That need has put drivers at risk. In Tehran, taxi officials say over a dozen cab drivers died from the virus and more than 300 contracted it. But distancing and government decisions have seen more people drive themselves, taking away from the cabbies’ possible fares. Meanwhile, some worry the plastic guard shield they put up may not be enough protection.“I don’t think it will be really that effective but its presence is better than its absence,” said lawyer Mahsa Leilidoost, a recent taxi passenger.Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak in Tehran, warned that re-opening of businesses may spread the infection, Iranian media reported.“The significant point is that more commuting, especially through public transportation, adds to the possibility of contracting” the virus, he said.Mosques and shrines remain closed after earlier being suspected of being a transmission source for the virus. That’s even as the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan is due to begin later this week, based on the sighting of the crescent moon.Rouhani said some sites will likely open May 4, around 10 days into the fasting month. But Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, has already suggested that mass gatherings may be barred throughout Ramadan over the virus.In Saudi Arabia, home to the holiest sites in Islam and ruled by the Sunni Al Saud family, a top council of clerics has called on people in the kingdom to pray at home throughout Ramadan. The council advised Muslims to conduct nightly prayers at home “in order to preserve the lives of people and grow closer to the Almighty God.”Already in Sudan, mosques in the capital, Khartoum, are closed as part of a three-week lockdown over the virus that will extend into Ramadan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-opens-up-as-economic-woes-trump-coronavirus-infection-fears/story-EHPDtCsenmIvpau9evgqHI.html
20-04-2020||World||40,000 and counting: Covid-19 death toll in US tops global numbers||The death toll from the coronavirus disease Covid-19 rose to more than 40,000 in the United States on Sunday, the highest in the world and almost double the number of deaths in the next hardest-hit country Italy.It took the United States 38 days after recording its first fatality on February 29 to reach 10,000 deaths on April 6, but only five more days to reach 20,000 dead, according to news agency Reuters.The United States’ toll increased to 40,000 from 30,000 in four days after including untested but probable Covid-19 deaths reported by New York City. The US toll exceeds that of Italy, which has the second-highest number of deaths at 23,660, according to Johns Hopkins.The United States has by far the world’s largest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, with more than 7,50,000 infections - a number that has doubled in 13 days. New cases on Saturday rose by nearly 29,000.New York has borne the brunt of the virus, which has killed more than 18,000 people in the state, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.The tracker also shows total US caseload of 7,42,442 - nearly four times that of Spain, which has almost 1,96,000 cases.However, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that the outbreak is “on the descent”, adding “it’s no time to get cocky and it’s no time to get arrogant.”The first sign of easing emerged in Europe as Italy, Spain and France reported the smallest increases in fatalities in week. Germany is letting smaller stores, car dealerships, bike shops and bookstores reopen Monday. Still, social restrictions imposed to curb the virus must be eased in phases and don’t spell the end of the epidemic, World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/40-000-and-counting-covid-19-death-toll-in-us-tops-global-numbers/story-Pew4WM7i62LwMOQLRSkmcO.html
20-04-2020||World||UK high court judgement on Mallya extradition appeal today||The high court of England and Wales is due to deliver its judgement on Monday on controversial businessman Vijay Mallya’s appeal against his extradition to India to face charges financial offences worth around Rs 9000 crores.The judgement by Justice Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing will be handed down at 10.30 am UK time by email. The ruling marks an advanced stage in the extradition case that began with Mallya’s arrest in 2017 and hearings in the magistrates court and the high court.Mallya’s appeal was heard over three days in February, when lawyers on both sides sparred over details of the case. The Crown Prosecution Service representing India accused his Kingfisher Airlines of “absolute and outrageous lies” while seeking bank loans, and Mallya’s lawyer alleging “a series of errors” in India’s case.According to Mark Summers of CPS, Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines submitted “absolute and outrageous lies” about projections of profitability and loss while applying to IDBI and SBI for loans in 2009, a proposition disputed by Mallya’s lawyer Claire Montgomery.Summers quoted from emails, witness statements, brand valuations, business case projections and thousands of other documents to reiterate to the judges the government of India’s primary charges of conspiracy and substantive fraud against Mallya.He insisted that chief judge Emma Arbuthnot of the Westminster Magistrates Court was correct in her ruling that there is a prima facie case against Mallya, for which he needs to be extradited to India to face trial.“Profitability of the company was knowingly fudged (in loan applications), wildly untrue and patently dishonest claims were made on projections of the company’s profits and loss. Promises of equity to be infused were liberally made that never came. A honest person would have presented accurate picture to banks”, Summers said.India’s case rests on what has been mentioned as “three chapters of dishonesty” by Mallya—misrepresentations to various banks to acquire loans, the misuse of the loans and his conduct after the banks recalled the loans.Summers cited in this regard issues related to the Kingfisher villa in Goa, the claimed Rs 3000 crore brand value of Kingfisher when a consultancy that had valued it at half that figure was not submitted to banks, an aircraft bought allegedly for Mallya’s personal use, and the “siphoning off” of funds to trusts reportedly controlled by his children.“There is at least a case to answer”, he told the judges, insisting that a reasonable jury at trial could conclude that Mallya and his company indulged in conspiracy, fraud, and used loans for unintended purposes, including part of the loans going to his motor racing team.Summers noted that in extradition cases, British courts are solely required to establish whether the person requested has a prima facie case to answer, not to establish the truth and arrive at a conviction.Montgomery, on the other hand, has insisted that Mallya’s inability to repay bank loans was due to a genuine business failure and the result of wider challenges facing the aviation industry at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-high-court-judgement-on-mallya-extradition-appeal-today/story-oJtuNi9eieXUAIFjmhBLaI.html
20-04-2020||World||Over 40,000 Covid-19 deaths in US, New Zealand set to ease lockdown: 10 points||The Coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has spread across continents to become a pandemic that has locked down more than half of the planet.More than 2 million have been infected by coronavirus across the world while over a lakh patients have lost their lives to the deadly contagion.Here are the latest Covid-19 developments from across the world:1. According to the Reuters tally, coronavirus death toll in the US rose to more than 40,000 - the highest in the world. The figure is nearly double the number of fatalities in the next highest country Italy.2. Spain’s death toll continued to slow on Sunday. The country registered 410 new fatalities on Sunday - the lowest daily count in almost a month. Health ministry emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said the slump in fatalities “gives us hope”.3. Russia confirmed 4,268 new coronavirus cases on Monday. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the country rose to 47,121. The increase was less than 6,060 new cases reported the previous day.4. On Monday, Pope Francis urged political leaders to put aside partisan differences and deal with the coronavirus crisis in a united way.5. After a month of tight curbs, New Zealand is set to ease some lockdown measures from next week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday.6. On Sunday, Turkey’s confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 86,306 - highest outside of Europe and the United States. 7. On Monday, Germany allowed the opening of some stores in selected areas. Larger stores will open later as the government plans to lift curbs in a phased manner.8. As Ramadan nears, the UAE said medical workers treating Covid-19 patients are exempt from fasting during the holy month. The country also urged Muslims not to congregate and offer their prayers from home.9. After thousands of people attended the funeral of a popular local cleric, Bangladesh has tightened the lockdown on seven villages. The country already has a nationwide coronavirus lockdown in place. 10. A top Chinese agriculture official said that the coronavirus pandemic threatens to trigger a new food crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-over-40-000-covid-19-deaths-new-zealand-set-to-ease-lockdown-curbs-10-points/story-v0NP9Zn0fbN21INKI9EDQP.html
20-04-2020||World||Nobel winning scientist claims Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab: Report||French Nobel prize winning scientist Luc Montagnier has sparked a fresh controversy by claiming that the SARS-CoV-2 virus came from a lab, and is the result of an attempt to manufacture a vaccine against the AIDS virus.In an interview given to French CNews channel and during a podcast by Pourquoi Docteur, professor Montagnier who co-discovered HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) claimed the presence of elements of HIV in the genome of the coronavirus and even elements of the “germ of malaria” are highly suspect, according to a report in Asia Times.“The Wuhan city laboratory has specialized in these coronaviruses since the early 2000s. They have expertise in this area,” he was quoted as saying.The theory that Covid-19 virus originated in the lab is making rounds for quite some time.US President Donald Trump last week acknowledged Fox News report that the novel coronavirus may have been accidentally leaked by an intern working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.The Fox News, in an exclusive report, based on unnamed sources has claimed that though the virus is a naturally occurring strain among bats and not a bioweapon, but it was being studied in Wuhan laboratory. The initial transmission of the virus was bat-to-human, the news channel said, adding that the “patient zero” worked at the laboratory. The lab employee was accidentally infected before spreading the disease among the common people outside the lab in Wuhan city.Professor Montagnier was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the identification of AIDS virus, with his colleague professor Françoise Barre-Sinoussi.His fresh claim on coronavirus, however, received criticism from scientists, including his colleagues. “Just in case you don’t know. Dr Montagnier has been rolling downhill incredibly fast in the last few years. From baselessly defending homeopathy to becoming an antivaxxer. Whatever he says, just don’t believe him,” tweeted Juan Carlos Gabaldon.As per a recent Washington Post, two years ago, the US embassy officials in China raised concerns about the insufficient biosafety at the Chinese government’s Wuhan Institute of Virology where deadly viruses and infectious diseases are studied.Though the institute, located quite close to the Wuhan wet market, is China’s first biosafety level IV lab, the US state department had warned in 2018 about “serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory”.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting,” according to a purported copy of the letter shared by Financial Times media reporter Mark Di Stefano on Twitter.But they did not want to be used as “currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion”.“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know -- as well as complete strangers -- have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue,” according to an excerpt published by the Guardian.The newspaper described the letter as an “unprecedented attack on a large part of the media”.Harry and Meghan made a bombshell announcement in January that they wished to withdraw from frontline royal duties and become financially independent.Their departure -- dubbed “Megxit” by the British press -- followed reports Meghan was unhappy with royal life and both of them had complained about media intrusion.The couple’s hostility towards some media oulets spilled over into legal action last year, with Harry suing over alleged voicemail interception and Meghan filing a claim over a private letter to her father appearing in The Mail on Sunday after he shared it with the tabloid.In their message to the editors, the pair said their new policy did not apply to all media and that they would continue to work with journalists around the world.The couple relocated to California last month and have kept a low profile, with even their location unknown amid unconfirmed reports that the pair are living in Malibu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-and-meghan-blacklist-uk-tabloids-over-distorted-stories/story-lXTC8i4Z8AcjdmdlI0cwvN.html

The killing spree, which began on Saturday night, ended on Sunday morning when the shooter, identified as Gabriel Wortman, was gunned down by police in an encounter.While no motive has yet been attributed to the killing spree, police do not believe this was a random act as Wortman was dressed in the uniform of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP and, at one point, was believed to be driving a vehicle camouflaged as a police cruiser.RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki said investigators will “have to do a lot of work on finding the motivation, a lot of background, a lot of profiling-type events and a lot of crime scene processing,” according to CBC News.Among those killed by Wortman was a veteran RCMP officer, Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two, who responded to the “active shooter” alert.Wortman’s rampage began at around 11.30 pm at the township of Portapique, and ended 12 hours later at a petrol pump in the town of Enfield, following a chase by the local RCMP with officers firing upon the suspect. Wortman is believed to have owned a denture clinic and properties in Halifax, the capital of the province, and Portapique where the rampage started.In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mourned the victims, as he said, “I was saddened to learn about the senseless violence in Nova Scotia, which claimed the lives of multiple people, including one member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.” He added, “Our hearts go out to the people who have lost loved ones, and to the RCMP family mourning a fallen officer.”Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil expressed his anguish over the tragedy calling it “one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-kills-16-in-canada-s-nova-scotia-in-mass-shooting-lasting-12-hours/story-2qCONT6RDuPcuxvuISUwtL.html
20-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Canada moves to protect companies from takeover by ‘predatory foreign investors’||The Canadian government has introduced emergency measures to protect vulnerable companies from takeover by “predatory foreign investors,” a move similar to the Indian government’s decision to remove the automatic approval route for investments from countries sharing a border with India. Ottawa announced a slew of measures that will “subject certain foreign investments into Canada to enhanced scrutiny” under these “extraordinary circumstances.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed these concerns during his daily media briefing and said his government “will be strengthening our oversight and paying close attention to foreign investment in this country to ensure that there aren’t people taking advantage of this crisis.”As with New Delhi’s decision, no country has been named in the announcement from Ottawa, though there have been fears within the country that Chinese state-owned companies may take advantage of the situation. A statement from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada appears to underscore this point. In a statement, it noted that some investments by state-owned enterprises “may be motivated by non-commercial imperatives that could harm Canada’s economic or national security interests, a risk that is amplified in the current context.” In this context, it decided that all foreign investments by such companies or by “private investors assessed as being closely tied to or subject to direction from foreign governments” will be subject to the enhanced scrutiny under the Investment Canada Act.The statement added the rationale for these steps: “Many Canadian businesses have recently seen their valuations decline as a result of the pandemic, consistent with patterns in other major economies. These sudden declines in valuations could lead to opportunistic investment behaviour.”The Canadian government will pay “particular attention” to investments to businesses related to public health or involved in the supply of critical goods and services.It said that the government “will ensure that in-bound investment does not introduce new risks to Canada’s economy or national security, including the health and safety of Canadians.”These protectionist measures will remain in place till “the economy recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canada-moves-to-protect-companies-from-takeover-by-predatory-foreign-investors/story-8hGFKFbpkpTdHbhCjyWAaI.html

20-04-2020||World||New York passes Covid-19 ‘high point’ as Trump, governors feud||New York, the epicenter of America’s coronavirus infections, appeared to have passed the peak of the outbreak on Sunday, as President Donald Trump clashed with state governors over ending lockdowns.The United States has so far recorded more than 746,000 coronavirus cases and 40,000 deaths, far more than any other nation.New York has borne the brunt of the virus, which has killed more than 18,000 people in the state, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.“We are past the high point, and all indications at this point is that we are on the descent,” state governor Andrew Cuomo told a press conference. “Whether or not the descent continues depends on what we do, but right now we’re on the descent.”He added that “it’s no time to get cocky and it’s no time to get arrogant.”New York’s improving data came as the ongoing political battle between Trump and other state governors worsened again, with virus testing rates emerging as the focus.Experts say extensive testing is crucial to a safe reopening of the economy, but some state governors said testing capacity fell far below the levels needed to avoid sparking new outbreaks of the virus.Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News Sunday that every US state had the ability to do enough testing “to move into phase one.”“Phase one” ends stay-at-home restrictions for healthy people, and allows restaurants, cinemas, sporting venues, places of worships and gyms to re-open with physical distancing.But Virginia Governor Ralph Northam pushed back at the Republican administration’s claims that there was enough testing, saying “that’s just delusional.”Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, said “we could double or even triple the number of tests that we’re executing daily if we had the swabs and reagents.” She called for more federal government help.“I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done,” Trump tweeted.‘Delusional’ With tens of thousands dead the battle lines are being drawn ahead of the November election, and Trump -- who declared himself “a wartime president” during the pandemic -- is seeking to reduce damage to his chances of holding onto office.The anti-lockdown protests in several US cities in recent days attracted support from Trump, who in tweets called to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia -- all states with Democratic governors -- from stay-at-home orders.“Our president, obviously, has been unable to deliver on tests. Now he has chosen to focus on protests,” Northam told CNN’s “State of the Union.”Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, also a Democrat, went further still: “To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law... it is dangerous.”The Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, said Trump’s encouragement of protesters who picketed the colonial-era statehouse in Annapolis a day earlier was “not helpful.”“To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, on Thursday, it just doesn’t make any sense,” Hogan, who chairs the National Governors Association, told CNN.Cuomo announced this week that New York state’s shutdown -- which orders residents to stay at home except to exercise or perform essential business -- has been extended until May 15.In Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis allowed the reopening of some beaches as of this weekend.Although fog shrouded the area around the state’s Jacksonville Beach, those who turned out were “keeping their distance” from each other, Captain Rich Banks of Neptune Beach Ocean Rescue said.“We’ll see what happens when it really gets sunny and hot,” Banks said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-passes-covid-19-high-point-as-trump-governors-feud/story-o1dCT6RFSzdsFAK8wBnp6J.html
20-04-2020||World||Canada shooting suspect disguised himself as cop, made his car look like police cruiser||A man wearing a police uniform went on a shooting rampage as he drove around the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Sunday, killing 13 people, including a police officer. Officials said the suspected shooter was also dead.Several of the dead were found inside and outside one home in the small, rural town of Portapique, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Halifax late Saturday. Police began advising residents of the town — already on lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic — to lock their doors and stay in their basements. Several homes in the area were set on fire as well.Police identified the man believed to be the shooter as Gabriel Wortman, 51, who was thought to live part-time in Portapique. Authorities said he disguised himself as a police officer in uniform at one point and made his car look like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.Wortman was arrested by the RCMP at a gas station in Enfield, just outside Halifax. Police later announced that he had died.“This is one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province’s history,” said Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil. He said it was an additional “heavy burden” amid efforts to contain the new coronavirus.RCMP spokesman Daniel Brien confirmed that 13 people had been killed as had the shooter. He said he could not rule out that the death toll could still rise. Already, that makes it one of the worst shootings in Canadian history.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada. The country overhauled its gun-control laws after the country’s worst mass shooting in 1989, when gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college. It is now illegal to possess an unregistered handgun or any kind of rapid-fire weapon. Canada also requires training, a personal risk assessment, two references, spousal notification and criminal record checks to purchase a weapon.“We believe it to be one person who is responsible for all the killings and that he alone moved across the northern part of the province and committed what appears to be several homicides,” RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said.Police have not provided a motive for the attack, but Leather said many of the victims did not know the shooter.“That fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,” Leather said.Leather said they would investigate whether the attack had anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic but no link has been found thus far.The dead officer was identified as Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two and a 23-year veteran of the force. Another officer was also injured.Leather said at point there was an exchange of gunfire between the suspect and police. There were half a dozen police vehicles at the scene of a gas station where the suspect was shot. Yellow police tape surrounded the gas pumps, and a large silver-colored SUV was being investigated.Police said earlier Sunday the suspect was driving a car that looked like a police vehicle and was wearing a police uniform, but later said he was “believed to be driving a small, silver Chevrolet SUV.” They said he is not an RCMP employee or officer.Cpl. Lisa Croteau, a spokeswoman with the provincial force, said police received a call about “a person with firearms” at around 10:30 p.m. Saturday and the investigation “evolved into an active shooting investigation.”“My heart goes out to everyone affected in what is a terrible situation,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.Christine Mills, a resident of the area, said it had been a frightening night for the small town, with armed officers patrolling the streets. In the morning, helicopters flew overhead searching for the suspect. “It’s nerve-wracking because you don’t know if somebody has lost their mind and is going to beat in your front door,” she said.Tom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the Municipality of Colchester, said the quiet community has been shaken.“This is just an absolutely wonderful, peaceful quiet community and the idea that this could happen in our community is unbelievable,” Taggart said by phone from his home in nearby Bass River.A Gabriel Wortman is listed as a denturist — a person who makes dentures — in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, according to the Denturist Society of Nova Scotia website. A suspect photo issued by the RCMP appears to be of the same person seen in video footage being interviewed about dentures by CTV Atlantic in 2014.Mills also said that Wortman was known locally as someone who divided his time between a residence in Halifax and a residence in Portapique.Taggart said he didn’t know Wortman well, but spoke to him a few times when he telephoned about municipal issues.Taggart described knowing Wortman’s “lovely big home” on Portapique Beach Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-shooting-suspect-disguised-himself-as-cop-made-his-car-look-like-police-cruiser/story-sBGtxgfpvWYSMDs8QKASDJ.html
20-04-2020||World||Backed by Donald Trump, anti-lockdown protesters hit the streets in US||Protests against coronavirus-related restrictions spread to more US states over the weekend after President Donald Trump backed them with his “LIBERATE” tweets.Hundreds gathered in state capitals of Texas, Maryland, Utah, California, Arizona, Washington and Colorado, with signs and chants against the restrictions as a violation of their rights. Some carried signs saying the virus was a hoax, and some in Texas called for firing top epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, who some people see as undermining the American president. Protestors in Michigan, New York, Kentucky, Texas and some other states earlier defied social distancing norms issued by the Trump administration. The US death toll went up by 1,891 over the past 24 hours to 39,025 as of Sunday morning and infections rose by 32,491 to 735,366.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/backed-by-donald-trump-anti-lockdown-protesters-hit-the-streets-in-us/story-mOESi0TyfRzzUnq2I4UW6L.html
20-04-2020||World||Coronavirus update: 100,000 deaths, 1 million cases in Europe||Europe reached two tragic milestones on Sunday as it recorded 1 million coronavirus cases and reported over 100,000 deaths from the Covid-19 pandemic.Despite the rising numbers across Europe, there was some cheer as Spain registered a sharp drop in daily deaths on Sunday. Signs that the outbreak could eventually be easing prompted Switzerland, Denmark and Finland to begin reopening shops and schools this week.Spain’s fatalities fell to 410 from 565 the previous day. The deaths in the third hardest-hit country in the world after the US and Italy has reached 20,453. “It’s a number that gives us hope,” said health ministry emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon of the daily death toll, which is at its lowest in four weeks.Germany has declared the virus is “under control”, having reported 3,400 deaths, and is beginning the task of lifting some restrictions without triggering a secondary outbreak - with some shops allowed to reopen on Monday, and some children returning to school within weeks.Parts of Italy began emerging from lockdown, too, with residents in Venice seen to be strolling around the quiet canals.France has shown signs of a lockdown bearing fruit. The country reported 395 new deaths, the smallest increase in five days, while the number of hospitalised patients also declined. The British government on Sunday insisted it is not yet safe to ease the lockdown, amid criticism that PM Boris Johnson’s administration didn’t respond quickly enough in the early stages of the outbreak, which may have led to thousands of deaths.The UK reported 596 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 16,060. Michael Gove, senior cabinet minister, firmly rejected reports alleging that Johnson did not attend five meetings related to the crisis, and that ministers were slow in responding despite evidence of its seriousness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-100-000-deaths-1-million-cases-in-europe/story-UGi3YtlvYDpgrZOuVgPvOJ.html

20-04-2020||World||Donald Trump warns China of dire consequences||US President Donald Trump on Saturday said China should face “consequences” if it was found to have been “knowingly responsible” for the coronavirus outbreak.“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t, and the whole world is suffering because of it,” Trump said at a briefing.“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake,” he said. “But if they were knowingly responsible... then sure there should be consequences.”The US president offered no evidence to back his claim, but some sections of the media and his allies have recently contended that - with giving any proof - the virus escaped a virology laboratory in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak in China.There have been news reports of the lab receiving funding from the US, and American diplomats expressing concerns about safety measures in place at the facility. There have also been reports that US intelligence agencies have launched an investigation into the lab.China has reacted sharply to Trump’s charges. The director of the laboratory in Wuhan has rejected claims that it could be the source of the outbreak, calling it “impossible”. In an interview with state media published on Saturday, Yuan Zhiming, the director of the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said that “there’s no way this virus came from us”. None of his staff had been infected, he told state-backed media outlet CGTN, adding that the “whole institute is carrying out research in different areas related to the coronavirus”.The origin of the pandemic has been traced to a wet market in Wuhan, where the Covid-19 virus is believed to have been transmitted to humans.Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, displayed a graph at a briefing attended by Trump that showed the death rates of various nations, and China was shown to be at the bottom with the lowest rate. Birx said she included China in the chart to highlight how “unrealistic”its coronavirus numbers are. The US mortality rate is 11.24 per 100,000, which is much higher than China’s reported rate of 0.33.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-warns-china-of-dire-consequences/story-kMtjxCQ1Q2zQIs3ha9AoTL.html
20-04-2020||India||Farmer turns to Twitter to sell cabbages, fails to find a buyer||Bengaluru: Turns out a bumper crop is bad news for farmers in times of Covid-19.On April 18, vegetable farmer Kannaiyan Subramaniam uploaded a video of his cabbage field on social media platform, Twitter. Within hours, it went viral with several users commenting on the video, and tagging others to amplify the farmer received the help he sought.The 50-year-old vegetable farmer in Voddarahalli village in Karnataka’s Chamarajanagara district, located on the border with Tamil Nadu, said that he had nearly 100 tonnes of cabbage that was ready for harvest.Faced with the prospect of fresh and healthy cabbages rotting in the 3.5-acre land that he farms on lease, Subramaniam who is also the general secretary of the South India Coordination Committee of Farmers Movements, a farmers rights lobby group, posted a 15-second video in Tamil asking people to help him find buyers. He offered his entire crop for Rs 3 lakh, a sum that he said, would barely cover his initial investment. Since then, the video has received more than 305,000 views, 25,000 retweets, and plenty of gratuitous advice. Subramaniam is yet to find a buyer.In the past 24 hours, others have taken to social media platforms to seek buyers for their produce, including a watermelon farmer from Bijapur, a tomato farmer from Sarjapur; a banana farmer from Tuticorin.With markets shut and people homebound due to the lockdown, demand for produce across the country has crashed. Unable to sell much, vegetable farmers are saddled with massive losses. This is the story of thousands of vegetable farmers across India today.According to an April 8 report by Credit Suisse, a financial research firm, despite a bumper harvest in the Rabi season, the arrival of fruits and vegetables in the country’s wholesale markets has fallen by a whopping 50-95%, as only a fraction of the 7,000 wholesale markets have been functioning after the lockdown was enforced. In 2019-20, Indian farmers sold 284 million tonnes of horticultural produce worth Rs 5 lakh crore. Even assuming only a 50% fall in market arrivals over a month of lockdown, vegetable farmers would have lost in excess of Rs 20,000 crore.Subramaniam sold his previous harvest of cabbages for Rs 11.50 a kilogramme. “I’m not looking for profit. I would be happy if I can recover my cost and the cabbages reach those who don’t have enough to eat in these times,” he told Hindustan Times, two days after posting the video. Subramaniam’s plight illustrates how the already bumpy road from farm-to-fork has caved in during the lockdown. A few days ago, local newspapers in Karnataka reported that nearly 70 farmers in Shivamogga district were stuck with 2,000 tonnes of ash gourd as regular buyers from Delhi and Agra failed to turn up. ‘Petha’, the popular north Indian sweet is made of candied ash gourd.Similarly, Panruti in Cuddalore district is the jackfruit capital of Tamil Nadu. With the onset of summer, the giant, spiky fruits are everywhere but the demand has dried up. Some local businessmen and charitable organisations in the region pooled in money and bought the jackfruit from farmers. The lot was handed over to the local municipal authorities that door delivered vegetables. Anyone who purchased a three-kilo vegetable pack sold by the government at Rs 100 was given a free jackfruit; ordinarily, the fruit costs close to Rs 150.Subramaniam rang up the agri war room helpline set up by the Karnataka government, which functions between 8am to 8pm to help farmers’ with transportation passes, farm equipment access and disease management. “The officials told me they couldn’t do anything about procurement directly but offered to connect me to traders who could only pay Rs 2 a kilo. The traders said even that price could not be guaranteed,” he said. Usually, market agents from distant parts of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka would visit Subramaniam’s farm and harvest the required quantity of cabbage themselves. If Subramaniam wanted to sell his produce at big market centres of Erode or Chennai for a higher price, he would harvest, sort, package and transport the vegetables directly to traders there. Since the lockdown, agents haven’t been able to come to his farm.“Hiring a mini-truck that can carry about 5-6 tonnes of cabbage to the market isn’t viable. During the lockdown operators charge more than Rs 30,000 for one consignment from my village to the wholesale market in Chennai,” Subramaniam said. One grocery retail chain sought to buy 3000 cabbages from him at Rs 5 apiece, but asked Subramaniam to deliver them at a collection center in Mandya 125 km away. He refused, because he felt that paying for transportation would have meant throwing good money after bad. “No matter how you dice it, there is no way I can even break even,” he said. “When the lockdown is lifted, demand will inch up but the loss-ridden farmers will not have the financial means to invest in a new crop. With a fall in production consumer prices will skyrocket. It’s a deadly spiral for both the farmer and consumer,” said Subramaniam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-turns-to-twitter-to-sell-cabbages-fails-to-find-a-buyer/story-ukTD9YuaR5yO82b2n8cnKO.html
20-04-2020||India||IIT-BHU joins 7 others in boycotting Times rankings over ‘transparency’ complaints||New Delhi: The Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), or IIT (BHU), on Monday joined seven other premier IITs and announced it will also boycott the prestigious Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The seven announced their boycott last week saying they are not satisfied with the transparency of the process.“There are questions over the rankings criteria. This issue has been discussed for a long time. We have also decided to not participate like some of the other IITs,” IIT (BHU) director Pramod Kumar Jain said.IIT Mandi director Timothy Gonsalves said his institute has not been participating in the rankings and will continue doing so. IIT Ropar, which along with Bengaluru’s Indian Institute of Science (IISc) was placed in the 301 to 350 bracket in the last rankings, will continue taking part in the exercise.“We are participating in the ranking exercise,” said Prof S K Das, IIT Ropar head. The rankings agency said its World University Rankings were well established as the global gold standard international benchmark for world-class research universities.“First published in 2004, our 2020 edition published last September included voluntary submissions from almost 1,400 institutions from 92 countries and regions,” it added in a statement.“If leading universities in a nation with such a proud heritage of scholarly excellence, and with such huge opportunities for economic growth decline to take part in the gold standard rankings, we believe it would be detrimental to those institutions, and to India as a whole.”It said transparency was at the heart of everything it did. “Our chief data officer visited Delhi in November 2019 to specifically engage with the IITs on our methodology, and in January 2020, our chief knowledge officer held a full one-day forum in Delhi for hundreds of guests, where the rankings data and methodology was front and centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-bhu-joins-7-others-in-boycotting-times-rankings-over-transparency-complaints/story-OacCXuaPaMKDpf4J75U5RM.html
20-04-2020||India||Uddhav warns those giving Palghar case a communal twist||Mumbai/New Delhi: Facing criticism for the lynching of three men — including two Hindu sadhus — in Palghar district, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a set of measures to bring the guilty to book, while warning against giving the incident a communal flavour. In a video message on Monday, Thackeray announced the setting up of a high-level police probe into the incident; the suspension of two police officials for dereliction of duty; outlined the nature of the incident and the action taken so far, including the arrest of over 100 accused; and summarised his conversations with home minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath about the incident. On Thursday, a mob of villagers attacked and lynched three men — Kalpavruksha Giri, Sushil Giri and Neelesh Telgade — in Gadhchinchale village, 110km from Palghar on April 16. The first two were Hindu ascetics affiliated with a religious akhara in Varanasi; the third was their driver. They were reportedly headed to Gujarat to attend the last rites of their religious guru. But the crowd suspected them of being child-lifters, dragged them out of the car, and beat them with sticks. The police said they were outnumbered. A video of the incident became public on Sunday, sparking accusations from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that the state government failed to ensure law and order. BJP supporters on social media also launched an attack on the Maharashtra government for what they alleged was negligence since the case involved Hindu religious figures. Thackeray said that the two sadhus had reached the Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli but were not allowed by local authorities to enter the area, and hence were returning through internal roads. “The police have already arrested more than 100 suspects including five key accused responsible for the incident. The key accused have been given police custody till April 30. We have suspended two policemen holding them responsible for the incident. Nobody involved in this heinous crime will be spared.” He also announced a high level probe by additional director general (CID) Atulchandra Kulkarni into lynching case.The Maharashtra CM issued a strict warning not to use the incident to inflame communal passions, and said he had apprised home minister Amit Shah about the case. “Even Amit Shahji knows that the incident had no religious connection as the village in which the incident took place has no such background. I have requested him to taken strict action against the people trying to spread communal tension using social media. We too are taking action against the bid to arouse religious sentiments using the incident.”State home minister Anil Deshmukh said that those who attacked and who died in the Palghar mob killings were not from different religions, and underlined that he had asked the Maharashtra police and the cyber cell to take action against anyone instigating communal hatred in the society or on social media. The CM also spoke to UP CM Yogi Adityanath, who had tweeted urging his Maharashtra counterpart to take strict action against the culprits involved in the lynching of the three men.While condemning the incident, the Congress — which is a part of the Maharashtra government — accused the BJP of communalising it. “We unequivocally condemn it. There is no place for violence in our civilised society and the strictest possible action must be taken against the accused,” Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a statement. But he added that there was no communal or Hindu-Muslim angle to the attack as was being sought to be projected; and the accused belonged to the tribal community. “Tragically, BJP and its echo system as also a section of media are attempting to project the incident with communal overtones.”The BJP rejected the allegation. Sunil Deodhar, a national secretary of the party, said the allegations that tribal people attacked the trio suspecting them to be thieves is fabricated. “No adivasi attacks those in saffron robes, unless they have been brainwashed for years. I am familiar with the area and it’s a stronghold of the communists who hate those in saffron,” he said. On Thackeray’s statement, Deodhar said that the CM was “beating around the bush, instead of addressing the issue”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-warns-those-giving-palghar-case-a-communal-twist/story-cxGaH7r4p9x8As92iHszYL.html

20-04-2020||India||New guidelines for soldiers set to join duties after leave||New Delhi The Indian Army on Monday came out with a fresh of instructions for soldiers who have completed their leaves, temporary duties and courses, and are required to rejoin their units on priority.The army said all its personnel be classified as ‘green’ (who have completed 14 days of quarantine), ‘yellow’ (those who need to undergo 14 days quarantine) and lastly, ‘red’ (who are symptomatic and require isolation and further treatment in Covid hospitals). According to the instructions, the top priority bracket includes soldiers whose units or duty stations are within 500km by private transport from their place of leave, all ranks of the operationally-critical Northern Command and personnel belonging to Army Medical Corps, Army Dental Corps and Military Nursing Service who are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The second highest priority for rejoining duty has been accorded to “all ranks of Eastern Command plus officers and key appointments of other Commands as decided by the respective Commands”.“The guidelines for rejoining have been planned in a phased manner considering the numbers of individuals rejoining from leave/temporary duty/courses and the requirement for smooth reporting, quarantine and onward dispersal to units,” two senior army officers said.The new orders said soldiers would rejoin duties only on the receipt of specific instructions from their units, formations and establishments. “Any individual whose leave station is within 500km of unit/duty station is allowed to directly report to unit using private transport only. Those who are not within the 500km limit will report to nearest unit/station headquarters in private vehicle only,” the instructions said.“All personnel reporting back from leave, temporary duty and courses will be classified as ‘yellow’ and will undergo 14 days quarantine at the reporting station/unit. They will subsequently be moved from reporting station to duty stations and units in army vehicles, special trains, etc.,” the instructions said.The army clarified in case such personnel do not move under the supervision of military authorities, they will continue to be considered ‘yellow’ and would have to undergo a 14-day quarantine again.According to the instructions, Indian Army soldiers from Nepal, who are on leave, will remain at their home stations till the situation in the neighbouring country stabilises or the government opens the border for the movement of personnel.“Requisite move instructions will accordingly be passed to such personnel from their parent units, headquarters and establishments,” the instructions said.The army clarified that the latest instructions will not apply to soldiers in hotspots or containment zones. “Individuals in hotspots/containment zones will follow strict ‘no movement’ till the areas are denotified. The leave-granting authorities will decide on the use of the exception of areas officially declared as hotspots/containment zones by the central/state government,” the instructions said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-guidelines-for-soldiers-set-to-join-duties-after-leave/story-Atp8EgUTN8pJAuoHpDLJmM.html

20-04-2020||India||Aggressive testing must to prevent 2nd wave of Covid||New Delhi: A working paper by a team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) suggests that there will be a second wave of ,Covid-19 infection unless new cases are aggressively traced, localised and isolated.The paper, released on Sunday evening, looks at various scenarios in which a lockdown is lifted in cities affected by Covid-19 infections. It also considers the most restrictive scenario when the lockdown continues to be imposed indefinitely: lockdown until May 31; lockdown until May 3 as currently planned and so on. In all cases, researchers have considered that infected cases are being isolated with 90% compliance.Researchers have then modelled the impact of nine interventions on infections in Mumbai and Bengaluru. These interventions include only case isolation; social distancing of those aged 65 years and above; lockdown for 26 days; lockdown for 40 days; lockdown continues; phased emergence from lockdown with various restrictions. Based on demographic data of Mumbai and Bengaluru, the team found that if the lockdown were to continue indefinitely, the number of Covid-19 fatalities in Mumbai till September are likely to be a fraction compared to no intervention scenario. The fatalities reduce to 530 as compared to 27790 in the no intervention scenario. If the lockdown were to be lifted on April 20 and people returned to normal activities, the number of fatalities will still rise, but slowly. Even if the lockdown were to be lifted only after May 3, the relaxation of restrictions will lead to fatality numbers going as high as with no-interventions, but gradually.“This delay may allow better mobilisation of resources for aggressive testing, tracking, and containment that can change the course of the epidemic,” the paper said.Bengaluru offers a similar scenario. If the lockdown were to continue indefinitely, the number of Covid-19 fatalities in the city are likely be far fewer: 30 compared to 21,200 in the no intervention scenario. These projections were made until September 2, 2020, for Mumbai and July 22, 2020, for Bengaluru, according to Rajesh Sundaresan, corresponding author of the paper.The team of researchers has arrived at these trends based on a simulation of the infection spread in Bengaluru and Mumbai using a model which builds a fine-grained replica of a city, and mimics various interaction spaces, such as households, schools and workplaces, according to a statement by IISc.“If there are 10 million people in Bengaluru, the city’s model also has that many individuals,” said Sundaresan, professor at the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering at IISc, in the statement. He added that the model also takes into account population densities, age distribution, household size distribution, commute distances and several other parameters.“We have to increase identification of cases by active case finding and enhanced testing, ensure isolation and quarantine and continue proper physical distancing, cough etiquette, respiratory hygiene. We have to get used to the new normal now or cases will rise steadily. Plans will have to be developed for migration, transit inter and intra districts and states after lockdown also,” said Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, lifecourse epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressive-testing-must-to-prevent-2nd-wave-of-covid/story-YnItNq5ETUctj4SXIxeeIP.html
20-04-2020||India||12-yr-old migrant worker dies after walking 100km||Raipur: A 12-year-old girl died in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur after walking about a hundred kilometers over three days through dense forests to reach her village from Perur in Telangana’s Mulgu district, where she had gone along with 13 migrant workers including her uncle to work in chilly fields before the nationwide lockdown, officials said on Monday. The workers began walking from Telangana’s Perur on April 15 and Jamlo Madkami, the girl, died upon reaching Chhattisgarh on April 18 and prompted the Bijapur district administration to quarantine the 13.Bijapur Collector KD Kunjam said that the girl’s post-mortem examination was done on Monday and the body was handed over to the family .Bijapur’s chief medical and health officer, Dr BR Pujari, said the girl’s post-mortem was conducted on Monday and added she tested negative for Covid-19. “...the exact reason behind the death is yet to be ascertained. Her viscera has been preserved. It will be sent for further examination to ascertain the cause of her death,” he said. Pujari said she appears to have died because of electrolyte imbalance.“Since she travelled on difficult terrains for three days, she could have suffered muscle fatigue and that may have led to some imbalance. Secondly, as per the people who were walking with her, she fell from a hillock and sustained injuries also,” he said.Pujari said the workers took a forested route to reach their village because of closure of roads due to the lockdown. “She [Madkami] walked along with the group and crossed difficult terrains of Maoist-affected forested areas and on Saturday evening she collapsed in Bhandarpal,” said Pujari. He added the route is extremely treacherous.Madkami was about 50 kilometers from her Aded village when she died.An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said hundreds of workers have returned to their homes on foot from Telangana through dense forests since the lockdown was imposed in March and extended last week until May 3. “The forest routes are surrounded by Maoist-affected areas. Hence no one can monitor their movement,” said a police official involved in anti-Maoist operations, who did not want to be named.The lockdown triggered an exodus of migrant workers from bigger cities in March as tens of thousands of them left jobless because of the curbs imposed to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic began leaving for their homes on foot. This prompted the Centre to direct the states and Union territories to seal their borders and ensure the migrant workers are taken care of in shelter homes. Migrant workers have recently gathered in cities like Mumbai and demanded that they be sent home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-yr-old-migrant-worker-dies-after-walking-100km/story-8LHJHm2F61mDJZXqGd4SGP.html

The agreement was signed in the presence of Indian ambassador Sripriya Ranganathan.Humasis Ltd, whose factory is located at Gyeongi-do in South Korea, is “sourcing raw materials for production of these diagnostic testing kits from India”, the statement said. “This collaboration forms an important part of efforts to augment India’s testing capacity in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic,” it added.Over the past few weeks, India’s Central and state government agencies and private companies have sourced 450,000 testing kits from different Korean companies.“This cooperation is in keeping with the special strategic partnership between India and [South Korea] and the shared commitment of our leaders to pursuing a people-first approach,” the statement said.The cooperation is also in keeping with the assurance by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that the two countries will continue to consult and support each other and share experiences in the common fight against Covid-19, it added. India has turned to a wide range of countries, from the US to China, to source medical supplies and equipment needed to counter the spread of the Coronavirus. Indian missions around the world have played a key role in the sourcing of these supplies, arranging clearances from local authorities and coordinating with airlines to transport the goods to India.Last week, Chinese firms supplied 650,000 testing kits on two cargo flights.Officials had then said Chinese companies have been contracted for nearly 15 million Personal Protection Equipment kits and 1.5 million rapid testing kits by the government and private firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-signs-pact-with-s-korean-firm-for-500-000-testing-kits/story-krpZcmk6E8TJPyYE8swjaL.html

According to Roy, cards and payments sectors will also struggle.COO Pravin Rao said that the IT major is not looking at any Covid-19-related layoffs “at this stage”.Rao said that the firm’s employees will return to offices in a phased manner. “We are in no hurry to get employees back to offices. Our first phase of returns, when it happens, will be likely to get 5% employees returning, and in the next phase will total about 15%,” he said.Rao said that the company will make 35,000 job offers in FY21.Infosys top brass also said it will honour the job offers it has extended to the markets, in order to enhance the skill-sets it can bring to recovery-focused client environments.“Considering the business uncertainty emanating from Covid-19, the company is unable to provide guidance on revenues and margins for FY21 at this stage. The company will provide guidance after visibility improves,” the company said in its stock exchange filing.CEO Salil Parekh said Infosys team has achieved 93 per cent remote working on Monday and has been ensuring consistent service delivery for clients in this rapidly changing environment.“While the immediate short-term will be challenging, looking ahead, we can see that there is a strong interest to consolidate with partners with high-quality and agile service delivery and strong financial resilience.

20-04-2020||India||‘Improper sampling, Bihar missing out Covid-19 cases’: AIIMS-Patna chief||The top official of Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) warned on Monday that Bihar could be missing out a large number of Covid-19 cases because of incorrect methodology of sample collection.The disclosure came as Bihar reported 20 cases of coronavirus — the biggest spike in a day so far. Seventeen of the cases were reported from Biharsharif in Nalanda district and three from Jamalpur in Munger district during the last 24 hours.The district administration had sealed Biharsharif and enforced containment measures, similar to a hotspot.“Improper methodology of sample collection could be a reason for the large number of negative cases in the state,” AIIMS-Patna director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh told HTFollow coronavirus latest updates here.Of the 11,319 samples tested so far, Bihar has reported only 113 positive cases.Dr Singh cast aspersions on the acumen of non-AIIMS personnel in collecting nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples for Covid-19 confirmatory test.He raised this point after two recent samples, which tested positive at AIIMS, turned out to be negative at the ICMR’s Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS) here. Both are institutes of the Central government.Dispelling any ambiguity in reporting samples at AIIMS, Dr Singh said, “We engage specialist doctors from the ENT department to collect nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples of suspects. In our case, you will always get proper yield. I don’t think any other institute, which conducts RT PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) in the state, engages ENT specialists for samples. They mainly rely on technicians.”Stressing that the government should emphasise on proper sample collection by specialists, he said, “If a sample tests positive, there is 99.9% probability of the sample actually being positive. However, if a sample tests negative, there is every possibility of the patient being positive (false negative), but the result being negative because the virus strand may not have been tapped due to improper sample collection. A large number of patients can thus be left out of the net,” he added.A 32-year-old woman from Khajpura who tested positive at the AIIMS on April 18, had tested negative at the RMRIMS on Monday. Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore Choudhary confirmed this fact.The AIIMS had collected nasopharyngeal sample of the woman that tested positive on April 18.“The remaining extract of the woman’s nasopharyngeal sample, along with fresh oropharyngeal (throat swab) sample, collected on April 19 was sent to the RMRI. The nasopharyngeal extract of ours, tested positive at the RMRI as well. However, the oropharyngeal swab of the patient, collected by RMRI technicians, tested negative at the ICMR laboratory,” said Dr Neeraj Agarwal, dean of AIIMS-Patna and also the nodal officer of the institute for coronavirus.“As such, Sunday we collected four samples — two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs each —from the woman and sent them for re-tests at our laboratory as well as the RMRI to check for any discordant results,” he said.Patna civil surgeon Dr Choudhary said, “The samples of recent tests, performed at RMRI, have tested negative, while we await results of tests done at AIIMS.” Another 35-year-old patient from Raghopur block of Bihar’s Vaishali district who tested positive at the AIIMS on April 15, tested negative during a re-test at the RMRIMS and the AIIMS, less than 48 hours later. The patient died on April 17 before his second report tested negative later in the evening.The AIIMS, however, said the patient died of “coronavirus” and “multi-organ failure”. “In medical science, any test report is always based on probability. If a sample tests positive, the actual chance of positivity is 67%. Similarly, if a sample is negative, actual chance of the patient being negative is only 37%. It is for this reason that a Covid-19 patient is tested twice within 24 hours before he or she is discharged from any facility. Even after discharge, a patient is advised to be under 14-day home quarantine,” said Dr Agarwal.The Khajpura woman did not have any travel history or prospects of having come in contact with any Covid-19 patient.

Aspiration boxes protect healthcare professionals at the time hospitalized Covid-19 patients are being taken off tubes, when it can get “messy”.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave it a public shout-out Monday, in a post on Twitter, with a link to the news article: “Thank you to the Mahindra Group for rising to the occasion and using your facilities to manufacture life-saving equipment.”The Mahindra plant’s protective gear for doctors and nurses is part of a larger effort by the auto industry to repurpose their manufacturing facilities to help make up for the shortfall of critical medical supplies such as ventilators for hospitalized Covid-19 patients and protective equipment healthcare professionals, with a little push from the White House. Ford and General Motors, for instance, are making ventilators.Earlier this month, India had lifted restrictions on the export of antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine a the request of President Donald Trump, who has touted it as a “game-changer” in the treatment of Covid-19, which remains unproven.The Mahindra plant makes off-road utility vehicles called Roxor and it was closed in March because of the epidemic, which has hit Michigan state very hard, specially Detroit, home of the US auto industry.“We had the material on hand to get started,” said Rick Haas, CEO of Mahindra Automotive North America, told the Detroit News, referring to the windshield material already in the inventory. “We’re also making face masks, but we’re having challenges keeping supply and material in house. Everyone is trying to do that.”The aspiration boxes, which were designed locally, have been much in demand here and and abroad reportedly and the company plans to ramp up its manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thank-you-to-mahindra-group-for-mike-pompeo-s-shout-out-for-india-s-help/story-neILifegY4PoTuhNJlI3lN.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Assam transfers Rs 2,000 each to 86,000 migrants stranded in other states||The Assam government on Monday transferred a sum of Rs 2,000 each as financial relief to 86,000 people from the state stranded across the country due to the ongoing lockdown.“We were able to reach 4.3 lakh people from the state stranded across India due to the lockdown. Today we extended a one-time ex gratia amount of Rs 2,000 to 86,000 of them. Another installment will be considered during the ongoing lockdown,” Assam health and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.The Assam government has already provided Rs 25,000 each to 647 patients from the states who went outside for treatment and are stranded now. A sum of 2,000 USD has also been given to those from Assam who went abroad for short stints and are stranded.In order to provide relief to those stranded in other states, Assam had started a helpline and those in need were asked to give a missed call. Those who called were sent a web link and asked to fill up a form giving their details and bank account information.Those details were then sent to the districts to where the applicants belong in order to verify their claims. A total of 4.3 lakh unique calls were received by the government of which 2.28 lakh filled the forms and out of that 1 lakh bank accounts were found to be eligible.The process also enabled the state government to get an idea of the number of people from the state who are outside the state for employment. Karnataka with 68,000 has the highest number of people from Assam followed by Tamil Nadu with 36,000 and Kerala with 34,000.“This data along with details of their family members will be helpful when these people plan to return to Assam. We will be to monitor their movement and keep track of their health,” Sarma said while addressing a press conference.The minister informed that the state has got 9,600 rapid test kits from the Centre. The Assam government is attempting to procure more of those kits from China. Earlier the state had procured 50,000 PPE kits from China.“As of now we have to wait for 6 hours to get results of tests, but now we will be able to know about a person’s status through the rapid tests within 15 minutes. From Wednesday we will conduct rapid tests in our government hospitals,” Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-assam-transfers-rs-2-000-each-to-86-000-migrants-stranded-in-other-states/story-2egcxIvzAnpo2EvwOwgr9K.html
20-04-2020||India||Karnataka rules out relaxation of lockdown after attack on health workers||The Karnataka cabinet on Monday decided to continue the current lockdown measures in force till May 3 without any relaxation in the state after initially hinting that curbs would be lifted in phases.“It has been decided that there would be no relaxation in lockdown which is on currently. The existing arrangements will continue,” chief minister B S Yediyurappa told reporters.Primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar at a briefing in the evening said, “It was a unanimous decision to continue the lockdown. If required we may revisit the decision after 4-5 days. Right now we have decided to go ahead with the current restrictions till May 3.”Follow coronavirus latest updates here.The decision came as the government reviewed the situation following an attack late Sunday night on health workers and civic administration officials by some residents of Padarayanapura ward in Bangalore. Videos of the incident went viral shortly after the incident.The health workers had gone there to shift to quarantine several primary and secondary contacts of some of members of the Tablighi Jammat who had attended its congregation in Delhi last month and had tested positive for Covid-19. They were to be shifted to hotels designated as quarantine zones. The area where these people lived is very densely populated and has been declared as a ‘red’ containment zone in the city.The health workers and some BBMP (civic body) staff apart from a few police officials were seen being attacked by a mob.An upset Yediyurappa condemned the attack and damage to public property saying such acts would not be tolerated and those guilty would be brought to book under law.On Monday morning, police arrested 59 people including a woman rowdy sheeter called Firoza. Home minister Basvaraj Bommai said that five FIRs have been registered and that cases have been registered under the Disaster Management Act. All the arrested people will be handed over to the Crime Branch of the police for further investigation and prosecution, sources said.Minister Suresh Kumar said that the state was contemplating bringing in an ordinance on the lines of those in Uttar Pradesh and Kerala to confer special powers to the government to enforce containment measures and also provide protection to health workers. The UP ordinance also ensures that those who destroy government property are made to pay for it, while the Kerala one provides for imprisonment of up to two years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.“We are examining similar legislation by other states and will bring an ordinance in the state in this regard,” he said.The incident also has led to a political slugfest with several BJP leaders saying that the local MLA had a hand in the violence. Former minister and Congress MLA B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan who represents the area, however, denied having a role in the violence. “I had asked the officials not to go in the evening/night and that I myself would help them in the morning,” he said.Yediyurappa hit back at Khan saying, “Who is he to dictate whether officials should go to an area of not?”Former chief ministers Kumaraswamy of the Janata Dal (Secular) and Siddaramiah of the Congress too backed the government and said action should be taken against whoever was responsible for the violence on Sunday night.Eighteen new cases of Covid-19 emerged in the state on Monday, taking the total number of affected people to 408 out of which 112 have been discharged and 16 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-rules-out-relaxation-of-lockdown-after-attack-on-health-workers/story-ojokZJq8njhP7V0QHXzfwM.html

He added, “In the difficult times of #Covid19, closer cooperation between allies and friends will prepare us better to fight this menace and save our people.”People familiar with developments said the first consignment of 5,022 tonnes of wheat, out of a total of 75,000 tonnes being gifted to Afghanistan, was shipped in 251 containers from Kandla port in Gujarat to Chabahar port in Iran. This is perhaps the first time the Iranian port, granted a special exemption from US sanctions, has been used to ship supplies to Afghanistan during a humanitarian crisis.The consignment of wheat left Kandla port on April 12, and reached Chabahar port on April 15. The consignment was then transported by road to Afghanistan, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.The remainder of the 75,000 tonnes of wheat will be shipped from India in the coming weeks. “This humanitarian gesture is meant to ensure food security during the difficult times of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said one of the people cited above.India’s ambassador to Kabul, Vinay Kumar, met Afghan public health minister Ferozuddin Feroz and acting defence minister Asadullah Khalid on Sunday and handed over 800,000 hydroxychloroquine tablets and 170,000 paracetamol tablets for use by the health ministry and security forces.Feroz thanked India for its humanitarian aid and also recalled India’s extensive support to Afghanistan in the health sector, including the construction of hundreds of health centres, support for the Indira Gandhi children’s hospital and supplies of equipment and medicines.India has pledged more than $3 billion for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, making it the largest donor to the war-torn country in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-prez-ghani-thanks-india-for-supplying-hydroxychloroquine-wheat-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-s9iZwJGGwRQD2EdbGysF0N.html

20-04-2020||India||Six new Covid-19 cases in Kerala, CM Pinarayi Vijayan denies rift with Centre||Six new cases have been reported in Kerala on Monday even as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan made it clear that the state had no differences with the Centre on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.Earlier in the day, the state was forced to withdraw some concessions announced to ease the lockdown after the Union Government toughened its stand saying these measures would be against its earlier directive to implement the lockdown till May 3.“We have been following the directive of the union government. There is no tiff or differences with the Centre,” he said adding some of the directives of the state were misunderstood due to some confusion. He said the state has no plan to allow dining in restaurants and barber shops will not be allowed till the lockdown was lifted.The CM said all the new cases were reported from Kannur in north Kerala, one of the four districts in the red zone. Out of 408 total cases, 286 have been discharged and 46,323 people are under observation in the state. He said the state has the best recovery and least mortality rates in the country.When asked about the Sprinklr controversy, the CM refused to say anything. “I have better things to do. I don’t have any plan to go after such controversies,” he said. The Opposition Congress has sought his resignation saying the state’s valuable data was handed over to an American software firm.At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state, the state IT department had inked an agreement with the US firm to process a huge volume of data collected by grassroot health workers of the state. Though no money was involved in the contract the opposition alleged that it was a breach of privacy and vital data. Later, it was found that the state cabinet and law department were not consulted before signing the deal and the data firm had tied up with many global pharmaceutical giants.As the controversy flared up, state IT secretary M Shivasankar, also the CM’s private secretary told the media on Saturday that he had taken the decision personally, as the pandemic situation was getting out of control in the state. Later, he also appeared in a promotional video of the deal which was removed from the Sprinklr’s website after the controversy cropped up.“We direly needed an entry that could wet a considerable amount of health data to identify the infection pattern to streamline the containment strategy. Spirnklr agreed to provide the service without charge. The arrangement did not warrant the prior vetting of the finance or legal departments. It was my decision at a desperate time,” he said justifying the deal. But the opposition said he owned up to save the Chief Minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-new-covid-19-cases-in-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-denies-rift-with-centre/story-wlDVyQ9rCmiAsbuy695j6L.html
20-04-2020||India||Bleach, silence and personal water bottles: Ministry officials return to work||Deepak, 28, carries a bright yellow backpack labelled Kisan Shakti as he moves along the first floor of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Deepak is one of the five members of the housekeeping staff tasked to sanitise the building four times a day. The assistants to the senior officials sitting outside the offices get up from their seats as Deepak sprays the disinfectant on the tables and couches. “We have been doing this since last month, once a day,” says Deepak. “Now we use this bleaching liquid more frequently than before.” The change in schedule comes with the government’s latest directive, asking deputy secretary and above officials to rejoin office on Monday after nearly a month of work from home. A third of the junior staffers are also supposed to come to office, according to rosters decided by the head of the departments. Joint secretary and above ranks officials have been coming to office since last week. Thermal scanners, masks and sanitiser are the new buzzwords in the corridors of North Block. At the very entrance, temperatures are scanned as CISF officials offer sanitiser to those entering the premises. Officials not wearing masks are an anomaly. While the ministries have provided masks to the employees, many have chosen to invest in their own with varying versions from surgical masks to extra-protective ones. However, even with over a third of the staff returning to work, there is silence in the corridors. “Can you get us two cups of coffee or tea, but swacchta se (maintaining cleaniness),” a senior official asked a member of his team only to be told that the canteen wasn’t serving anything today.“Officers would socialise earlier,” said a second ministry official. “But now the canteen is shut, there is no chai (tea), so there is no charcha (conversation).” There are also officers carrying their own lunches and personal water bottles from home. “In the post-corona world, new rules to live and work by are being laid down,” a third official said. “Most of us now carry own lunches, make our own tea and even bring water bottles from home. It’s a lot more self-reliant than the ministries were earlier. I even make sure I switch off the lights in my room before I go home.”“I drink my milk tea at home in the morning,” added the third official as he laughed. “In office, it’s only green tea for me.” Moreover, most officials operate from within the four walls of their room. While senior officials have their own chambers, in case of junior officials extra care has been taken to ensure not more than two are in the same room. “We have nearly eliminated the paper-trail,” the first official said. “Only the most confidential documents are on paper anymore. Moreover, we have critically reduced the number of meetings, even while at work we operate on phone, whatsapp and video calls on the NIC platform.” “We have a four-day rotational shift,” said a CISF official posted outside one of the ministries in North Block. “After that we get break days and then return to work.” The CISF officials are the ones who sanitise and thermal scan those entering the buildings. In many cases, officers are only calling supporting staff who have their own private vehicles and live nearby. “I have only one multi-tasking staff,” said the first official. “And the only reason he was called in is because we needed to go through certain files.”But with Delhi still in lockdown, and a lack of public transport, many junior staffers are finding it increasingly difficult to reach work. “Junior-level officers normally travel using DTC buses and the metro,” an official told Hindustan Times. “There was a proposal to provide a transport allowance, but when there’s no transport, how will the allowance help.”“Commuting has been tough as there aren’t enough vehicles for junior staff. We are supposed to carpool with others and tying up gets a bit tough. They have asked to try getting private cars for whoever can manage,” one government official said requesting anonymity. Ministry staff has also expressed concerns over lack of social distancing measures while car-pooling. “Social distancing is not maintained when you have to pool with others. The entire point gets negated,” another ministry personnel said.In certain cases, the ministry provides a vehicle for junior staffers while other times many senior officials have taken to sending their own cars to pick and drop the officials. “I picked up one of the members of my team from Bengali market today,” said the first official. “He doesn’t have a car.”Drivers working for the officials live nearby and normally walk to office. “We walk to office and drive the officers when needed,” a driver who has been working with one of the ministries’ for the last thirty years said. “The new thing about my job is that along with cleaning the car, I now sanitise it using a spray as well.”According to Abdul Khan, a Delhi Police officer posted outside the Central Secretariat, the place has never been as eerily quiet before. “Earlier we would have lots of people in this area,” Khan said. “Tourists, visitors and officers all would be here. There would 400-500 people waltzing in the lawns. Now a lot fewer of them come in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bleach-silence-and-personal-water-bottles-ministry-officials-return-to-work/story-MxANV6uoyuQxF7Hdie5oPN.html

All supplies, rations, construction materials and medicines pass over this bridge,” the BRO said in a statement.The CM lauded the BRO for constructing the bridge on war footing despite the lockdown. It has been named after martyr Hangpan Dada from the state who died fighting terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir and was awarded Ashok Chakra posthumously.Work on the bridge started on March 17 and was completed on April 14 while adhering to all Covid-19 precautions. The BRO builds and maintains road networks in India’s border areas.The reconstructed bridge will allow heavier vehicles to cross including those for the Army’s requirements and transportation of heavy construction material. “Now that this strategic 430-foot multi span bridge is completed, hassle free communication is restored to Daporijo and 451 villages as well as all forward locations along line of actual control (LAC) where our security forces are deployed,” Khandu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-no-bar-as-bro-reconstructs-bridge-in-arunachal-pradesh-in-27-days/story-m2eCDCU3ze3IX52QDFD2RK.html

20-04-2020||India||Bengal govt asks medics not to return home daily amid Covid-19 outbreak||West Bengal government has asked frontline medical staff in state-run hospitals not to return home daily after work in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) among doctors and nurses.Earlier, the state government had announced that doctors, nurses and other medical staff in government hospitals would get a one-week holiday every second week.“On Sunday, the government issued an order urging frontline medical personnel in government hospitals to stay in their headquarters. They have been asked not to commute daily to their homes to prevent the spread of viral infection,” said a senior official of the health department.The order was issued after healthcare facilities in Bengal took a hit, as multiple patients who were being treated in general wards and some frontline medical staff who were treating those patients tested Covid-19 positive.Dozens of doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff in multiple state-run hospitals were asked to quarantine themselves after the incidents came to light.Some frontline medical workers, especially from among those posted in government hospitals in districts in and around Kolkata, have been returning home daily after work.“This is not desirable since it puts a daily physical and mental strain on the medical personnel. Besides, it also puts them at immense risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease,” he added.The state government has made arrangements for accommodation for doctors and nurses in hotels and other places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-asks-medics-not-to-return-home-daily-to-curb-covid-19-spread/story-ERYhnS5323NAteMsiaWLFL.html
20-04-2020||India||Cong panel featuring Rahul, Manmohan discusses MSME, migrant workers’ issues||New Delhi: The newly formed Congress consultative committee, headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, met for the first time on Monday and discussed the revival of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, smooth crop procurement and the issue of stranded migrant labourers due to the nationwide lockdown to contain the deadly coronavirus.After the meeting, the opposition party reiterated its demand for immediate direct cash transfer of Rs 7500 in all Jan Dhan, pension and the PM-Kisan scheme accounts to enable the poor and the needy to sustain themselves during the lockdown period.Giving details of the meeting, former union minister Jairam Ramesh said the Congress panel will prepare a detailed plan for revival of MSME together with steps to ensure smooth crop procurement of wheat, mustard and gram besides resolving the pressing issue of stranded migrant workers and submit it to the central government in a day or two.Congress president Sonia Gandhi had on Saturday formed the consultative committee under the chairmanship of the former Prime Minister to deliberate on current matters, including those related to the Covid-19 outbreak, and formulate the party’s views on various issues.The 11-member group also comprises former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, general secretary in-charge organisation KC Venugopal and former union ministers P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Jairam Ramesh.The other members of the group are technology and data cell chairman Praveen Chakravarty, spokespersons Gaurav Vallabh and Supriya Shrinate, apart from social media department head Rohan Gupta.Ramesh said the panel will meet every other day to discuss the important issues faced by the country due to the pandemic.“We have worked out a very concrete MSME revival package which we will submit to the central government in a day or two,” Ramesh said, addressing a news conference through video conferencing.He said both the former Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi insisted that absolute priority be given to the MSME sector, which has social and economic importance and is the second largest employer after agriculture.Ramesh said the Congress will also make positive recommendations to the government to ensure smooth crop procurement and resolution of the problems of the stranded migrant workers.He said the party once again urged the government to submit through direct benefit transfers Rs 7500 in all Jan Dhan accounts, all pension accounts of the elderly, differently abled and widows, and also those under the PM-Kisan scheme.“I am sure a compassionate and a responsible government can find funds to provide for the vulnerable,” he said when asked if the country had funds of this nature to spare.“It is the matter of priorities. It is absolutely essential for the survival of tens and thousands of people who need immediate assistance to tide over the crisis,” added Ramesh.He said the Congress will keep giving constructive suggestions to the government and hope it will take those positively. Rahul Gandhi too had also advocated constructive support to the government in his press conference last week.“We need to work with the government in these difficult times with a positive mindset. We are extending our hand for constructive cooperation and hope the government will come down from its pedestal and accept our positive suggestions. We are giving these suggestions on behalf of the people of India,” Ramesh said.The panel in its next meeting will discuss the lockdown exit strategy after May 3 and steps beneficial for the migrants, students and farmers.Ramesh also alleged that the Centre was busy “destabilising” the Madhya Pradesh government and was “caught napping in preparation for managing” the Covid-19 pandemic as a result of which the action got delayed.“The government did not act on time while dealing with the crisis and was busy in toppling the government in Madhya Pradesh. The government only woke up on March 23 but this is no time to play politics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-panel-featuring-rahul-manmohan-discusses-msme-migrant-workers-issues/story-If0V8RfGLfw5Y2XcAoYBrI.html
20-04-2020||India||IBF urges Centre to formulate stimulus package for broadcast sector||The Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) has sought the government’s support to deal with the economic crisis in the television broadcast sector as a fallout of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, according to a statement issued by the foundation on Monday.In its letter to Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, the IBF appealed to the government to take steps to help the sector. It listed 18 points including an 18-month regulatory moratorium for the sector, extension of moratorium period for GST payment, phased resumption of production activities, The IBF statement said the broadcasting business had been hit, both on the demand and supply side, which had not only led to cash flow problems but also resulted in existential crisis for many of its members. The cash flow difficulties of the members were further compounded, it said, because payments from Bureau of Outreach & Communication (BOC) and other state government advertising agencies running in several hundreds of crores had not been made.IBF president NP Singh said the broadcast sector was facing the brunt of the slowdown on account of complete cessation of production of television shows, cancellations of live sporting events and scheduled advertisements. Singh said while the not-for-profit industry body welcomed the compliance and statutory relaxations granted by the government on 15 April, “the broadcast sector is seeking a stimulus package from the Government in the form of economic relief and regulatory flexibility so that all Broadcasters especially the smaller businesses can be helped to get back on track”.The industry body also asked the government to reduce GST rate on Digital services (B2C), automatic refund of input credit and immediate processing and issuance of Lower withholding order (LTDS)”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ibf-urges-centre-to-formulate-stimulus-package-for-broadcast-sector/story-XWKCZvDA2lsble9LC26qKI.html
20-04-2020||India||Bengal school allegedly flouts lockdown, distributes food among students||On a day the Centre sent two teams to Bengal to review allegations of violation of lockdown orders, a government-aided school in Murshidabad district on Monday allegedly called hundreds of students to distribute rice and potatoes in lieu of their regular mid-day meals. This happened even as reports of more Covid-19 cases were being reported from different parts of the state. To ensure the safety of children, the government had earlier asked all schools to give the food items to their guardians. All schools in Bengal are closed.The Lalnagar High School in the district’s Hariharpara community block allegedly violated the orders and distributed 3 kg of rice and potatoes to each of the hundreds of students most of whom came in uniform. Only a few guardians came to collect the midday meal. Photos and videos of the incident went viral in the region.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.“The school authorities had announced on public address system that on Monday, they would distribute rice and potatoes. When I reached the school to collect them on behalf of my son, who studies in class 7, I found hundreds of students standing in queue,” said a villager who did not wish to be named.“Most of the students appeared to be completely unaware of social distancing norms. They were standing close to each other and some were even playing in the field. I did not see any school official asking them to go home and send their guardians instead,” he said.The father of another student said, “I was told by the school authorities that only students will be given the food items.”The headmaster, Sarwardi Biswas, claimed no midday meal was handed over to students. He said, “I was instructed to give midday meal items only to guardians and I carried out the order. Not a single student was given the food.”“There are 547 students in my school who were entitled to receive the rice and potatoes today. In all, 533 guardians came to the school to take it on behalf of the children,” he said.The headmaster also rubbished an allegation that students were given food in smaller quantities. He said, “The rice and potatoes were weight in front of the guardians. I don’t know why they are alleging that they got less than three kg of each item.”An assistant teacher of the school, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “We told the headmaster that students were not supposed to be in the school but he asked us to keep mum.”Hariharpara block development officer Purnendu Sanyal said, “We instructed the schools to distribute the midday meal only among the guardians. I was not aware that Lalnagar High School flouted our direction. I am looking into it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-school-allegedly-flouts-lockdown-distributes-food-among-students/story-2yK9wC5B22Sgk8YtmTHbLI.html
20-04-2020||India||Tulips in full bloom in Srinagar, but no visitors amid Covid-19 lockdown||This year over 1.3 million tulip bulbs in Srinagar will quietly wither away over the next week without catching an eye of a visitor because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which has led to the enforcement of the ongoing nationwide lockdown till May 3.The tulips, which have turned the 30-hectare Siraj Bagh into a sea of colour, haven’t had a single visitor to enjoy its blooming splendour since March-end, officials said amid growing concerns over the jolt to tourism in Kashmir Valley during high season due to the viral outbreak.“Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on the tourism sector, one of the mainstays of our local economy. The tulip plantation was increased from 1.2 million bulbs in 2019 to 1.3 million this year. We’re hopeful that it would give a fillip to tourism. Alas! The flowers will wither away over the next few days,” said Farooq Ahmad Rather, director, floriculture, Jammu and Kashmir.The picturesque tulip garden --- one of the biggest in Asia and located on the foothills of Zabarwan range and on the banks of majestic Dal Lake – grew over 55 varieties of red, yellow, pink tulip bulbs this year. The garden attracted 258,000 visitors, including many local Kashmiris, last year. The corresponding figure for 2018 was 190,000.“This year, we had increased the variety of tulips and the plantation area, as we’re hoping for more footfalls,” Rather added. The state horticulture department spends around Rs 70 lakh annually for the regal garden’s maintenance. “The tourism sector is reeling under a massive loss because of the Covid-19 outbreak. The setback will affect all those who are associated with the sector such as hoteliers, transporters, traders and houseboat owners,” Rather said. “Around 258,000 people visited the garden last year, of whom over 100,000 would have been tourists helping our local economy,” he added.The Tulip Garden was opened in 2007 on a slope with multiple terraces and overlooking the scenic Botanical Garden. The state floriculture department had imported tulip bulbs from the Netherlands and other European countries for the garden. Besides tulips, hyacinths, pansies, daffodils and ranunculus make the garden a one-stop destination for revellers during spring.Usually, the shelf life of a tulip is 15 days but floriculturists have increased the life span by adding late-blooming varieties. “Earlier, we used to grow only early and mid-blooming varieties. But the addition of late bloomers has ensured that the Tulip Garden remains open for a month around this time of the year,” said Shayeq Rasool, state floriculture officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tulips-in-full-bloom-in-srinagar-but-no-visitors-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-am5scMWrotuPQpOotU2kRM.html

This is an appeal to all the members of Purvashram that the least number of people should attend the funeral program and continue to follow the lockdown,” Adityanath said in a series of tweets in Hindi.“I had a great desire to see my father at the last minute, but I could not see him because of my duty to pursue the country’s fight against the global coronavirus pandemic in the interest of 23 crore people of Uttar Pradesh,” the Uttar Pradesh chief minister added.Bisht, 89, was admitted to the gastroenterology department of the AIIMS after his health deteriorated.

20-04-2020||India||Covid-19: India inks deal with South Korean firm for 500,000 testing kits||The Indian government signed an agreement with a South Korean company on Monday for acquiring 500,000 testing kits to prevent and control the spread of Covid-19, with the first lot expected to be delivered on April 30.The deal marks the first purchase agreement signed by the Indian embassy in Seoul and the testing kits will be supplied to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is playing a key role in shaping India’s efforts to contain the Coronavirus.The kits will be delivered to India by the South Korean firm, Humasis Ltd, in four lots from April 30, said a statement from the Indian embassy in Seoul. The agreement was signed in the presence of Indian ambassador Sripriya Ranganathan.Humasis Ltd, whose factory is located at Gyeongi-do in South Korea, is “sourcing raw materials for production of these diagnostic testing kits from India”, the statement said. “This collaboration forms an important part of efforts to augment India’s testing capacity in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic,” it added.Over the past few weeks, India’s Central and state government agencies and private companies have sourced 450,000 tests (both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR and antibody tests) from different Korean companies.“This cooperation is in keeping with the special strategic partnership between India and [South Korea] and the shared commitment of our leaders to pursuing a people-first approach,” the statement said.The cooperation is also in keeping with the assurance by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that the two countries will continue to consult and support each other and share experiences in the common fight against Covid-19, it added. India has turned to a wide range of countries, from the US to China, to source medical supplies and equipment needed to counter the spread of the Coronavirus. Indian missions around the world have played a key role in the sourcing of these supplies, arranging clearances from local authorities and coordinating with airlines to transport the goods to India.These supplies have included RT-PCR testing kits, rapid antibody tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. Last week, Chinese firms supplied 650,000 testing kits received in two cargo flights.Officials had then said Chinese companies have been contracted for nearly 15 million PPE kits and 1.5 million rapid testing kits by the government and private firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-inks-deal-with-south-korean-firm-for-500-000-testing-kits/story-hr28p3p5HrcOm7SyXKfwKP.html

20-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: As controversies break out, Bihar cracks the whip||The Bihar government has sought an explanation from officials of the Nawada district administration allegedly responsible for issuing an inter-state pass to BJP legislator Anil Singh to visit Kota in Rajasthan in violation of the guidelines for the Covid-19 lockdown.Action was also taken by authorities over the house-warming party organised by Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Verma’s personal assistant Pintu Yadav after first information reports (FIRs) were filed against several key officials who attended the gathering in Jehanabad.Verma, who found himself at the centre of a controversy as the party violated the guidelines for the lockdown, recommended the removal of his personal assistant.Bihar’s chief secretary Deepak Kumar reiterated chief minister Nitish Kumar’s position that the spirit of lockdown must be maintained by all amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and said show-cause notices had been served to officials of the Nawada district administration to explain how the inter-state pass was issued to the legislator from Hisua so that he could travel to Kota to bring back his daughter.“This is not the right time to bring back students from Kota, as the country grapples with the pandemic. This is a fight all have to fight together despite the known hardships, as caution and patience are the two things most required at this juncture,” the chief secretary said.The BJP is part of Bihar’s ruling coalition and the opposition parties played up the issue, accusing the government of double standards.Congress leader Shakti Sinh Gohil alleged the BJP legislator was also provided a government vehicle to travel to Kota. Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said many VIPs had been issued passes in Bhiar, whereas the poor were left to fend for themselves.A senior officer, who declined to be named, said that at a time when air, train and road travel had been stopped across the country, except for essential services, issuing a pass for a person to travel to another state couldn’t be justified. “The axe will fall on some officials,” he said.The Bihar Legislative Assembly also issued a show-cause notice to the driver of the MLA’s vehicle.“The vehicle was provided to the MLA in the capacity of the whip, but how could that vehicle be taken to another state?” said an officer, adding the driver was asked to explain why action should not be taken against him.With the house warming party in Jehanabad creating embarrassment for the state government, the education minister was quick to wash his hands off his personal assistant. The state government ordered the suspension of Jehanabad’s sub-divisional police officer and the circle officer of Makhdumpur.“The law will take its own course. If anything wrong has happened, there will be consequences,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-after-political-row-bihar-cracks-the-whip/story-07Lxx5S1Lu91skwkxqXinN.html
20-04-2020||India||Problems mount for trans people during Covid-19 lockdown||As reports about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) began to make their way into news cycles in February, malicious posters began appearing at bus stops and railway stations in Hyderabad that blamed transgender people for the spread of the virus. While no one knew who printed these posters, their content was disturbing. The posters said HIV-positive transgender people were spreading the virus, and that they ought to be stoned. Transgender activist Vyjayanti Vasantha Mogli said the posters created fear among many people of the community. The only added to the troubles that transgender people already face, she said. As the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown continues, several members of the community said the livelihoods of hundreds of transgender people remain disrupted, with many struggling for their daily needs. Many are worried they will be thrown out by landlords if they are unable to pay rent. And transgender people who are HIV-positive are complaining about difficulty in accessing critical medicines. Cuttack-based transwoman Meghna said food was running out for many members of the community in the state. “Around 70% of the community in Odisha is dependent on begging or sex work, and it is rare that a transperson has savings to fall back on,” she said. Non-governmental organisations and community networks are providing support but that, she said, isn’t enough. “The government needs to provide for us,” she said.R Subrahmanyam, secretary of the ministry of social justice and welfare, said that before the lockdown, the ministry asked 25-odd organisations working for the welfare of the transgender community to identify people with financial constraints. He said 5,000 people were given Rs 1,500 as assistance. “We have also said that, in case, there is anyone looking for more assistance, they need to get in touch with these organisations, who will [work] with us for help,” said Subrahmanyam. Problems have been exacerbated for those who are HIV-positive and need monthly doses of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Mogli said while some don’t have access to medicines, others are facing the problem of having to come out as HIV-positive to caregivers. In addition to that, HIV treatment is only provided by the government to those who are registered with authorities. For those without a valid medical record, said Hyderabad-based Harshini Mekala, a simple HIV test can help. “The test takes about three hours to show if a person is HIV-positive,” said Mekala. Grace Bano, who lives in Tuticorin, said that most transgender people benefiting from social schemes are based in urban areas.“Several transgender people, including those who are HIV-positive, are suffering in villages. We had to run a campaign to reach out to 250 people in Tamil Nadu alone,” she said. An HIV-positive transwoman living in Mumbai, who is a volunteer with the government and has arranged doses for a few months from the ART centre for those registered with the government, said on condition of anonymity: “For those from states who had to stay back in other states they were visiting, there is no availability of medicines.” Amit Kumar of the All India Sex Workers Network, a collective representing more than 500,000 sex workers, said transgender sex workers are more vulnerable.“Access to social schemes is more limited for them,” he said, adding some people in the network rely on the monthly grant of Rs 500 in their Jan Dhan accounts. The network had written to the National AIDS Control Organisation for assistance, especially for those from the trans-community. The HIV-positive transwoman in Mumbai said that in her area, only 70 out of the 500-odd transgender people have managed to get funds from the social justice ministry, and some are relying on Jan Dhan accounts for sustenance. Mogli said in several states, different schemes help transgender people in different ways. But several schemes require proof of identity. “Several people have papers prior to their coming out, and these papers are in a different name and of a different sex,” she said.She said among the steps the government needs to take is a rent moratorium for a few months for the community so that they aren’t thrown out of rented accommodation. “The government should also provide rations and cash for those in the community who are starving,” she added. Ayushman Bharat too must provide cover for Covid-19, especially for transgender people, she said. For states such as Telangana, which do not implement the Central scheme, state welfare measures should provide cover, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/problems-mount-for-trans-people-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-CcErvDMwKsjEVMpm0tNXxI.html
20-04-2020||India||Flight restrictions to be lifted when Covid-19 is controlled: Government||Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said on Monday restrictions on passenger flights will be lifted only when the Centre is confident that the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been controlled. He added that no decision has been taken to restart flights.Puri’s comments came a day after aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) asked airlines not to accept bookings until further notice. DGCA said none of its circulars regarding the extension of lockdown allowed airlines to restart the bookings for journeys from May 4.Several airlines, Indigo and Vistara, stopped advance bookings after the order. The government has extended the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to May 3. “I want to once again say that flight restrictions that are in place as a result of India’s fight against COVID19 will be lifted once we are confident that spread of the virus has been controlled & it poses no danger to our country & people,” Puri tweeted.“Since some airlines did not heed our advisory & opened bookings & started collecting money from flyers, a directive was issued to them on 19th April restraining them from doing so,” he said in another tweet. The minister said airlines were informed that they will be given sufficient notice and time to commence bookings.The Centre also issued an advisory on 17 April asking domestic and foreign airline operators to issue full refund for bookings till May 3. The advisory was only for those passengers who booked flights during the first lockdown period (March 25-April 14).Authorities clarified that the order did not apply to passengers who booked flights prior to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flight-restrictions-to-be-lifted-when-covid-19-is-controlled-government/story-KICZrqdjadaf6MhiSOdU4M.html

20-04-2020||India||China sends 24 flights with Covid-19 medical supplies, 20 more this week||Chinese companies are expected to send about 20 planeloads of Covid-19-related medical supplies to India over the next one week, a senior government official said.Requests for these flights between April 21 and 27 have been placed with the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the official said. The continuing cooperation is seen as a signal that the two countries are in sync on the Covid-19 battle despite some concerns that led India to impose restrictions on foreign takeover of Indian companies.Over the last two weeks beginning April 4, around 24 flights have taken off from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xi’an and Hong Kong to India carrying 390 tonnes of medical supplies.These include RT-PCR test kits, Rapid Antibody tests, thermometers, personal protection equipment.According to information compiled by the external affairs ministry, the major consignees were Imperial Life Sciences, HLL, Matrix Labs, Invex Healthcare, Max and companies of the Reliance, Tata, Adani group. There were four state governments in this list too: Karnataka, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.The consignments from China included the 650,000 testing kits received in two cargo flights last week. Officials had then said that Chinese companies have been contracted for nearly 15 million PPE kits and 1.5 million rapid testing kits by the government and private firms.Indian ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, last week described facilitating India’s imports of Covid-19-related medical equipment and keeping the drug production supply chain open the “best” signal from China for bilateral ties.India had also sent a plane load of medical equipment to China’s coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan when the crisis was at its peak in the neighbouring country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-sends-24-flights-with-covid-19-medical-supplies-20-more-this-week/story-EXhtQdMSMgKd6ptETBX4yK.html

Till now, eight police staff from the same police station have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Delhi Police.Central Delhi’s Chandni Mahal police station was sealed on Thursday after two constables posted there tested positive for Covid-19 on the same day. Following the diagnosis, at least 26 other police personnel, including the station house officer, were quarantined.This was the first police station in the Capital to be sealed. Chandni Mahal was earlier declared a containment zone by the Delhi government that had placed severe restrictions on its residents, after many people from the area tested positive for the infectious disease. Security was beefed up in Chandni Mahal, a few hours after it was declared as one of the capital’s containment zones late on April 10 by the Delhi government.The administration has sanitised the entire area and is providing door-to-door delivery of essential commodities to the residents.Earlier, Deputy Commissioner of Police [DCP] (central) Sanjay Bhatia had said that the two constables lived in the barracks inside the station because of which such an action was needed. Bhatia said the other police personnel of the station will now be working from the nearby Jama Masjid police station.With 110 new Covid-19 cases and 2 deaths in the national capital on Sunday, Delhi’s count of coronavirus positive cases has already crossed the 2000 mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-more-police-staff-from-delhi-s-chandni-mahal-station-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-k1ogNMqyitwpgIwyh1I5AL.html
20-04-2020||India||Nothing communal about Palghar lynching, says Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday warned of strict action against those trying to give a religious colour to the lynching of three men in Palghar last week.Thackeray said he has spoken to Union home minister Amit Shah and apprised him of the details of the case.“Even Amit Shahji knows that the incident had no religious connection as the village in which the incident took place has no such background. I have requested him to take strict action against people trying to spread communal tension using social media,” Thackeray said on Facebook Live.“We too are taking action against the bid to arouse religious sentiments using the incident,” he added.Two sadhus or Hindu ascetics and their driver were lynched to death by a huge mob outside Gadhchinchale village, 110km from Palghar, on April 16 on the suspicion of being child-lifters. Also read: Mistaken for thieves, 3 lynched to death by 200-strong mob in Maharashtra’s PalgharIt later emerged the sadhus—70-year-old Swami Kalpvriksha Giri and 35-year-old Sushil Giri—belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were on their way to Gujarat to attend the last rite of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri. Asserting that nobody involved in the Palghar mob lynching incident would be spared, the chief minister announced a high-level probe by Criminal Investigation Department’s (CID) chief Atulchandra Kulkarni.The Sena chief also listed the action taken by his government against those accused of being a part of the mob. “The police have already arrested more than 100 suspects, including five key accused responsible for the incident. The key accused have been given police custody till April 30,” he said. “We have suspended two policemen holding them responsible for the incident. Nobody involved in this heinous crime will be spared,” he added.He also said the two sadhus had reached Union territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli but were not allowed by local authorities to enter their area and hence were returning through internal roads.“The persons killed were sent back from the border of the Dadra Nagar Haveli amid the lockdown restrictions. Had they been given shelter by the authorities or coordinated with us, this could have been averted,” he said.Thackeray, who also spoke in Hindi, said he has also spoken to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath over the incident. Adityanath had called Thackeray urging him to take strict action against those involved in the lynching of three men in Palghar district.Taking a potshot at the leaders of the opposition Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), who have attacked the government for the incident, Thackeray reminded them about incidents of mob lynching during the government under Devendra Fadnavis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-communal-about-palghar-lynching-says-uddhav-thackeray/story-wlvkJUPFJmcxwm4hKPd7NP.html

The Unified Commanders Conference (UCC) was supposed to take place on April 22-23.The UCC was to be chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by national security adviser Ajit Doval, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, the three service chiefs and a battery of senior officers of the armed forces and the ministry. Fresh dates are yet to be announced.The army had earlier indefinitely deferred a conference of its top commanders that was scheduled to take place in Delhi from April 13 to April 18.Such top conferences covers key issues such as the country’s security dynamics, emerging security scenarios, enhancing operational capability, taking steps to stay prepared for all challenges and budgetary aspects. Issues related to theaterisation would have also been discussed but the coronavirus outbreak has put many things on hold.The conferences were to take place at a time when there has been an unusual spike in ceasefire violations on the Line of Control by the Pakistan army to help infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the army was carrying out “targeted strikes” on terror launch pads along the LoC and eliminating the Pakistani infiltrators before they cross over to the Indian side.Singh, in an interview to PTI, said the armed forces are not lowering their guard at all while playing a significant role in the country’s overall fight to defeat the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-military-conference-deferred-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-wrexS6MY0DY9TUEogD9qrO.html
20-04-2020||India||Man stopped by cops for violating lockdown in Andhra’s Guntur, dies||A 28-year-old man died of cardiac failure when he was allegedly beaten up by the police for violating the lockdown in Sattenapalli town of Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district on Monday morning, his family members said.The deceased was identified as Mohammad Ghouse, and had been suffering from cardio-vascular disease. “He went out to get medicines from a nearby medical shop, when the police stopped him at the local check post and thrashed him on his back. He collapsed immediately,” his father Md Adeem told reporters.The police themselves shifted him to the local government hospital, where he succumbed while undergoing treatment.Guntur range Inspector General of police K Prabhakar Rao announced suspension of Sattenapalli town sub-inspector of police Ramesh Babu. A case of death under unnatural circumstances (Section 174 of Indian Penal Code) was registered in the incident.The IG also ordered a magisterial inquiry into the allegations of high-handed behaviour of the SI.Rao, however, said according to preliminary inquiries, the SI had not beaten Ghouse, but only asked the latter to show a prescription since he was going to the medical shop. “Even as the SI was questioning him, Ghouse developed palpitation and collapsed there itself. He was taken to the nearby hospital, where the paramedical staff tried to resuscitate him, but he succumbed within minutes,” the IG said..The death of the Muslim youth led to a tense atmosphere in Sattenapalli town. Hundreds of his relatives and local Muslim organisations staged a demonstration in front of the police station demanding justice for the family and action against police officials who allegedly beat him up.Senior police officials led by Guntur rural SP Vijaya Rao rushed to the town to bring the situation under control. The police officials also assured the family of adequate compensation.The IG said as many as 21 cases of lockdown violations were registered in the last two days in Narsaraopet town hence police were strictly enforcing the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-stopped-by-cops-for-violating-lockdown-in-andhra-s-guntur-dies/story-QJr2xD6IUgkGep47tsGdqL.html

The IMA asked the Centre to enact central law on violence against doctors and hospitals across the nation.“Our legitimate needs for safe workplaces have to be met. Abuse and violence should stop immediately,” the IMA stated.The IMA stated that doctors and medical professionals across the country will light a candle at 9 pm on April 22 as protest and vigil against the violence and abuse. The IMA termed it as ‘White Alert’ to the nation.#IMA demands Special Central Law Against Violence on Doctor’s & Declares White Alert to the nation on 22.04.2020 & Black Day on 23.04.2020. pic.twitter.com/inFOSiJusIIt said that doctors across the country will work with black badges on April 23 and declare it as ‘Black Day’ if the government fails to enact central law on violence against doctors and hospitals. “The IMA has maintained utmost restraint and patience inspite of extreme provocations. Doctors have been abused, beaten up, denied entry and residence. Obstruction to cremation is the last straw that IMA can bear,” a statement released by the IMA read.Last week, residents of a Chennai locality protested against the cremation of a doctor from Andhra Pradesh who died of coronavirus in the city, saying it might lead to the spread of coronavirus in their locality, news agency PTI reported.Following the resistance, the doctor’s body was taken back to the hospital mortuary and was later cremated at another locality.Earlier this week, the Federation of Resident Doctors Association wrote to home minister Amit Shah, expressing concern over the attacks on doctors and medical staff at Lok Nayak Hospital in the national Capital and other states such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana.In a series of tweets, lawyer Sonali Jaitley Bakshi said her father, late Union minister Arun Jaitley, wanted to pursue the formation of a law to deal with the violence against health workers.This comes when the nation battles the coronavirus crisis with doctors and medical professionals in the frontline of the challenge. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-warns-of-white-alert-black-day-over-violence-against-doctors/story-dZWief0bLk164WurbDl6jK.html
20-04-2020||India||Indian Army soldiers to be placed under ‘green, yellow, red’ categories to prevent spread of Covid-19||The Indian Army on Monday came out with a fresh of instructions for soldiers who have completed their leaves, temporary duties and courses, and are required to rejoin their units on priority. According to the instructions, the top priority bracket includes soldiers whose units or duty stations are within 500km by private transport from their place of leave, all ranks of the operationally-critical Northern Command and personnel belonging to Army Medical Corps, Army Dental Corps and Military Nursing Service who are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The second highest priority for rejoining duty has been accorded to “all ranks of Eastern Command plus officers and key appointments of other Commands as decided by the respective Commands.”“The guidelines for rejoining have been planned in a phased manner considering the numbers of individuals rejoining from leave/temporary duty/courses and the requirement for smooth reporting, quarantine and onward dispersal to units,” two senior army officers said.The new orders said soldiers would rejoin duties only on the receipt of specific instructions from their units, formations and establishments. “Any individual whose leave station is within 500km of unit/duty station is allowed to directly report to unit using private transport only. Those who are not within the 500km limit will report to nearest unit/station headquarters in private vehicle only,” the instructions said.With Covid-19 cases spreading at a fast rate across the country, the army said all its personnel be classified as ‘green’ (who have completed 14 days of quarantine), ‘yellow’ (those who need to undergo 14 days quarantine) and lastly, ‘red’ (who are symptomatic and require isolation and further treatment in Covid hospitals).“All personnel reporting back from leave, temporary duty and courses will be classified as ‘yellow’ and will undergo 14 days quarantine at the reporting station/unit. They will subsequently be moved from reporting station to duty stations and units in army vehicles, special trains, etc.,” the instructions said. The army clarified in case such personnel do not move under the supervision of military authorities, they will continue to be considered ‘yellow’ and would have to undergo a 14-day quarantine again.According to the instructions, Indian Army soldiers from Nepal who are on leave will remain at their home stations till the situation in the neighbouring country stabilises or the government opens the border for the movement of personnel. “Requisite move instructions will accordingly be passed to such personnel from their parent units, headquarters and establishments,” the instructions said.The army clarified that the latest instructions will not apply to soldiers in hotspots or containment zones. “Individuals in hotspots/containment zones will follow strict ‘no movement’ till the areas are de-notified. The leave-granting authorities will decide on the use of the exception of areas officially declared as hotspots/containment zones by the central/state government,” the instructions said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-soldiers-to-be-placed-under-green-yellow-red-categories-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19/story-07zKVNFbu1K7hYpJCmaAcJ.html

It is the highest number of positive cases in a 24-hoiur span in the state.The three casualties were spread across Anantapur, Kurnool and Krishna. Earlier, too, there was a death reported from Kurnool on Saturday night.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.Among the 75 new cases that were reported in the last 24 hours, 25 cases were reported from Chittoor, 20 from Guntur and 16 from Kurnool, besides five from Krishna, four from Anantapur, three from Kadapa and two from East Godavari.The bulletin claimed that so far 92 people have been discharged from hospitals after they were completely cured of Covid-19. “Setting aside 20 deaths, there are at present 610 active cases in the state,” the bulletin said.Telangana also reported three deaths and 18 new cases as on Sunday night.

20-04-2020||India||Aggressive tackling of Covid-19 cases needed to prevent 2nd wave: Research paper||A working paper by a team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) suggests that there will be a second wave of Covid-19 infection unless new cases are aggressively traced, localised and isolated.The paper, released on Sunday evening, looks at various scenarios in which a lockdown is lifted in cities affected by Covid-19 infections. It also considers the most restrictive scenario when the lockdown continues to be imposed indefinitely: lockdown until May 31; lockdown until May 3 as currently planned etc. In all cases, researchers have considered infected cases are being isolated with 90% compliance.Researchers have then modelled the impact of nine interventions on infections in Mumbai and Bengaluru. These interventions include only case isolation; social distancing of those aged 65 years and above; lockdown for 26 days; lockdown for 40 days; lockdown continues; phased emergence from lockdown with various restrictions. Based on demographic data of Mumbai and Bengaluru, the team found that if the lockdown were to continue indefinitely, the number of Covid-19 fatalities in Mumbai till September are likely to be a fraction compared to no intervention scenario. The fatalities reduce to 530 as compared to 27790 in the no intervention scenario. If the lockdown were to be lifted on April 20 and people returned to normal activities, the number of fatalities will still rise, but slowly. Even if the lockdown were to be lifted only after May 3, the relaxation of restrictions will lead to fatality numbers going as high as with no-interventions, but gradually. “This delay may allow better mobilisation of resources for aggressive testing, tracking, and containment that can change the course of the epidemic,” the paper said.Bengaluru offers a similar scenario. If the lockdown were to continue indefinitely, the number of Covid-19 fatalities in the city are likely be far fewer: 30 compared to 21,200 in the no intervention scenario. These projections were made until September 2, 2020, for Mumbai and July 22, 2020, for Bengaluru, according to Rajesh Sundaresan, corresponding author of the paper.The team of researchers has arrived at these trends based on a simulation of the infection spread in Bengaluru and Mumbai using a model, which builds a fine-grained replica of a city, and mimics various interaction spaces, such as households, schools and workplaces, according to a statement by IISc.“If there are 10 million people in Bengaluru, the city’s model also has that many individuals,” said Sundaresan, Professor at the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering at IISc, in the statement. He added that the model also takes into account population densities, age distribution, household size distribution, commute distances and several other parameters.“We have to increase identification of cases by active case finding and enhanced testing, ensure isolation and quarantine and continue proper physical distancing, cough etiquette, respiratory hygiene. We have to get used to the new normal now or cases will rise steadily. Plans will have to be developed for migration, transit inter and intra districts and states after lockdown also,” said Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressive-tackling-of-covid-19-cases-needed-to-prevent-2nd-wave-research-paper/story-4Z7o4P4L773XKUxi2oKb4M.html
20-04-2020||India||‘We shut ourselves out’: 9 members of a family recover from Covid-19||On the night of April 17, Anit Thapa, chairman of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration that administers the hill region in north Bengal announced, “Today officially Kalimpong is a zero Covid district and I would like to thank the people of GTA region, the hospital nurses and doctors, the respiratory therapists who helped all of us to fight this pandemic.”The reason he was able to make this declaration was because all members of the Singh family that had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 3, were finally discharged on Friday evening. Nine members and a domestic help were admitted to the hospital, turning the hill district of Kalimpong into a Covid-19 hotspot. The Singhs — 12 of them — lived across three homes in Siliguri and Kalimpong, 65 kilometres away.On March 30, a 49-year-old woman died due to Covid-19 at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, two days after she was detected as being positive for coronavirus. This alerted the authorities to test the other members of her family: nine of them tested positive, including the woman’s husband, son, daughter, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two toddler grand-nieces. Five were released earlier in the week, while the remaining four were discharged on Friday. The domestic help of the family was discharged as well. All the 41 persons who had been sent to quarantine centres after coming into contact with the family and the domestic help have been released.The 49-year-old had returned from Chennai accompanied by her 20-year-old daughter, who studies mass communication and journalism in the southern capital. They landed at Bagdogra airport, paid a visit to the Siliguri residence of her nephew, and then travelled home to their Kalimpong residence where five other members of the family, including the woman’s husband and son reside.Sneha, a second-year college student in Chennai, said her mother was the only one who showed severe symptoms. “In reality, all the family members, except for my mother, showed very little symptoms.”“The first thing I did after receiving the news of my aunt-in-law’s death was to go to the room of her son and daughter and tell them that I was their mother from that day,” Julie Singh, a family member, recalled.Within hours of the 49-year-old woman’s death, the administration took all other members of the family, and the domestic helps, who were already in home quarantine at that time, to a government centre. Three days later, on April 3, all members of the family, except Julie and her husband, Ajay, tested positive. However, Julie’s three-year-old daughter had tested positive, so Julie accompanied all the members of the family to the private hospital, where they were kept.“We all uninstalled Facebook from our phones to shut ourselves from the outside world. We watched movies and listened to music on YouTube,” said Sneha.“We had to accept whatever had happened as the law of nature,” she added.“You can imagine the situation,” Ajay, the nephew of the deceased, and who lived with her, said. “My aunt had just died and nine members of the family landed in hospital. My daughter is three-year-old and my niece is six months older than she is. My father is a patient of kidney transplant. My mother was shell-shocked with the news of my aunt’s death. My cousins had just lost their mother. One of them is still a minor. Whom could I not attend to? And how could I attend to so many of them while myself being in quarantine?” he said.Julie, his wife, would meet the other members of her family in the hospital wearing Personal Protective Equipment, as she herself was not infected with the virus, but was staying there to look after her young daughter, who was infected. She shared Buddhist chants with her family members. “For most of the time in the hospital, I meditated,” she said. “My husband also asked all our relatives and family members to keep calling my parents to keep them engaged and motivated.” “I kept receiving calls from family friends throughout the day. They also shared on WhatsApp different news of people’s recovery. All these mattered in those times, as I was really worried about my husband and the two grandnieces,” Manju Devi Singh, Ajay’s mother who was also hospitalised, said.With all members of the family now discharged, “finally, we are happy that the storm is over and the family is united all over again,” Sneha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-shut-ourselves-out-9-members-of-a-family-recover-from-covid-19/story-og2nz0BT9O0Jm0RPpqU8VO.html

20-04-2020||India||Flight restrictions to be lifted when Covid-19 is controlled: Govt||The restrictions on domestic and international flight operations will be lifted when the government is confident that spread of the novel coronavirus has been controlled, and poses no danger to Indians, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday, amidst reports of some airlines doing open bookings.In a series of tweets, the minister also said a directive was issued on Sunday to airlines, restraining them from doing open bookings since they did not heed to government’s advice in the matter.“I want to once again say that flight restrictions that are in place as a result of India’s fight against COVID-19 will be lifted once we are confident that spread of the virus has been controlled and it poses no danger to our country and people,” he tweeted. The minister said,”since some airlines did not heed our advisory and opened bookings, and started collecting money from flyers, a directive was issued to them on 19th April restraining them from doing so. They were also informed that they will be given sufficient notice and time to commence bookings.” While government-run Air India stopped the bookings after the government’s advisory, private carriers ignored it and continued taking bookings for travel after May 3, prompting the aviation regulator DGCA to issue a circular on Sunday. “All airlines are hereby directed to refrain from booking tickets... Further, the airlines may note that they shall be given sufficient notice and time for restarting operations,” the circular said.All domestic and international commercial passenger flights have been suspended for the lockdown period. However, cargo flights and special flights, permitted by the DGCA, can fly during the duration of the lockdown.Meanwhile, several passengers have posted their complaints on social media against Indian airlines for not refunding booking amounts for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus lockdown, and instead issuing credit vouchers for future travel.On April 16, the aviation ministry said that passengers can ask airlines for full refunds if the bookings were done during the first phase of lockdown for travel up to May 3.  However, the government has not taken any decision so far on whether full refunds should be issued to passengers who booked their tickets before the lockdown began for travel during the March 25-May 3 period.  The first phase of the lockdown was from March 25 to April 14, and was later extended by 19 days till May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flight-restrictions-to-be-lifted-when-covid-19-is-controlled-govt/story-IJXVmNRjO58kFXIrv79TXN.html

20-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Northeast reports fewer cases, Manipur has no new positive case as of Sunday||On Sunday, Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh took to Twitter to make an announcement: his state, which was the first from the Northeast to report a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive case, is free from the viral outbreak, albeit temporarily.“I am glad to share that Manipur is now coronavirus free. Both patients have fully recovered and have tested negative. There are no fresh cases of the virus in the state. This has been possible because of the cooperation of the public and medical staff and the strict enforcement of lockdown restrictions,” he tweeted.Manipur, as well as the region’s first Covid-19 patient, was a 23-year-old girl, who had tested positive in March upon her return from the United Kingdom (UK). She was discharged from the hospital on April 12 after she recovered from the viral infection, the CM said.On Sunday, the second patient from Manipur, a 65-year-old man, who returned to the state after attending the Tablighi Jamaat’s international congregation held at Nizamuddin in Delhi between March 13 and 15, was also declared to have recovered.The region’s other states, which have recorded fewer cases in comparison to most parts of the country, are also announcing the recovery of their patients.The seven states from the Northeast, excluding Sikkim, have reported 52 Covid-19 positive cases to date. Assam topped the list with 35 cases, followed by Meghalaya at 11. Currently, Assam has 15 active cases and has also reported one death, a Jamaat follower.“The lone Covid-19 positive person of Arunachal Pradesh has now been declared virus-free,” state CM Pema Khandu tweeted last Friday.“The process of discharging patients would continue and by the end of April we hope to release all Covid-19 patients from our hospitals,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday. Around 82% of cases in Assam are asymptomatic, the minister said. “Earlier, we were collecting only throat swabs for tests, but now on we will be taking both throat and nasal swabs to ensure that there is better monitoring,” Sarma said. Assam is also planning to use rapid testing kits in government-run hospitals to ensure that there is faster detection of cases after the kits are made available. The state has tested over 4,800 samples and the rate of testing has been 120 people per million. Tripura had recorded two Covid-19 positive cases and last week one of them -- a 45-year-old woman with a travel history to Guwahati -- was discharged from hospital. The other patient, a Tripura State Rifles jawan, is recovering well and is likely to be discharged soon.Mizoram was the second state in the region to record a Covid-19 case when a 50-year-old pastor, who had travelled to the Netherlands, tested Covid-19 positive on March 24, a day after the first case from the region in Manipur was reported.“There is good news, as there is considerable improvement in the patient. He has no fever and we hope that he will fully recover within a few days,” Mizoram health minister R Lalthangliana told HT over the phone from the state capital Aizawl.Nagaland has a unique distinction of its lone patient getting transferred to Assam’s tally. The 33-year-old Dimapur-based businessman was first listed in Nagaland’s tally but later transferred to Assam, as he tested Covid-19 positive in Guwahati. Meghalaya was the last state in the region to record a Covid-19 positive case after a 69-year-old doctor from the state capital, Shillong, contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, on April 13. Though the doctor died later, 10 people, including his family members and assistants, have tested Covid-19 positive. These are the only Covid-19 active cases in Meghalaya.Most states in the Northeast had sealed their interstate borders and also with neighbouring Bangladesh and Myanmar prior to the Central government’s move to initially implement a 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak from March 25 and further extend it by another 19 days till May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-has-no-covid-19-case-as-of-sunday-says-cm-biren-singh/story-sfBnD2QbbIK4Aq5rxW2kLO.html

20-04-2020||India||China seeks FDI policy revision aimed at shielding Indian firms’ takeover||China on Monday asked India to revise what it described as a “discriminatory” change in foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations aimed at preventing opportunistic takeovers of Indian firms amid the Covid-19 crisis.The Indian government brought China under the ambit of regulations preventing such takeovers and acquisitions on Friday, with authorities saying any Chinese investments would now require the government’s approval. The revision of the FDI policy came close on the heels of China’s central bank buying a 1.01% stake in HDFC in the first quarter of 2020.“We hope India would revise relevant discriminatory practices, treat investments from different countries equally, and foster an open, fair and equitable business environment,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement that was Beijing’s first formal response to the tweak in India’s FDI regulations.Ji said the “additional barriers” set by India for “investors from specific countries violate WTO’s principle of non-discrimination, and go against the general trend of liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment”.The Chinese side also contended the changes in India’s FDI rules “do not conform to the consensus of G20 leaders and trade ministers to realise a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open”.There was no immediate response to Ji’s remarks from Indian officials though people familiar with developments said the Indian government couldn’t allow vulnerabilities created by the Covid-19 pandemic to be exploited by any country, including China.Also Watch | Chinese threat amid Covid impact: Why India changed FDI rules One of the people cited above, on condition of anonymity, said: “A pre-emptive action was needed to protect Indian assets from hostile acquisitions and takeovers, particularly start-ups that have little money power. The necessity is not just felt by India, but many other countries, including powerful G20 nations, which have expressed serious concerns about Chinese designs.”The person added: “The actions of Chinese investors, with tacit backup from their government, are not fair business as usual. Hence there is a need to protect our domestic interests.”The people said there was no bar on the entry of Chinese firms into India or investments by them, but all proposals will have to go through the government.“This is not just targeted at China but all countries that share borders with India. It is surprising why China is so perturbed, if it believes in ethical business,” the person cited above said.Earlier, only investments from Pakistan and Bangladesh required the Indian government’s approval for security reasons. Without naming China, an order issued by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) on April 17 said the scope of the policy had been widened to cover all neighbouring countries that share a border with India.Ji noted that China’s cumulative investment in India exceeded $8 billion as of December 2019, “far more than the total investments of India’s other border-sharing countries”. She added, “The impact of the policy on Chinese investors is clear.”The revision of the foreign investment policy by the DPIIT will make it “much difficult for companies from countries sharing land border with India, including China, to invest in the country”, Ji said.Ji contended Chinese investments have “driven the development of India’s industries, such as mobile phone, household electrical appliances, infrastructure and automobile, creating a large number of jobs in India, and promoting [mutually] beneficial and win-win cooperation”.She also noted that Chinese enterprises were actively making donations to help India fight Covid-19 and sought to urge India to create a “favourable investment environment” that would help drive recovery after the pandemic.“Where companies choose to invest and operate depends on the country’s economic fundamentals and business environment. Facing the economic downturn caused by Covid-19, countries should work together to create a favourable investment environment to speed up the resumption of companies’ production and operation,” Ji said.The Indian government’s tweak in FDI rules followed concerns that Chinese firms, including its mammoth state-run companies, could take over Indian companies at a time when their valuation has taken a massive hit because of the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic that originated in Wuhan nearly four months ago.According to the DPIIT’s order, “an entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route”. The order also requires the government’s approval for transferring ownership of an Indian company to any “existing or future” foreign investor belonging to the countries that share a border with India.Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar share borders with India, but there are some exemptions for Nepal and Bhutan-based entities.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had on April 12 cautioned the government against takeover threats. “The massive economic slowdown has weakened many Indian corporates making them attractive targets for takeovers. The government must not allow foreign interests to take control of any Indian corporate at this time of national crisis,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-seeks-revision-of-fdi-policy-aimed-at-protecting-indian-firms-from-takeovers/story-Jx5jw68fLMFaVuBAoz9kIO.html

A government source told Hindustan Times that the decision to quickly modify 25 such vans had been taken.The government targets close to 40,000 rapid tests in these containment zones over the next 3-4 days.Two vans will be assigned to each of Delhi’s 11 districts; the other three will be kept on standby at the headquarters.The decision was taken a day after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed concern that 186 people who had been infected by Sars-Cov-2 on Saturday were asymptomatic. This has reinforced suspicions that “silent spreaders” were unknowingly infecting others, and underlined the need for extensive testing to isolate such patients.Also Watch | Covid-19 | ‘Delhi received 42,000 rapid testing kits, trial run initiated’: Satyendar Jain The Delhi government has not eased any restrictions clamped under the national lockdown because the city-state is seen as a “high-risk zone”. All 11 revenue districts in the state are now designated as virus hot spots. The government will review this situation on April 27.A top government official said the large number of positive cases had convinced the city government to go in for extensive testing. The availability of the testing kits had made this possible.Of the asymptomatic patients who had tested positive yesterday, the official said 35 cases were reported from Tilak Nagar, 30 from Tughlakabad Extension, 5 from Nabi Karim, 3 from Sadar Bazar and 2 more from Nizamuddin.These prisoner vans will go into the containment zones with police cover.In case there is resistance or untoward incidents, the possibility of deploying para-military forces is not ruled outThere is some concern in the Delhi government that there were instances where police officers aren’t as proactive as the city administration would like them to be after the Chandni Mahal police station chief and some other personnel tested positive. The government had responded to this concern by extending Rs 1 crore ex-gratia cover to police personnel also besides asking them to take all precautions in handling people in Covid-19 hotspots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-testing-for-covid-19-in-delhi-ordered-25-prisoner-vans-will-be-mobile-labs/story-CE6i6PiC0WekJPHFTvNL0H.html

20-04-2020||India||5 times India dissed Pakistan’s propaganda during Covid-19 crisis||India has responded sharply to Pakistan government’s allegations of discrimination against Muslims, insisting that it was the Imran Khan government’s effort to divert attention from Islamabad’s poor way of handling its internal affairs.This isn’t the first time that India has panned Pakistan during the humanitarian crisis due to Covid-19 that has killed more than 1.5 lakh people across the world and infected over two million. In recent weeks, India has also noted renewed attempts by Pakistan-backed terrorists groups to infiltrate into India.Here are five such incidents during the Covid-19 crisis:April 19, 2020: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) slammed the remarks made by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan where he accused the government in India of discriminating against the Muslims. The MEA said such remarks were an attempt to shift focus from Islamabad’s “abysmal handling” of its internal affairs. Khan had compared the Indian government’s treatment of Muslims to “what Nazis did to Jews in Germany”.April 17, 2020: Army Chief General MM Naravane said that during such time when India is sending is medical teams and exporting medicines to the world to battle coronavirus, Pakistan is exporting terror. “It is unfortunate that while the world has got together to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, our neighbour has resorted to firing heavy calibre artillery and killing of innocent people, including an eight-year-old boy to garner international attention,” he said during his visit to the forward posts in Jammu and Kashmir. His remarks came after a series of ceasefire violation incidents, especially in the Keran sector of the union territory in which eight civilians and five soldiers were killed in two weeks.April 10, 2020: India took a jibe at Pakistan over its opposition to New Delhi’s leadership in dealing with the crisis in SAARC region. New Delhi said the degree of seriousness of each member nation of the SAARC in collectively fighting the coronavirus pandemic can be gauged by their behaviour. The reaction came a day after Pakistan pledged to contribute US $3 million to the SAARC Coronavirus Emergency Fund as proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but demanded that any initiative to deal with the situation must be brought under the bloc’s framework.April 4, 2020: India once against hit out at Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for commenting on domicile rules for Kammu and Kashmir, saying repeated attempts to interfere in India’s internal affairs will not make its “untenable” claims acceptable. In its response, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that Pakistan has no locus standi whatsoever on any aspect pertaining to it. Khan had criticised India’s new domicile rules for Jammu and Kashmir, calling them an attempt to alter the demography of the union territory.March 16, 2020: India slammed Pakistan for raising the Kashmir issue during a video conference between SAARC countries to discuss ways to tackle the deadly coronavirus disease Covid-19. The government said that Pakistan’s attempts to politicise a humanitarian issue by its unwarranted statement on Kashmir during the video conference on coronavirus reflected very poorly on it. Speaking further on the SAARC emergency fund, the MEA said: “Where India is concerned, the commitment made by the Prime Minister is today in an advanced stage of implementation. Assistance in material and services has been extended to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. These SAARC countries have also made early commitments to the fund.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-times-india-dissed-pakistan-s-propaganda-during-covid-19-crisis/story-3OmGtHqjvYUDXIb3xF76yL.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown 2.0: Areas where eateries are open from today||As announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address last week, states across the country will partially lift curbs on coronavirus lockdown from today. However, some states like Delhi, Punjab, Telangana and Karnataka have decided not to ease the lockdown restrictions until May 3. On Sunday, Telangana became the first state to extend the lockdown till May 7. With partial ease in lockdown restrictions across the country, are eateries operational in certain areas?In its revised guidelines on activities and operations exempted during the lockdown period from April 20, the Ministry of Home Affairs had said that dhabas (eating joints) along the highways will be allowed to operate from April 20 “with a stipulated minimum distance”.The MHA said that bars and restaurants across the country will remain shut until the lockdown ends on May 3. The Kerala government, however, announced that hotels and eateries will be operational in 10 of its 14 districts from Monday - a move the Centre has objected to. The government has eased restrictions for districts falling in ‘orange’ and ‘green’ zones. The easing of curbs will not apply to four districts that fall in the ‘red zone’ - Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode and Malappuram. Restaurants in Kerala’s ‘orange’ and ‘zone’ will remain functional till 7pm with social distancing norms in observance. “People will have to keep it in mind it is a temporary arrangement so we expect responsible behaviour. We advise people to come out if it is necessary only,” said state director general of police Loknath Behra.E-commerce platforms across the country are allowed to sell essential commodities such as food, pharmaceutical and medical devices during the lockdown, the MHA said last week. Food delivery options will be available in non coronavirus affected areas during the lockdown. Telangana, however, has announced that food delivery mobile applications will not be allowed to operate in the state from today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-2-0-are-eateries-open-in-your-area-from-today/story-xdfUGo2aYj3hwp4IaudIJO.html

He said he went for a surprise inspection.“I am the excise minister of state and Raigarh district is the neighbouring district of Mahasamund where I am the minister in-charge. I got information that illegal sale of liquor is going on in Raigarh district, hence I went for a surprise visit. Since a mahatma was also staying in the same area I thought I would meet him but due to the outbreak of corona and lockdown, the mahatma also refused to meet me. Therefore I returned. Now, the media is misquoting me which is not correct,” said Lakhma while speaking to HT.Lakhma further added that saving peoples’ lives is the priority of our government.“We are not in a hurry to take any decision regarding the lockdown because this government is of common man. Presently, the lives of the people are important,” said Lakhma answering a question.When asked about supplying liquor online after lockdown, Lakhma said, “We are thinking on both online and shop distribution. We will see when the time comes.”Meanwhile, on Sunday evening, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said his government has been considering restarting a lot of economic activities in the state from Monday. The MNREGA work has been resumed in several villages.In his video address to people of the state, Baghel underlined that Chhattisgarh has set an example before the whole country for effectively controlling the coronavirus pandemic.Expressing gratitude to people for standing by the government in the period of crisis, the chief minister said, “The discipline, strength and grit shown by the people, to tackle the Corona crisis, since last one month, is unique”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-minister-with-convoy-visits-seer-250-km-away-during-lockdown/story-Pa0NXEDnURxY3E0a2QF45I.html
20-04-2020||India||Toll collection resumes on National Highways as per govt directives||Toll collection on National Highways across the country resumed on Monday in line with government directives, a move which is being opposed by transporters. The central government on March 25, had announced temporary suspension of toll collection following directives by the Ministry of Home Affairs in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as well as highway developers resumed collection at toll plazas. Highways developer IRB Infrastructure Developers said all its Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) “have resumed their toll collection from 00.00 hours today” in line with the NHAI directives.Also read: Centre objects to Kerala govt ‘diluting’ lockdown restrictions A spokesperson of IRB Infrastructure Developers said, “we are pleased to have the directives from nodal agencies to resume toll operations. This seems to be a positive sign for the sector, with an indication leaning towards restoration of normalcy in phased manners for the nation.” IRB Infra’s projects SPVs collectively operate 50 toll plazas across India and all have now fully resumed their operations from Monday. In line with NHAI guidelines, all Project SPVs will be taking necessary precautions and care at toll plazas for highway users and employees manning the toll plazas. For this, the company has provided adequate masks, sanitizers, hand gloves, etc. to employees manning the toll plazas. However, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), protested against resumption of toll on national highways and said it will adversely affect rabi crop procurement, adding that over 85 per cent transporters are cash-starved small operators who will not able to sustain toll fee.Also read| Covid-19: These are new lockdown relaxation rules in your state AIMTC, the apex body for transporters that represents about 95 lakh truckers and transport entities, has sought suspension of toll till May 3. “As per inputs received from across the country, procurement of rabi crop will be disturbed, as more than 85 per cent, finance-starved small operators can’t sustain toll burden starting April 20. Tolls must be suspended at least till May 3,” AIMTC President Kultaran Singh Atwal has said seeking the Prime Minister’s Office’s intervention. Atwal has said that more than 85 per cent of the transport fraternity have one to five vehicles and about 65 per cent of them are self-employed owner-drivers. AIMTC Secretary General Naveen Gupta said: “Only 15 per cent of the transporters own big fleets but they are also helpless... some have vehicles transporting essential goods while others are facing shortages of drivers.” He said the transport fraternity is financially broken and does not have finance for operations and bringing back drivers, which is a big challenge. AIMTC has sought a relief package from the government that includes Rs 15,000 per driver per month besides insurance cover to drivers and supporting staff. Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT) Coordinator S P Singh said in the past 21 days, the benefit of toll fee not being levied was hardly being passed on in the form of any reduction in truck rentals across the country. On March, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari had announced: “In view of COVID-19, it has been ordered to temporarily suspend the collection of toll at all toll plazas across India.” This will not only reduce inconvenience to emergency services but also save critical time, he had said. The minister had also said that maintenance of roads and availability of emergency resources at toll plazas will continue as usual. Earlier, the road transport and highways ministry advised the NHAI to follow the home ministry’s guidelines about toll plaza operations following the lockdown. The prevailing condition may be treated as ‘Force Majeure’ for concession or contract agreement in terms of the finance ministry, it had said. The NHAI had rolled out the electronic toll collection programme across India in December on its over 500 toll plazas while doubling toll charges from the vehicles entering FASTag lanes without the tag.

20-04-2020||India||‘Bizarre’: India dismisses Pak PM’s tweet on discrimination against Muslims||India on Sunday rejected criticism by Pakistan’s top leadership of the “deliberate and violent targeting of Muslims”, saying such remarks were an attempt to shift focus from Islamabad’s “abysmal handling” of its internal affairs.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) had criticised what they described as the deliberate targeting of Muslims by the Indian government against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.External Affairs Ministry’s spokesperson Anurag Srivastava rejected the criticism by saying: “The bizarre comments by the Pakistani leadership are an attempt to shift focus from the abysmal handling of their internal affairs. Instead of concentrating on fighting Covid-19, they are making baseless allegations against their neighbours.”In a reference to incidents of the oppression of Pakistan’s Hindu minority, Srivastava said, “On the subject of minorities, they would be well advised to address the concerns of their own dwindling minority communities, which have been truly discriminated against.”Also read: Imran Khan hits mute on Saarc Covid-19 pledge, India sends $1.7 mn reliefKhan had followed up on tweets by the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission of the OIC and compared the Indian government’s treatment of Muslims to “what Nazis did to Jews in Germany”.“The deliberate & violent targeting of Muslims in India by Modi Govt to divert the backlash over its COVID19 policy, which has left thousands stranded & hungry, is akin to what Nazis did to Jews in Germany,” Khan tweeted. The deliberate & violent targeting of Muslims in India by Modi Govt to divert the backlash over its COVID19 policy, which has left thousands stranded & hungry, is akin to what Nazis did to Jews in Gerrmany. Yet more proof of the racist Hindutva Supremacist ideology of Modi Govt.In a tweet, President Arif Alvi, a close aide of Khan, accused the Indian government of suppressing the Kashmiri people through “extreme violence, torture and oppression”.In recent months, Khan has repeatedly criticised the Indian government’s attitude towards the country’s Muslim minority and the external affairs ministry has pushed back against his remarks, describing them as interference in India’s internal affairs. The Indian side has also targeted Khan for failing to counter cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil.The OIC’s Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission had, in a string of tweets, condemned what it described as the “unrelenting vicious Islamophobic campaign in India maligning Muslims for spread of #Covid-19 as well as their negative profiling in media subjecting them to discrimination & violence with impunity”.Also read: Pakistan Supreme Court orders removal of health advisor to PM over Covid-19It urged the “Indian government to take urgent steps to stop the growing tide of #Islamophobia in the country and protect the rights of its persecuted Muslim minority as per its obligations under (international human rights) law”.India’s foreign minister was invited as a special guest to a meeting of foreign ministers of OIC states in the UAE last year, marking a high point in New Delhi’s often testy relations with the Islamic grouping.However, in recent months, the OIC has repeatedly criticised the Indian government’s handling of the situation in Kashmir and attacks on Muslims. The external affairs ministry has rejected this criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bizarre-comments-india-trashes-pak-pm-imran-khan-s-tweet-on-discrimination-against-muslims/story-NVocZ0GH2tSyxEpD4vcf2M.html

The chief minister, however, maintained that no leniency is to be given in areas that are categorised as coronavirus hotspots and containment zones.“All district magistrates should decide at the local-level after seeing the circumstances to give exemption in certain activities during the lockdown, and then inform the state government in this regard,” a statement released by Uttar Pradesh government read. The district officials will work out the modalities regarding opening of specified industries, banks and other units in the 56 districts that have reported less than 10 coronavirus cases.Adityanath said that the district magistrates of 19 sensitive districts and those where there are 10 or more cases of coronavirus must decide carefully and with alertness. “The district magistrates of 19 sensitive districts, where there are 10 or more COVID-19 cases, should also take a decision on the basis of ‘sajagtaa’ (alertness) and ‘satarktaa’ (carefulness).

It has nothing to do with religion. We apologise as some word hurt people’s sentiments. The hospital never intended to hurt anyone’s sentiments,” said Dr Amit Jain, radio oncologist at Valentis Cancer Hospital, as reported by news agency ANI.A case has been registered against the hospital. “We have registered a case. We are taking action as per the evidence available,” said Meerut SSP Ajay Kumar Sahni.The advertisement by Valentis hospital said that in case of emergency, the patient and their attendants will be admitted but they will be tested for Covid-19 immediately. The cost for the test - Rs 4,500 each - will be taken from the patient.The reasons cited by the hospital included the alleged misbehaviour of the members of the Tablighi Jamaat, who, the ad said, had contributed to the spread of coronavirus infection in the country.“This is certainly wrong and we are sending a notice to the administration of the concerned hospital,” Meerut’s Chief Medical Officer Raj Kumar had said on Sunday.

20-04-2020||India||DGCA tells airlines not to resume bookings||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Sunday directed airlines to refrain from resuming online ticket bookings a day after civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri told them to restart the process only after a decision is taken to end the bar on domestic and international flight operations. In a circular, the aviation regulator said that none of its circulars regarding the extension of lockdown allowed airlines to restart the bookings for journeys from May 4. The 21-day lockdown imposed to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic by ensuring social distancing was extended until May 3 last week. The Centre has, however, allowed certain activities particularly in rural areas outside the Covid-19 containment zones from Monday.“It has been brought to notice of all concerned that no decision to commence the operation of domestic/international flights from May 4 has been taken yet. In view of this, all airlines are hereby directed to refrain from booking tickets as described... The airlines may note that they shall be given sufficient notice and time for restarting of operations,” the DGCA circular said.Some airlines, including state-run Air India (AI), opened bookings on select domestic routes from May 4. This prompted Puri to advise them to do so only after the government takes a decision on restarting flight services.“The Ministry of Civil Aviation clarifies that so far no decision has been taken to open domestic or international operations... Airlines are advised to open their bookings only after a decision in this regard has been taken by the government,” Puri said on Saturday.A spokesperson for AI said they had now stopped online bookings. “Even if you see an option to book a flight, one will not be able to go to the payment section.”SpiceJet, GoAir and IndiGo did not respond to repeated attempts for a response to the circular.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-tells-airlines-not-to-resume-bookings/story-OwZ10clQqbe87nf9Ozt20O.html
20-04-2020||India||No more tours, conferences: Lok Sabha secretariat draws austerity plan||Tours by members of Parliament, canteens, conferences and many such expenses may come to a halt as the Lok Sabha secretariat, which runs the lion’s share of the Parliament establishment, has told its staff to not spend more than 20% of its budget in the first quarter (April-June).The Rajya Sabha secretariat, too, will put similar measures in place, officials said. The Lok Sabha secretariat said that only salaries and “extremely urgent” payments will be made in April and told its 2,000-odd staff “not to incur any expenditure without prior approval by their higher authorities.The internal circular, seen by Hindustan Times, said: “No payment other than ‘Salaries’ will be made during the month of April, 2020.” It also said: “Payment on Wages/Professional fee due for the month of April, 2020 will be made on May 1.”Parliament is trying to reduce costs to save money on a central government directive following the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent 40-day lockdown, which is expected to take a heavy toll on the economy. The Lok Sabha was allotted ₹811 crore in this year’s general budget, Rs 44 crore higher than the revised estimate of Rs 766.87 crore in FY 2019-20. But with expenditure being curbed, a large part of the money is expected to remain unspent. The Rajya Sabha has an annual budget of Rs 436 crore.Restrictions on spending by the Lok Sabha secretariat mean that payments to hired agencies, travel to international conferences in the coming days, study tours by parliament panels and rentals for a fleet of cars will stop in the first quarter of the financial year, said two senior officials who requested anonymity.Earlier this month, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu approved a 30% cut in the salaries of MPs, and the government issued an ordinance to stop releasing the annual ₹5 crore in annual Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) funds to individual MPs for two years, diverting the money to expenses related to Covid-19.Apart from the salaries and allowances of MPs, Parliament spends a hefty amount on annual maintenance contracts, canteens, international and domestic conferences, hosting foreign dignitaries, foreign tours of parliamentary delegations, payment to experts for appearing on Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV shows, appointment of consultants and for recruitment.Most of these expenses will stop up to June.The internal said payments other than “medical advance / repairs of important equipment/system/committed expenditure or any other expenditure related to prevention against spread of COVID-19 etc. will be deferred for the remaining quarters of current financial year.”The circular also asked all departments to give “account-wise weekly report on expenditure incurred during the first quarter of financial year 2020-21” to internal auditors.Parliament complex will reopen to its staff on Monday but only a limited number of employees are required to attend office. A separate circular has also given details of the restricted number of gates, toilets and lifts that will be open for the use of officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-more-tours-conferences-lok-sabha-secretariat-draws-austerity-plan/story-Eb9f45WCAfCH0Z8yQ28KUP.html
20-04-2020||India||Ganga water fit to drink at many stretches: CPCB||For the first time in many years, several stretches of the Ganga are conforming to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) standards for the quality of river waters, a phenomenon that follows the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 and extended until May 3. In fact, some stretches of the river are recording CPCB’s “fit for drinking water” norm with basic conventional treatment.Experts say this is mainly owing to industries not discharging toxic effluents into the river and less withdrawal of water for industrial and agricultural purposes as part of the lockdown that has shut industrial activity and restricted agricultural work.This will change on Monday when several sectors start reopening gradually. Water quality experts said the lesson from the lockdown is to strictly ensure industries meet effluent discharge standards. More than 80% of the pollution in the Ganga is contributed by domestic sewage from surrounding towns and villages and the rest by industrial effluents, according to the National Mission for Clean Ganga.CPCB’s assessment of Ganga water from January 2020 had shown that most stretches of the Ganga from Garhmukteshwar in Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal were not only violating drinking water standard but also recorded hardly any dissolved oxygen (how much oxygen is dissolved in the water) and extremely high levels of total coliform (bacteria from human and animal waste).Many of the same stretches, according to CPCB’s real time water quality monitoring of the Ganga on Sunday, met the drinking water standards; the biological oxygen demand was < 3 mg/l, dissolved oxygen i >4 mg/l and ph 6 to 9. The biological oxygen demand is the oxygen needed by the river to sustain life. “There are many reasons for improvement in water quality in Ganga. Industries is one of them.... Some distilleries have also stopped discharging. Waste dumping by people around the river also contributes to higher BOD {biological oxygen demand} which may have stopped as people are in lockdown. Its difficult to identify any one factor,” said a senior CPCB official who declined to be identified.CPCB will soon release its analysis of Ganga and Yamuna water quality during the lockdown period from March 25. “Yes its true that we found dramatic improvement in water quality in many parts of the river but in some stretches we found that water quality has deteriorated after the lockdown was imposed. The reasons for this will have to be verified,” the senior official cited above added.Experts urge policy makers to learn from the lockdown experience as access to clean water is also a public health issue and can play a critical role in tackling outbreaks like that of Covid-19.“Industrial pollution is zero today. It is a major polluting factor for Ganga as it compromises the river’s capacity for assimilation. When sewage is mixed with industrial effluents, it is difficult for the river to assimilate the pollution. There is another reason for improvement and better dilution of pollutants. There were a very high number of western disturbances which brought rain and improved the flow in the river leading to better dilution. There are two key takeaways from this—industries have to become zero liquid discharge and environmental flow is a must in the river,” said Manoj Mishra, convenor of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, descriptor.E-flow refers to quality, quantity and timing of water flows required to maintain life in the river.“Improvement in Ganga water pollution is a function of both quality and quantity. Water is not being lifted by industries so there is more flow in the river and the pollution is getting diluted. At the same time effluents are also not being discharged. It’s a same thing as you dilute something in a glass of water versus a bucket of water. Because of the harvesting season the agriculture sector also isn’t withdrawing much water now. If you leave nature on its own, it survives and comes back to life. This is a clear example but levels will go back up as soon as we reopen,” said Suresh Rohilla, senior director, water and waste water management, Centre for Science and Environment.Stretches that met “drinking water quality” standard on SundayStretches with biological oxygen demand (oxygen needed by the river to sustain life) is <3 mg/l, dissolved oxygen is>4 mg/l and PH is 6 to 9• Kannauj, bathing ghat and barrage in Kanpur, Fatehpur bridge, Narora, Varanasi bathing ghat 1, Sukartal Ghat, Bhitpur, and Ganga nullah, Murshidabad and Howrah Bridge in West BengalStretches with high pollution level on Sunday:• Allahabad nullah with BOD of 15.35 mg/l and DO of 1.04 mg/l• Haridwar nullah with BOD of 43.20 mg/l and DO of only 0.01 mg/l• Nullah at Patna with BOD of 30.13 mg/l and DO of 0.25 mg/lSource: CPCB||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-ganga-stretches-now-cleaner-cpcb/story-kpWW5DuCMJJHwa9ds7XNqJ.html

The death toll in Rajasthan stands at 22 and the number infected at 1,431 as of Sunday.State health department said that in the last past five days the daily increase in the number of cases had slowed, indicating a flattening of the Covid-19 curve..Health minister Raghu Sharma said credited the decrease to the efforts made by the state government to stanch the number of new cases and the fatality rate which, he claimed, was lower than the national average. Sharma also claimed that those who had died of the virus also suffered from co-morbid conditions and their deaths could not be attributed to Covid-19 alone.On Saturday, Rajasthan’s additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh said that had the virus spread at the same pace as it did in the first phase of the lockdown (March 25 to April 14) ,the number of people infected would have been 1,679 but because of stringent measures adopted by the state, the number had been limited to 1,361 (as of Saturday evening).Health department data also showed that people in the 20-40 year age group were most susceptible to the virus in Rajasthan.Singh said the man who died on Sunday was a 62-year-old resident of Jaipur’s Raja Park and was admitted to a private hospital on April 16 with complaints of fever and breathlessness. His sample was taken and he tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday, April 18, and he died the same day, said Singh. It was the 22nd Covid-19 death in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-tally-climbs-to-1-431-in-rajasthan/story-uL6p2DCcYxKNyxpOZjat1M.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Call grows for law to protect doctors from violence||As cases of violence against health care professionals increase, doctors’ associations have urged the central government to formulate more stringent laws. Earlier this week, the Federation of Resident Doctors Association wrote to home minister Amit Shah, expressing concern over the attacks on doctors and medical staff at Lok Nayak Hospital in the national Capital and other states such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana.In a series of tweets, lawyer Sonali Jaitley Bakshi said her father, late Union minister Arun Jaitley, wanted to pursue the formation of a law to deal with the violence against health workers.“Today, I want to talk about something VERY important! Our family has always had the utmost respect for doctors, nurses & everyone in the medical profession. But recent attacks on these warriors brought back one of the final memories I shared with my father. When he was admitted to AIIMS, he often spoke of how kind the hospital staff was to him & our family. Their love, patience, dedication was clear to see. However, it broke his heart to hear of patients’ families beating up doctors,” she tweeted.Bakshi went on to add, “…He then told me that post-recovery, he’d pursue govt. to introduce a strict law punishing those who assault medical staff. Sadly he could not- but I want to fulfil his vision & request GoI to pass this law soon. Friends, they save our lives - it’s time we stood up for them!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-call-grows-for-law-to-protect-doctors-from-violence/story-0KKCkwQA8i5UY1VDjDQnlM.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Big spike in Gujarat with 367 new infections||Gujarat on Sunday reported 367 new coronavirus disease cases, taking the total number of cases in the state to 1,743. The state has become the third most affected in the country after Maharashtra, which has 3,648 cases and Delhi which has 1,893 cases.The death toll in Gujarat stands at 63, after 10 deaths were reported on Sunday.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health and family welfare, attributed the overnight spurt in cases to a large number of test results sent back from government and private laboratories late on Saturday.“We have got 29,104 people tested, of which 27361 tests were negative. We were expecting the increase as many of those tested had symptoms and we are well prepared to deal with the situation,” she said. “Compared to the national average of 269 tests per million, we are conducting 447.8. More tests would result in identification of more positive cases quickly,” the principal secretary said.“On Sunday, 367 new positive cases were found. Ten deaths were reported from different regions,” Ravi said. She said that as many as 18,450 people are currently under quarantine, of which 2,681 are at government facilities and 231 in private. According to the data released by Gujarat’s health department, about two-thirds of the total cases in the state were reported from the capital, Ahmedabad, which has emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot city. A statement by the health department said that of 1743 total cases, 1632 patients were stable and only 14 were on ventilator support. The government hospitals in the state have 1,061 ventilators and there are 1,700 ventilators in private hospitals, the statement said.The government also said a special 1,200 bed hospital in Ahmedabad has earmarked for Covid-19, a government statement said. The data showed that Covid-19 has now spread to 29 of the 33 districts in the state, which last month was restricted to five. Meanwhile, the state government has decided to allow factories in municipal corporation and town council areas to function from Monday. According to officials familiar with the matter, at a meeting chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani, it was also decided that that these units would arrange accommodation facilities for the workers within the factory premises and ensure that the workers don’t have to travel much.Director General of Police, Gujarat, Shivanand Jha said necessary measures are being taken by the administration to prevent the transmission of corona virus in the state. “Strict vigil is kept to ensure that the lockdown orders are not violated,” Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-spike-in-gujarat-with-367-new-infections/story-EENpHN7PLmNThYvZ2We5cJ.html

The delegation of the main opposition party included, leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D K Shiva Kumar apart from several former ministers like R V Deshpande, Ramesh Kumar, G Parameshwara, Dinesh Gundu Rao, Ramalinga Reddy, Ajay Dharam Singh and other senior leaders.Congress said that there was a shortage of masks, glues, sanitizers, PPE kits required by doctors, nurses and other para-medical staff. The delegation members said that while the state required 12 lakh kits a mere 2.27 lakh was available, similarly only 5.46 lakh N-95 masks were available as was Hydroxychloroquine tablets of which only 2.8 lakh were available.Instead of the mere 152 tests done per million of population, the Congress delegation said the state should do at least 10,000 per million population according to WHO standards.Asking the state government to urge the Centre to declare this as a ‘national calamity,’ the opposition party leaders claimed that salaries have not been disbursed to the doctors, nurses, para-medical staff and ASHA workers. It also asked that insurance and other social security benefits given only to doctors should be extended to others.Stating that private hospitals and clinics were not functioning, Congress said this was inconveniencing non-Covid-19 patients and urged the government to ensure that they remain open. Accusing the government of not doing enough to aid the farmers, it urged that the losses suffered by them must be made good from the national calamity fund.Congress leaders also said that there was wide-spread discrimination in distribution of grants and reliefs by the government and asked that all legislators be treated on an equal footing. It also said ruling party members were taking credit for distribution of aid from the government by pasting their pictures on relief material.The delegation also asked the state government to help migrant labourers and said MNREGA should be effectively leveraged. Congress said that ruling party members were accusing a particular community of spreading the virus which it said was reprehensible. KPCC President D K Shivakumar said inspite of a BJP government in the state the Centre was meting out step-motherly treatment in providing flood relief, share of GST taxes and aid to fight coronavirus. It demanded that the CM lead an all-party delegation to Delhi to persuade the Central government to set right the injustice which it said was being meted out to Karnataka.The Chief Minister who gave a patient hearing to the opposition leaders said that he would look at the suggestions given in the memorandum.Meanwhile, the state recorded six new Covid-19 positive cases even as two more people died due to the virus. Till date, Karnataka has had 390 confirmed Covid-19 positive cases which include 16 deaths and 11 discharges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-congress-delegation-meets-cm-submits-list-of-demands-to-tackle-covid-19/story-VR6RzMiKryj25tTuzHQ8WN.html

The first case in Dharavi was reported on April 1, following which there has been a rapid surge in the number of positive cases, which may soon pose a grim challenge for civic authorities. Coronavirus cases are climbing steadily in the area and there are fears that the number of cases could be higher as many people with symptoms may not have been tested yet.The slums in Dharavi are spread over an area of more than 240 hectares and house around 8.5 lakh residents. With a population density of 66,000 people per square kilometre, it is one of the most congested areas of the city.The total number of coronavirus positive cases in Maharashtra has mounted to 3,648 till Sunday with the state registering 211 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-20-new-cases-emerge-in-mumbai-s-dharavi-total-count-at-slum-is-138/story-d18Ct3o8k35I3AGI2h5F4I.html

20-04-2020||India||Non-essential deliveries by e-tailers remain prohibited||E-commerce companies such as Amazon and Filpkart are not allowed to sell products unless they are in the essential items list, the Union home ministry said in an order on Sunday, clarifying an earlier announcement that did not specify if these companies could start delivering products such as laptops, mobile phones and appliances from April 20.On April 15, the government put e-commerce in the list of what will be allowed once some curbs are lifted from areas with no Covid-19 outbreak. It seemed to suggest that sale of all products would be allowed, prompting trader lobbies to criticise this as discriminatory against brick-and-mortar retailers. “Supply of non-essential goods by e-commerce companies to remain prohibited during Lockdown 2.0 to fight Covid,” said a spokesperson of the ministry of home affairs citing the new order, which, he said, clarifies a misinterpretation of last week’s directions.Clause 14 (v) for e-commerce companies in revised consolidated guidelines on April 15 was technically misinterpreted as allowing the delivery of non-essential items, since the clause did not specify “essential or non-essential items”, a home ministry official said, asking not to be named. On Saturday, the opposition Congress too opposed the April 15 decision, saying the government was doing injustice to retail traders by allowing e-commerce companies to deliver non-essential items. Similar objection was raised by the Confederation of All -India Traders in a letter to the PM. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday the move will help in creating a level playing field.Amazon India, one of the biggest e-commerce websites, said Sunday’s decision will affect customers who may need some products essential to working or studying from home. “The new guideline will disappoint not only the consumers whose list of essentials had expanded to work from home and study from home products but also the thousands of small businesses, sellers and manufacturers across the country, who had geared up in the last 48 hours to provide millions of people with safe access to products,” a spokesperson said. The company said it will continue to follow guidelines and deliver essential products, and was working closely with authorities for expedited processes to make safe deliveries of priority products. On Sunday, CAIT issued a statement, saying it had “demolished sinister plan of e-commerce companies to trade in non-essential commodities”. Since March 25, when India was put under what is the world’s largest shutdown in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the government has largely allowed only items of basic necessities to reach people.Efforts have been made to ensure that milk, vegetables, cooking oil, milk and such products reach people, with a special emphasis on doorstep delivery in many parts of the country, the official cited above said.When Modi extended the lockdown till May 3, he said that certain economic activity in regions that contain the outbreak successfully can be relaxed, but with “very strict guidelines on how people step out of their homes” . These allowed some construction and industrial activity as well as operation of offices with strict social distancing protocols, as long as these were in areas not classified as hot spots. Work by some self-employed individuals, such as cobblers and roadside vendors, was also put on the list of what could be allowed||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/non-essential-deliveries-by-e-tailers-remain-prohibited/story-IQWV2cGmciq8eucWx7uuAM.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Curbs in Delhi won’t be eased from today||Delhi will not immediately ease any restrictions clamped under the national lockdown because coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are on the rise in the national capital, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, even as several other states announced relaxing some norms beginning Monday to jump-start the virus-hit economy.Hindustan Times reported on Sunday that the Delhi government did not want to ease restrictions on April 20 on the grounds that the city-state was a “high-risk zone”. All 11 revenue districts in the state are now designated as virus hot spots, with one remaining district (north-east Delhi) joining the list.At a news conference on Sunday morning, Kejriwal said the government will assess the situation after one week. “There have been instances where people without symptoms were found infected by Covid-19,” the chief minister said. “Delhi has 2% of the country’s population but 12% of the total active cases,” he added.Kejriwal said many people were facing difficulties because of the lockdown. “But if we give relaxations and if there is a shortage of ICU, ventilators, oxygen in hospitals and people lose their lives, we wouldn’t be able to forgive ourselves. Hence, the decision to not relax lockdown was taken,” he added.Out of 736 samples collected recently, 186 people were found to be infected by Sars-CoV-2 on Saturday and all of them were asymptomatic, he said, adding that the people did not suspect they had contracted the disease. “This suggests that they would have compromised with isolation norms and potentially spread the virus without even knowing. This is a scary situation.”At 2,003 cases -- 110 people tested positive on Sunday -- Delhi has the second most Covid-19 infections after Maharashtra, which has 4,200. The city has 80 “containment zones”, where the restrictions are stricter, movement is barred, and home delivery of essentials is facilitated by the administration.On April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the national lockdown – first imposed on March 25 – will be extended till May 3, but said some of the curbs would be lifted in places outside “containment zones” and in areas where the potential of the pathogen spreading was low, to revive economic activity.An order released by the Union home ministry a day after PM Modi’s address laid down guidelines for the conditional lifting of some restrictions.The Delhi government, however, decided to send a proposal to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Friday evening against the lifting of restrictions after the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) informed it of “large outbreaks” in several parts of the city, according to a senior government official who asked not to be named.Kejriwal attributed the large number of cases in Delhi to heavy airport arrivals from Covid-affected countries and a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin recently.The tally of Covid-19 cases first jumped in India after the detection of hundreds of patients who attended gatherings of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group, in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month. Once the cluster – the largest single source so far in the country – was identified and isolated on March 30, daily cases surged. The number of cases in Delhi increased from 72 on March 29 to 2,003 so far – more than 1,000 cases can be linked to the Nizamuddin gathering.“If there had been no lockdown, the situation here would have been similar to Italy and Spain,” Kejriwal said.According to an order issued by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, the government will review the situation on April 27.Food distribution centres in Delhi also came up on the radar after a volunteer tested positive for Covid-19. Kejriwal said people linked to the centres will be among the first batches to be tested with rapid antibody kits.Of the first batch of 42,000 rapid testing kits that arrived in Delhi on Friday, some were used to evaluate 92 cured patients being discharged from Lok Nayak hospital for plasma therapy trial to treat other Covid-19 patients.Schools, colleges and coaching centres will continue to remain closed; as will all public transport including buses, auto-rickshaws, taxis, cab aggregator services, e-rickshaws and the Metro. Construction and other business activities, including the operation of non-essential factories will also remain suspended. Goods transport and all essential services that were permitted through the lockdown will continue to operate.Experts said earlier that the sectors that could have witnessed some relief included self-employed workers such as electricians and plumbers, construction activities in cases where the sites had provisions for safe accommodation of labourers, and activities in industrial zones.Animesh Das, a labour activist and member of the Delhi government’s minimum wage board, said: “Delhi has around 600,000 constructions workers of which roughly 500,000 are left in the lockdown. Rest managed to leave the city before it was strictly imposed. A significant percentage of them resides at the construction sites. Since relaxations are out of question at this hour, the government should take up an exercise of construction site visits and provide them with direct cash benefits. The workers and their families are currently in poor shape.”Public health experts said not allowing any relaxation at this time was a good move as ideally all containment zones should have tight restrictions and complete lockdown for at least 28 days. Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Delhi is vulnerable because of its high population density. Mobility is directly proportional to chances of transmission and that is already visible to some extent after the first phase of the 21-day lockdown. So, stricter restrictions are a necessary step at this juncture. Currently, Delhi is not in a position to relax the lockdown. To contain the transmission of the virus, people have to cooperate.”Amita Baviskar, a professor of sociology at Ashoka University, said: “Well-to-do families with salaries and savings will sail through. The crisis has hit the lower middle and working classes – small businesses, street vendors, domestic workers, daily wage labourers, and industrial workers. The government may give them two meals a day but they need cash for other necessities such as rent, medicines, school fees, mobile recharge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-curbs-in-delhi-won-t-be-eased-from-today/story-K3n2BLwyQpCpmX1d0O1UfO.html

Assistant police superintendent Arun Kumar said Kunwarpal, the sanitation worker, was spraying disinfectants when he got into an argument with Motipur resident Indrapal over the disinfectants that fell on him. He added that soon Indrapal’s four friends joined him and assaulted Kunwarpal. “Kunwarpal received serious injuries and was taken to a private hospital by some locals but when his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to... the hospital in Moradabad where he died on April 17 [Friday],” said Kumar. He added the police were investigating the case.Police said an FIR has been registered against the five accused under sections 147, 323 and 304 of the Indian Penal Code. However, no arrests have been made yet.Kumar said Kunwarpal’s brother, Harishankar, informed the police about the attack on his sibling on April 14. Harishankar said the accused also forced his brother to swallow some disinfectants. Kumar said they were awaiting Kunwarpal’s postmortem report. “We have registered the FIR and action will be taken against the accused based on the findings of the autopsy and investigation,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanitation-staffer-dies-3-days-after-being-beaten-up/story-2GZrAeKLc5jyLwpLnMVhCM.html
20-04-2020||India||Indore coronavirus clusters double in 9 days||The number of Covid-19 cases in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore has gone up by 237% and led an increase in the city’s containment areas by 103% since April 10, two officials said on Sunday.There were 82 containment zones in the city on April 10, which have since gone up to 167. Indore has the highest such zones in Madhya Pradesh.A hard lockdown is imposed to stop the spread of the disease once an area is declared a containment zone. No one is allowed to step out their houses in such zones and essentials are delivered to the people living there. A containment area can be as small as one lane in a residential colony.Indore reported the sharpest spike in the number of cases over the past few days. As many as 135 were diagnosed with the disease in the city on Friday and 49 on Saturday, taking the city’s tally to 891. A health official said the evening bulletin on Sunday may not be released. However, until 2 pm on Sunday, there was no change in Indore data. Madhya Pradesh has reported 1,407 Covid-19 cases. Three states have more cases than Madhya Pradesh. Indore reported 47 Covid-19 related deaths until Saturday and they accounted for 69% of the pandemic-related fatalities in Madhya Pradesh.Indore’s chief medical and health officer, Dr Pravid Jadia, said the trend over a couple of days shows the number of people identified as Covid-19 patients is on the decline. “In the coming days, it is going to improve further.” Jadia said the number of cases has risen due to an aggressive approach to identifying and treating patients.Of the total 12,940 Covid-19 samples tested in Madhya Pradesh on April 12, only 2,443 were collected from Indore, which had 411 cases by then, according to the health department of Madhya Pradesh. As many as 2,816 samples were collected from Bhopal, which had 158 cases. However, as the number of cases increased, the tests were also increased to 22,569 across the state on April 18.Indore’s collector, Manish Singh, underlined that mostly those people are testing positive who were quarantined as the administration had traced them based on contact histories. “Hence, the situation is improving by the day.”Bhopal-based public health expert Amulya Nidhi said there should have been an aggressive approach from day one for earmarking containment zones and then screening, testing, isolating or quarantining suspected patients as well as contact tracing until these areas were declared Covid-19 free.“Overconfidence of the government and too much bureaucratisation caused the problem. The local community was not taken into confidence,” said Nidhi. Nidhi added there could have been a better use of anganwadi, accredited social health activists etc for reaching out to more and more people for screening them. “Targeted focus on certain localities was a wrong approach. There should have been equal and effective planning for the rest of the city too,” said Nidhi, referring to his study of the government’s approach.Nidhi added people have been seen moving out in containment zones and as many as eight quarantined people escaped from a quarantine centre in Indore. “A good coordination among police, administration and health department was badly required.”Amulya said instead of strengthening the public health system, the government has turned to the private hospitals. “It is the government doctors and health workers who are fighting the disease not the doctors from private hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-virus-clusters-double-in-9-days/story-uU6NjQRonN2cX9N1I3uOfO.html
20-04-2020||India||Modi calls for unity, says virus doesn’t see religion||The coronavirus disease does not distinguish between race, religion, caste, colour and borders and humanity’s response to this “common challenge” should be based on unity and brotherhood, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, calling on Indians top to innovate a new work culture for the world.Modi’s comments come at a time when some sections of society have sought to introduce a communal element in the discourse surrounding Covid-19 at a time when nation is still in the midst of the battle against the pandemic that has left 558 people dead and infected 17,252 more in the country. “Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together,” the Prime Minister said in an address to professionals from various fields on the social media platform LinkedIn.Unlike previous moments in history, when countries or societies faced off against each other, the world today is facing a common challenge, Modi said . The future will be about togetherness and resilience, Modi said.The next big ideas from India should find global relevance and application. They should have the ability to drive a positive change not merely for India but for the entire humankind, the Prime Minister said. Logistics was previously only seen through the prism of physical infrastructure — roads, warehouses, ports. But logistical experts these days can control global supply chains through the comfort of their own homes, he said. India, with the right blend of the physical and the virtual, can emerge as the global nerve centre of complex modern multinational supply chains in the post Covid-19 world, he said.“Let us rise to that occasion and seize this opportunity,” Modi said as he suggested the creation of a business grammar where the vowels A, E, I, O and U stand for adaptability, efficiency. inclusivity, opportunity and universalism.“Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models. India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal can take the lead in providing a new work culture,” he said.It has been a topsy-turvy start to the third decade of this century and Covid-19 has brought with it many disruptions, the Prime Minister said. “Coronavirus has significantly changed the contours of professional life. These days, home is the new office. The Internet is the new meeting room.For the time being, office breaks with colleagues are history,” he said. Modi said he too was adapting to the changes and most of his meetings, including with ministers and officials, were through videoconferencing.“The work place is getting Digital First. And, why not? After all, the most transformational impact of technology often happens in the lives of the poor. It is technology that demolishes bureaucratic hierarchies, eliminates middlemen and accelerates welfare measures,” the Prime Minister said.He cited the examples of the Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar and Mobile number , which together comprise the JAM trinity, to stress how these changes had empowered poorer sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-calls-for-unity-saysvirus-doesn-t-see-religion/story-odKsutBpjYQ6hdv5lVWjMJ.html
20-04-2020||India||Bengaluru dentist helps save migrant labourer, newborn||When Shanti went into labour on April 14, she and her husband desperately began to walk in search of a hospital in Bengaluru. The couple from Odisha, who worked at construction sites on the city’s outskirts, had trudged for about seven kilometers when Shanti collapsed in front of a dental clinic. An employee at the clinic noticed Shanti and immediately called Ramya Himanish, a dentist who runs it and stays nearby. Shanti delivered a baby boy before the dentist could help them reach the nearest hospital. The dentist in between ensured Shanti’s bleeding stopped and the boy, who was presumed dead, was cleaned to help him breathe properly.“They [the couple] could not speak Kannada nor Hindi or English and from whatever little I could understand, they spoke some tribal dialect. The couple is very young, aged between 18-20. The woman, whose name I came to know eventually as Shanti, was too frail and in great pain. When I inquired, all we could understand was that they had no work for nearly a month and had not eaten for a day,” said Himanish.Even before she could get further details, Shanti collapsed next to the clinic and began bleeding heavily after delivering. Himanish said her first priority was to save her even as the baby was not moving and the husband assumed he was dead and wrapped him up in newspaper. She used dental sutures at her clinic to stop Shanti’s bleeding as she shifted her to a portion of her clinic where she could get privacy behind curtains. “...mine is a dental clinic with no paraphernalia of regular maternity hospitals. Once the condition of the mother stabilised, Himanish turned her attention to the child wrapped up in the newspaper. She realised it was a baby boy and his heart was beating, though it was faint. So she used whatever equipment available to clean the nose and mouth of the child to help him breathe freely. Mud and the birth fluid were hindering the baby from breathing. The moment the baby was cleaned up, he began to breathe and cry. “Shanti had woken up by then and I asked her to feed the child. All of us were in a shock till then and it was then I asked them whether they wanted to be shifted to the nearest hospital. But since, it is a large multi-speciality private hospital, the husband was afraid they would ask money. So, we called the government K C General Hospital and eventually an ambulance came and shifted them there.”Himanish said the husband had till then refused to talk to her or answer her questions. “I assume he was afraid that we would ask for money which is why he did not speak at all then and maybe also the shock that he thought that the child was dead. Also, he himself is very young, not more than 20-21.”A day later, the husband, who refused to disclose his name, called Himanish from the K C General Hospital. He could not clearly communicate as he knew none of the languages Himanish spoke. The dentist understood he wanted to thank her and say the child and mother were all right. “In all my 18 years as a dentist, I have never had such an experience. While it was very tense when the whole thing took place, I am happy that everything turned out well though I do not know how this has come to the notice of the media,” said Himanish.Attempts to get details of the couple from K C General Hospital were unsuccessful. The hospital said it does not disclose details of any of its patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-dentist-helps-save-migrant-labourer-newborn/story-YFojENQ7vTZ1BNlcNzOdyK.html
20-04-2020||India||Maharashtra records 552 cases, 12 deaths in highest single-day spike||Maharashtra recorded its highest one-day jump in Covid-19 cases on Sunday with 552 more infections that pushed the toll in India’s most-affected state beyond 4,000 but authorities insisted the spike was because of a backlog in Mumbai’s civic body and private laboratories.The state now has 4,200 infections, of which 2,724 are in the state capital Mumbai, which recorded 456 new patients on Sunday. The spurt comes as a blow to the state’s health authorities after four consecutive days of relatively low numbers, which were 232, 286, 118 and 328 cases between April 15 and 18. The state also reported 12 deaths on Sunday, taking the toll to 223. Of these, six were in Mumbai, four from Malegaon and one each from Solapur and Ahmednagar.Maharashtra took 30 days to cross the 1,000-case mark on April 7, while it crossed the 2,000 mark in just six days on April 13. From 2,000 cases to 3,000, the state took three days and from 3,000 to 4,000, it took three days.Officials said the rise in Mumbai numbers was because of the backlog from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and some private laboratories. “We have to verify all the cases that we get, which takes time. Private labs send us the data first, then to BMC, so sometimes we observe discrepancy in reporting of cases,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare ) and director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra. “We have increased the number of daily tests, so of course, the detection of new cases will rise. We shouldn’t say that the curve is falling depending on the data of one-two days. We have to consider data for at least a week before we can come to a conclusion,” he said.According to officials from the health department, the verification of private laboratory reports by government laboratories takes a few days. “It leads to a sharp spike in numbers on the day the verification is done,” an official said.Maharashtra has conducted 72,023 tests – the most by any state in India -- of which, 67,673 samples tested negative. A total of 507 patients have fully recovered. There are 87,254 people under home quarantine across the state, while 6,743 are under institutional quarantine. The number of containment zones in the state has reduced from 410 to 368, most of them in Mumbai. State authorities have so far screened 2.39 million people, with the help of 6,359 teams, as part of its containment strategy.Earlier in the day, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a relaxation of lockdown restrictions in rural areas but clarified that strict curbs in containment areas and in Mumbai and Pune will continue till at least May 3. “We are relaxing restrictions in green and orange zones, which have zero or fewer Covid-19 patients, to a certain extent. The industrial operations in these zones will be allowed, but the employers will have to ensure arrangements for stay and food for the employees. The district borders will, however, remained sealed and no intra-district activities be permitted,” he said.The state government has also directed 10% of its employees to resume work from Monday. Maharashtra has only four districts (Nanded, Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli) with no patients, while in 18 districts, the number (of Covid-19 cases) is in single digits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-crosses-4-000-mark-with-552-new-cases-12-more-deaths/story-CGGn4BnFSWnS3n63SJrafO.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid curbs relaxation: Factories to run at limited capacity||State governments are expecting 10 to 25% of industries to restart operations on Monday in the first easing of lockdown measures for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as part of a staggered reopening of the economy, multiple officials said on Sunday.The ministry of home affairs (MHA), in guidelines issued on April 15, allowed special economic zones (SEZs), and Export Oriented Units (EoUs), industrial estates and industrial townships to reopen before the extended lockdown ends on May 3. Restrictions have been eased on industries located in rural areas rural areas as well.The conditional relaxations announced by the Centre focus on the rural sector and daily-wage earners and do not apply to so-called hotspot districts where most of the coronavirus cases have been detected.On Sunday, the MHA said migrant workers stranded across states should be allowed to work in industries depending on their skills, reiterating that no inter-state transport will be allowed.The order may help industries to find workers. A large number of workers have left for their home states after the 21-day lockdown was enforced from March 25. “Finding skilled workers among stranded labourers may not be easy,” said an industry leader from Rajasthan. Most industry leaders also said they were bracing for teething problems in the first few days of reopening and expecting production to reach up to 50% of capacity by the first week of May.Punjab’s industry minister Sunder Sham Arora said more than 40% of the industrial units would resume their operations within this week albeit at reduced capacities. Andhra Pradesh’s special chief secretary for industries Rajat Bhargava said the capacity of industries was expected to gradually increase in the next fortnight. “Don’t’ expect a miracle. Kick-starting economic activity in a lockdown is more difficult than shutting it,” said an official of the Madhya Pradesh industries department on condition of anonymity. In Maharashtra, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases for any state in India, chief minister Uddav Thackeray on Sunday allowed industriy to resume work in 20 of the total 36 districts, which either don’t have any coronavirus cases or have very few cases. “We are allowing industrial operations in limited capacity from Monday where the employers are ready to bear the responsibilities of the stay, food and transportation of the employees,” the CM said. Industries in rural areas have also been allowed. Maharashtra has 1.026 million registered micro, small and medium enterprises, or MSMEs, of which around 450,000 are in areas where operations are being allowed from Monday.Punjab government officials are not expecting more than 12% of industries to start operations because most industrial units are in Covid-19 hotspots. Punjab’s home department has made it mandatory for all categories of industries employing 10 or more persons to make transport arrangements for their workers or accommodate them on their factory premises. “We don’t expect more than 10-12% of industrial units to resume operations in the next two-three days. Also, our containment zones are mostly in industrial towns,” said a senior government official, who did not want to be named. SAS Nagar (Mohali), Jalandhar, Patiala, Ludhiana and Amritsar districts, where most of the small and medium industries are located, account for 65% of the 234 Covid-19 cases discovered in the state.In Uttar Pradesh, industry leaders were not sure whether partial lifting of lockdown will help in running their units efficiently. “We have conveyed to the government about problems which we are facing in restarting our units {in UP}. It will not be easy for us to resume production,” said Pankaj Kumar, national president, Indian Industries Association, an industry lobby for MSMEs units. In the MSME segment, around 950,000 industrial units are registered in the state. Out of these, around 6,656 units are listed in the essential goods category and 5,720 are operational. All of them are working at less than half of their capacity, officials said.Suresh Aggarwal, president of the Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI), said he was not expecting more than 25% of the industries employing about 2.5 million workers to resume work on Monday. Rajasthan was the first state to notify conditions for a “modified lockdown” from Monday, which allowed running of all industries in rural areas; industrial areas established in municipal corporation or municipality limits, export- based units, and in special economic zones to function. Workers should be accommodated in on factory premises or nearby, the order said.“As per the conditions laid down by the government, masks and sanitizers are a must, which have not reached the industries. In such circumstances, it will not be wise to start the operations,” Agarwal said, expecting industries dealing with garments, mills (oil, flour,grains), health and surgical, plastic and packaging to start functioning in single shifts. In eastern India, the Jharkhand government has given permission to several big industrial units such as Tata Steel and Tata Motors in Jamshedpur and Dalmia Cement in Bokaro to start operations. Officials said all major steel, mining and cement factories have been allowed to operate.However, around 1,200 industries in Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority (AIADA)---the biggest industrial cluster in the state---will have to wait another 10 days for reopening. “All industries in rural areas are allowed. For others, we have given permission to most essential industries with specific guidelines to be followed for restarting 30% of their operation/production,” said A Dode deputy commissioner of the Seraikela-Kharsaawn district, where many industries are situated. In neighbouring Bihar, the government expects about 3,000 of the total 25,000 small industries to start functioning in rural areas and industrial belts on Monday, benefitting about 15,000 workers, government officials said. Principal secretary (industries), S Siddhartha, said industrial units will have to procure passes for their personnel tarting operations. and government officials have been deputed to facilitate the process. Dome 1,750 units located in 52 industrial areas and parks, set up by state’s industrial development authority, have been permitted to resume work, another official said.Andhra Pradesh’s special chief secretary for industries said 50 to 60% of 107,000 industries that are outside the 97 designated red zones in the state are expected to operate from Monday. Bhargava said the government had permitted software companies to run with 50% of employees and hardware units with 100 % “But most of these IT companies are located in red zones like in Visakhapatnam,” he said.“On the first day, we are hoping that 10% of industries might start their plants and gradually, the number of industries that commence works might go up in a phased manner. It will take a week to 10 days to stabilise,” Bhargava added.The 36 industrial areas in Goa would start functioning from tomorrow with 33% staff working in staggered shifts, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-curbs-relaxation-factories-to-run-at-limited-capacity/story-AjpzJvTK2eqpKtKNB6y5DP.html
20-04-2020||India||Migrants can go to work within state limits: Govt||The Centre on Sunday said that migrant workers -- many of whom are in relief camps across the country due to the Covid-19 lockdown -- will be allowed to work in the states they are currently in, and directed local administrations to help provide them transport while ensuring social distancing measures are followed. In a notification, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla underlined there will be no interstate movement of workers during the lockdown.The Centre on Wednesday allowed activities such as the conditional reopening of industries in rural areas outside the so-called Covid-19 containment zones from Monday to restart the economy as the lockdown was extended until May 3. The flagship Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) will also restart with a focus on irrigation and water conservation works.The decision is expected to bring relief to the stranded workers, tens of thousands of whom were forced to leave for their towns and villages on foot last month as the lockdown left them jobless. Some were transported back to their homes by the government, and many were housed in relief and shelter camps. Workers have taken to the streets in different places across the country and demanded that they be sent back to their states.The Union home ministry’s order on Sunday said that workers in state-run and relief and shelter camps can be employed in the activities allowed from Monday. “Since additional activities, outside the containment zones, have been permitted in the consolidated revised guidelines with effect from April 20 (Monday), these workers could be engaged in industrial, manufacturing, construction, farming and MNREGA works,” the order said while underlining the ban on the interstate movement. The order said states and Union Territories will be responsible for providing transport to the workers wishing to return to their places of work, but they have to be screened for Covid-19 symptoms. It added local authorities will have to ensure the workers are registered and their skills are mapped to employ them suitably.The buses to be used for transportation should be sanitised and social distancing measures must be followed, the order said. The local authorities will also have to provide food and water to the workers when they travel to work, according to the Standard Operating Procedure listed by the ministry.The mass movement of the migrant workers last month prompted the Centre to order states to seal their borders as it could undermine the impact of the restrictions aimed at slowing down the spread of the disease.The Centre informed the Supreme Court this month that there were over a million migrant labourers in relief camps across the country. Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday reviewed the second phase of the lockdown. He said while some economic activities have been permitted, due caution has to be exercised to ensure that only genuine relaxations are given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-can-go-to-work-within-state-limits-govt/story-FVeQdtQjedItS1PN1GkhbN.html
20-04-2020||India||Silent spreaders make Covid a bigger challenge: Experts||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday that all 186 people who were diagnosed with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) the previous day had exhibited no symptoms of illness, reinforcing evidence from other states that asymptomatic “silent spreaders” are unknowingly infecting others.Asymptomatic infections are higher than symptomatic infections in several states, including Karnataka and Assam, according to state government officials familiar with the matter. At the INS Angre station in Mumbai, 66% of the Indian Navy personnel diagnosed with Covid-19 had no cough, fever or any other sign of the illness, according to Western Naval Command.Experts say that the expansion of testing from only symptomatic contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 patient to testing everyone who could have been exposed to the infection, irrespective of symptoms, is leading to more asymptomatic cases being detected n India.“People with no symptoms are either asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. Some develop symptoms some days or a week later, but they begin shedding the virus and infecting others even before they develop symptoms. Young, healthy people are more likely to have a milder disease than older people and those with chronic illnesses,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and lung problems, and diseases of the heart and kidney, among others, exacerbate illness and raise the risk of complications and death. According to a study published in Nature Medicine on April 15, around 44% people with Covid-19 got infected by people who had no symptoms, with coronavirus-positive people being the most infectious two or three days before the symptoms appear. Another study from Asia published in March had found that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission accounted for 48% of the cases in Singapore and 62% in Tianjin, China.“Asymptomatic transmission has made containment of this pandemic such a challenge. Unlike Sars-CoV, where disease transmission started after people developed symptoms, around 40% of Covid-19 infection is spread by people before their symptoms appear. Contact tracing and quarantining people will have to continue for several months to break transmission,” said Dr Manoj Murhekar, director of the ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai.According to a study published in the journal Science on March 16, undetected cases of people with “mild, limited or no symptoms” were responsible for 79% of Covid-19 transmission before the lockdown in China, because infected and contagious people continued to congregate or travel.“This is why contact tracing is so important, where every contact of a known case is traced and tested irrespective of symptoms. Social isolation will have to be sustained for another one to two years to reduce the multiplier effect. A recent study from Stanford University has found many people who have mild or no disease remain undiagnosed but continue to infect others,” said Dr Ganguly.A modelling at Stanford University that tested 3,300 people in Santa Clara County in California for antibodies against Covid-19 to detect past infection found actual infections outnumbered confirmed cases by a factor of 50-85.  “These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa Clara County by early April, 50-85 times more than the number of confirmed cases,” said researchers in the yet-to-be peer-reviewed study published on April 17 in the preprint server medRxiv. Younger people who are healthy are more likely to stay asymptomatic, found a study in Nanjing in the Jiangsu Province of China, which followed 24 people who tested positive but didn’t show symptoms. In the one to three weeks after diagnosis, the seven who continued showing no symptoms had a median age of 14 years , according to the study published in Science China Life Sciences, which is the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.As India widens rapid antibody testing for community surveillance and tests everyone in Covid-19 clusters and hot spots, the number of asymptomatic cases will grow, experts say. “Now that states are increasing rapid antibody testing, those who have been infected without knowing it because they had mild disease or did not get tested will be diagnosed, which will help us better understand if there has been a sub-clinical spread of the disease,” said a former health ministry official who asked not to be named.“Along with rapid testing, we must ramp up polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect active infection and do it at the local level to speed up results, so that there is no lag in the containment response,” she said.Doctors say that until a treatment or vaccine is developed against Covid-19, the only protection against silent spreaders is wearing masks, social distancing and hand-washing. “Anyone can be a pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carrier without knowing, so personal protection and social distancing must become the new norm,” said Dr Murhekar.Covid-19 transmission can be stopped only when cases are brought down to below one per million population, said Dr Ganguly.“To detect community transmission, we need to scale up testing, continue testing all severe acute respiratory testing for surveillance, and trace, test and quarantine all contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, irrespective of whether they develop symptoms or not,” said Dr Ganguly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/silent-spreaders-make-covid-a-bigger-challenge-experts/story-SW0Mo3ExEPpCo9GHYMhBRN.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Infections with no symptoms raise concerns across states||Roughly two-thirds of all Covid-19 cases in 10 major states comprise people who did not show any symptoms at the time of testing, according to state government data that reinforced growing evidence that “silent spreaders” were possibly unknowingly infecting others, and underlined the need for extensive testing to isolate such patients. An analysis by HT found that 65% of Maharashtra’s 3,648 cases and 75% of Uttar Pradesh’s 974 cases did not show symptoms at the time of testing. In Assam, 82% of 34 cases were of people with no symptoms “They didn’t show any of the typical symptoms associated with the disease during treatment,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday. In Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday that all 186 people diagnosed with Covid-19 the previous day had exhibited no symptoms of illness.”Most of the Covid-19 positive cases in Haryana are asymptomatic,” Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana, said.  To be sure, these numbers could include people who were both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic, which means that a person was tested before they started showing symptoms. Doctors said exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 depended on the virus load, age and immunity. “If the load is not very high and virus is not virulent, the symptoms may not be there. But, it can be detected through test,” Kamboj added.Dr C Nagaraja, director of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases in Bengaluru, said younger people with good immunity may not show any signs of Covid-19 and that most asymptomatic patients were between 20 and 45. “Even older persons taking certain medicines may not show any signs initially. Those with weak immunity and co-morbid conditions show Covid signs faster,” he said. Globally, research has shown that people remain very infectious in the period before they show symptoms. In central Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district, a woman student who travelled with some members of the Tablighi Jamaat remained asymptomatic for 22 days while under observation but showed signs towards the end of the observation period, said district medical officer, Dr N Sheeja. Identifying such people is difficult unless extensive testing is done, say experts, and the numbers are expected to rise because rapid and pool testing mechanisms have been introduced by most states. In rapid test, a person’s blood is tested for Covid-19 antibodies, whose presence indicates that the person was infected by the virus and is now immune. In pool testing, samples of up to 64 people are tested together. If the combined test is positive, then all persons are individually tested to identify Covid-19 patients. Internationally, countries such as South Korea and China, where the number of Covid-19 have declined, started identifying the asymptomatic carriers early. In China, reports say around 43,000 asymptomatic persons have been identified and isolated. Similarly, in South Korea, more than 30,000 such people were traced, local reports said. Dr. Karan Peepre, medical superintendent, AIIMS, Raipur, said the only way to deal with asymptomatic people is quick identification through massive testing and isolation. Uttar Pradesh health secretary Amit Mohan Prasad said identifying hot spots was crucial to prevent the spread by disease by symptom-free patients. Andhra Pradesh Covid nodal officer, D Arja Sreekanth, said the state is conducting door-to-door survey to identify such patients. “We are also testing all those above 60 years having co-morbid issues like diabetes, hypertension, past history of tuberculosis etc, though they might not have Covid-19 symptoms,” he said.Some experts, however, said asymptomatic patients are not a big threat if the chain of transmission is broken and the ongoing lockdown is an effective way to do that. “Lockdown is effective in breaking the (transmission) chain,” said Balram Bhargava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research.(with inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infections-with-no-symptoms-raise-concerns-across-states/story-gT3GFcfIjUF3HFeBZOU8PI.html
20-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Eateries to open in 10 Kerala districts||Hotels and restaurants will open in 10 districts of Kerala on Monday after nearly a month of lockdown as the coastal state prepared to get its economy back on track after successfully controlling the spread of Covid-19.Out of Kerala’s 14 districts, four -- north Kerala’s Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode and Malappuram -- are in the red zone with the bulk of infections. Eight, including state capital Thiruvananthapuram, are in the orange zone with few cases and two are in the green zone with no cases. The relaxations will be applicable to the orange and green zones only, said state authorities.From Monday, restaurants and hotels in these two zones will remain open until 7pm and some private vehicles allowed on the streets but no overcrowding will be permitted. “People will have to keep it in mind it is a temporary arrangement so we expect responsible behaviour from them. We will keep a strict eye. We advise people to come out if it is necessary only,” said state director general of police Loknath Behra.On Sunday evening, many hotels in Thiruvananthapuram were seen making arrangements for the opening and said they needed a day to collect food and other essentials things. “For batter and dough we need time. It is good that social life is slowly picking up. At the same time we are aware of the norms and constraints,” said a spokesman of the district hoteliers and restaurant owners’ association. The establishments had shut on March 25 when a nationwide lockdown was imposed.Police said only three passengers will be allowed in a car, including the driver, and no pillion riding will be permitted on two-wheelers. The government has also allowed farming, food processing units, construction, road construction and traditional sectors like handloom, coir and beedi to work, without crowding. The state reported two new cases of coronavirus, which took the total number of infections in the state to 401, state health minister K K Shailaja said. Out of the 401, 270 have been discharged while 129 people are in different hospitals, she said in a statement. A total of 55,590 people are now under observation, down from almost 200,000 at one point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eateries-to-open-in-10-kerala-districts/story-6gZbPaDkEoY6rPO0X2e1QI.html
20-04-2020||India||Tourism that generates jobs and revenue in the state worst-hit: Jai Ram Thakur||Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur spoke to Hindustan Times about steps to fight the coronavirus disease, its impact on the state economy - particularly tourism and horticulture, and a possible bailout package for some sectors. Edited excerpts:How many tests per million are being conducted to detect and diagnose Covid-19 patients in Himachal Pradesh, and what measures are being taken to contain the spread?Thirty-nine people have tested positive as on April 19. Out of these, 12 were cured, four went outside the state for treatment, and one person died. We are conducting about 200 to 250 tests daily in our three authorised institutions. This ratio is better than the national average, and on our request the Union government has provided 4,800 rapid testing kits. The state has been fortunate that the virus has not spread at the community level. This was possible because of the immediate steps taken -- a complete curfew was imposed in the entire state from March 24 and plying of vehicles was banned, which helped in breaking the cycle of spread.We started delivery of essential commodities to people’s doorsteps to effectively ensure social distancing. We have sealed the borders, and inter and intrastate movement has been banned. The Covid-19 hot spots in the state are in Kangra, Chamba, Sirmaur, Solan and Una. What is your plan for a graded relaxation of the lockdown in other areas from April 20?Our focus is on containing the spread in the hot spots and preventing the virus from spreading to the green zones in Shimla, Mandi, Kullu, Bilaspur, Kinnaur and Lahaul Spiti. We are planning a staggered exit plan bring back normalcy in the state and to revive economic activity simultaneously. Steps have been taken to facilitate curfew passes for farmers as their crops are at the harvesting stage. They are also being sensitised about social distancing. The horticulture department has been asked to ensure door- to- door or at least village-wise supply of pesticides and other plant protection resources. Tourism is a key income generator for the state, and a sector hit hard. What are the plans to revive the sector, and will there be an immediate bailout package?Tourism plays a key role in the economy of the state and this industry has suffered a lot. After this crisis is over, we will chalk out the strategy to revive the tourism industry. We are getting a lot of request for tax holidays and concessions in utility bills, because the tourist season has been a washout.This is also the time when fruits and flowers are supplied outside the state. What steps are being taken at the state level to ensure there is no disruption?We have taken several steps to ensure that farmers and horticulturists do not suffer hardships in pursuing farm activities and selling their produce. The supply chain of farm inputs and plant protection material is being maintained. Direct contact between farmers and the buyers is being established so that farmers can sell their produce at remunerative prices. Smooth transportation of horticulture produce is also being ensured. Himachal Pradesh is probably the first state to allow farm activities to run smoothly even during the curfew by maintaining proper social distancing.What are your expectations from the central government? are there any specific sectors that need assistance?Almost 36 hours after the lockdown was announced by the Prime Minister, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package for the poor. This includes, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna with eight different elements to address the needs of different sections of the vulnerable.Every sector in every state has suffered a blow. In our state, tourism, which generates jobs and revenue, has taken the biggest hit; industry is affected; those engaged in horticulture and apple harvesting are suffering. Owing to weather conditions, we get a limited window for the construction of roads, highways and hydel projects -- all of that has been disturbed. We’ve formed a task force, and I am confident that the country under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi will come out from this crisis.The issue of migrant workers has emerged as a serious concern. How are your coping with shortage of labour force from Nepal, Bihar and other places?As of now we have imposed complete ban on entry of people from outside the state. Still, there is sufficient number of labourers who permanently live in the state, particularly in apple growing areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tourism-that-generates-jobs-and-revenue-in-the-state-worst-hit-jai-ram-thakur/story-4pYE7z7Ny3pk2GqsVU3VSM.html
20-04-2020||India||Virus and the village: A Covid chronicle||Most people aren’t leaving their homes in Abu Sayeed Ahmed’s Khairabari village in Assam’s Barpeta district. “They are following the official guidelines – washing their hands, sanitising their homes, sewing their masks,” said the 20-year-old. But a few people step out every day fearing they would die of hunger if they stayed in.’Ghar pe rahenge toh mar jayange’ (If we stay home, we will die). There must be nearly 4,000 people across villages in this district who eat at night based on what they earn during the day. So, they have been forced to come out and knock on other people’s doors,” he said.For India’s estimated 260 million rural poor, hunger is the biggest challenge thrown up by Covid-19 lockdowns. In March, the Narendra Modi government initiated bank transfers of Rs 500 rupees for 200 million poor women as part of a $23 billion relief package. But going out to withdraw this cash from their bank accounts is fraught with risk for many beneficiaries. “I happened to be in the market when the police beat up a bunch of people going to the bank to take out Rs 500 from their accounts. I ran for my own life,” Sayeed said.“There might have been some aberrations in the beginning. The police acted with sakhti (firmness) initially, but there’s really no need now. Thousands of people were going to the mandis (markets), so we had to shut them down. We don’t need to use violence or force. People in Assam have acted very maturely,” said Harmeet Singh, an additional general of police (ADGP) in Assam. “We have 13 helplines running for relief and 6 for psychological counselling. The police force has been turned into a relief force.”The district hasn’t registered any positive case of the coronavirus infection so far, but the villages have been nearly sealed. Apart from the police patrolling the borders, Sayeed said, “each village has put up its own barricade to prevent the entry of outsiders. Even the returning migrant workers can’t reach home anymore.”This situation isn’t unique to this village in Barpeta. As infections spread across cities and sometimes outside them, rural areas are facing multiple crises at once: from poverty to poor healthcare, from farm closures to fake news, from administrative gaps to police excess, from sweeping hunger to mass reverse migration.As the pandemic rips across the globe, infecting over two million people so far and confining the rest, it has thrown up challenges that even the richest and most resourceful nations apparently can’t overcome.In India, where the toll stands at 17,252 positive cases and 558 deaths, containing the numbers is as acute a need as feeding people and stopping the rumours.On April 1, as the pandemic entered its fourth month, the director-general of the World Health Organisation warned the world leaders of its “unintended consequences” for the “poorest and the most vulnerable.” The words bode ominously for many of India’s 649,481 villages where each new day of the epidemic marks a battle between self-sufficiency and disaster. As they tackle one problem after another, many people in the villages say they can at least rely on each other.ARM’S DISTANCE Take social distancing. In Rajasthan’s Viratnagar, the evening addas (get-togethers) are already a thing of the past, says Manish Naik, a social worker. “The shops open once a day between 6pm and 7 pm, and that’s the only time people see each other, but they are exchanging updates while keeping an arm’s distance.” In Ateli in Haryana’s Mahendragarh, neighbors are catching up roof-to-roof while wearing masks, says Komal Aggarwal, a college student. Even inside the house, where 21 people live as part of her joint family, new rules of interaction have been set. “We pass time by playing games, whether it’s carom board or antakshari, but we sit apart from each other while wearing masks. Even in the kitchen, where everyone is pitching in to cook, no more than three or four people go in at a time.” In Jharkhand’s Gumla district, villagers coming to the common service centre to collect cash sent to their Jan Dhan accounts. They stand in the spots allocated to them, says Kanchan Keshri, who runs the centre. “No one wants to touch another person,” Keshri added.The idea of physical distance has reached the remotest of places, but its execution varies widely. In Karnataka’s Challakere taluka, Naveen MS, a civil service aspirant, says many villages are grappling with the concept. “They just don’t know the meaning of it. In the slum areas, people are in close contact with each other. The men are still gathering under the trees in the evening to play their usual game of dice.” In higher-income areas, he said, some distance is being maintained between homes, but not inside the homes “where the emotional bonds are very tight”.“People baulk at the idea of social distance between mother and son, brother and sister,” he added.The outbreak has now spread to 364 of India’s 720 districts according to union health ministry data. As the numbers rise, many villages are securing their borders. Some panchayats are erecting bamboo barricades, and some are even setting up local task forces to stand guard. In a village in Maharashtra’s Satara district, says Prabhakar Sonwane, a lawyer, residents dug a moat to prevent entry and exit. “This old man who had a health emergency and was being taken to the hospital on a scooter fell into the trench and later died,” he said.RUMOUR MILLS In Jharkhand’s Gumla district, on April 8, a village mob attacked Anis Ansari from Basia Road for entering neighboring Bhadauli. “Rumours have gone viral in this area that infected Muslims are intentionally spreading the virus,” said Kanchan Keshri. While the seriously injured Ansari was taken to a hospital in Ranchi, a mob from Basia Road killed Bolwa Oraon from Bhadauli on suspicion of spreading these rumours. Three other men from Bhadauli were also attacked and suffered injuries. Jharkhand’s ADGP, ML Meena, confirmed the casualties.Such rumours are swirling across rural India. “WhatsApp, radio, television – there is no source of news that you can trust,” said Sonwane. “We have no idea what the situation is in Assam. One day you hear that there isn’t a single positive case in the state, next day you hear that there are 20 cases. On top of that, many people are using social media to create hatred between Hindus and Muslims,” said Sayeed. “The [state] government is using Twitter to release official information and bunk rumors, but only urban and educated people benefit from that. I think they should find a platform where everyone can access information equally and at the same time,” said Naveen MS.To make sure information reaches “the last man”, says Harmeet Singh, an additional director general of police in Assam, it must be circulated via multiple platforms. “In Assam, we first release the official statements on Twitter and Facebook and then take it further via YouTube, television and mobile phones including WhatsApp groups for every district. The police personnel are also asked to circulate the same information in their own personal networks. Early on, we released a very clear advisory for the public on how to deal with fake news,” he said. Initially, he said, “there was a bit of rumormongering. For example, there were posts exaggerating the number of those affected, which would cause confusion. These were pulled down. As of today, 40 odd people have been booked for spreading fake news and 200 counselled.”STRANDED MIRGANTS Worries about how their migrant-worker family members will make it back home, and how long they will have to spend in make-shift quarantine centres, are aggravating an already tense atmosphere in the villages. In the days following March 24, when the Prime Minister announced a three-week national lockdown, nearly 300,000 fled the cities even as road and rail transport halted.In west UP’s Hathras, Dalit-rights activist Sanjay Jatav says hundreds of wage workers have journeyed home. “Some of them walked from Delhi and Haryana. It took them three days to get here,” he said. Many of the returning migrants are kept in the district administration’s quarantine centres. On April 3, a migrant worker in Lakhimpur Kheri, Roshan Lal, killed himself after being allegedly beaten up by a police officer for missing quarantine attendance. Lal’s sister told reporters afterwards that he had left the centre to arrange for food for his family.Jatav and others in Hathras are also concerned about friends and family members stranded in the cities. “My brother is a machine operator at a factory in Badarpur in Delhi, and he hasn’t been able to come back since the factory closed. I wish someone would help him.” In his village in Latur’s Hisori taluka, Sonwane said, “There are around 1000 people and leaving aside 10 to 15 percent, everyone had migrated for work. Now, 95 percent of them have come back, but five percent are stuck in the cities without work or ration.” In Viratnagar, Naik says people are glad that wage workers have come back, but they are scared about the state of those in quarantine.“There are 25 people who came from Mumbai, and they are still being kept in a hostel outside the village. Their family members don’t know what’s going on, and they are very worried,” he added. Near his village, Domba, Keshri said two quarantine centres have come up. “But we don’t know if they have sufficient number of beds or if provision for regular meals.”In its response to a PIL filed at the Supreme Court, the home ministry acknowledged the scale of the problem. “This migration is not only dangerous for the migrant workers but also for rural India for which they have started the journey,” noted the status report filed on 27 March. The ministry estimates that 1.3 million people are housed in relief camps and shelter homes across India. It has ordered the local governments to use the state disaster relief fund to provide them food, shelter, clothing and medical aid wherever there are. The ministry has also instructed their employers to continue to pay their wages during the lockdown. The district officials are to screen and quarantine those workers who have already reached their destination as per standard health protocol. “The Government will shortly implement a system whereby the panic in the minds of these migrant workers is addressed keeping in view the socio-psychological issues,” the status report sent to the SC noted.There isn’t anything that their families can do in the meantime but sit at home. The country’s 3 million police officers must ensure that 1.3 billion people stay in, and many of them are using violence to get the job done. “The police patrolling is constant. Kaafi pitali ho rahi hai. (A lot of people are getting beaten up),” said Manish Naik about Viratnagar.“In Ateli, shops are allowed to open between 9am and 11am and people go out to buy essential supplies, but no one dares leave home after that,” said Komal Aggrawal. “People are being thrashed by the police if they are seen outside no matter how urgent their need,” said Sanjay Jatav about Hathras.FARM FEARS Cut off from their sources of income, people in the villages wonder how long they can carry on. An estimated 30% of India’s rural population falls below the poverty line according to a Mint analysis of the official figures. The average monthly surplus for rural households is limited to Rs 1,413.More than half of India’s workforce is engaged in farming, and the lockdown has affected every aspect of their work cycle: harvest, planting, procurement, labour, markets. “Kisan ka kamar toot gayi (this virus has broken the farmer’s back),” said Keshri. “People are harvesting their sugarcane crop in the villages here, but they can’t access the markets,” said Sonwane. “The farmers had taken private loans on high interest for the current crop, and those loans are not going to be waived.They are in great trouble,” said Sayeed. “I am harvesting the wheat crop in my own fields. We can’t employ farm labourers at this time. They are out of work completely,” said Manish Naik. In Challakere taluk, Naveen MS said the out-of-work labourers used up their savings to buy small stocks of essentials – vegetables, coconut – that they sold locally. “Now, they are borrowing from local moneylenders to continue the work.”Hunger is being discussed everywhere. “Majdoori nahin toh paise nahin. Paise nahin toh khana nahin. (No labour means no money and no money means no food),” said Jatav. “Morning to evening, people only talk about one thing here: how long will we survive if this continues,” Manish Naik.On 11 April, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) made a set of suggestions to the central government in anticipation of an extended lockdown. “We have requested that agriculture be given a relaxation or else the food security of India will be very adversely impacted. The wheat and rice crop is ready, but there is no labour available for harvest. If the farm produce doesn’t reach the markets and godowns, we are staring at a deep crisis of hunger,” said Ashok Dhavale, AIKS president. He pointed out that farmers, farm workers and unorganised labourers will be the first to face it. “We are demanding that 5 kilo of free ration be given to all of them for the next six months irrespective of whether they have ration cards or whether they are registered under this or that scheme,” he said.As part of the Indian government’s $22.6 billion economic stimulus plan, free food is to be distributed to 800 million families and free gas cylinders to registered beneficiaries. The measure signifies a huge relief for rural areas, but it’s all on the execution. The free ration is reaching some villages but not the others; some of the authorised shops are either hoarding it or charging people for it; some are distributing it selectively; and in some areas, the beneficiaries have no information about their entitlement.In the rural pockets of UP, Sumantra Goswami, an officer with the Prayaagraj district administration, says the delivery of free rations can be tricky. “Every day we are supplying bags of ration to multiple villages, but it’s difficult to reach some. At times, it takes us from morning to evening. Some areas are so remote, or the roads leading to them are in such bad shape, that no one agrees to carry the ration for fear that if their vehicle breaks down, they won’t find anyone to repair it because of the lockdown. We usually deliver the ration through our contacts in the relevant block or panchayat or police office, but the thing about UP is that unless you belong to the dominant caste or community in a village or have the support of the local political operators, you aren’t allowed to go in and intervene. In some cases, we also found that the village chiefs hoarded half of the relief supply sent to them to distribute,” Goswami said. As a result, he said, “we have villages where enough ration has reached to last two or three months, and then there are those that haven’t received any.”The AIKS has also demanded that the cash benefit to those below the poverty line be increased to R 5,000 per month. “Government is giving them grains, but families also need other essentials like milk and soap. How are whole families supposed to survive on R 500 a month. This is a cruel joke,” Ashok Dhavale said.Left to their own devices, many in India’s rural areas are drawing solace from knowing that they have each other. “My father grows his own vegetables, so when the neighbours can’t go to the market, they come to us,” said Komal Aggarwal from Ateli. Prabhakar Sonwane from Latur believes this lockdown is best survived in a village. “You have wide open spaces which reduce the risk of infection. And, in a village, one family can ask another for help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/virus-and-the-village-a-covid-chronicle/story-VF687Qp7jrwEP2O5FgTKQI.html
20-04-2020||Editorials||Hold Facebook, Google accountable | HT Editorial||On Monday, Australia announced that it will now force technology giants such as Facebook and Google to pay news companies for using content. This, the government said, was meant to ensure a “level playing field”, and came after an 18 month investigation into the power of these digital platforms by the country’s competition and consumer commission. Earlier this month, France’s top competition authority asked Google to negotiate with media companies, both publishers and agencies, for using snippets on its search engine and news aggregator and pay them proper remuneration. Both Australia and France are right. For too long, there has been an unfair ecosystem that has been built around the digital news landscape. Media organisations invest tremendous resources — personnel, editorial gatekeeping, overhead costs and distribution. Big digital intermediaries such as Facebook and Google take their content and push it on their platforms. But operating under ambiguous regimes, they pretend not to be media companies. This means they neither have the legal accountability that media organisations have, nor do they incur the same levels of expenditure. But they monopolise the revenue that streams into the digital news world. This has made several genuine media organisations unviable — reducing their profitability, forcing them to scale down their operations or even close down. This, in turn, hits not just particular companies but hurts democracy and the right of citizens to be informed. This crisis has become even more acute given the economic slowdown after the coronavirus pandemic. India is not immune from either the trends in the digital news world, or the slowdown. Media companies now face additional challenges. For traditional print platforms, circulation has dipped because of unfounded fears about the possibility of the infection spreading through newspapers. Revenue is hit due to the curtailment of advertisement spend by private companies as well as the government. In this backdrop, it is time for the government to institute clearer rules for intermediaries. It is time to get Facebook and Google to meet their legal obligations — it is no surprise that there is a proliferation of fake news on some of these platforms in the absence of stronger accountability rules. It is also time to get them to pay the rightful share of compensation to those platforms whose content they use and leverage to build their own audiences and profits. India must carefully consider other global examples and put a stop to the reckless and unfair trade practices adopted by digital intermediaries. It is, indeed, time for a level playing field — not just to help media, but also to preserve democracy and keep up the news-gathering mechanisms that are so essential to keeping citizens informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/hold-facebook-google-accountable-ht-editorial/story-GADdW5CHdtt7dulicQxPlI.html
20-04-2020||Editorials||PM Modi is right to call for unity | HT Editorial||In a blog on Sunday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi noted that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) does not see “race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking”. This, he underlined, meant that the response should attach primacy to “unity and brotherhood”. There is a common challenge that all countries and societies face; the solution therefore lies in resilience and togetherness.The pandemic has been a great leveller. Privilege and wealth have not been insurance policies against it. Given India’s diversity, where primordial identities often become faultlines for conflicts, the PM’s message has even more relevance. A united response, laced with empathy, is the only way out. But here is the problem. Supporters of the ruling dispensation themselves have engaged in divisive rhetoric — and sought to pin the blame for the spread of the disease on certain communities, particularly minorities. This newspaper has been categorical in calling the Tablighi Jamaat gathering irresponsible and criminal. But some people have used the gathering as an excuse to attack all Muslims, which, in turn, has made segments of the community reluctant to report symptoms and see a conspiracy against them when none exists. There have been irresponsible actions in various states — including keeping Muslim patients away or segregating patients. Everyone should internalise the PM’s message and stop playing politics over the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/pm-modi-is-right-to-call-for-unity-ht-editorial/story-43IMADOW0YNZVP4Stay0EI.html
