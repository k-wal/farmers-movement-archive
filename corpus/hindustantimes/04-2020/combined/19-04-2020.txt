19-04-2020||News||Overcoming structural constraints||In the course of history, bacteria and viruses have played a crucial part in changing the course of events, and contributed significantly to the rise and fall of civilisations. This is the not the first time humanity has been threatened by an invisible enemy; from the Spanish flu a century ago to the more recent global outbreaks of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), public health crises have shaken the very foundation of societies and countries. Yet, the fact that we were caught largely unawares says a lot about our research and preparedness against biological threats, priorities, and the fragility of economic and financial systems.As a percentage of GDP, India’s health budget has hovered below 1.5% for several years now. India’s per capita public expenditure on health has increased from ~621 per person in 2009-10 to ~1,657 in 2017-18, which is still far too low. By comparison, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries spent, on an average, 8.8% of GDP on health in 2017, the latest year for which figures are available. Only a fraction of India’s health care budget goes towards battling communicable diseases. This chronic underfunding is responsible for inadequate infrastructure. It is common knowledge that in-patient facilities in India are poor. However, some numbers can place the problem in perspective. According to a paper published by Brookings India last month, we have just 0.55 beds per 1,000 people. Twelve states, with 70% of the population, are below the national average. These include states in central, northern and western India, where the maximum number of the coronavirus disease cases (Covid-19) have been reported. When rural-urban and economic disparities are taken into account, the threat of any serious pandemic overwhelming the health care system is real. The health outlay for the current financial year is grossly inadequate. As a first step, budget allocations need to be scaled up. The pandemic has accelerated the recent decline of various sectors of the economy. The International Labour Organization has warned that over 400 million Indians in the informal sector may fall into a vicious cycle of poverty. This demands long-term planning to support businesses through loan moratoriums, lower interest rates, greater State contributions for employee benefits, a transition to no-contagion workplaces, and institutional support for their participation in the no-touch economy. Agriculture must be supported through liberal and assured procurement, lower input costs and forbearance in agricultural lending and loan recoveries till the crisis blows over. The Goods and Services Tax and income tax administration must be steered towards lower rates and lighter burdens of compliance.Social distancing and personal hygiene have become watchwords as effective strategies to prevent the spread of the disease. They are indeed effective. Staying at home assumes that everybody has a home right where they are. Sadly, the large-scale internal exodus from cities to rural areas suggests otherwise. Nearly half our population cannot store food and essentials beyond a few days, after which they must step out or have these delivered to them. The postal department and select courier companies should be roped in to ensure door-to-door coverage wherever needed.Health care personnel are scarce. They are precious resources at any time, but even more so now. They need appropriate protective gear, machinery and medicines to help Covid-19 patients. There is no evidence that India lacks the raw materials, the technical know-how or the entrepreneurial spirit to plug the gaps. However, access to capital, standardisation and testing facilities, and protracted procurement procedures remain limiting factors. A transparent emergency procurement policy must be implemented to cut red-tape. Several promising low-cost ventilator designs have become available and should be taken into production. Hundreds of doctors embedded in non-medical streams, such as the civil service, armed forces, and the pharmaceutical industry must be marshalled to support the frontline care providers. Thousands of recently-retired doctors and nurses can be marshalled to support patients with other health concerns. Pooled testing, where samples are pooled to run Covid-19 tests, should be implemented to identify and isolate high-risk clusters. This can significantly make up for the short supply of testing kits. None of the National Disaster Management Authority’s four members has experience in biological disasters. This institutional defect should be rectified quickly, possibly by expanding the body to include the director- general of health services. A separate body with adequate resources and expertise can also be considered on the lines of Taiwan, where a flexible command structure, a comprehensive epidemic prevention strategy, medical big data, and proactive public information disclosure, all through a central epidemic situation command centre and other institutions and collaborations, have made the country a model for coronavirus response.The provision of authentic information and the debunking of fake news need special attention in today’s networked world. State governments have risen to the challenge and instituted practices sensitive to local requirements. Successful handling of the crisis is likely to strengthen people’s faith in democratic institutions and good governance. Marginalised people become even more vulnerable in emergencies. We must maintain the robustness of our plural country to ensure a unified response to the challenge, for acknowledgement of interdependence would enable us to better leverage our strengths. As a learning from this crisis, we must implement long-range policies and programmes to meet such challenges in the future. It is everybody’s battle, and credit is due to all those who are making great and small sacrifices to achieve this collective goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/overcoming-structural-constraints/story-BJxyGSlqb7uyrJcZxc6AnO.html
19-04-2020||News||Sewage testing can help track the spread of Covid-19 infection||The fight against the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is at a critical juncture. To gauge the extent of the infection, the Government of India now plans to expand random testing in areas with no reported cases. It will use a combination of the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, also known as RT-PCR, on pooled samples and antibody detection tests. Another strategy that can help delineate the areas with silent transmission is testing sewage samples for the coronavirus (Sars-CoV2). By now, we know that the Covid-19 disease is caused by Sars-CoV2, and that only in 20% of the cases, the severity of the infection requires hospitalisation. In 30% of the hospitalised patients, the virus has been detected in samples from the respiratory tract as well as from faeces. We also know that about 80% of the infections are mild and do not require hospitalisation. Among mild infections, the symptoms are mainly low-grade fever, slight cough, sore throat, running nose, but some also a few gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms may occur alone or in combination with cough and sore throat. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms have a longer duration of illness and shed virus in stools. In nearly 25% of patients, nucleic acid particles are detected in stool as early as within three days of the infection – even before it appears in the respiratory tract. (However, the virus is detected in stools even in those who have only respiratory symptoms.) These findings suggest the importance of testing sewage samples to detect Sars-CoV2.In past, sewage or waste-water monitoring has been used successfully to detect the outbreaks of norovirus, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, measles and polioviruses. Similarly, a few countries have already started monitoring sewage/waste-water for Covid-19. In Amsterdam, the virus was detected in waste-water at Schiphol airport, just four days after the Netherlands confirmed its first case, well before the infection was reported in the community. Its samples have been found in raw sewage in Tucson (Arizona). Sweden and Germany are also doing sewage analysis.Sewage surveillance can be an effective method to ascertain the presence of the virus a community even if individuals are asymptomatic for Covid-19. Moreover, the density of the viral particles can give us an idea of the infection’s spread. This can also help us verify if the interventions such as physical distancing reduce the transmission. Regular and periodic sewage surveillance can be an early warning tool to alert public health authorities of the likelihood of a rise in cases, giving them crucial headway for preparation. As it is not possible to test everyone in a community, sewage surveillance has the potential to unearth the positive cases within it. Such monitoring can also provide a better estimation of the infection’s spread as it can account for those who have not been tested, or show only mild symptoms, or are asymptomatic. Sewage sampling could also serve as an early warning about the emergence of clusters. It can also act as a sensitive indicator for the reappearance of the virus. The sewage surveillance for Covid-19 in India is possible and feasible.India has, however, domestic examples to emulate. It is one of the first countries to use the sewage surveillance (also known as the environmental surveillance) to detect the silent transmission for the poliovirus through shedding in the community sewage system. India used to rely on acute flaccid paralysis (lameness survey). But it is a well-known fact that the paralysis happens only in severe cases; many infected children shed the virus without having the illness as well. In 2001, the environmental surveillance was initiated, with sewage sampling conducted weekly from three sites in Mumbai, and by 2017, there were 42 sewage sampling sites spread over Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Telangana and Delhi. We have trained human resource to carry out the sewage surveillance for Covid-19. It can be an effective tool, especially in states with a large number of cases. Since the infection was reported in December in China last year, we know some of the critical information about the virus, but there are still a large number of unknowns. One such unknown is if the virus particles are detected in stool, can they transmit through faeces? Scientists have detected high concentrations of viral particles in stool, but have so far not observed replication in the virus in it. Though, current evidence does not support faecal transmission of Covid-19 through stool, sewage surveillance can act as an infection-related marker of many things. It is worth giving it a try.

19-04-2020||News||Can convalescent plasma therapy help treat the coronavirus disease?||The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) has spread across the world with no solution in immediate sight. The first case was reported on December 30, 2019, in China, but until now, no country in the world has been able to develop any vaccine that prevents the disease, or anti-viral drug that cures it. There is, however, an inexpensive and readily-available antiviral agent that has got little attention: The virus-neutralising antibody found in people having fully recovered from SARS-CoV2 infection. To give a bit of background, the human blood contains a yellow fluid known as plasma in which the red and white cells are suspended. The plasma contains albumin, globulins and hundreds of other proteins that are essential for physiologic functions of the body. Those deficient in these proteins undergo plasma replacement, which is not uncommon any more. The process requires a plasmapheresis machine, which takes blood from the donor (healthy and free of HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses) and, after extracting the plasma, returns the rest of the blood cells to her body. The extracted plasma is then frozen in the blood bank for later use – such as in the case of haemophilia, a well-known bleeding disorder with a deficient protein, Factor VIII. The disorder requires plasma infusion into the body, a standard treatment for haemophilia until purified Factor VIII became commercially available. Besides, there are many “autoimmune” disorders affecting multiple organs that require “immunoglobulins” derived from plasma.Blood also contains red blood cells, which has different antigens in different people and act as a marker of the blood groups. For transfusion, blood is matched for compatibility, which, in case of mismatch, can result in a fatal transfusion reaction. But devoid of cells, plasma is safe from transfusion reaction.Plasma-derived immunoglobulins are commonly used to prevent serious viral infections. To treat dog bite, for instance, anti-rabies immunoglobulin is the first medical treatment administered after first aid. Or the needle-stick injury in hospitals that carries the risk for hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis B immunoglobulin from antibody-positive donors is the first treatment. In both instances, antibodies neutralise the virus that has just entered the body through the dog-bite or needle-stick injury. When exposed to measles or chicken-pox, immunoglobulins derived from persons with antibodies is the standard treatment to protect children undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Covid-19 is particularly dangerous for senior citizens, as they have a relatively weak immune system, and younger people with chronic lung disease, a heart condition, hypertension, diabetes, and those on therapies that affect the immune system. Critical Covid-19 pneumonia affects both the lungs simultaneously, leading to severe oxygen deficiency (hypoxemia), affecting body organs and tissues. If not corrected immediately, this may result in death. Hypoxemia’s treatment requires putting the patient on a mechanical ventilator under the intensive care unit. But in spite of aggressive oxygen therapy, many patients die. So, to come to the original question, why do physicians not employ or recommend the potentially life-saving therapy using antibody-containing plasma to treat the Covid-19 pneumonia? Because the world over, physicians are taught to practice “evidence-based medicine”. This treatment has a paucity of evidence, but it is not because the plasma method was tried and failed, but because doctors are waiting for the concrete evidence to emerge. The evidence, however, can emerge from the cumulative experience of plasma therapy, or, simply, research studies. In an emergency situation, the wiser approach is to employ the empirical application on a number of severely-ill patients not recovering with aggressive oxygen therapy. The data accumulated will give statisticians the opportunity to derive evidence of efficacy, if that is truly the case.Research, on the other hand, will entail a drug trial involving a treatment arm and a control arm, both given standard treatment with ventilators. The cases have to be randomised into two groups, one given plasma therapy, and the other placebo. After the trial is over, the treatment’s efficacy can be quantified by statistical comparison of outcomes in both the arms.One wonders if the research approach is a wise idea in the current context, since the convalescent plasma is known to contain ant-viral immunoglobulins and are reasonably safe. We don’t have any reason to justify its denial to a control group only because the dice of randomisation fell against their favour while others are offered the plasma. Chinese physicians have published two reports of convalescent plasma therapy in very severe cases of Covid-19 pneumonia cases on ventilators: Five patients in one report, and 10 in the other. All the 15 showed rapid improvement. The fever came down and viral loads decreased. We urge physicians working in Covid-19 hospitals to gain experience in plasma therapy, with careful observation and documentation of all details. In the case of plasma therapy for other conditions, adverse reactions have rarely been reported, but for the very ill Covid-19 patients not recovering despite administering aggressive standard treatment, the benefit far outweighs the risk. This approach requires testing for Immunoglobulin G, or IgG, antibodies against SARS-CoV2 in recovered convalescent persons and healthy ones in the community with previous Covid-19 infections. For every positive case, four to five persons would be silently infected. Health authorities must design antibody surveys with the dual purpose of identifying antibody-positive individuals: One, this will enable them to safely return to work; and, two, if healthy and willing, they could donate plasma.

Officials said the person handling the Facebook page claimed it belonged to a liquor vend in Panchkula’s Sector 7 . Regular posts informing people that they would deliver liquor at home have gone viral on social media.The matter came to the fore when a cyber cell official came across the posts. Inspector Lalit Kumar, the Sector 5 SHO, said a cyber cell official deputed to monitor social media found the Facebook page where the handler assured delivery of liquor at the door step. The matter was then taken up with senior police officials.“Amid the lockdown, all liquor vends are closed and no one can sell or buy liquor. The number mentioned on the Facebook page was found to be of Odisha, and as per initial investigation, the page was found to be fake,” the SHO said. A case has been registered under the Information Technology Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-fb-page-offers-home-delivery-of-liquor-in-panchkula-unidentified-persons-booked/story-Ej4xqsk6y3ks5uFLILgNvI.html

Health officials said that 11 of the positive cases were linked to people who attended various religious congregations, while one case was of a 71-year-old man from Indirapuram.With the 12 new cases, the total number of Covid-19 patients in Ghaziabad has gone up to 42, and 10 of them have been discharged from different hospitals. On Sunday, three Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment were discharged from the L1-category hospital at Muradnagar after being cured.“Ghaziabad recorded a total of 12 Covid-19 positive cases on Sunday. Eleven of them are the ones who attended religious congregations. Their second test reports have come positive while their first reports were negative. From now, we will be conducting tests only after at least seven days. The 11 are primarily from the Pasonda area in Sahibabad. They were brought to the quarantine centre after being picked up by police and health teams early this month,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad.Meanwhile, the district has received 1,000 rapid test kits (RTKs), which will be used in conducting random tests in containment zones from Monday, the officials said. “One of the 12 patients tested positive on Sunday is a 71-year-old man who was on chemotherapy at a hospital in Noida. He is a resident of Indirapuram. We are preparing documents so that he can be shifted to L3 category hospital at Meerut Medical College,” the CMO added.Most of the 11 Covid-19 patients are native of Ranchi in Jharkhand, and had been in hiding at Pasonda, Gupta said. Till Sunday evening, the health department was awaiting reports of 443 samples.“Majority of the cases in Ghaziabad have come from areas of Masuri, Pasonda and Islam Nagar which have now become hot spots of the infection. We will now be conducting random tests in these areas from Monday with the help of 1,000 rapid test kits which we have received,” Gupta said.The district administration on Saturday night sealed street number 4 at Islam Nagar after a woman, who delivered a child on April 16, had tested positive for coronavirus.“The area, which houses about 100 families, has been sealed. The health department teams were taking up sanitization and other procedures as per health protocols. The administration has also removed two high-rises -- KDP Grand Savana at Raj Nagar Extension and Girnar Apartment, Kaushambi -- from the list of hot spot areas,” said Shiv Prakash Shukl, city magistrate.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey also confirmed that the two high-rises were moved out of the hot spot list.In another development on Sunday, a group of private doctors and health care persons lodged at a quarantine centre at Dasna took to social media and alleged lack of facilities at the centre.The group has majority of people from different private health establishments who had tended to the 25-year-old woman who delivered child on April 16 and was declared corona positive on Saturday.“We had to take to social media as there were dumps of garbage at the quarantine centre, besides dusty surroundings. There are mosquitoes and no tea or food was provided to us till Sunday afternoon. So, our group prepared videos and posted them on the social media,” said one of the doctors from the group.When asked, the CMO said that some areas were not clean and there was some delay in provision of food.“After the videos got viral, we rushed teams and garbage was cleaned and food was also provided. There was some delay in providing food to the quarantined persons. We will take up the issue with agency, which is tasked to provide services here,” he said.So far as the use of RTKs are concerned, officials of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have said that such kits are not meant for diagnosis but should ideally be used for surveillance purposes to establish trends.ICMR has recommended that since the gold standard frontline test for Covid-19 is real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which is aimed at early detection, the rapid antibody test could not be a substitute for it.Unlike the RT-PCR, which detects the virus’ genetic material (RNA) in swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid tests detect antibodies in the blood and indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus. The rapid tests can show results within 30 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-records-12-new-covid-19-cases-in-single-day-gets-1-000-rapid-test-kits/story-ssnDmgzHeooXbr7sjcagIJ.html
19-04-2020||City||1,300 members of Mahanubhav Panth sect shifted from Latur to Pune||Around 1,300 members of ‘Mahanubhav Panth’ a sect worshiping lord Krishna, stranded in their Latur-based ashram in Maharashtra due to the lockdown, were on Sunday shifted to their main base at Junnar in Pune district.The members were brought in 40 buses and following social distancing norms after the state government issued a special order in view of the damage caused to the ashram by unseasonal rains at Latur where around 4,000 members had gathered. The ashram at Latur district was in open field away from main town. The Disaster Management, Help and Rehabilitation department on April 17 had issued a special order instructing the Latur district administration to make special transport arrangements to shift all the 1,341 followers of Mahanubhav Panth. These members were brought to Devdatta Ashram in Junnar, which is their main base having capacity to house around 4,000 people, said district collector Naval Kishore Ram.“We have followed all norms while bringing them here. These 1,341 followers were brought to Devdatta Ashram in Junnar in 40 buses on Sunday,” said an official from district administration on anonymity.According to officials, these sect members went to another ashram at Nilanga in Latur district, 400 kilometres from Pune, on February 26 for a religious congregation. However, the lockdown prevented them from coming back to Pune in March.The order issued by the state government stated, that local administration at Latur was asked to carry out health check-up of all these members following which the journey was allowed.“Due to lockdown, all these people could not return to their original ashram in Pune district. Meanwhile, rain and thunderstorm caused heavy damage to the ashram in Nilanga and the accommodation of the occupants became an issue. So the district administration was instructed to carry out health check-up of all these followers before allowing them to board the buses,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-300-members-of-mahanubhav-panth-sect-shifted-from-latur-to-pune/story-L6bGlXseDdYM7uApUaOJ0I.html

The family is a resident of Vijay Garden, Ghodbunder Road.The father, Shashi Yadav, 53, said that his son Vishal Yadav has a skin allergy since a week which has caused red patches on his body. Moreover, he is unable to get the medicines prescribed by his doctors in India. He added that medical stores in South Shields, UK, where his son is staying in an apartment, are demanding a prescription from the local doctors to provide the medicines. The local doctors have also denied an appointment without a registration in the local bodies. The family has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for help and forwarded the request to district authorities and MLAs in the area.“My son is stuck in an apartment in South Shields with three to four other students. He went there to pursue a course in Nautical Science. Last week, he developed a skin disease which caused painful red patches on his body. He had this skin problem in India too for which a doctor had prescribed a medicine. He went to the local medical stores in UK with the prescription, however, was denied,” he said. He added that the medical store asked him to get a prescription from a local doctor. “Local doctors are not ready to give an appointment without registration with local bodies, who in turn claim to be busy with the outbreak to provide any new registration. I want the district authorities to contact the local bodies in the UK to provide treatment to my son.”Rajesh Narvekar, district collector, said, “We will forward the request to the state and try to contact the consulate to provide him medical aid.”Local MLA of the area, Pratap Sarnaik also said that he will approach the chief minister to forward the request to appropriate authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-family-writes-to-pm-district-authorities-to-seek-treatment-for-son-suffering-from-skin-allergy-in-uk/story-Mr6xQJVI4iLTG7U8UUwkzL.html

19-04-2020||City||Noida: With no ration, people looking for food not getting through the helplines||Noida: Though the district administration, the police department and the authorities had launched helpline numbers for residents to call on in case they need medical or essential items, or in case of emergencies, many intended recipients say the service has fallen short of its goals.Many from impoverished backgrounds, who are in need of assistance the most as several of them have lost their sources of livelihood due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, allege that either the wait to get through to an operator on the helpline is too long or their pleas for help go unattended.“We are a cluster of nearly 30 jhuggis (shanties) and for almost a week, we have been scraping the bottom of the jars for food. We have been trying to contact anyone who can help us and tried several numbers of government helplines that we got from people. However, there was no response at all. If a call finally did go through, the operator gave us another number to call. I heard from a neighbour that we could get rations at a police post. I approached a constable on duty at a barricade in Sector 76 but she did not provide any help. Then I contacted one of my employers who gave me the number of a police officer who then gave me the number of a police response vehicle (PRV), who then gave me a number of the chowki. All of them kept saying that help will come but it never did,” said Rukmani, who worked as a domestic help and lives in a cluster in Sector 75.She said that eventually, the families in the area were helped out by the intervention of citizens who provided them with basic groceries.“Most of the calls are going to the control room now but if we come to know through someone about genuine needs, the local police does provide help,” said Dharmendra Sharma, station house officer, Sector 49 police station, under whose jurisdiction the area falls.There are others who allege that despite several attempts, their calls are not going through.“I must have tried calling the number of the control room at least five to six times but to no avail. We even tried calling at odd hours to avoid a busy network but that didn’t work either. I work as a security guard in Sector 63. We are from Deoria district but were not able to go back home. My family is struggling to make ends meet because of a lack of basic necessities and with no sign of any help on the way,” said Abbas, who is staying at a plot in B block, Sector 63.Another family residing nearby had a similar story to share. “A dog bit me and I went to the district hospital for treatment when I came across this number. We got through after several days and we were assured that help would reach us. Today, finally after three days, we received rations and that too through the help of someone from the media that we contacted,” said Neelam Devi, whose husband used to run a tea stall in the area before the lockdown.On Friday, a Noida PRV had helped out a cancer patient in Kannauj district by sending medicine from here. While on one hand the administration and the police department say they are reaching out to the needy and helping them, the ground level reality is different, with people being redirected from one department to another, coupled with engaged lines and endless wait, among others.The police department had earlier appointed nodal officers while the authorities had also issued contact numbers for emergencies.“There are many helpline numbers. But we are also receiving calls on a daily basis at the police helpline number -- 112. Depending on the emergency, we either contact the health department or the police take action themselves if the need is for food or medicines,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration had even formed an integrated, ‘all in one’ control room model where all departments such as the district administration, the health department, the police, and the three development authorities could be reached through a single helpline number - 18004192211. Officials had said that they are capable of handling as many as 30 calls at one go.“Many calls are coming in. If there is an issue with the lines being engaged, we will look into it immediately,” said Anand Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate (judicial), one of the officials managing the integrated control room.When HT tried calling the helpline on Saturday evening, the line became engaged at the food services option after going through the automated menu.

19-04-2020||City||Corona crisis: Residents can pay water bills by June 30||NOIDA: In view of the ongoing nationwide lockdown, the Uttar Pradesh government has asked the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to allow residents to pay water bills of March, April and May by the end of June, instead of paying them every month. The government has postponed payment of water bills after residents demanded for the same.“Residents can pay these bills by June end, 2020, as we have postponed the payment in view of Covid-19 pandemic,” said Alok Tandon, principal secretary with UP infrastructure and industrial department. Tandon, who is also chairman of Noida and Greater Noida authorities, communicated the decision with the residents.Recently, the Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Association (CONRWA), a residents’ body, had through a letter requested for postponement of paying water bills.“We had requested the postponement of the bill payment because many residents cannot pay the same via online and they cannot visit the water department or the other department of the authority physically due to nationwide lockdown,” said Brigadier (retired) Ashok Hak, convenor of CONRWA (Noida chapter).“As of now, the residents are under immense strain as their jobs are affected, and they cannot move out of their houses amid Covid -19 safety issues. So, the government should not put any such burden,” said PS Jain, president of CONRWA.In Gautam Budh Nagar district, there are about 78,000 and 80,000 water consumers under the jurisdiction of Noida authority and Greater Noida authority, respectively. Most of them are yet to pay the dues, the officials said. Even before the lockdown came into effect, the two industrial development authorities have struggled to recover water bills from their consumers that include builders, private firms and individuals. The state government has already extended date of payment of water bills for industrial, institutional and commercial units in the two industrial authorities’ jurisdiction due to Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corona-crisis-residents-can-pay-water-bills-by-june-30/story-oHjKe2nciFjUtgphKZnxUP.html

The decision was taken after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a video conference with all the district magistrates and senior officials of the administration on Sunday evening.On April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the countrywide lockdown will be extended till May 3. “In Ghaziabad, we will maintain the status quo and no activity will be restarted from April 20. This decision has been taken due to a higher number of cases in the district,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.“Only the industrial units, which are manufacturing or supplying essential items, will continue their operations like before. There will be curbs on movement during the lockdown. If anyone is found moving around without passes authorised by officials, legal action will be taken under provisions of the Disaster Management Act and relevant sections of the IPC,” he added.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, during the video conference on Sunday, told the district magistrates that there would be no easing down of the lockdown in hot spot areas. He also asked the principal secretary (health) not to open the 19 sensitive districts which have 10 or more Covid-19 cases in the state.The CM directed the district magistrates to take a call on lockdown relaxations while urging the DMs of 19 districts to decide on the basis of “awareness and alertness” after intimating the government.A couple of days ago, Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), had said that the work for expressways, highways, roads, construction of medical colleges and big housing projects could take off from April 20 if required protocols are followed and permissions are obtained.According to officials of the industries department there are about 32,000 different categories of industrial units in Ghaziabad, which also include about 350 registered export-oriented units.Nearly 600 units, which are involved in production of essential items, are presently in operation.“The number of coronavirus cases in Ghaziabad rose sharply on Sunday. On Saturday, we had a total of 30 positive cases but 12 more cases were reported on Sunday. This is by far the sharpest spike in the number of coronavirus positive cases that have emerged in a single day in Ghaziabad. We will now intensify our containment efforts and real-time monitoring in a more aggressive manner,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer(CMO).From Saturday night, the Ghaziabad police also initiated a seven-day special drive in order to enforce lockdown in a stricter manner. “The cops have been directed to penalise and issue challans to people if more than one person was found riding a two-wheeler. The maximum number of persons permitted in a four-wheeler is two,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural).By Sunday evening, the police had issued challans to 3,800 people and also seized 117 vehicles as a part of the drive.Till Sunday evening, Ghaziabad had a tally of 42 positive cases, with 10 patients being discharged from different hospitals. In UP, the number of cases crossed the 1,000 figure mark and stood at 1,084, of which 108 cases were discharged from hospitals.“We have ramped up sampling and testing. More than 2,000 samples are being tested every day. Till date, we have tested 2,8447 samples of which 27,363 turned negative. Of the cases emerged so far, we have 78% related to men and 22% related to women,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).The officials also said that 18.5% cases were in age group of 0-20 years; 47.3% in the age group 21 to 40 years, 24.7% in the age group of 41-60, and 9.4% cases were in the age group of over 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-video-conference-with-cm-ghaziabad-decides-against-partial-lifting-of-lockdown/story-iD7u8BsiWgZOkKqG9uQ2tJ.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC to put high-risk contacts on anti-malarial drug||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday announced its decision to treat high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients, with doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-malarial drug.Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial drug being used to prevent the spread of the Sars cov2 virus which is causing Covid-19. However, there are several side-effects to the drug which include headache, dizziness, ringing in ears; nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, weight loss; mood changes, feeling nervous or irritable; skin rash or itching, and hair loss.The civic body also clarified that it will not put those residing in containment zones on HCQ, citing medical complications. Last week, it was decided that the BMC would give HCQ to citizens residing in Covid-19 hotspots like Worli and Dharavi. However, the decision has been put on hold.For the past two weeks, the BMC had put frontline staffers on a seven-week dosage of HCQ, and is testing them for the coronavirus. HT had reported on March 29 that the frontline staff will be put on the drug to improve their immunity and tackle the threat of the virus. The decision was taken as a precautionary measure after many countries such as Spain, Iran, and Italy, reported that their doctors and medical staff tested positive while attending to infected patients.Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “As of Saturday’s protocol, the BMC has decided to give HCQ to all high-risk contacts of Covid-19 positive patients. BMC has already given HCQ to frontline staff, doctors, nurses, supporting staff of hospitals, sanitary workers, BEST employees, police personnel and civic officers.” The civic chief clarified that HCQ will not be given to all persons in containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-put-high-risk-contacts-on-anti-malarial-drug/story-Ao6SlpXcIk7rfqqmUImUMJ.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||Barber in the gym in this society||Over the past three days, around 40 society members of Mahindra Park at Ghatkopar have got haircuts and shaves after almost a month’s gap. “A lot of our society members were complaining they wanted to go out to get a shave and haircut, but couldn’t because of the lockdown. Which is when we decided that our gym can be converted into a salon,” said Dr Abdul Ghani Khan, secretary of the society.A barber from the neighbourhood was stationed at the gym in Mahindra Park. Before bringing him in, all necessary precautions were taken and the barber was provided gloves and masks, added Khan. “The gym, where this barber was stationed, was sanitised twice to thrice a day so that no one gets infected,” said Dr Dyaneshwar Mahajan, chairman of the society.The 440-member society has also distributed around five kilograms of rice, two kilograms of dal and one kilogram of sugar to 1,200 underprivileged people in neighbouring slum areas. Around 200 members from the society have contributed around Rs 4 lakh so far and another donation drive may be organised again.“There are around 70 Muslim families in the society. We had a discussion with them and they can donate their zakat money [traditionally intended for alms] for needy slum dwellers, which can be distributed irrespective of religion. Some other members of our society have also shown keen interest in participating,” said Khan. Mahindra Park’s committee has also a makeshift store at the society office where essentials such as milk, groceries and vegetables are sold at wholesale rates to society members. Supplies like rice, dal, wheat and milk were procured from the wholesale market through a society member who is associated with the markets held by Agriculture Produce Market Committee.“The elderly are provided essentials at their doorsteps, and for younger residents, only five people are allowed at a time around the society office,” said resident Ashish Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/barber-in-the-gym-in-this-society/story-eZFPjEy2AXKvFGx0Te6zlM.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||Recovered Kasturba staffer gets a warm welcome in her society||The first two medical staffers at Kasturba Gandhi Hospital who contracted Covid-19 through cross-transmission got discharged on Sunday. Almost 200 medical staffers across the city have tested positive for Covid-19 so far.In the first week of April, a 40-year-old midwife stationed at the isolation ward got diagnosed with the infection. Soon after, another class IV employee, who worked as a sweeper in the same ward, contracted the infection. After both of them tested negative on two consecutive tests, they were discharged on Sunday.Neighbours welcomed the midwife back home by showering her with flowers while some blew conch or rang bells to laud her for her service. Talking to HT, the woman said, “I was really overwhelmed with the response. I am thankful that people didn’t stigmatise me.” She said upon learning that she was given duty at the Covid ward of the hospital, she insisted that her husband and son move to their hometown to avoid any possible chance of infection. “I knew it was my duty, but I didn’t want to expose my family to it so I forced them to go,” she said. Meanwhile, a 40-year-old ward boy stationed at the out-patient department (OPD) has been quarantined at the hospital after developing symptoms such as cough and fever. “We have taken his swab sample and sent it for testing. We will get the report by Monday,” said a doctor from the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/recovered-kasturba-staffer-gets-a-warm-welcome-in-her-society/story-LadfHm9is3iRnVKCTqF1RM.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC directs doctors to resume private practice for non-Covid-19 patients||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday asked private doctors to keep their clinics open to treat non-Covid-19 related health issues. Considering all BMC hospitals are struggling under the weight of both, Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, the civic body decided to distribute some of the burden to private hospitals and clinics.The directive was issued during a meeting between municipal commissioner Pravin Pardeshi and representatives of private clinics and nursing homes. The civic body, under orders from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, has created a special screening mechanism.“Many private clinics have shut down for lack of protection to health staff due to a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Now the civic body has decided to address the problems of all private clinics so that they can open and take over a load of non-Covid-19 patients,” said Pardeshi.The BMC has also suggested that doctors and paramedical staff above the age of 60, and those with underlying medical conditions should avoid practising.Joint commissioner of police Vinay Choubey (law and order in Mumbai) was also present for the meeting and assured that travel passes would be issued for private health staffers. BMC’s move came immediately after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his Facebook address on Sunday morning clarified that private doctors will resume their practices, especially for non-Covid related diagnoses and treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-directs-doctors-to-resume-private-practice-for-non-covid-19-patients/story-Ios0TSbp1SgEz79AfWoPbN.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena reaches out to Governor even as Raut slams him over CM nominations||On Sunday, when senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut indirectly criticised Governor B S Koshyari over delay in nominating chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to the Legislative Council, two party leaders met the latter at Raj Bhavan. The development assumes significance in the context that Thackeray has to become a member of one of the two houses of the state legislature within six months of taking oath as the CM, the deadline of which ends on May 28. Koshyari has not yet responded to the cabinet’s recommendation to nominate the CM to the Legislative Council, which has made the Sena top brass restless. Thackeray will have to resign if he does not become a legislator by the stipulated date. “Raj bhavan , governor’s house shouldn’t become center for political conspiracy. Remember ! history doesn’t spare those who behave unconstitutionally (sic),” Raut tweeted on Sunday, referring to the delay in the Governor’s decision on Thackeray’s nomination.On the same day, two senior Sena leaders — CM’s close aide Milind Narvekar and party’s south Mumbai MP Arvind Sawant — called on the Governor at Raj Bhavan. Both met Koshyari separately. Sawant confirmed the meeting but said it was a personal call. “We have worked together in Parliament and I know him well, it was a personal call,” he said. Narvekar was unavailable for comment.A top Sena leader said the party leadership has reached out to the Governor so that Thackeray’s nomination happens smoothly. “At a time when Thackeray and the entire state machinery is busy fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, it will be better to avoid any unnecessary political controversy. That’s what we are trying to do,” he said, on condition of anonymity. Raj Bhavan sources confirmed the developments on Sunday. An official said the Governor has sought legal opinion on the issue. Thackeray had planned to contest a by-election to the upper house of the state legislature, scheduled in April but was postponed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. Thus, the state cabinet on April 9 recommended the Governor to nominate Thackeray to the council. State BJP, however, slammed Raut for his comment.BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said: “I am sure the Governor will take a decision as per the constitutional provisions. The Sena leaders should wait for his decision instead of criticising him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-reaches-out-to-governor-even-as-raut-slams-him-over-cm-nominations/story-Eu0gudV7VyMtHZkTmlFCtI.html

At least 2,380 inmates lodged in the jail will now be screened and the samples of 18 staff who were in contact with the warder has been collected. Six others have been put under home quarantine. Officials say that the warder was deployed outside the barracks and had not been in close contact with any of the inmates.Jai Kishan Chillar, superintendent of Bhondsi jail, said the 40-year-old warder was on leave for the last one week. “The warder took emergency leave for three days to meet his wife in Bhiwani, who was unwell. He was on leave from April 10 and was to return on duty on April 13. He extended his leave by three days and returned on April 16. We followed the Covid-19 protocol, which states that anyone who goes out of the jail premises has to get tested for the virus before resuming duty. He had no visible symptoms but we asked the warder to get tested for Covid-19 at sector 10 Civil Hospital. He was admitted to the quarantine after giving his samples. He tested positive on Sunday. Later in the day, his wife too tested positive.”Gurugram is a ‘red zone’ for having a large number of Covid-19 positive cases, along with Nuh (57 cases), Palwal (34), and Faridabad (42). To prevent contamination, the jail premises and all the barracks have been sanitized by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram ( MCG).The medical teams have also started the screening of all the inmates to check for influenza-like illness. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, Gurugram chief medical officer, said, “The warder is undergoing treatment in Civil Hospital. Eighteen samples of his close contacts have been taken. All the people who met him, including a man who drove him on a motorcycle to Civil Hospital for getting tested, have been placed under quarantine. Our teams will be screening staff and inmates with the help of the medical team of Bhondsi jail.”Following the state jail department’s instructions, Bhondsi Jail officials on March 21 converted one of its barracks into a quarantine cell for new inmates who are to be kept there for 14 days before being transferred to their barracks. Chillar said that 80 inmates have come to Bhondsi Jail in the last one week and they have been shifted to the quarantine cell after medical tests. A separate quarantine room for jail staff has also been set up.Chillar said the meeting of inmates with their family members has also been cancelled till further orders and no outsider is allowed on the jail premises. “We have suspended visitations as the inmates live in close proximity and can be a threat to others. We are taking all precautionary measures and have directed the inmates to use the two landline service to make calls and to connect with their friends and family members till May 3,” he said.“Each inmate was has been given two cotton masks and has been directed to use them once out of their barracks. We have placed sanitisers at the entrance of each barrack and no one is allowed to enter without using it. The staff at the gate has been asked to monitor the temperature of all people entering the premises with a non-contact infrared temperature measurement gun twice a day,” Chillar, said.Jail inmates have also been refrained from gathering in large groups. All activities — such as yoga, music and other classes — have been suspended at the jail. The inmates, however, have been involved in the task of stitching cotton masks. Till now, they have made more than 45,650 masks — the largest number of masks stitched by jail inmates across the state.Till now, 37 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Gurugram. On Saturday, four cases have been reported from Sohna. Of these 37, two patients are from Agra, two from Sector 54, five from Pataudi, 10 from Sohna, who are Tablighi Jamaat attendees. Punia said, nine Jamaat attendees from Sohna were confirmed Covid-19 negative on Sunday after undergoing treatment in civil hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bhondsi-jail-warder-tests-covid-19-positive-cases-in-gurugram-touch-37/story-qtKCzNhKlv1RMGQq1Bi0iK.html

19-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Daily meetings help Tulip Ivory residents tide over lockdown hardships, beat Covid-19||From holding daily meeting on issues arising out of the Covid-19 lockdown to forming medical and housekeeping teams, Tulip Ivory in Sector 70 is doing whatever it can to make life easier for its residents. Besides, the residents’ welfare association (RWA) has set up a special care team for senior citizens living alone, as they are facing more problems due to the nationwide lockdown.The main aim of the care team is to ensure that no seniors step out of homes for any needs. The team has to call up all the 14 seniors living alone in the society twice a day. “Several senior citizens live without family in the society. We had to make sure that all their needs were met and they did not have to step out at all. So, the senior citizen team has been formed. The seniors let us know of any items they run out of,” said Ajay Sharma, a member of the RWA. Sharma said the society has tied up with a medicine delivery platform for speedy procurement of medicines for senior citizens. Colonel (retd) Balraj Singh Rathee, 62, lives with his 60-year-old wife at the society. The last time he stepped out of his home was on March 19. Since then, he and his wife have depended on online stores for delivery of essential commodities. “I have been able to get all my grocery and essential items online. RWA volunteers are always ready to help in case I am not able to get anything,” said Rathee. To streamline the functioning of all activities in the society, the RWA members hold a morning video conference from their homes. The meeting headed by the president discusses issues, updates and suggestions to make life easier for the residents. “The meeting starts at 9am and lasts about 20-25 minutes. It is attended by all the 10 RWA members. We update each other on sanitation, cleaning and maintenance works, among others. Suggestions and issues being faced by residents are also discussed. A final message about the outcome of the meeting is shared on the residents’ WhatsApp group later,” said Brigadier (retd) MC Pant, RWA president. The society, which houses around 220 families, has formed special teams for emergency, medical, housekeeping, food distribution, and hygiene. Each team consists of two-three residents. The medical team comprising three doctors residing in the society suggests the measures against coronavirus. The society is located near villages that have been declared red zones. Several of the staff employed at the society resided in these villages. To contain their movement in and out of the society, it accommodated close to 20 staff in two vacant villas. In each room, only two staff are allowed to stay. The staff members have now been provided with a gas cylinder, stove and dry ration for cooking their own meals. “Earlier, the residents had come together to provide meals to them. We carried this out till April 8, after which the staff were provided with cooking facilities,” said Sharma.To keep its residents engaged, the society shares activity videos on yoga and zumba with residents. Some are even dedicated to keeping children engaged. The society has stopped walks across its premises in any form. “Initially, it was difficult to enforce the no-walk policy because a few seniors and children wanted to come out. But gradually we have been able to make it work and the residents are complying,” said the RWA president. Pet owners have been given time slots of not more than 15-20 minutes to walk outside the society. Only two pet owners are allowed to go out at a time. The society is dependent on online marketplaces for its grocery needs now. However, in the beginning of the lockdown, it had set up a temporary store to cater to the needs of the residents. It has one vegetable store inside its complex that also sells dairy products. All essential deliveries are made to the tower lobbies as delivery executives are no longer allowed to make doorstep deliveries.If any residents wish to step out of the society, they have to inform their tower representatives. A record of the same, mentioning their duration and reason of outing, is being maintained. “When they return, they have to wash their hands before entering the society,” said Pant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-daily-meetings-help-tulip-ivory-residents-tide-over-lockdown-hardships-beat-covid-19/story-OPyujayV9tLQD3XvbUH0EP.html
19-04-2020||Gurugram||Expats use online groups to barter essentials, bust myths, exchange information on Covid-19||Far from their homes and locked up inside their homes in a country that is trying to control a raging pandemic, hundreds of expats living in Gurugram have found strength and hope at one place — their online WhatsApp groups. These expats often take the help of these WhatsApp groups to post about commodities or essentials that they are running out of. The response is usually swift, with a fellow expat often volunteering to supply of essentials — like medicines or milk — for those who can’t. Views are exchanged, myths are busted about Covid-19 and messages are forwarded to their native countrymen about how India is fighting back against the virus.Some are also using these WhatsApp groups as a platform to barter things they have at their home with fellow expats living near them.  Penny Mcluckie from New Zealand, who runs a management consultation agency and stays in sector 66, recently shared wine she and her husband had with other expats after she got a WhatsApp message of liquor running out at their homes. “I have been sharing with other expats stuff that they are running out of. We shared wine with people who didn’t have liquor. We recently ran out of dish washer soap and someone gave it to us. So, that’s how expats are supporting each other during the lockdown,” said Mcluckie. WhatsApp groups have become the go to place for expats if they are in a hurry to find things which are not easily available at their place. Luka Baldin, who is from Italy and has been staying in the city for the last one year, said these groups have turned out to be the only medium they look up to in case they need anything. “I needed a print out of an important document. So I had posted it in one of the expat groups and someone immediately helped me out with it. Similarly, I often write in the group that if anyone wants my help, then I am here to do whatever I can.”A handful of Japanese expats have also created a WhatsApp group, where they are busting myths about Covid-19 disease and telling people what they can do during the lockdown period. Seiko Uchida, one such Japanese expat who lives in M3M Golf Estate, said, “I have created a dedicated WhatsApp group for Japanese expats to keep them abreast with the latest developments during the lockdown. This initiative helps them overcome language and cultural barriers, while accessing the correct information. I have received numerous requests from expats regarding the purchase of medicines and I help them in sourcing details of pharmacists, so that they don’t have to go out during the lockdown. Since most expats here do not own a vehicle, I often drive them for their grocery shopping. However, we have stopped venturing out nowadays given the magnitude of the pandemic.” Gensei Asada, a Japanese student who has been staying in the city for the last six years, said he has created a WhatsApp group of Japanese people to share how India is dealing with the pandemic. “I am telling people through WhatsApp that people should not leave their houses. India has a strict law asking people to stay in their house, not like the one in Japan. India has been dealing with COVID-19 in an excellent manner. I have a YouTube account where I tell people about what is happening in foreign countries.”Besides this, there is an Irish expat who is helping out rag pickers in the city. Tara McCartney, co-owner of Duke Horse Riding Club, is making sure that these underprivileged people in the neighbourhood are well fed and looked after during the lockdown. McCartney grew up in Northern Ireland and has been living in the city since 2018. She distributes food items to a nearby locality every day. “We started with soaps, towels, sweet bread and gave grocery packs like rice, lentils, oil and vegetables to a group of people. I am also supporting a rag pickers community of 350 people along with 26 construction workers from Bihar and three families of flower pickers in sector 58,” said McCartney, who has obtained a curfew pass.Serbia-born Danijela Radonic Bhandari, who has been in Gurugram since July last year, has been conducting online counselling classes during the lockdown. “As a health coach, clinical hypnotherapist, and energy healer, I have been providing free online counselling and distant healing to those in need, both in India, and outside,” said Bhandari. She also participates in online group meditation and chanting sessions.Like Bhandari, Carina Bravo — who is from Argentina — is a teacher who is also conducting online classes daily for students. “I am busy taking online classes for students in Spanish. The lockdown period has been spent by making assignments for students and making sure they complete them,” said Bravo, who has spent 20 years in the city.Managing to give full salaries to their employees is also one way of asking people to stay indoors and that’s what Argentinian Mariano Martinez is doing. “I run a garments manufacturing unit in Udyog Vihar. Ever since the lockdown started, I have ensured that i give full pay to all the employees,” said Martinez.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/expats-use-online-groups-to-barter-essentials-bust-myths-exchange-information-on-covid-19/story-mvCHQLokbLVsNvc6zRSfZN.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||Emergency request prompts officials at Narela quarantine facility to stock sanitary napkins||Officials at a quarantine facility in North Delhi’s Narela were caught unprepared by a call from a quarantined person, who asked for sanitary napkins, early Saturday.The caller had said that sanitary napkins were unavailable in the storehouse of the facility, following which officials rushed to meet the requirement and also order stock for other female residents.Alok Kumar Mishra, a Delhi government teacher, deployed at the control room in Block A of the facility, said that they were initially unclear about the request as the caller asked for some “napkins”.“We thought he was asking for napkins that we use to clean our hands. We generally send them tissues and napkins with food. I told the person that it’s too early and we can only arrange it the time of the breakfast. The person then asked us that it’s urgent and they need ladies’ napkins. We could not understand that and he hung up,” he said.Mishra said that a female civil defence official who was at the call centre suggested him to call back and ask if they need sanitary napkins. “We were not even aware of the fact that the female residents might need sanitary napkins, on the lines of other essential commodities We searched our storeroom and found that we did not have any in our stock,” he said.The officials then quickly arranged for the same from a nearby medical store. “We also ordered stock to keep in our store. There are 23 women in our block. It’s a lesson for us. We cannot ignore women’s needs at the time of a crisis,” Mishra said.District magistrate (North) Shinde Deepak Arjun said that the authorities are making all possible efforts to help those in quarantine. There are around 366 people residing in the Narela facility at present.“We did not know that the lockdown would be extended for this long and hence, a few things were not stocked initially. We are now providing everything the residents are asking for. We have also stocked sanitary napkins now,” he said.Dr Surbhi Singh of Sachhi Saheli, an NGO, said that the authorities should take care of the menstrual needs of women. “It’s true that, during a crises like this, the first thing was to provide food and shelter to everyone. But now, authorities should also start considering the needs of women. We have also extended support to the district administrations in helping women to cope with the lockdown,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/emergency-request-prompts-officials-at-narela-quarantine-facility-to-stock-sanitary-napkins/story-LSB3fX8OQiajAqzFM5F4DM.html

BCET Staff Welfare Association president Gurmukh Singh said this was a recurring issue with the staff as the college, set up to promote technical education in the border area of the state, had not been covered under the planned budget for technical education in the state since 2004. He claimed that polytechnics and ITIs were being covered under this head, even as two other government colleges in the state face the same fate as their institution. He added they had even met state technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi in this regard, but the situation had not been remedied.Punjab technical education director Vimal Setia said, “The file of salaries of the staff of BCET, Gurdaspur, is with the principal secretary of the department, Anurag Verma. The BCET staff get salaries from tuition fee fund, which is not sufficient to pay salaries right now, thus the delay in payment.” Gurmukh said the delay in salaries was a huge mental stress for the staff, especially in times of the covid-19 pandemic. “The college has a lot of other heads with sufficient funds to pay our salaries,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/300-college-staffers-in-gurdaspur-without-salary-for-two-months/story-KZQA4HEyqqO0ugr30wRFFK.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police to send notice to MLA, another man in Deoli suicide case||The Delhi Police on Sunday said they will be soon sending a notice to Deoli legislator Prakash Jarwal and another person (his aide), to join the probe and give their statement in connection with the death of a doctor who allegedly killed self at his home in south Delhi’s Deoli Saturday morning.A case of extortion and abetment to suicide was registered against the two after the son of the doctor, who was into the business of supplying water tankers to the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), in his complaint blamed the legislator and his aide for his father’s death. The doctor’s son had alleged that his father was tense and upset because the services of his five water tankers attached with the DJB had been suspended and a pending bill of around ₹10 lakh was also not being paid.“Our five tankers have been engaged with the DJB in supplying water since 2005. However, the services were stopped since March this year on the directions of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA, who had been demanding money to resume the service. My father’s business was running in losses. The MLA’s associate often came to our house or called us to the MLA’s office asking us to pay up,” the doctor’s son alleged, when contacted on his phone.He added that his father had written about the allegations in a diary that was found in an almirah. The doctor had also been threatened and the phone recording of the same has been given to the police along with the diary and other evidence, his son alleged.When contacted, the DJB refused to comment on the matter.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the allegations made by the doctor’s family are being probed and that the MLA and the other person will be asked to join the investigation soon.“Our investigation is in the initial stage. We are verifying the allegations. Further action will be taken accordingly,” DCP Thakur said.Reacting to the allegations, Jarwal had said Saturday he had received information through media that a doctor, who used to deal in water tankers, has killed self and has mentioned his name in his note.“I would like to state that I am innocent. I haven’t met or spoken to him in the last eight-10 months. In 2017, some news channels had done a sting against tanker mafias which featured his name following which all their vehicles were black listed. I have full faith in the judiciary and I am ready to face any investigation. I would only like to say that there have been attempts to trap me in the past and similar attempts are being made now too. Just like I have proved myself innocent in the past and I will do so now too. I am ready to cooperate with the police in any kind of investigation,” Jarwal had said in a statement Saturday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-to-send-notice-to-mla-another-man-in-deoli-suicide-case/story-D6LFhvElpYlaVwgPgnkkWI.html

The hospital administration had terminated Singh’s services on Thursday for allegedly “diverting” PPE kits and distributing them among doctors.Singh, however, had countered the allegations saying that he had procured the kits through an NGO and got them distributed. The DNB (Diplomate of National Board) student had alleged that he was being targeted for “highlighting the wrongdoings” in the system especially those related to the coronavirus pandemic. North Corporation’s standing committee chairperson Jai Prakash said, “The termination order of the doctor has been revoked. The hospital administration has also issued an order to reinstate the doctor.” He added that amid the coronavirus pandemic the system needs more doctors who fight on the forefront. “We were concerned that the morale of the doctors should not be hit in such times. So we took the decision,” he said.The issue of Singh’s termination had landed the corporation into a controversy after many in the medical community accused the North MCD of “wrongly targeting the doctor”. The matter had escalated to such a scale that Union health minister Harsh Vardhan intervened and asked the North Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner on Twitter to reach out to the doctor and resolve the issue.The Hindu Rao Hospital is the biggest hospital under the North MCD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-delhi-municipal-corporation-resinates-hindu-rao-doctor/story-r2fnmJw4QPp0xg64bVwfZN.html

19-04-2020||City||Haryana’s ‘richest’ village donates whopping ₹10.5 crore to state Covid-19 fund||In a big philanthropic gesture, the Bal Jattan village panchayat in Panipat donated ₹10.5 crore to the Haryana Corona Relief Fund on Sunday.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar thanked sarpanch Sarita Rani and other panchayat members for the huge donation and tweeted a photograph of him receiving the cheque from them.While the move garnered praise from the authorities, it also raised questions about the source of income of the village panchayat.Clearing the air, Sarita said that Bala Jattan is one of the richest village panchayats in the country as it still holds around ₹120 crore in its bank accounts and the annual interest on the amount is around ₹6 crore. Located in the Israna assembly constituency, Bal Jattan has a population of around 5,000 people and makes up for 2,500 votes.Sarita, who belongs to the Dalit community, had won the previous panchayat elections by a thin margin of about 200 votes.“Most of the panches and village elders were in favour of the donation as the country in dire need of financial resources to combat the coronavirus outbreak. We decided that the donation amount should be huge so that more panchayats and rich people get inspired to make similar contributions for the cause,” she said.According to Sarita, ₹10.50 crore is not a big amount for the village as it has huge income and most of the facilities have already been provided to the villagers. “Also, the country is above the money,” she said.Ranbir Singh, a local villager, said that around ₹700 acres of village land were acquired for the expansion of IOCL’s Panipat refinery in the year 2000, for which the panchayat had received a lot of money and ₹120 crore out of that amount were still lying in its bank account. “The villagers have made a big-hearted gesture by donating ₹10.5 crore in the state relief fund for coronavirus,” Singh said adding that the panchayat now has ₹380 acres of agriculture land which generates an annual income of over ₹1 crore.Appreciating the panchayat’s concerted efforts, Sarita said village panches Manju, Rajesh Kumar, Raja Nain, Sudesh Rani, Satyawan, Vijay Rathi and Naresh Sharma unanimously extended their support for the decision. “Now, we want the government to upgrade our middle school to high school so our children don’t have to go to other villages for studies,” the sarpanch said adding that they were also making efforts to set up a hospital and sports stadium in the village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-s-richest-village-donates-whopping-10-5-crore-to-state-covid-19-fund/story-sZDWgnlMnCjW6krNnpETpK.html
19-04-2020||Chandigarh||‘Most of infected patients in Haryana are asymptomatic’||Haryana has tested more than 11,800 people across the state since April 1 for Covid-19, which in last 24 hours has infected 18 more people. As per the official data, Haryana had collected only 817 samples of suspected coronavirus patients before April 1. The testing gained momentum after April 1 and till Sunday, more than 11,800 samples were collected and tested across the state. This means that about 621 samples a day were collected in Haryana in past 19 days.According to Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, director of Haryana health services, most of the Covid-19 positive cases in the state are asymptomatic.Dealing with asymptomatic cases, he admitted, was a challenge in itself. “There may be people who are asymptomatic and unaware about the presence of virus. Who knows where such people could be roaming...The coronavirus disease test is negative when the viral load is less. But, the test turns out to be positive the moment viral load is virulent in the very person whose test was earlier negative,” Dr Kamboj explained. “That is why dealing with asymptomatic cases is a big challenge,” he added. 18 new cases take tally to 250A warden of Bhondsi jail in Gurugram is among the 18 people — Ambala (4), Bhiwani (1), Faridabad (9), Gurugram (4) — who were found infected on Sunday. While one of the latest cases from Ambala included an ANM, who had worked in a containment zone in the district, the other three are members of a family hailing from Shahazadpur block near Ambala City.As per reports, three of them were taking treatment from a private doctor, who had initially treated a Panchkula patient. Ambala health department had collected the list of all local patients, who had availed treatment from this doctor.As per the health bulletin, the total number of active Covid-19 cases in the state on Sunday was 144, while 104 patients have been discharged.Nuh with 57 cases continues to be the worst-affected district, followed by Faridabad (42), Gurugram (36) and Palwal (34).According to the state health bulletin, of total 250 Covid-19 patients, 24 are foreign nationals and 64 are from other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/most-of-infected-patients-in-haryana-are-asymptomatic/story-6OoL1Ihvax0OddP43pSc4L.html
19-04-2020||City||Coronavirus outbreak: Yamunanagar plywood industry seeks relaxation amid lockdown in Haryana||Plywood and related industry of Yamunanagar district is also not untouched by nationwide lockdown imposed by the Centre in view of the coronavirus outbreak.With the central government hinting at relaxations to be given to some sectors in the coming days, traders of one of Asia’s largest timber markets are also hoping to get some respite in their business. Despite the district being declared a green zone, the government’s move will not largely affect this industry as the units are scattered and most of them come under the municipal corporation (MC) limits.‘ALLOW US OPEN UNITS FOR 2-3 DAYS’All India Plywood Manufacturing Association president Devendra Chawla said, “The industrial units are spread across both Yamunanagar and Jagadhari cities. A large area comes under the MC limits and so does the plywood industries.” “We have asked the district administration to allow us open our units within the MC limits for two-three days so that we can check our raw material, including wood, glue and other chemicals,” he said. Nearly a thousand units, including plyboard and peeling factories, are operational across the district.Deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar said that as per the guidelines of the central government, there are a few standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to premises and labour that are to be followed by the applicants. “Industries within MC limits cannot operate as per the order, however, the request of the plywood industries related to the checking of their raw material has been forwarded to the state government for consideration,” he said.ONE LAKH PEOPLE LINKED TO INDUSTRYWith more than one lakh people directly or indirectly linked to the plywood industry in the district, the association has also urged the state government to help them during this economic slowdown. In an online meeting held few days back, the association asked the state government to waive off their fixed charges on electricity bills and refund Rs 200 crore collected from them as ‘licence fee’.“Governments of Punjab, Gujarat and Rajasthan have decided to charge electricity bills as per usage but Haryana government has only given us a rebate of Rs 10,000. We are demanding waive off of fixed charges, the remaining should be taken as per the usage and our pending bills of March and April be deducted from the security amount,” Chawla said.‘DEFER LOAN INSTALMENTS’Other demands of the plywood association are -- assistance from the central government to export Indian plywood and furniture to Middle East and European countries, deferment of loan instalments and waive off the moratorium period interest. State education and forests minister Kanwar Pal, who is also an MLA from Jagadhari, said, “Amid this global economic slowdown, we are already trying to help industries in the state. I will raise the issue of waiving off the fixed charges during the cabinet meeting with chief minister.” About the demand of licence amount, he said, “Our government had decided to do away with charging this fee and refund the amount to the industrialists. The matter is under process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-outbreak-yamunanagar-plywood-industry-seeks-relaxation-amid-lockdown-in-haryana/story-ugY5bYfg2308VCMdSrMORN.html

19-04-2020||City||Not getting coupons, farmers store wheat crop at houses||BATHINDA As the wheat harvesting is picking pace in the state, farmers who are not getting coupons to sell their crop in the grain markets are storing their produce at their houses to sell it later.To avoid overcrowding at procurement centres in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the state government is issuing limited number of coupons to farmers to bring their crop to mandis. The procurement started on April 15.Karamjit Singh, a farmer from Jeond village in Bathinda, said he has already stored the wheat crop harvested from five acres. “I have grown wheat over 60 acres and will have to store the entire produce at house if I don’t get the coupons,” he said.A farmer from Pakho Kalan village said he has stored crop harvested from 25 acres in his house as he did not get coupons to take it to mandi. He said that it will be extra financial burden on farmers to take back the crop to mandis for sale in the coming days.Bathinda district mandi officer Preet Kanwar Brar said they have to send many farmers back who bring their crop to mandis without coupons. “To ensure that overcrowding doesn’t take place we have to keep strict check on number of coupons being issued,” he said. “Coupons are issued three days in advance to farmers. In Bathinda, we have issued 32,840 coupons for procurement till April 21,”he said.BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) leader Shingara Singh Mann said that farmers have no other option but to store the crop at their houses even as they will have to bear additional financial burden in the process.He said that farmers should be provided gunny bags so that they can keep the produce packed at their houses. They should also be provided an incentive for storing the crop. He added that farm unions will hold a protest at their rooftops on April 25 to press for these demands. To check overcrowding in the procurement centres, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking incentives to farmers to sell their crop after April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-getting-coupons-farmers-store-wheat-crop-at-houses/story-htTG0vLzxmV32BqYjnluPJ.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||26 more Jaslok Hospital staffers test positive for Covid-19||A day before south Mumbai’s Jaslok Hospital was set to open up their services, 26 healthcare providers including five doctors tested positive for Covid-19, on Sunday. The total number of infected staffers at the hospital now stands at 57.At present, all the infected staffers have been isolated while two doctors whose condition have been kept under observation at the intensive care unit (ICU). Testing all quarantined staffers was part of the protocol laid by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The 26 new Covid-19 patients were asymptomatic.Last month, 21 nurses at the hospital had tested positive, following which the hospital authorities collected swab samples of 100 staffers and quarantined them at a hostel in Ballard Pier. Although most staffers had tested negative, they were quarantined for 14 days as is mandatory. BMC, as a precautionary, sealed the hospital. “Positive cases have come from the quarantined staff in the hostel who were tested again before they could resume work. The second round of swab testing showed that some staffers were asymptomatic but diagnosed positive for the virus. We are taking precautions to ensure the safety of our staff and patients. We have tested over 1,600 of our staff, nurses and doctors and adopted precautionary measures to ensure their safety,” said a hospital spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/26-more-jaslok-hospital-staffers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-r422ILreQ5cmX74hnRZtOP.html
19-04-2020||City||Govt revokes order to use Bathinda cancer hospital as Covid facility||The Punjab health department has withdrawn its decision to continue using the Advanced Cancer Institute (ACI), Bathinda, as an isolation facility for Covid-19 suspects or patients, after a strong opposition by doctors and the families of those suffering from cancer for fear of infection. Bathinda civil surgeon Dr Amrik Singh Sandhu said the isolation facility will be relocated at the civil hospital by Tuesday. “The decision was taken by the high-ups after looking into various aspects. In case an infected patient requires treatment or ventilator support, they will be shifted to the Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital in the adjoining Faridkot district,” said Dr Sandhu.Also, he clarified that ventilators at the cancer institute will not be used for the Covid patients at the civil hospital. Sandhu said barricading has been planned at the civil hospital for restricted movement in the new Covid facility.On Sunday, seven coronavirus suspects were discharged from the centre as they were found negative for the disease. Earlier, HT reported as how the treatment of cancer patients was hit after Covid suspects were admitted at the isolation ward on the third floor. Oncologists had suspended surgeries and radiotherapy since cancer patients have low immunity and should not be exposed to possible infection. Also, the paramedic and technical staff at ACI was put on duty at isolation ward and X-ray test station and laboratory was also being used for Covid cases. Besides, Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had said she will write to the Prime Minister about the state government’s decision to use the cancer institute as a Covid-19 facility. She had also written to the Punjab chief minister on the issue. Cancer institute medical superintendent Dr Deepak Arora said he got an informal communication for the relocation of the Covid facility. “We will sanitise the entire floor to make it fit for regular cancer patients,” he added. Till date, Bathinda has not reported any Covid-19 case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-revokes-order-to-use-bathinda-cancer-hospital-as-covid-facility/story-fCYxpkNkipprVbpD2AoqNI.html
19-04-2020||Chandigarh||Amid labour shortage, PAU advises farmers to go for direct paddy sowing||Experts at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, have advised the state’s farmers to opt for the direct seeding rice (DSR) variety of paddy in the upcoming kharif season to make up for an acute shortage of labour in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.The new variety, according to the PAU researchers, would save the farmers from two labour-intensive steps of the traditional paddy sowing — setting up of nurseries and then transplanting the saplings in the puddled fields.The PAU has developed a new DSR technique which was successfully tested during the last kharif season.“In this new technique, the fields are levelled, irrigated and good soil moisture conditions are created. Then, paddy is sown with the help of tractor-operated drills,” said PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon.“After harvesting and procurement of wheat, the next worry for Punjab farmers is paddy sowing. Amid the Covid-19 lockdown, labourers engaged in paddy transplantation have gone back to their native states. Now, Punjab farmers are left with no option but to adopt alternative sowing techniques,” Dhillon added.The PR-126 variety of direct seeding has shown the best results and the yield is as much as transplanted paddy, he added.“On the basis of the recommendations made by the PAU, we have started making preparations even as the deadline for paddy sowing is two months away. Also, it will help in the long run as it cuts one-third of the total water requirements,” said secretary (agriculture) KS Pannu.“At least 500 Korean and Japanese machines are available for direct sowing and as many additional machines will be developed in two months. These machines could sow paddy on 1.25 lakh acres. The government is offering 40% subsidy on these machines,” he said.‘Will also use paddy transplant machines’The PAU and the state government have some machines for transplantation of saplings at their disposal and they will be put to use in the kharif season. “We are getting more such machines manufactured,” Pannu added. In Punjab, paddy is sown on 70 lakh acres and paddy transplantation is not permitted before June 20 as per the state government’s directions to save subsoil water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-labour-shortage-pau-advises-farmers-to-go-for-direct-paddy-sowing/story-1NIlDYF8EeVSC0JHZpmxAO.html

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||No special curfew concession for Ramzan: Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday ruled out any relaxation in curfew in the state, except as needed to ensure procurement of wheat till May 3, when the situation would be reviewed. He ordered all deputy commissioners to ensure strict enforcement of curfew, with no relaxation or concessions whatsoever. He clarified that no special curfew passes would be issued on account of Ramzan that begins this week. A government release added that there should be no relaxation, except already announced by his government with respect to harvesting and procurement operations, as well as those relating to operations of certain industries/brick kilns and construction activity.The CM has also ordered a health audit of mandis after reports emerged that some of these lacked proper hygiene. Over 185 lakh tonne wheat is expected to arrive in the mandis till June when procurement is expected to end. This will infuse around Rs 35,000 crore, including the Cash Credit Limit (CCL) payment of Rs 26,000 crore, received from the Centre, into the state economy, thus giving it the much-needed support for fighting the COVID-19 battle effectively. Acting on the CM’s directives, DCs have issued separate notification to maintain strict curfew restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-special-curfew-concession-for-ramzan-amarinder/story-QQgtvUi61Qi2YVedcljYnM.html
19-04-2020||City||Labour pangs hit hard: SAD MLA Ayali seen harvesting the field himself||With migrant labourers long gone, all big and small farmers in Punjab can be seen sweating it out in their fields to harvest their wheat crops. Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA from Dakha constituency, Manpreet Singh Ayali was no different. The multimillionaire realtor-cum-farmer turned politician was seen harvesting his fields in Dakha area on Sunday. The MLA exhorted the youngsters of Punjab, particularly of his constituency, to help their brethren in the harvesting process.Ayali, who was seen using the harvester, urged residents, particularly the elderly in the villages, to involve the youngsters in the harvesting and farming process. “The entire world is going through a lockdown. Material things such as buying a new car or a motorcycle have taken a back-seat. Everyone wishes that there is enough food to eat in the house. I would urge youngsters, especially those associated with farming, to go out in the field and work. This is the best opportunity God has offered us and we should make the most of it,” said Ayali.He also advised residents of the villages to strictly follow social distancing measures while harvesting the crops.The MLA from Dakha also urged farmers not to sit at home after harvesting. “We have to continue working in the field even after harvesting for preparing fodder and transplanting of paddy crop. We should no longer be dependent of labour,” said Ayali.“Gurus have ranked farming above all the occupations. The first Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev had also carried out farming at Kartarpur Sahib. The lockdown has provided us an opportunity get back to manual labour. Besides, we should also help the farm labour toiling hard in the field,” said Ayali.He also urged the government to ensure timely disbursal of payment to farmers whose crops have arrived at the mandi.The Dakha MLA’s appeal has come at a time when Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has predicted acute shortage of labour which could impede the process of sowing of summer vegetables and paddy crops transplantation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/labour-pangs-hit-hard-sad-mla-ayali-seen-harvesting-the-field-himself/story-sP4nYORfro4t7Tqt88ZbRO.html

He also asked them to expedite the Water Resources departments work being carried out for anti-erosion and embankment strengthening.These measures would provide work opportunities to people and labourers, the CM said, adding that local labourers should be used as per the guideline besides following the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).He told the officials to expedite wheat procurement in the state as the state government has enhanced the procurement target so that more farmers can get fair price of their produce.Food and Consumer Protection Department officials informed the CM that at least 7 lakh MT of wheat will be procured this season. Kumar, however, stressed for procurement of more than 7 lakh MT of wheat.The door to door campaign (screening) is being carried out on the lines of Pulse Polio to identify COVID-19 infected people in affected districts, he said, adding that 1.84 crore people in 33.86 lakh households have been surveyed so far under the drive.Of the above figure, merely 980 people had symptoms of general disease like cold, cough and fever, he said.Kumar stressed the need for paying special attention to the quality of food being served at disaster relief camps in the state.

19-04-2020||City||Punjab’s stricter norms make industries uncertain||Chandigarh With the state government making norms for allowing industrial activities from April 20 more stringent amid the covid-19 crisis, most industries in Punjab are unsure about resuming operations.The stricter government guidelines, coupled with supply chain disruptions, retail still not being open and the prevailing business environment, have left a majority of them in doubt about restarting their production, according to industry leaders in different parts of the state. The Centre had announced the relaxations four days ago. The state’s home department, which imposed additional conditions on Saturday for permitting industrial activities outside the containment zones, has made it mandatory for all categories of industries and industrial establishments employing 10 or more persons to make boarding and lodging arrangements on their factory premises for workers, or provide transport.The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) had, in its guidelines issued on April 15, imposed this condition only on manufacturing and other industrial establishments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Oriented Units (EoUs), industrial estates and industrial townships. Additional chief secretary, industries, Vini Mahajan, said the government is being cautious to make sure the situation does not get out of hand. “We want to see industries restart operations, but have to focus on containing covid-19 spread at the same time. If necessary, some recalibration can be done,” she said.CHALLENGING SITUATION, TOUGH GUIDELINESRaman Batta, president, Bathinda Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said district authorities are not allowing industries to transport workers and asking them to be accommodated within factory premises. “How many medium-scale factories have the space and facilities for boarding and lodging 100-150 workers? In this situation, only 10-12% of units will resume production,” he said.Badish Jindal, president of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association (FASII), and Upkar Singh Ahuja, chairman of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU), said strict conditions, such as accommodating labour within the factory premises and holding the owner responsible if any worker contracts the infection, have also made many owners reluctant. “If authorities want industry to work, these guidelines will have to be changed,” Ahuja said.Of 2.52 lakh registered industrial units, roughly 2,200 – a tad less than 1% - have been running their operations after the state government, on March 29, asked industrial units to start operations with conditions related to boarding and lodging of labour, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. Things have not been smooth for them. Ashok Sethi, director, Punjab Rice Millers and Exporters Association, said rice shellers started operations about 10 days ago at 20% capacity and faced many challenges, including operational difficulties, supply chain issues, cancellation of orders and payments. “We are only doing packing right now, but still it is tough. If I can achieve 50% of my production target this year, it will be an achievement,” said Sethi who is a member of the 20-member task force set up by the state government on covid-19.OFFICIALS HEDGE BETS ON RESPONSEInitially, state government officials expected 40% industrial units to resume operations from Monday onwards, but have scaled down expectations after the state home department’s order on consolidated guidelines with additional riders. “Our expectations were in line with the guidance given by the Centre, but the state guidelines were issued on Saturday. We will have to wait until Monday to see how many industrial units resume operations. Also, our hotspots and containment zones are mostly in industrial towns,” said industries director C Sibin, refusing to hazard a guess on the response.TWO-THIRDS OF COVID-19 CASES FROM INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTSSAS Nagar (Mohali), Jalandhar, Patiala, Ludhiana, and Amritsar districts, where most of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are located, account for two-thirds (66%) of 234 Covid-19 cases in the state to date. In Ludhiana, 650 of 95,000-odd units have taken permission in the past two weeks to operate. “Most of those granted permission are running their operations, but not many fresh applications for permission have been received,” a district official said. Of 12,000-odd units (mostly MSMEs) in Mohali, 65 are operational. HS Pannu, general manager, district industries centre (DIC), said he had received 10-12 queries in the past 24 hours. Mohali has the maximum number of 61 positive cases in the state.Strap/BlurbWAIT AND WATCH Initially, even govt officials expected 40% industrial units to resume operations, but have scaled down expectation after state home dept’s order on consolidated guidelines with additional riders||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-stricter-norms-make-industries-uncertain/story-KNeAB6CQcwqIA9gONhRPgP.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||Mandoli jail to accommodate 250 prisoners from Tihar, Rohini facilities to ensure social distancing in prisons||The high-powered committee formed by the Delhi government for decongesting prisons has resolved that 250 prisoners from the Tihar Jail and the Rohini Prison Complex will be shifted to the Mandoli Jail so social distancing norms can be followed. It also ordered the grant of emergency parole to inmates suffering from mental illness and serious physical ailments.The committee, headed by Delhi high court’s Justice Hima Kohli, was informed by the Director General (prisons) that some inmates can be shifted from the congested Rohini and Tihar facilities to Mandoli as its actual occupancy, as on date, was less than its registered holding capacity.He also apprised the committee that the total area of Tihar jail, its outlay and particularly the corridors and open spaces in front of individual cells and barracks can accommodate more prisoners than its registered holding capacity. Rohini Jail Complex does not have such open spaces to accommodate more prisoners than its holding capacity, he said. “Taking into account the jail population of Rohini Jail, Tihar Court Complex and Mandoli Court Complex, as well as their respective areas and outlays, the committee has unanimously resolved that transferring 200 prisoners from Rohini Jail and 50 prisoners from Tihar to Mandoli would sufficiently decongest Rohini and Tihar jails.“By doing so, the Jail administration would be in a position to implement social distancing among inmates of all the three jail complexes,” the minutes of the meeting read.The DG (prisons) submitted that 953 convicts have been released on emergency parole even though the orders were issued for the release of 1,109. He also said that while orders have been issued for the release of 1,877 prisoners, 1,777 inmates have so far been released; the remaining have decided to stay back because they hail from other states. Till April 18, 2,962 prisoners, including convicts, remission and under-trial prisoners, had been released.Kanwal Jeet Arora, member secretary of the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA), informed that advocates empanelled with it and visiting jail premises on a daily basis, had drafted and filed bail applications for the under-trial prisoners as per criteria adopted by the committee.DG (prisons) informed that there are 11 convicts who have also become eligible for being released after the grant of remission, however, they have not been released due to the non-payment of the fine.Following this, the committee said, “Being conscious of Covid-19 pandemic…and…‘National Lockdown’ of 40 days, these convicts or their family members may have become incapacitated to deposit the fine.“It is accordingly resolved…that these 11 convicts who have completed their substantive sentence can be released on furnishing an undertaking…to the effect that they shall deposit the fine within ‘15 days of lifting of Lockdown’ failing which they shall surrender to serve the remainder of the sentence (imposed on them in default of payment of fine),” the committee resolved.It also said that considering the advisory of the Indian Council of Medical Research prisoners suffering from HIV, cancer, chronic kidney dysfunction (UTPs requiring dialysis), Hepatitis B or C, Asthma and TB are more prone to the risk of the virus, inmates suffering from any of these diseases should be given emergency parole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mandoli-jail-to-accommodate-250-prisoners-from-tihar-rohini-facilities-to-ensure-social-distancing-in-prisons/story-JJlBuPmjccz5ZO0hPyJPxL.html

19-04-2020||City||Residents fearful after jail in green zone Tarn Taran made quarantine centre||Residents of Tarn Taran district, one of the three in the state with no covid-19 case so far, are fearful of the spread of the infection with the state government turning a sub-jail in Patti, 24km from district headquarters, into a quarantine zone for new inmates. The sub-jail is located in a residential area and the decision was taken on Thursday. Fifty-one new inmates are already inside the jail that has a capacity of 205. A government doctor, not wishing to be named, said, “Three of these new inmates, who were suspected to covid-19 patients during screening, were taken to the Patti civil hospital on Saturday as they had fever. After a few hours, their fever subsided and they were sent back to the jail.”Advocate Deepak Arora, a resident of Patti city, said, “The creation of a quarantine zone inside the jail has increased the chances of spread of the infection, not only among jail and health staff, but also among citizens.” Another resident Lucky Kumar said such a move could be disastrous, as infection could spread quickly. Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had said the preventive step to create a quarantine zone was meant to ensure the disease did not spread in the state’s jails. Barnala sub-jail was also turned into a quarantine zone. Patti Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill, however, has threatened to start a sit-in against his own government if the decision was not revoked by Monday evening. “I have requested the jails minister and senior officials to revoke the decision, to no avail. If a single case comes through this new jail, who will be responsible? Such a facility should be shifted to the Kapurthala Open jail,” Gill said. Patti sub-jail superintendent DSP Vijay Kumar said that they had been taking in the new inmates only after proper screening. “People should not panic, as extra precautions are being taken,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-fearful-after-jail-in-green-zone-tarn-taran-made-quarantine-centre/story-Emcm4aHLG1htgsl1LahN4K.html

The ‘Earn While Learn’ scheme was launched by the university in 2018 under which students are paid Rs 100 per hour and each student is allowed to work for a maximum of 40 hours in a month. The scheme is aimed at providing opportunities to the students of economically weaker sections. The scheme did not see a positive response from the students last year as students from only one department had opted to avail the scheme. But this year, the varsity took measures so that more students can benefit. “I have been working under the scheme since December and I have submitted the documents in January. We have been told that the payment is under process, but we do not know when the amount will be released,” said Umakant Dubey, a student of University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET).However, the university successfully disbursed the salaries of its employees on time.The finance and development officer of the university, Vikram Nayyar, said, “It may be under process at the department levels, but from our side there has been no delay.”Dean of students’ welfare (women), Neena Capalash, was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/students-enrolled-under-panjab-university-s-earn-while-learn-scheme-await-payments/story-M1hKQnT2k0me1R4iYggw3M.html

A multi-centric proposal has already been filed under The New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) project, which is focused on developing new delivery mechanisms for therapeutic agents, being used currently in Covid-19 treatment,” said Professor Saranjit Singh, acting director of NIPER Mohali.NMITLI is the largest public-private-partnership effort within the R&D domain in the country.Singh said the institute was mainly focused on delivering drugs through inhalation as Covid-19 affected the lungs.On other initiatives, he said a few faculty members had joined national and international groups fighting against Covid-19. “One of our faculty members was recently invited to join a corporation in California, as part of their team for analytical work in a Covid 19 project that is being submitted for US Food and Drug Administration approval. The institute has already received proposals for a memorandum of understanding which is being reviewed,” Singh said.The institute was also initiating work in the ambitious area of discovering new drugs for anti-viral treatment. This is a long term goal as discovery of new medicine can take anything between six to 10 years. NIPER hopes to work in collaboration with the pharma industry to synergise the discovery of new drugs for viral diseases, he added.Established in 1994 on 130 acres in Sector 67, NIPER is an Indian Public Pharmacy Research University and a part of seven schools under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, government of India.Isolation ward set upThe National Bioavailability Centre (NBC) at NIPER has also been prepared as an isolation/quarantine facility for Covid-19 patients.

Mandeep Kaur, also from the UK and currently in Cheema village, said she was already stressed because she was unable to fly back home, and on top of that the neighbours were afraid to talk to her. “They accuse us of spreading the virus,” she says.The NRIs also allege that a well known Punjabi singer’s song on YouTube blaming them as irresponsible carriers of the coronavirus, which had been tweeted by a top Punjab police official, was the reason behind people’s wrong perceptions.With the death of Baldev Singh, Punjab’s first Covid-19 fatality, who had returned to India from Germany via Italy, “Most people, especially in the rural areas, believe that NRIs in their neighborhood are a threat. The government should spread awareness among people and save NRIs from mental tension,” said Satnam Singh Chahal, executive director, North American Punjabi Association.Parminder Kaur, a Goraya resident who returned from Canada last month, said that local councillor and a person working with the administration posted the quarantine notice outside her house on March 29, “asking me to stay quarantined till April 14 ,“even though I showed them documents proving that I came here with my children on March 10.”She said the locals were not behaving well with her and her children who had accompanied her to India did not want to come back again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-suspicious-we-are-not-treated-well-say-nris/story-r8sQSQJbth7gca53UJ883M.html

19-04-2020||Pune||After 11,000+ meals for poor, NGO seeks corporate funds for lockdown 2.0||After having served meals to 11,900 marginalised poor and supplied grocery essentials to 2,600 needy families in the city, Saad Pratishthan Pune Trust has appealed to corporates for sponsorship to help additional 1,500-2,000 families with ration kits.Marginalised people such as migrant labourers, homeless destitutes, scrap pickers, jobless daily wagers, commercial sex workers and others were the focus of attention for the relief work.The trust received about Rs 50 lakhs in donations from individuals and organisations for relief work during the 21-day lockdown. Funding of Rs 5 lakhs from National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) was used to distribute 1,000 health kits to waste-pickers and policemen.With the lockdown having been extended the NGO has appealed to new donors, especially corporate sponsorship. The trust volunteers fan out in different areas of the city and distribute ration kits and meal to the deserving poor and the needy.On Friday, a car loaded with meals and ration kits meandered through the arterial areas of the city, distributing meals and ration kits to the poor. The distribution was undertaken near Sardar Vallabhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital where the hungry and the homeless were fed. The joy of the receivers knew no bounds upon receiving the food packets from volunteers Chinmay Damle and Sai Tamhane.Speaking of the two worlds that exist in Indian society- one of abundance and the other poverty, Sai Tamhane said, “There is a need to bridge the gulf between the haves and have-nots in the society. Our mission is to ensure that the vulnerable sections of the society don’t stay hungry.”Damle said meals and rations were being distributed after due diligence and verification as per a list provided to them by credible NGOs.Amit Dhole, trustee, Saad Pratishthan said. “Our focus has been on reaching out to people whose names are not in the voters’ lists and people who don’t have ration cards. While local corporators or MLAs often and to a large extent, take care of their voter base, this other section of the urban poor is the most vulnerable. Most of them are migrants and have no line of credit at the local store nor any formal channel through which they can access the government ration shop.”Saad has served 850-1,100 cooked meals daily with the help of Tiranga Bhuvan, Kothrud; Poona Guest House, Urban Foundry and Westin Hotel. Daily, around 400 ration kits weighing 30 kg each have been distributed across Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. These kits contain 10 kg rice, 10 kg wheat flour, 5 kg mix dal, 2 kg besan, 2 litres oil, ½ kilo spices , 1 kg salt and soap.The trust has obtained police permission for four trucks and five private cars and a group of young men and women have been serving as volunteers. Some NGOs have provided assistance by identifying the most needy. Precaution is being taken in terms of hygiene and avoiding mass gatherings.The trust was founded by Suhas Dhole, chairman, UGC Supply Chain Solutions Pvt Ltd as a social foundation to work towards humanitarian causes in Pune district.“We are grateful to our donors for enabling us to help the poorest of the poor in these testing times. With the funds ,we have collected so far, we hope to feed around 5,000 people. We plan to continue the initiative till a week after the lockdown ends,” Suhas Dhole said.BOX: Issues and Challenges• Many beneficiaries attended to by Saad Trust unable to access government’s food distribution network due to absence of ration cards* Received support from NGOs like Robin Hood Army, Mashal, Samapathik Trust, Saheli, Janaseva Foundation, Manoday Vyasan Mukti Kendra and others.* Marginalised communities which need attention: Potraj (Khadimachine chowk, Hadapsar SRA), Rajgond (Gosawi vasti), Pardhi (Bopodi), the LGBTHI (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Hijara, Intersex) community across Pune through Samapathik Trust; Commercial sex workers (with the help of Saheli NGO and Faraskhana Police station), various nomadic tribes and daily wage labourers, migrant workers.* Areas of operation: Sangvi,Yerawada, Pimpri, Charholi budruk, HInjewadi, Hadapsar, Sasanenagar, Vimannagar, Lohegaon and Katraj, among others||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/after-11-000-meals-for-poor-ngo-seeks-corporate-funds-for-lockdown-2-0/story-OhHI1aq58omeAnlBFvV5tK.html

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||At 158, Srinagar, Bandipora make up for nearly half of J&K’s Covid-19 cases||Two districts of the valley – Srinagar and Bandipora – constitute nearly half of the Covid-19 cases reported in Jammu and Kashmir.With 80 such cases, Bandipore has surpassed Srinagar as the district with highest Covid-19 patients in the northern region comprising J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. Nuh in Haryana is now the third district with the maximum positive cases in the region.While it’s not clear why the two Kashmir districts have the most number of cases, health experts believe it could be due to the lack of early detection and the cases related to Tablighi Jamaat. “The surveillance at airport in the early days or the cases of contact tracing going wrong or being ineffective could be the reason for the spike in the cases Srinagar and Bandipora,” said a senior officer who was privy to the government’s response in the initial days of cases being declared in J&K. Srinagar has 78 positive cases with 60 active cases, as 17 patients have already recovered and one has died. Out of Bandipora’s 80 cases, 68 are active Covid-19 patients and 11 people have already recovered.Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Choudhary said that many steps were taken to control coronavirus in Srinagar and results have been encouraging. “From tracking of cases with hidden or undeclared travel history and launching of web app Talaash, case detection has been effective. A total response in 10 days was 889,” said the DC adding that of the 889, 573 belonged to Srinagar.Most cases in Bandipora come from three red-zones – Hajin, Gund Jahagir and Bandipora. “Over that 1,000 people are under quarantine and we are collecting more samples,” sub-divisional magistrate Shahnawaz Bukhari told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-158-srinagar-bandipora-make-up-for-nearly-half-of-j-k-s-covid-19-cases/story-KyWLxGInAoQDdmhwQKeeLM.html
19-04-2020||City||PM Garib KalyanYojana: Ludhiana industrialists urge govt to relax norms for all business establishments||The city industrialists have urged the government to relax norms for all establishments and cover all categories of employees under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY).Under the scheme, the government has decided to pay the employees’ provident fund (EPF) contribution both of employer and the employees (12 per cent each) for the next three months. However, the financial relief measures under PMGKY concerning PF as announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman on March 26 is applicable to the establishments with less than 100 employees. Moreover, an establishment can avail the scheme only if 90% of its employees have an average salary of ₹15,000/ month or below.Ludhiana Punjab Dyers Association that represents around 300 dyeing units in the city has recently written to the ministry of labour and employment urging the latter to relax the norms, so that every unit can avail the benefits at the time of financial crisis. “If the government is keen on helping the establishments during the lockdown, it must extend PF benefits to all the categories of employees irrespective of their salary structure and number of employees in an organisation. Due to the conditions laid down by the ministry, we have not been able to avail the services even though we are in dire need of them,” told Bobby Jindal, president of Punjab Dyers Association. Jindal, whose dyeing unit is on Tajpur Road, said his unit has around 100 employees, out of which 50 are paid above ₹15,000 per month. “Many of our workers, including dyeing master and knitting master, earn above ₹15,000, which is why we will not be able to avail this scheme. We request the ministry to help us. Relaxing norms will help the government save millions of jobs,” told Jindal. Similarly, Bahadur K Textile and Knitwear Association that comprises over 5,500 units in Ludhiana has also asked the ministry to ease the norms and include all establishments. “The provision of employers earning less than ₹15,000 per month will force many business establishments to go for salary cuts. Why the government is laying down such conditions at the time of global health emergency? It is a defunct scheme and will help no one? Did I make a mistake if I employed more than 100 employees in my firm? Bigger units are facing more losses during this lockdown. Government is ignoring our plight” said Tarun Jain Bawa, president of Textile and Knitwear Association.Bawa claimed that presently the employees’ state insurance (ESI) department has surplus of ₹84,000 crore, while there is unclaimed amount of ₹40,000 crore with the provident fund department.“The government should use these surpluses to help both big and small establishments and not burden us with PF deposits right now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industrialists-urge-govt-to-relax-norms-for-all-establishments-under-pm-garib-kalyanyojana/story-P8z6vo3FM29iumXu9aCEDJ.html

The dwindling numbers of cadre and their leadership was the reason behind recent cowardly acts of attacking civilians and adopting hit-and-run tactics,” he said.The senior officer informed that the army has neither lowered its guard nor allowed terrorists to achieve their sinister designs.“The ground report suggests that the people of Kashmir are at ease with regard to the developing positive security environment and feel assured about peace to sustain during this summer season,” he added.Two HM terrorists were killed in an encounter in Shopian and two other HM terrorists were eliminated in Kishtwar on April 17.Earlier this month, nine terrorists were eliminated on April 4 and 5 in two separate operations.However, the Army lost five commandoes of the elite Special Forces along the Line of Control (LoC) in Keran sector of Kupwara district on April 6 and the CRPF lost three of its personnel in another attack in Sopore town on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-j-k-13-militants-eliminated-in-april-so-far/story-iMZFRDIcCITqzWqQSz34yK.html

Khar police had booked him under sections 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups), 121 (Waging, or attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India), 117 (Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons), 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 501 (Printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 505(2) (Statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code.Gajanan Kabdule, senior inspector, Khar police station, said, “We booked him under section 121 IPC as the complainant had mentioned the section in his complaint. But after our initial investigation we found that this section was not applicable so we informed the court when produced him,” said Kabdule.Khar police told the court that they wanted to investigate why he had posted the video, and who were the people behind him. While his advocate Nazneen Khatri opposed the custodial interrogation, the court remanded Khan to the custody of Khar police till April 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/charges-on-aijaz-khan-of-waging-war-against-country-dropped/story-gGRQaqxuxuhZo6a3wvmfdJ.html

19-04-2020||Mumbai||Kapad Bazaar shut due to non-compliance of lockdown orders||In a bid to deal with the non-compliance of lockdown orders and social distancing norms in G-North ward, Niyati Thakkar, DCP of zone 5, has asked the ward office to shut down Kapad Bazar at Mahim as it was leading to crowding. Locals, however, said the crowding was not because of them but because of the people coming from Dharavi and Worli which have been sealed as containment zones due to the high number of Covid-19 positive cases there.Irfan Machiwala, a social worker, said Kapad Bazar was allowed to function from 8am to 11am every day like other markets in the city. “Most Mahim residents buy their groceries and essentials from Kapad Bazar as it is economical and has fresh produce. The local police was monitoring the area and residents also cooperated by maintaining social distancing and limiting their visits to the market. However, the market was ordered to be shut down on April 15,” said Machiwala. He said that locals, upon inquiring with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), were informed that the market was shut based on a letter by the DCP of the zone. BMC order stated that the market was to shut down as social distancing norms were not being maintained. Machiwala said while the April 15 order had directed shutting of the market for only three days, on April 18 they came to know that the civic body has extended the order it till further notice as the situation has not improved. DCP Thakkar said, “People coming to the market were not following social distancing norms and were creating unnecessary crowd. We reported this to BMC, following which the order was issued to close the market.”She further said shopkeepers have been asked to offer home delivery as 80% of their customers are from the same locality. “We have been allowing passes to their delivery boys. As of now, no complaint have come for shortages of groceries or any crisis situation. We are monitoring it closely and if any such situation arises, we will take a decision accordingly” said Thakkar.A resident who is a lawyer said, “The decision is harsh but it had to be taken as the market was inundated by residents from Worli and Dharavi which have been sealed.” He also said there were few instances of joy shoppers who visited the market unnecessarily. He cited an instance wherein a family of six had come to the market and said there was no need for all of the family members coming to market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kapad-bazaar-shut-due-to-non-compliance-of-lockdown-orders/story-B3uX3okGLNpPSKe851F87K.html

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||HP Cong demands resumption of trade in state||Amid the ongoing coronavirus lockdown, Himachal Pradesh unit of the Congress has urged the government to start trade in the state after proper assessment of commercial and industrial businesses. In a letter to chief minister (CM) Jai Ram Thakur, state Congress president Kuldeep Rathore said, “Fortunately, Himachal Pradesh is probably one of the safest states. We have to continue with the same level of precautions in the future and at the same time, plan for restrictions on all commercial/business activities in a phased manner after April so that people can start earning their livelihood.”Reiterating the party’s commitment to the Union and the state government in the fight against Covid-19, the Congress leader also demanded procurement of the adequate stock of apple cartons for next season.OPT FOR MASS TESTING: CONG TO GOVERNORMeanwhile, former CM Virbhadra Singh, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri and Rathore visited governor Bandaru Dattatreya at Raj Bhawan and highlighted the difficulties being faced by industrialists, common people and farmers.A memorandum submitted by the delegation mentioned that mass testing of the Covid-19 be carried out on war footing, and number of test labs and isolation centres should be increased.

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||Amid no checks during lockdown, wild mushroom ‘smugglers’ have a free run of Kashmir forests||Taking undue advantage of the lockdown, smugglers are having a field day collecting morel mushrooms (gucchi) in the forests located in different areas of Kashmir.Fayaz Ahmad, a resident of Machikrand village in Uri town, said that the smuggling of wild mushrooms was rampant in the area. “This has become a new source of income for the villagers. They are selling it illegally for higher prices,” he said.“The government must tighten the noose on these people as there are no checks on them in the lockdown period,” said Mir Wali Mohammad, sarpanch of Barnate village in Boniyar tehsil of Baramulla district.“Last year we booked three persons and an FIR was also registered against the smugglers. A huge quantity of illegal mushrooms was also recovered from them,” said a forest official posted in Boniyar range, requesting anonymity.Boniyar SHO Tariq Ahmad Shah said a 50-year-old man had recently died after slipping from a mountainous area where he had gone to collect the wild mushrooms.”“Some villagers hunt for morel mushrooms in the forests of Doodpathri area,” said Tahir Ahmad Najar, a resident of Chadoora village in central Kashmir’s Budgam district.“I believe that people are compelled to go to the forests to collect the mushrooms because of the prevailing situation under which many don’t have food or income to survive,” said Raja Abdul Hamid, sarpanch of Dildar village in Karnah tehsil of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district.“We are jobless and have no other source of income. Our families rely on these mushrooms only,” said an Uri resident who often goes to collect the morels.In south Kashmir, these sought-after mushrooms grow in the forests of Daksum and Margun top areas.Chairman of J&K RTI movement and an environmental expert Dr Ghulam Rasool said, “These mushrooms are sold at around ₹20,000 per kg due to their medicinal properties.”Morel mushrooms grow mostly in forest areas in the higher reaches of the valley. It is said that they grow naturally whenever it rains and thunders. They grow in conifer forests across temperate regions, and the cool foothills of the Himalayas, in Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Jammu & Kashmir are an ideal territory for them.As edible as button mushrooms, gucchi variety possesses immunostimulatory and anti-tumour properties. With the valley witnessing continuous rains, production of these mushrooms has gone up considerably. The annual production of gucchi goes up to 400 kg here. People are also making the rounds of the forests to collect timber, wild vegetables and hunt wild birds.Baramulla senior superintendent of police (SSP) Abdul Qayoom said that they had lodged several cases last year for smuggling of wild produce. “More cases are likely to surface as this season proceeds further,” he said.Kashmir chief conservator of forests Syed Farooq Gillani said people may be collecting the mushrooms in view of the prevailing troubled situation. “But as of now, we have not received reports of any major damage to the forests and its resources,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-no-checks-during-lockdown-wild-mushroom-smugglers-have-a-free-run-of-kashmir-forests/story-UXYOeiBxbgWtrANZ4avSgL.html

19-04-2020||Mumbai||Second wife entitled to family pension where customary second marriage is allowed: HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday held that the second wife is entitled to the family pension if the second marriage was permitted by the customs of the deceased employee.A division bench of justice AS Chandurkar and justice Vinay Joshi dismissed an appeal filed by the divisional manager of South East Central Railway, challenging a July 18, 2016 order of the Nagpur camp of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).CAT had directed the railways to release the family pension to one Ganeshibai, widow of Ghasiram Gondor, who had served in South East Central Railway as a gangman.Ghasiram retired on June 30, 2001. His first wife, Sunderabai, died in August 2002 and a year later the former railway employee passed away.After Ghasiram’s death, Ganeshibai claimed the family pension in the capacity of the legally wedded wife of the ex-gangman. She moved CAT after the railway administration rejected her claim in March 2006 on the grounds that she was not entitled to the family pension since she was the second wife of Ghasiram, whose marriage took place while his first wife Sunderabai was still alive.CAT, however, accepted her claim and directed the railways to release her pension. The divisional railway manager then moved the HC challenging the CAT order on the ground that the Railway Service Pension Rules, 1993 do not allow any employee to have a second marriage and since Ghasiram had married Ganeshibai without his employer’s permission, she was not entitled to the family pension.The HC, however, rejected the railway’s appeal. The court noted that Rule 75 [7][i][a] of the 1993 Rules stipulates releasing pension to more widows than one, and lays down that where a deceased employee has more than one widow, the pension should be shared equally.“Though Rule 21 of 1966 Rules mandates to take prior permission for a second marriage, not obtaining such permission would not change the status of said marriage,” said the bench.The comment came in view of the fact that both, Ghasiram and Ganeshibai belonged to the Gond community, a scheduled tribe to which provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act are not applicable.“The personal law applicable to them permits customary second marriage,” said the bench.The court held that the marriage was not void, and therefore, the second wife Ganeshibai, can be termed as the widow of Ghasiram, deceased railway employee, and in view of Rule 75, she is entitled to the family pension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/second-wife-entitled-to-family-pension-where-customary-second-marriage-is-allowed-hc/story-i10y0Q60pRQKwmAC4gfsiL.html
19-04-2020||Chandigarh||After Haryana protest, UT allows critical Covid patients from other states at PGIMER||The UT administration allowed treatment of critical Covid-19 patients from other states at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) following a protest from Haryana.UT adviser Manoj Parida shared it through a tweet on Saturday, saying that PGI will continue to treat critical corona or non-corona cases of neighbouring states, if local doctors find treatment beyond their capacity.“Only condition is that they must consult the PGI director in advance so that they are ready to receive the patient without causing infection,” he said.Earlier, UT had restricted the institute for treatment of Covid-19 patients only from Chandigarh that created a problem in Panchkula three days ago.As reported by Hindustan Times on Saturday, PGIMER declined the request of Panchkula chief medical officer to shift a critical Covid-19 patient. Justifying the denial, PGIMER dean (academics) Dr GD Puri in a statement said “They were restricted by Epidemic Act evoked by the UT administration that stopped the inter-state migration of corona patients”.This, however, did not go well with Haryana government and the state chief secretary took up the matter with UT and PGIMER authorities. Sources confirmed that the Union minister of health and family welfare too intervened in the matter.Will strengthen coordination with states: PGI directorPGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the system at the institute level will be strengthened for better cooperation with the neighbouring states for the treatment of Covid-19 patients who need critical support and care. “Primarily, if a patient requires intensive care unit (ICU) support, experts from anaesthesia and internal medicine departments will be nominated for coordination with the neighbouring states for decision on shifting of critical patients,” he said.Dr Ram said the patients who can be treated at local facilities should not be referred to the institute as isolation is the only possible way to stop the spread of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-haryana-protest-ut-allows-critical-covid-patients-from-other-states-at-pgimer/story-WufSP1sbSeL744rpL2Kz6H.html

Limaye, who is locked down at her Sadashiv peth residence, is enjoying her stay at home as she has received this sudden break to spend time with her family.Fresh from her heroics at South Asian Games, 2019 where she helped India to win gold medal, Limaye has not compromised on her fitness and practice and she is dribbling with household chores, spending leisure time and following fitness routine at home.The 25-year-old Limaye was also part of Indian railways team which defeated Kerala to lift title at Senior National Basketball Championship, Ludhiana and she was in the top five performers in Asia in FIBA Asia Cup held at Bengaluru.Morning sessionMorning time is dedicated to help my mother with all the household chores and watering the garden and then generally, I relax after finishing all my work.Afternoon sessionI keep myself busy in the afternoon with writing articles about my basketball journey and then I feed my dog and kitten who have been living in the house for the last couple of days. I also binge watch shows online in the afternoon.Evening sessionThe session usually starts at 4:30 pm. I go on the terrace and do some skipping for warm up and then start my workout. I usually do lower body the first day, upper body the second day, scapula and core the third day, functional the forth and power for the fifth day. After an hour and half of working out, I do some dribbling to keep me up to date with the sport.I am staying fit by doing step workout at home. I also use the large terrace to my benefit and include a lot of skipping and jumping in my workouts.This lockdown has been amazing as I get to spend some time with my family because I’ve just been travelling for the last couple of years. It’s hard staying away from the game but it is also a good break and good rest to the body as rest is equally important. At nights, I try and feed all the dogs who come to our gate and walk my dog. I also feed the cats around.Feeding cats and dogs is something which I like a lot but due to my tight schedule it is not possible to do it frequently but right now due to lockdown I am managing to do it every day.This isolation time has made life difficult for all but I believe we all must occupy our self with doing all those things which we have not managed to do previously.

19-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: Community comes together to help the needy||Museb Sayyed, (49), a travel agency owner, at NIBM road, is creating awareness among the community about the precautions to take to stop the spread of Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection. He is also the Amir (leader of Muslim community) of Kausar Baug Masjid, Kondhwa, from the past 10 years and along with his team is involved in providing relief to the needy people in this time of crisis. He speaks about this role. What exactly is your role in this pandemic?After the lockdown was announced by our Prime Minister on March 24 all the mosques were closed in Kausarbaug area in the city. Usually, at least 1,000 to 5,000 people visit the mosque during the day. We trained our committee members who impart the details to other members in the committee about coronavirus and the precautions to be taken. The members are also involved in providing food and ration kits to the needy. We distributed at least 800 kids till date. All the elected members of the society as well as the Masjid have been informed about the situation and asked to take preventive measures.How does your day begin and roll out?My day starts at 6 pm with prayer and then I coordinate for the requirements of my house. I then coordinate with the members of the mosque who are involved in relief work. We also get calls from people who are unable to buy medicines so we coordinate with them and our volunteers deliver the medicines. At around 8.45 I pray at home.What precautions are you taking?I always wear a mask and carry a sanitizer with me when I am working out of the house. I believe one should be healthy himself first if he has to serve the society during these times of crisis.What is your view of the Covid-19 situation Pune?The Pune civic body has implemented the lockdown effectively and taken all the necessary steps to prevent the spread. The police are on their toes and make sure people follow the rules of lockdown. They take at least two to three rounds daily in our area. What gaps do you see in health and relief work?There is a scarcity of masks and gloves for the members who are involved in relief work. Besides if the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) could allot more of the sanitising spraying machines for Kondhwa Kausarbaug and NIBM road, it would help to sanitize the area better. Right there is only one machine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-community-comes-together-to-help-the-needy/story-QHDtFcn8x7Mg7Tx8yqH3DO.html

The data states that most of the deceased had comorbid conditions with diabetes and hypertension being the primary causal factors for their deaths. The data was released on Friday.The hospital has come under fire from the public and the state government as 41 out of 50 deaths reported in Pune city and rural were reported from Sassoon as of Saturday. The report also emphasizes that patients come to the hospital only when they have reached a critical stage. Out of the 39 deaths, 11 were declared dead on the second day of admission to at Sassoon while six on the fourth day giving little time for the hospital doctors to treat the patients.Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar had earlier defenced the hospital administration by stating that, “Most senior citizens and people with comorbid conditions are coming to the hospital when their situation is worse which gives hospital less time to treat the patient.”Former Dean DR Ajay Chandanwale said, “Most patients who were declared dead came at a critical stage and some were even referred from other hospitals after they reached a critical stage or got serious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/diabetes-hypertension-leading-cause-of-death-among-covid-19-patients-according-to-sassoon/story-stDdMOv4dp2RLNUAyojyYO.html
19-04-2020||Pune||Reach out to supportive family to deal with domestic violence, says Dr Nayreen Daruwalla||Dr Nayreen Daruwalla, director, Society for Nutrition, Education & Health Action (Sneha) a non-governmental organisation that works on programmes on prevention of violence against women and children, talks to HT about how women are finding it difficult to call the helpline especially when the abusive family members are at home sharing the same space.  The National Commission for Women (NCW) has claimed that distress calls of domestic abuse victims have increased sharply in the lockdown period. Has your helpline also seen a similar surge during the lockdown?Women approach our counselling centres through three main mediums; physically access the counselling centre, crisis helpline and crisis email. On an average, Sneha counselling centres register around 400 cases monthly, including women and children, and around 4,800 cases are registered annually. The Covid-19 situation has restricted women’s mobility in terms of reporting of cases.In March 2020, the counselling centres registered 513 cases, out of which 177 survivors (37%) were provided initial support, psycho education, and referral to the police and counselling on the helpline.In the normal situation, the counselling centres receive about 100 calls on the helpline every month and around 10 crisis emails requesting assistance. During the pandemic, from mid-March to mid-April 2020, Sneha has received 45 crisis emails (32 from Mumbai and 13 from elsewhere in India).At the same time, calls on the helpline have fallen from 100 to 56 as survivors are finding it difficult to call, especially when the abusive family members are at home sharing the same space. Can you give us an idea of what some of the calls have been like?Survivors have requested help as they are facing physical, emotional, verbal and sexual violence in their natal and matrimonial homes.How does the helpline help women in distress? Has your approach in helping them changed during the lockdown? Yes, the counselling is done over the phone when the survivor is in a position to talk in privacy. Appointments are given to them. The survivors are asked to call the counsellors when they find a private moment. With our 20 years of experience in networking with public systems, the counsellors are in a position to connect the woman with the police or protection officer in the area where the survivor resides. What advice would you give women who are stuck in homes with their abusers?At this point of exacerbated vulnerability of women in their homes, it would be best to for them to follow these steps:-Reach out to supportive family and friends who can help with immediate solutions as well as coping with stress-Develop a safety plan for them and their children with the help of neighbours, friends or relatives-Collect important documents, money and few personal things in case the woman needs to leave.-Plan carefully on the phone the exit with a family member, friend or relative to access transportation help by contacting the nearby police station-Gather information on women’s helplines, NGOs providing support services on violence, shelter and police protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/reach-out-to-supportive-family-to-deal-with-domestic-violence-says-dr-nayreen-daruwalla/story-wNgce9Jby8Hidg9m4vJiHP.html
19-04-2020||Pune||Pune ZP to send domestic violence perpetrators to institutional quarantine||With reports of domestic violence on the rise during the lockdown, the rural administration in Pune has come up with its own solution - send the erring men to institutional quarantine.The Pune zilla parishad on Saturday announced that it has formed dedicated village-level committees to first track cases of domestic violence and then counsel the members resorting to abuse. If a man continues to ill-treat the woman even after counselling, he would be put in institutional quarantine as punishment.The Pune zilla parishad’s announcement comes in the backdrop of the National Commission for Women’s statistics that show a spike in cases of domestic violence against women during the nationwide lockdown.“We have done this because globally there are reports of women suffering domestic violence at the hands of their husbands. The committees have been formed at the village level where professional counselling of the male members of the families are being done. The counselling sessions are related to those families where the incidents of abuse and ill treatment of women have been reported. These steps are being taken proactively in tandem with the Domestic Violence Act. The provision of putting the husband in institutional quarantine has been taken so that the women do not face a loss of residence,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune zilla parishad. While Pune rural police have not observed any surge in complaints related to domestic violence, the ease of quarantine will act as deterrent, said zilla parishad officials.According to data shared by the National Commission for Women (NCW), 123 cases of domestic violence were received between February 27 and March 22. In the last 25 days, the commission received 239 more such complaints. The commission has also launched a WhatsApp number to report domestic violence cases.The village-level committees in Pune district have been designated as local vigilance committees where women staffers attached to the state-run child care centres, women members of the local gram panchayats and self -help group (SHG) will be counselling those individuals who are found mistreating the women.The administration has reasoned that the step is undertaken as a preventive measure to curb the spread of outbreak of the epidemic. The administration will investigate each type of complaint made by victim before the administration and action will be taken. “The person will be counselled in the first place and if he does not show any improvement in behaviour and continues to harass the woman, he will be admitted in institutional quarantine,” said Prasad. The ZP will take assistance of the police in carrying out the initiative and the entire process will be in writing.Anil Deshmukh lauds initiativeMaharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh lauded the ZP initiative. Deshmukh said the committees were formed in “line with the home department’s instructions to deal with cases of domestic violence”.“Other zilla parishads in the state should follow the suit to ensure women are not harassed,” he tweetedLocked down with their abusers, women turn to helplines for solaceRenu Deshpande DholeStay home, stay safe – the universal advisory in the times of Covid-19 pandemic, might sound full of irony for victims of domestic violence and women stuck in toxic, abusive relationships, said city psychologists . Helplines and women’s organisations have come forward to urge women to seek help if they find themselves at the receiving end of violence during this difficult time.“In crisis times such as this, ‘active violence’ is erupting due to feeling of being cooped up, especially in families that are already dysfunctional. The level of stress due to the many uncertainties surrounding the future is high and a loss of control in the outside world might lead to more aggressive, controlling behaviour by the perpetrator at home,” explained feminist psychologist Sadhana Natu.She, and 26 other psychologists in Pune, have circulated their mobile numbers widely with the intention of helping anyone in need of reaching out for emotional/psychological support during the lockdown.“The limitation is that only those who are using a phone, have access to WhatsApp, Facebook (which we used for publicity) can use this service. That leaves out the lower middle classes and the poor with no access,” Natu said.Grassroots organisations and activists working in the field at the forefront of fighting Covid-19 could help popularise these initiatives by experts, she felt.Sadhana Khati, chairperson, local complains committee, Pune district, agreed that the limited access to a mobile phone and the lack of private space to call for help might exacerbate the feeling of being trapped for victims of domestic violence. “While women from all classes suffer violence and abuse, there’s often silence around it in middle class/upper class homes. Then again, violence can come in many shades – economic, emotional, sexual, physical. We will have to wait to gauge the full impact of this lockdown on domestic abuse victims,” she said.If one can’t access a helpline, there are some safety mechanisms that women in toxic relationships, problematic marriages and violence-ridden families can employ to avoid suffering as the lockdown continues, says relationship therapist and psychologist Seema Gaikwad.“In these times, when one might be cut off from trusted people, it is important to have some sort of support system in place. It may help to call friends, video call loved ones, asking near and dear ones to check on you regularly or having online sessions with your counsellor or therapist as a part of your routine. For your own safety, try to avoid triggers of conflict. Do not provoke, do not react when possible. Remember that this lockdown is not unending. Use the introspection done in this period to work out a plan to address your issues, after this crisis is over,” she advised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-zp-to-send-domestic-violence-perpetrators-in-institutional-quarantine/story-UZJSOjnuWie1KFn10IilrN.html
19-04-2020||Pune||For every 100 patients tested in Pune, 10 are positive; officials assure to increase testing||For every hundred patients whose swab were tested in the city, more than 10 turned out to the positive for Covid-19 which takes the testing to sample proportion in Pune district to 10.25%.Pune is the second hotspot in Maharashtra after Mumbai with experts calling for more testing. The district administration is now trying to get more labs on board, said officials.With 565 positive cases as of April 17 out of the 5,507 results which came from various laboratories, the city’s testing to sample proportion is 10.25%. As compared to Mumbai, this rate is close to 6%. According to the data from the BMC health department from February 3 to April 15 around 30,500 samples have been tested out of which 1,936 tested positive for the virus, which gives a proportion of sample to tested positive ratio of 6.1%.Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said, “We want to expand our testing capacity and so have already spoken to Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) to bring on board private laboratories too. Within 2-3 days we will increase our testing capacity drastically. With regards to testing asymptomatic patients, we conduct the first test if the person had come in close contact with the Covid-19 patients and then quarantine the person. No further tests are taken if the person does not show symptoms.”According to public health expert Dr Abhijit More who works with Jan Aarogya Abhiyan asymptomatic patients must be tested every 5th and 14th day as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. “Since most cases are asymptomatic and if the person tests positive, the compliance of quarantine or isolation could be managed better.Mumbai has started mass testing about 10 days ago which is why the number went high but in Pune the testing rate is too low. If the lockdown period is not used to test more people then what is the use of the lockdown?” he said.He further states that the government can also collaborate with Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and National Centre for Cell Sciences which are located in Pune or bring in more private laboratories because government infrastructure would fall short in today’s scenario. “Pool testing is another option which is approved by ICMR wherein multiple sample are mixed and if one of the sample is found negative then the can test each sample separately.”With ICMR protocols calling for testing asymptomatic patients twice within the incubation periods, the district administration is simply isolating the patients after the first test if it is negative. Currently the city has only three government labs which test samples, including NIV which gets sample testing requests from across the country and sometimes from other counties, Sassoon hospital which manages tests from Satara and also AFMC which mainly accepts samples from Nashik.Dr TP Lahane, who heads Directorate of Medical Education and Research, which also controls Sassoon hospital said, “BJ Medical College tests samples of only those patients who come to Sassoon directly. We are mainly testing samples from Satara, Nashik and Karad and we have tested 1,500 tests till date from 21 March. Pune is mainly managed from NIV and the follow of testing of Covid-19 first contacts and high risk contacts is done by the corporation and the patient could be sent to Sassoon or Naidu.”He further added that the testing capacity which is currently 120-150 has been increased to 200 daily as we will soon start using the automated RNA extraction machine.At AFMC around 300 samples from Pune have been tested, around 1,000 from Ahmednagar and Nashik, according to AFMC spokesperson.According to the data from district health office as of April 17, 7 pm 5,703 samples sent to government labs including National Institute of Virology (NIV)Pune district 5,507 results have come565 positive casesThis brings the testing to positive proportion to 10.25 per cent compared to 6.1 per cent in MumbaiICMR Protocols for testing The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) strategy for Covid19 testing dated April 9, 2020 states that· All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days· All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases· All symptomatic health care workers· All patients with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and cough and/or shortness of breath)· Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contactIn hotspots/cluster (as per Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) and in large migration gatherings/ evacuees centresAll symptomatic ILI (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose)Within 7 days of illness – rRT-PCR (Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction )After 7 days of illness – Antibody test (If negative, confirmed by rRT-PCR)Government labs testing samples in Pune · National Institute of Virology, Pune· Armed Forces Medical College, Pune· BJ Medical College, PunePrivate labs approved by ICMR · AG Diagnostics Pvt Ltd· Sahyadri Specialty Labs· Ruby Hall Clinic· Metropolis Healthcare Limited||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/for-every-100-patients-tested-in-pune-10-are-positive-officials-assure-to-increase-testing/story-I3vsunlILqGwmmwGVaKLqL.html

The domes should be repaired…I humbly urge Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar to address the issue of damage done to dome gurdwara due to storm. Construction of a Gurdwara Sahib is not the work of government, it should have been given to Kar Sewa committee or Sangat in the very first place.”Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) president Satwant Singh said, “Damage amid this kind of weather conditions is not abnormal thing. The thunderstorm also caused damage at many other places in Pakistan. However, it is being projected as a big issue by a section of electronic media in India. We have got these domes repaired and are affixing them on their places very soon on the periphery of the gurdwara”.A long pending demand of the Indian Sikh community, a 4-km long corridor was opened on November 9 last year from Dera Baba Nanak, a town situated along international border in India side, to Kartarpur which is the last resting place of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak.The corridor is closed following the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thunderstorm-damages-2-domes-on-newly-built-structure-at-kartarpur-gurdwara/story-wl2HRNDYToVsnMfFSIPHaL.html

19-04-2020||Education||DD Bihar, state govt to offer online teaching for matric, inter students||In a bid to mitigate the impact of complete lockdown on school students, the state government has decided to offer online teaching to students of classes 9 and 10, beginning Monday, to make up for the disruption in classes.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, presided by chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar, in the presence of deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, chief secretary Deepak Prasad, DGP Gupteshwar Pandey and departmental heads. All DMs and SPs were connected through video conference.As the education department will be functional from Monday, the CM directed its principal secretary, RK Mahajan, to start offering online education, for at least an hour, for the time being, on a daily basis.Mahajan further said that the process for booking a slot on public broadcaster, Doordarshan Bihar, to begin an hour long learning class for the students will be initiated and the department will also push for sealing a separate slot for students of class 11 and 12 too.While the move is an attempt to try and make up for the loss in school curriculum that will pitch students for taking up the crucial board examinations next year, it appears that it will also help in filling up the sudden break in the lives of students who are now forced to stay indoors in the times of a crisis.The CM also asked the concerned departmental heads and the district administrations to step up the door-to-door screening exercise to test symptomatic persons and put them under isolation with a view to contain the spread of Covid-19.“DMs should monitor the exercise to ensure each and every family is covered under the exercise in all the four districts identified as hot spots, as is being done in the case of pulse-polio drive, and also keep a watch on Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), and instances of bird flu in their respective districts,” he said, adding, “Proper monitoring of incoming passengers is also an important step in containing the spread of the pandemic.”Kumar also directed officials of the disaster management department to ensure that dry milk powder was available in camps and isolation centres. “All eligible persons, who do not have ration cards, should be identified with the help of Jeevika workers and food grains should also be provided to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/dd-bihar-state-govt-to-offer-online-teaching-for-matric-inter-students/story-WMOeTifisLSG0eUh6Hfi4K.html

The administration was gearing for curfew relaxation from April 20 but that’s not to be. Of particular worry to the officialdom is how to manage the delivery of food to more than 3 lakh city residents daily. “Had curfew relaxation been allowed from April 20, most of the things would have taken care of themselves. But with fresh coronavirus cases surfacing, the road ahead is difficult,” a senior UT official said. MOHALI CIVIL SURGEON BELIEVES IN POWER OF PRAYERIn these difficult times, Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh, like many others, prays daily for an early end to the Covid-19 pandemic. On the frontline, he admits he prays daily for the well-being of all. For two days last week, his prayers were answered as Mohali did not report any new case and there was good news from Jawaharpur village from where 38 cases had been reported earlier. The village’s first coronavirus case, a 42-year-old panch, tested negative after treatment.ON COVID CURFEW DUTY, COPS BRING OUT THE BEST IN RESIDENTSPolice personnel ensuring that the coronavirus curfew is observed end up spending hours in the sun. With summer setting in, some local businessmen and members of resident welfare associations are coming to their aid. Cops on duty shared how the grocery chain, 24 Seven, had been sending refreshments for cops deployed near their stores. Those posted near residential areas said residents were sending across refreshments such as tea and nimbu pani besides snacks. LEOPARD ENSURES MOHALI STAYS HOME, AND SAFEResidents of Mohali have been observing the Covid-19 lockdown sincerely thanks to a leopard being sighted in their town. Photos of pug marks of the wild cat are being shared on social media platforms, keeping the wildlife department on its toes. People are citing the continuous barking of dogs and peacock calls to buttress their case of sighting the leopard. Interestingly, people are even making announcements, urging others to stay indoors lest they come face to face with the leopard. SHARING INFORMATION, PUNJAB SHOWS THE WAYNeighbouring Punjab is proactive in disseminating information regarding Covid-19 patients and their contact tracing, but the health authorities of Chandigarh are slow to confirm information. The latest example being of a woman resident of Sector 30 who tested positive on Friday evening. The health department and centralised information unit of the UT did not confirm the development despite repeated attempts. In these times of social media, perhaps they should take a leaf out of Punjab’s practice of prompt online updates and detailed media bulletins.VIPS DEFY LOCKDOWN AS COPS CRACK DOWN ON AAM AADMIHow many VIPs have violated the Chandigarh administration’s prohibitory orders? That’s a question none in Chandigarh Police is willing to answer. It seems the police crackdown for violating the lockdown is for the aam aadmi, while the personnel turn a blind eye towards violations by the influential, including bureaucrats, present and former. They are let off with a polite warning. “The rule of law should be same for all, specially in a pandemic. As soon as we catch an important person, he/she is quick to call up our boss, who asks us to let him/her off,” says a cop candidly.HOLIDAYS PUT TEACHERS’ ONLINE CLASSES OFF TRACKUT education department officials and teachers worked day and night to compile the logistics of students so that online classes could begin amid the Covid-19 crisis.

19-04-2020||City||HT Chandigarh debate: Charity has to be channelised effectively to target groups||With the world and India set for a long-drawn battle against Covid-19 and the lockdown in India extended up to May 3, this is the time for redefining the role of NGOs and civil society in streamlining charitable initiatives in real time coordination with the administration.Till now, ever since the curfew/lockdown was imposed, a number of NGOs and good Samaritans have come forward to organise community meal (langar) services and supply food to the administration to distribute to the poor and the homeless. However, what has been lacking is a well coordinated response system to alleviate the distress of people left without any means of income after the lockdown led to drying up of work/jobs.What is going against NGOs and philanthropists is that most of them have been operating on their own without guidelines, attempting to reach out to the underprivileged in whichever way they deem fit. Without a well-defined, workable plan in place, many people are not able to benefit from their charitable initiatives.Fine tuning the PM Cares fund, set up specifically to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, to guarantee transparency in utilisation of money, allocating specific amounts to each charity with UT or state or district administrations as the overarching authority to supervise spending could be a way forward.The aim of funds like this should not be only to help the underprivileged tide over the present crisis, but also to help rehabilitate them in the long term.Every plan must be need-based. The focus immediately should be on mapping out beneficiaries and ensure everyone gets his or her rightful share of food. This can later be extended to monetary help, creation of work opportunities, continuing education of children and other support systems for them.Work must be initiated on a war footing to start helping the needy to enable them to quickly get back on their feet once normalcy is restored.WRITE TO USWhat can be done for effective distribution of charity?How can charitable endeavours be streamlined during the Covid-19 crisis, made sustainable and reach targeted populations?

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: In a city under lockdown, sex workers going without food, medical attention||They have run out of money so they are dependent on NGOs for meals, no clients visit them as the city remains locked down because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Female sex workers (FSWs) here are struggling to make ends meet during the crisis.Some of them do not even have money for facemasks or gloves.“This has been my only source of income for the last 15 years after I was pushed into this profession to take care of my bedridden father,” says a woman.“I have four children, I don’t have enough to feed them,” she adds.Over 3,000 FSWs are registered with the Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society apart from an unspecified number living in the city.Many of them say they have not had a single client in days.Manpinder Kaur, project manager with the NGO Servants of the People Society, who has been helping these women since 2009, says: “SOPS takes care of 600 female sex workers, 50% of them newly initiated. The ones who have just started working are facing more hardships as they don’t have contacts. They are vulnerable, unlike the ones who are associated with pimps, who take care of them.”In normal circumstances the FSWs work out of their own homes, visit clients at their homes or in rooms rented out by pimps.“For 80% women, this is their only source of income. Old-timers with contacts are often forced to entertain clients even for basic essentials,” Kaur adds.Another worker in her 30s with three children says she had ration for 10 days after a woman working with an NGO gave her wheat flour and pulses. “Now it’s finished. What do I do?” she asks.Forced into this work to earn enough to educate her children, she says there are a lot of women like her who do not have rations, are sick and in need of medical attention.“Their names and demands were handed over to the area counsellor, but till date they have not received any help.”Another 40-year-old woman says on a regular day she would earn Rs 500 to Rs 3,000. But since the lockdown, “in the entire month, I got only one client.” Pinky Rani, project manager with the NGO Yuvsatta, who is looking after 648 FSWs, says some of the workers do not even have money for contraceptives.Tapan Singh, project manager with Indian Public Health Association, says 50 % of sex workers, including males who have sex with males (MSMs) and transgender people, have no savings. They are from very poor backgrounds, and dependent on daily earnings. “These days, all they are worried about is where their next meal is coming from.”Dr Sandeep Mittal, deputy director, State AIDS Control Society, says: “To reach out to the high risk groups, including FSWs, MSMs, truckers etc, we have 10 NGOs and on Thursday, we had a meeting with them, where issues faced by the sex-workers were also discussed. Definitely, with lockdown, their only source of livelihood has been hit. We are trying to provide help via organisations, but movement is restricted because of the lockdown.”The lockdown has also impacted the regular medical check-ups for HIV and sexually transmitted infections. “As per protocol, a worker should be screened for STI four times a year and twice every year for HIV. So, daily we had lots of workers to be screened for. But because of lockdown, we are doing only need-based screening - only those who come have symptoms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-in-a-city-under-lockdown-sex-workers-going-without-food-medical-attention/story-HaadD8PNDLIstioWH3TGVK.html

He also said Friday should continue to be observed as dry day as the practice has been on for long time.Dr Manjit Singh said that people were staying homes due to the ongoing curfew and so they have a lot of time on their hands which they could use to clean coolers, flowerpots, fridge trays, water tanks and other containers which are the usual breeding sites of the deadly mosquito. The doctor said that the district health department has asked the Mohali municipal corporation to carry out fogging on streets and other public places.District epidemiologist Dr Renu Singh said dengue fever is treatable and if symptoms appear, one should visit the nearest health facility or dial helpline 104 for medical guidance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protect-yourself-from-dengue-too-warns-mohali-civil-surgeon/story-A7B1pOgTQDVzthf09funPL.html
19-04-2020||Chandigarh||14-day quarantine for outsiders entering Chandigarh||An outsider entering Chandigarh will be quarantined for 14 days as per a decision taken in a review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Saturday.UT adviser Manoj Parida said as per government of India’s directions, outsiders entering the city will be quarantined for 14 days either at home or in government facilities to prevent spread of infection.He, however, stated that this will not apply on residents of neighbouring cities who are out on government duty or catering to essential services. He said as per the ministry of home guidelines, the entire UT has been declared as containment zone. “Since in Chandigarh, the coronavirus outbreak is scattered and not confined to a specific pocket, area, village or cluster, the entire city has been declared a containment zone,” he added. The latest declaration has ruled out any relaxation of curfew from April 20.Meanwhile, Badnore expressed serious concern over health workers getting infected after two Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) workers were found positive for the virus on Friday.He directed that authorities of all government and private hospitals must strictly follow the protocol laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) while treating Covid-19 patients. He also stressed that the administration must rigorously do the contact tracing of these two patients and ensure that the infection is contained.He advised the PGIMER director to ensure that proper safety, security and sanitisation is done on the institute campus so that there is no reoccurrence of such infections.He directed the chiefs of all medical institutions to ensure that critical non-corona cases are also attended to on priority. --BoxSec-26 mandi to remain closed on MondayThe UT administration decided to shut the Sector 26 wholesale mandi on Monday for sanitisation and cleaning. There will be no distribution of vegetables and fruits by the administration’s buses on Monday.Badnore directed that the flour mills should be kept open, so that the beneficiaries receiving the wheat under PMGKAY can get it milled.Municipal commissioner KK Yadav stated that sanitisation through drones has been started in the city. He also stated that distribution of baby food for the needy mothers has been arranged by the municipal corporation. 4800 rapid kits receivedPrincipal secretary (health) Arun Kumar Gupta said 4,800 rapid testing kits have been received, which will be utilised as per the advice of medical experts. The administrator has given directions to coordinate with Panjab University, Punjab Engineering College and other NGOs for blood donation camps. ----Embedded copyUT allows patients from other states at PGIMERThe UT administration also allowed treatment of serious Covid-19 patients from other states at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) following a protest from Haryana.UT adviser Manoj Parida shared it through a tweet on Saturday, saying that PGI will continue to treat serious corona or non-corona cases of neighbouring states, if local doctors find treatment beyond their capacity.“Only condition is that they must consult in advance PGI director so that they are ready to receive patient without causing infection,” he said.Earlier UT had restricted the institute to entertain Covid-19 patients only from Chandigarh that created a problem in Panchkula three days ago.As reported by Hindustan Times on Saturday, PGIMER declined the request of Panchkula chief medical officer regarding shifting a serious Covid-19 patient. Justifying the denial, PGIMER dean (academics) Dr GD Puri in a statement said “they were restricted by Epidemic Act evoked by the UT administration that stopped the inter-state migration of corona patients”. This, however, did not go well with Haryana government and state chief secretary took up the matter with UT and PGIMER authorities. Sources confirmed that Union minister of health and family welfare too intervened in the matter.Will strengthen coordination with states: PGI directorPGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the system at the institute level will be strengthened for better cooperation with the neighbouring states for the treatment of Covid-19 patients who need critical support and care. “Primarily, if the patient who require intensive care unit (ICU) support, experts from anaesthesia and internal medicine departments will be nominated for coordination with the neighbouring states for decision on shifting of critical patients,” he said.Dr Ram said that the patients who can be treated at local facilities should not be referred to the institute as isolation is the only possible way to stop the spread of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/14-day-quarantine-for-outsiders-entering-chandigarh/story-WFZ3MAhGBEooFltWXyoNKI.html

This is because of the Mandi and Chandigarh authorities. I have been alone in Chandigarh for a month due to the curfew, but at least allow me to be with my parents in this time of grief.”When contacted by Hindustan Times, Kushaldeep Kaur said, “I explained the entire situation to Mandi’s ADC but he refused saying it was not possible. Later, he asked me to get permission from the Chandigarh DC.” However, she says when she got in touch with Chandigarh administration, she was told the pass will have to be issued by Mandi administration.Kushaldeep said her grandmother had been hospitalised owing to a critical situation when her sugar levels spiked.When contacted, Mandi DC Rigved Thakur said he was not aware of the case, adding, “In case of emergencies we are issuing curfew passes but they will be valid in Mandi district only.

Earlier, after a 65-year-old man of Nayagaon’s Dashmesh Nagar had died of the disease on March 31, the area was declared a containment zone and residents were extensively screened. Health authorities have restarted screening these residents and sealed the street where the deceased stayed.The hospital attendant lives with his wife, a newborn son, mother and brother-in-law in a multi-storey building in the thickly populated Adarsh Nagar. The building has around 40 rooms, which are all on rent. The building opposite has about 100 rooms, all occupied on rent. All residents are acquaintances and kept visiting each other despite the curfew.As many as 13 of his contacts, including his family members, have been tested. The reports are awaited. The 30-year-old had been working in PGIMER’s ward where suspected Covid positive patients are isolated.“The area around his building has been sealed and all families living in the building have been quarantined. All essential supplies will be delivered to these residents at their doorsteps,” said Himanshu Jain, sub-divisional magistrate ( SDM), Kharar, adding that the Nayagaon municipal council executive officer, the nodal officer for essential supplies, will ensure this. “Besides sampling the primary contacts, we will screen area residents using rapid testing kits from Monday onwards,” said Girish Dayalan, deputy commissioner, Mohali.Civil surgeon Manjit Singh said, “Further contact tracing is on. The house-to-house survey of the locality where the patient lives has been completed, and so far all residents are asymptomatic.”“The street outside the youth’s building has been sanitised and barricaded to limit movement of residents,” said area councillor Kuljinder Kaur.Meanwhile, the district reported no fresh case on Saturday. Mohali has so far confirmed 57 positive cases. Of these two persons have died and six have been discharged after being cured.123 CONTACTS OF TWO CHANDIGARH PATIENTS TRACEDChandigarh MC’s contact tracing team has traced 75 contacts of the Sector-30B woman and 48 contacts of the sanitation worker from Dhanas. Both had tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, taking the Chandigarh count to 23.While the sanitation worker is suspected to have picked up the infection while working in PGIMER’s communicable diseases ward, the source of the woman’s infection has not been ascertained yet. The grocery shop, chemist shop and a Verka booth visited by the woman, who is in her 50s, have been sealed.“Among her 75 contacts, six live with her. There are five more family contacts. Nine of these people have been sampled. The remaining 64 people are community contacts and have been home quarantined,” stated the MC team’s report.In the case of the 50-year-old sanitary worker, seven of his household contacts, 15 family contacts, 15 community contacts and 11 contacts from work have been traced and put under home-quarantine. Samples of his seven household contacts have been collected.“Contact tracing takes time, it’s not a one-day task. Till now, the source of infection of the Sector-30 woman has not been traced. The teams are working on it,” said Arun Gupta, health secretary, Chandigarh.The teams are also using mobile tower locations to trace the areas visited by the patients.The city reported no new case on Saturday, but reports of 22 samples are pending. MOHALI CASES HIGH, CURBS TO STAY: DCWith 57 Covid-19 cases in Mohali — the highest in Punjab, the district administration has ruled out any relaxations in the curfew.“The number of positive cases is high and we have not reached the stage of no new cases in 14 days, so there will be no relaxation,” said Girish Dayalan, deputy commissioner, Mohali.Any violations of the curfew will invite criminal proceedings under the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Indian Penal Code.“Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi has the highest number of cases at 37, and will remain a containment zone, along with the neighbouring Devi Nagar, Haripur Kurha and Mukandpur villages. Buffer zone will extend to 2km beyond the containment zone,” he added.The DC said, “Comprehensive contact tracing and sampling will continue with the same pace, as it is crucial to effectively combat coronavirus.”So far total of 919 samples have been tested, of which 838 have been found negative. The results of 24 samples are awaited. As many as 636 people are under home-quarantine, while 1,893 people have completed the quarantine period..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/22-families-living-in-covid-positive-pgimer-staffer-s-building-quarantined-in-nayagaon/story-lRaP1MLcmJ9IG6rMHcm3WN.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||‘25% more flamingos in MMR’||After delaying their annual migration to wetlands in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), flamingos are flocking to the city in large numbers.The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), which estimated that their numbers in MMR are 25% more than last year, said that lower human activity has created ideal conditions for foraging in wetlands near Sewri and Thane Creek and other areas like Talawe wetlands, comprising NRI Complex, Seawoods and TS Chanakya, in Navi Mumbai. These areas, which otherwise see a lot of construction work and movement of people, are quieter. The BNHS said that wildlife authorities should look at the developments and declare the Seawoods area as a flamingo sanctuary as the local administration plans to develop a golf course at the site. Various areas along the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary were also witnessing large congregations as fishing activities are currently on hold owing to the lockdown.“A major reason for the large numbers is also the large flocks of juveniles moving to these sites, following the successful breeding documented two years ago. Additionally, the lockdown is giving these birds peace for roosting, no disturbance in their attempt to obtain food, and overall encouraging habitat,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS. “Wetland destruction and developmental activities across several areas of the eastern seafront is another reason why larger bird numbers are getting squeezed into smaller pockets like in Navi Mumbai.”During January, numbers were as low as 33,334 individuals across MMR, but by the end of February it increased to 1 lakh. While researchers could not go on field dowing to the lockdown, using grid technique or blocking — a counting technique by dividing photographs (mapping a large area) into grids used when single species of birds are in large numbers and stationary — the BNHS estimated that current numbers surpassed 1.5 lakh in the first week of April. In 2019, the highest flamingo count was recorded at 1.21 lakh. At Talawe wetlands, the maximum count was about 6,000-odd individuals, which has crossed 8,500 this year.“We are witnessing an overall increase in flamingo population in the range of 23-25% since 2019. An accurate count will be taken once the lockdown is called off,” said Apte, adding that BNHS had correctly predicted the delayed arrival of flamingos in 2020 when numbers were very low in January.The MMR is the second-largest flamingo habitat along the west coast after Kutch, Gujarat, according to BNHS, which began monitoring flamingo numbers since May 2018, under a 10-year exercise. “Flamingos usually visit MMR wetlands from November to May, mostly for feeding purposes from the Gujarat region, which is their breeding area. Migration starts after monsoon, when water-filled regions start drying up. However, owing to good availability of water last year through winter, arrivals this year were delayed,” said Rahul Khot, assistant director, BNHS, who leads the flamingo studies. “While there is a decline in industrial waste during the lockdown, the influx of domestic sewage is helping the undisturbed formation of planktons, algae and microbenthos formation, which forms the food for flamingos and other wetland birds.” Navi Mumbai (Seawoods) resident Sunil Agarwal said, “Residents are cooped up at home spending their mornings and evenings at their balconies taking photographs and videos of these relaxed birds. The lockdown will at least prompt people to focus on what is around them, which they had been taking for granted, and hopefully this site will be declared a flamingo sanctuary soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/25-more-flamingos-in-mmr/story-OOBiPNb9rTsInMEAli8e2L.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||328 new cases in state take virus count to 3,648; toll 211||After the relatively low numbers of the past two days, Maharashtra on Saturday registered a jump in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases with 328 more infections, taking the tally to 3,648.Of the new cases recorded on Saturday, 184 cases were from Mumbai, taking the city’s tally to 2,268; 78 cases were from Pune. This is the third time this month that single-day numbers have crossed the 300 mark. Maharashtra also recorded 11 Covid-19 deaths on Saturday, taking its toll to 211, the state health department said. The toll figure excludes the one death reported in Mumbai on April 11, which has later corrected as a non-Covid-19 death as the test result of the deceases turned out negative.The areas around Mumbai recorded a single-digit rise in cases on Saturday. Thane city recorded six cases, while Thane rural and Bhiwandi recorded three cases each. Kalyan-Dombivli recorded five cases, while Navi Mumbai recorded two cases. Vasai-Virar and Panvel recorded a case each. In Palghar, the number of cases reported on Saturday was seven.There were 11 positive cases in Mira-Bhayandar, eight cases in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Akola, Amravati, Aurangabad, Nandurbar recorded one case each. Raigad recorded five cases, Satara saw four cases and Solapur saw two cases.According to the state health department officials, the trajectory of the cases needs to plateau by April 21 for it to remain under control. “We expect the cases to dip after the two 14-day incubation cycles, which began on March 22, when over 2.20 lakh people came to Mumbai airport. If the containment is good it will go down,” said TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education & Research.Officials said the mortality rate in Maharashtra is also seeing a gradual decline. However, the state’s mortality rate is still double that of the country’s. After touching the 7%-mark on April 12, the mortality rate is decreasing primarily owing to early admission of Covid-19 patients and also due to concentrated efforts to treat patients with underlying illnesses. The mortality rates on April 14, 15, 16 and 17 were 6.84%, 6.61%, 6.41% and 6.05%. Across these dates, 46 deaths have been reported. Lahane said, “The mortality rate is slowly decreasing because of early influx of patients. Earlier, most patients died between the first and third days of admission. Now, it happens six to seven days after admission in critical cases. When they are in hospital, we can monitor their lungs, blood-pressure, etc.”A health department official also attributed the reduction in deaths reported in the past few days to a more “focused” approach at treating patients with comorbidities. “The chief minister has formed a committee to come up with a protocol for Covid-19 patients. What we have done now is that we operate on the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research. More attention is being given to patients with underlying illnesses; with early admissions, it helps hospitals to treat them well so that they do not become critical cases,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, the state government on Saturday started 25 more dedicated hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. With this, the total number of dedicated hospitals for Covid-19 in Maharashtra goes up to 55 with total capacity of 6,660 beds, said Rajesh Tope, state health minister, on Saturday. Earlier, the state has 30 hospitals with a capacity of 2,305 beds. The state government has also got permission from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to start six new government laboratories for Covid-19 tests, state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said on Saturday. The total number of laboratories in the state now goes to 42, which includes government and private sector. The total capacity of the state for Covid-19 is now 7,600 tests per day. New testing facilities are going to come up at Kolhapur, Beed, Jalgaon, Baramati (Pune) Nanded and Gondia. The Maharashtra government on Saturday issued orders that state government employees would start working from Monday with 10% strength. The new order also made attendance of secretaries, joint or deputy secretaries mandatory. However, women officers can be exempted from it by the order of the department head. On March 23, the state government had issued orders that it would operate with only 5% of the government staff.As per the order, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses or municipal corporation’s buses including BEST, TMT, NMMT, will be used to ferry government employees from Monday. With the suburban railway network shut due to the lockdown, MSRTC, BEST buses will be operational between 7am and 11am and fro 4pm to 7 pm, the order state. Buses will pick up and drop employees from railway stations on western, central and harbour lines daily. Social distancing measures will be ensured and the frequency of the buses will be increased to ensure there is no crowding in the buses, officials said.The Maharashtra government also decided to provide financial assistance of ₹2,000 to all registered construction workers in the state to tide over the crisis during the lockdown to break the chain of coronavirus infections, officials said on Saturday.The order came days after hundreds of migrant workers, mostly from West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, gathered outside the Bandra railway station demanding that they be sent back to their homes. This one-time monetary help will be sent directly to the bank accounts of more than 12 lakh construction workers through direct benefit transfer (DBT), the officials said. The decision to give the assistance, taken by the state labour department on Saturday, will bring an additional burden of around Rs250 crore to the state exchequer.Only those workers who are registered with the state’s Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (BOCWWB) will be eligible to get the monetary assistance. Maharashtra has 22.70 lakh registered construction workers but only 12.18 lakh who are active, will get the benefit of the decision, said S C Srirangam, the board’s secretary and chief executive officer said. Meanwhile, the state on Friday decided to allow construction work in cities, including Mumbai and Pune, with a rider that prior permission from civic authorities will be mandatory. According to the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Friday, the state has given permission for all urgent pre-monsoon works. The Maharashtra government has started to allow the relaxation of rules in several areas of the state.With the alteration in the testing protocol adopted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation(BMC), former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray calling it an “unnatural” attempt to lower the number of Covid-19 cases. Fadnavis said that the state government should follow the ICMR guidelines in testing the immediate contacts of the person who tested positive for coronavirus. Lahane defended the testing protocol adopted by the BMC and said, “There is nothing wrong in it. They are testing but after five days. [It is seen] after five days you get the test positive. This negates the false-negative when tested immediately, which is dangerous; it is better to wait.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/328-new-cases-in-state-take-virus-count-to-3-648-toll-211/story-6kfXIMVk7EBXYmLTtmmmjN.html

KDMC said the work of repairing the bridge will take at least six months. “The entire work will depend on the blocks carried out by Central Railway and also removal of cables by the state electricity board,” added Koli. Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway, said, “The railways will hold blocks to complete the work.”Officials from the civic body said the bridge repair work will cost ₹10.5 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-no-trains-running-due-to-coronavirus-lockdown-kdmc-begins-dismantling-dombivli-rail-overbridge/story-UQ9QHxF847modPw2Tmow6N.html

The girl had fever since April 7 and was taken to Rukminibai Civic Hospital, said civic officials. The girl was later taken to Kalwa Hospital but her case was not considered, and then she was admitted at Shastri Nagar Civic Hospital in Dombivli. “We had sent her swab sample for testing as she had fever since earlier this month and she tested positive. She has been sent to Neon Covid hospital in Dombivli for further treatment. Her condition is stable,” said Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).Her parents, who are at risk of the infection, have been quarantined and will be tested.KDMC is yet to be sure about how the girl got infected as none of her family members was infected or had travel history.Last week a six-month-old boy, the youngest to have contracted the disease in Kalyan, was released after treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-year-old-from-dombivli-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-68p0ngRHm1ji0o0vucv2nO.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Testing target a bridge too far in Delhi hot spots||The Delhi government’s plan to carry out 20,000 swab tests in containment areas over five days between Tuesday and Saturday ended with roughly 4,000 tests after the hard lockdown in these areas turned out to be a hurdle for sample collection efforts. In an order last week, seen by HT, the government identified the need to ramp up testing and said 20,000 samples would be collected from containment areas and quarantine zones over a span of five days beginning Tuesday. On Saturday, the fifth day, this number was at 4,030. “So far, samples were being collected only in our hospitals, and we cannot ask people living in containment zones to come to the hospitals. We have to go there and set up a temporary tent or room or something where we can ask people from the area to come and give their samples. With RT-PCR tests, sample collection is more difficult because when the swab is put at the back of the throat, aerosol that might contain the virus is generated,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, asking not to be named.The need to ramp up testing comes at a time when new clusters are forming in the city. On Saturday, the city reported 186 new cases from among 736 samples that were processed in 24 hours. This means one in four people who were tested had the infection, underscoring the need to widen the net in order to detect the other cases that there may be.To improve the testing rate, the Delhi government has decided to incentivise collection of samples and set up 21 collection centres in hotels, dharmashalas and hospitals that were not initially designated as collection centres. Additionally, all Delhi government hospitals will start collecting samples in tents outside main buildings.“Teams from the dispensaries are being mobilised to collect the samples in the containment areas. They will go to the centres being set up in the community and ask people to come there,” said another official from Delhi’s health department. Teams that will collect samples in the community will be paid Rs 100 per sample, with those actually taking the swabs getting a bigger share of the incentive. “The incentive per team would be worked out in such a way that the person exposed to maximum danger or higher risk will be given the greater share (2 shares) of the incentive. For example, if there are 8 members in a team with two persons taking the samples then the total amount (number of samples x 100) would be divided by 10 to ensure that the two sample collectors will be given two shares of the incentive,” according to an officer order by Delhi’s health department.The government has also roped in private laboratories to process the samples as it is likely to exceed the capacity of the six government-run labs. Private laboratories will be paid Rs 4,500 if they collect a sample and use their own testing kit; R 3,500 if the sample is collected by the government and the kit is of the lab; and R 2,200 if the sample is collected by the government and the kit is also provided by it.“Yes, we have started sending samples to the private laboratories. This is done only after our own capacity is exhausted,” said a third official from Delhi government health department.Yet, this might not be enough. On Friday, 2,674 samples – more than the total number of samples collected– remaining pending at both government and private labs. In addition to the swab tests, the government will deploy 42,000 rapid testing kits it received on Saturday to check for signs of infection through a blood sample.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-testing-target-a-bridge-too-far-in-delhi-hot-spots/story-l1OABQoZZ3sOypXxWppG5O.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid-19 count rises by 184||On Saturday, the city recorded 184 new Covid-19 positive coronavirus disease (Covid-19)cases and five deaths due to the infection. This has taken the total number of cases in Mumbai to 2,268, and total deaths to 126, according to the state health department. According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC), as of Friday, 54% of cases in the city — 1,158 of 2,120 Covid-19 positive cases — have been discovered due to contact tracing measures, screening in containment zones, and through fever clinics. Until Thursday, 115 such fever clinics were conducted at which 4,453 persons were screened and 1,761 were tested.Contrary to the state health department’s figures, as per data from the BMC, Mumbai recorded 87 new cases on Saturday, with the city’s total count rising to 2,509. A press note issued by civic body has attributed the total figure to 302 patients who tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, at three private laboratories in the city between April 12 and 15. The BMC stated that 42 patients have recovered from Covid-19 and were discharged on Saturday, taking the total number of patients who recovered to 281.Dharavi, the slum pocket in the island city, saw a spike in infections on Saturday with 17 new cases and one death. The 80-year-old woman from Dharavi had died on Friday at Sion Hospital but it was only confirmed on Saturday that she was Covid-19 positive. Two Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel posted in Western Railway (WR) tested positive on Saturday evening. One of the RPF personnel was deputed at Mumbai Central railway station and helped distribute food and meals to people outside the station. The second RPF personnel was posted at the WR’s Jagjivan Ram Hospital, which has been declared a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre. As of Friday, the civic body has spent a total of ₹80 crore from its contingency fund on Covid-19 related preparedness such as purchase of ventilators, personal protective equipment, medicines, and distribution of food packets. P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the finance department, said, “This amount is as per receipts submitted to BMC as of Friday. More purchases are in the pipeline and receipts will be submitted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-19-count-rises-by-184/story-MhfO8vetSUuCVqJCBIB0aP.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||Ward officer quarantined after driver tests positive||A municipal ward officer from the western suburbs has been home-quarantined after his driver tested positive for Covid-19 during a random testing session. The asymptomatic driver’s test report came on Thursday. “As per the new rule of the civic body, all frontliners need to get tested to avoid any chance of infection. So, we tested over 40 people from the ward who are working closely on the ground in battling the pandemic. All came negative except the asymptomatic driver,” said a health official from the ward.The driver, employed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has been admitted to the isolation ward at Kasturba Hospital. Four of the driver’s family members along with the ward officer have been quarantined at their homes for 14 days. Talking to HT, the officer confirmed the development and said, “I am fine, I don’t have any symptoms yet.”The civic body is currently trying to trace the source of infection. “The driver is a resident of Kalyan with no travel history and doesn’t know anyone infected with the virus. So, his source of infection is unknown,” said the health official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ward-officer-quarantined-after-driver-tests-positive/story-yyeq25puFQ5pUyjXUmLmBO.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||17 new Covid-19 cases in Dharavi; 194 recorded in E ward so far||Apart from G South ward (Worli, Prabhadevi), the worst-affected area in Mumbai, a spike of Covid-19 cases has been reported in two other wards, E (Mazagaon, Agripada, Byculla, Mumbai Central) and G North (Dharavi, Dadar). According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), E ward is the second worst affected, with 194 cases, while G South ward has the highest number of cases (389) as of April 17. G North ward has 142 cases in total. With 17 new cases on Saturday, the overall count for Dharavi alone rose to 118. As of Saturday, 11 deaths have been reported in the area. Local representatives said that the situation is equally bad in E ward. The assistant municipal commissioner of E ward was recently transferred after a sudden spike in the number of cases. Civic officials confirmed that the ward officer was transferred as there was a lapse in controlling the outbreak and containing the areas. Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party MLA and local corporator of Byculla, said, “The administrative ward has completely failed in containing the virus. There are three medical health officers in the ward, unlike just one officer in other wards. Still, the numbers are not coming down. There is no proper division of work in the ward.”According to BMC’s most recent data, 120 cases were reported in the ward on April 12 and within five days, the count rose to 194. D ward (Malabar Hill, Grant Road, Chowpatty) has also reported a large number of cases, with at least 141 locals confirmed as Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/17-new-covid-19-cases-in-dharavi-194-recorded-in-e-ward-so-far/story-uwwbsGXL7p2HoShRReMkuM.html

19-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi gets first batch of 42,000 kits, to start rapid testing for Covid-19 from today||Delhi has received 42,000 Rapid Testing Kits (RTK) from the Central government and from Sunday these will be used to conduct random tests in the 76 containment zones of the city. This is the first batch of Rapid Testing Kits that will be used in the national capital. Till now the government and private labs were conducting only Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)-based molecular tests. Conducting rapid antibody tests across the city is likely to significantly improve Delhi’s record on testing Covid-19. Unlike the RT-PCR test that detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in throat swabs to diagnose a Covid-19 infection, rapid tests detect antibodies in the blood and indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus. It can show results within 30 minutes, the Delhi government said. Till Saturday, a total of 22,283 RT-PCR tests were conducted in the city. “We have received 42,000 rapid testing kits from the Centre. Today (Saturday), all our technicians are being trained on how to use these kits, the precautions to be taken and other nuances. From tomorrow (Sunday), rapid testing will begin in the containment zones,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain told reporters on Saturday. When asked which zones will be the first ones, Jain said that the rapid tests will be conducted in all the containment areas simultaneously. Till 8pm on Saturday, five district magistrates told HT that they had received a communication from the health department that RTKs will be provided to them. “But we have not been told how many kits we will get. No package has arrived so far,” said a district magistrate, on condition of anonymity.A senior official in the health department said the number of kits allotted to every containment zone will be directly proportional to the Covid-19 cases detected in the area — higher the cases, higher the allotment.Out of the 11 districts in Delhi, the south-east district has the highest number of containment zones at 17. The south-east district includes the Nizamuddin Markaz and surrounding areas and parts of East of Kailash, Shaheen Bagh, Tughlakabad, New Friends Colony, and so on. On Saturday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also issued a new rapid testing protocol under which states are allowed to use rapid testing kits wherever they want, including in Covid-19 containment zones and hot spots.According to the new ICMR protocol, only those showing symptoms of influenza-like illness — such as fever, cough and cold — for seven or more days in hotspots should be made to undergo a rapid test. Those who are found positive in the rapid test must be quarantined for at least the next seven days. Those who test negative should also remain under home quarantine for at least seven days as they are in a hotspot.Delhi, meanwhile, has also placed an order for an additional 50,000 RTKs through ICMR-approved vendors, but those are yet to arrive. these kits, too, are being imported from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-gets-first-batch-of-42-000-kits-to-start-rapid-testing-from-sunday/story-3motC4Agv5QgvufFJj3FaL.html
19-04-2020||City||Saad can join probe on 3-day notice: Kin of Tablighi Jamaat chief||Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad could join the investigation into defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings, on a three-day notice, said a close relative of the religious leader on Saturday. Maulana Badrul Hasan, a resident of Kandhla and a relative of Saad, also said that he was in regular contact with Saad’s family. Saad belongs to Kandhala town in Shamli district and many of his relatives live there. “He was in self quarantine and thus could not appear before the crime branch. But now he is ready to answer questions in person. But the agency should give him three days notice,” said Maulana Hasan. According to him, Saad did not have a phone but was in regular contact with his family members.On Thursday, Saad had written to the Delhi Police seeking a copy of the first information report (FIR) against him and seven others. Police had filed a criminal case against Saad and six other top officials of the Jamaat on March 31 for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings, issued to contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in the Capital.In the letter, Saad had asked the police if they have added any new Indian Penal Code sections to the FIR.Delhi Police officers, requesting anonymity, had on Wednesday confirmed that they had added Section 304 in the FIR against Saad. Section 304 of the IPC, related to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, is a stringent section, unlike the other sections of Epidemic Diseases Act which had been levied in the FIR initially. A person convicted under Section 304 of the IPC could be sentenced to a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment.Saad’s lawyer Shahid Ali had also confirmed that they wrote to the police on Thursday. “We have given a letter to the Delhi Police stating that we have replied twice to the notices issued to us. We also asked them about media reports related to a particular section that has reportedly been added to the FIR. We also sought the copy of the FIR. We have reiterated that we are always available for cooperation in the investigation. We have not received any notices or summons to join the investigation except for some information they asked of us in their two letters.”Badrul Hasan claimed that Saad was in Delhi and the crime branch officials are in contact with him through his lawyers. “Maulana is cooperating with them in every possible way,” Hasan claimed. Regarding cases registered against four distant relatives of Maulana Saad in Saharanpur, he admitted that they are relatives but were not on good terms with Saad. Two of these four relatives have been charged with concealing information about visiting Markaz in Nizamuddin; two of them had tested positive for Covid-19. They are undergoing treatment while two other relatives and eight other family members of the Jamaat chief have been placed under quarantine. Last month, police officers and state government officials had evacuated more than 2,300 persons from inside the Markaz building in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, where they had gathered for a religious congregation of indeterminate length. The meetings continued despite orders by the Delhi government banning all religious events (March 13), restricting gatherings to 200 people (March 16), and then putting a four-person limit (March 21) on all gatherings. The Nizamuddin area was also declared a containment zone after the evacuation. At least 21 evacuated persons had then tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2.Earlier this month, police had sent two questionnaires to Saad, containing 29 questions related to the Tablighi Jamaat and the gatherings between March 10 and 15. In the first notice, which had 26 questions, sent on April 1, the investigating officer had sought details of CCTV cameras inside the building and had asked Saad to preserve the footage. The police had asked for details of all the people, including foreigners, present in the building last month. There was also a question on the steps taken by the management to disperse the gathering after the government had issued the prohibitory orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/saad-can-join-the-probe-on-a-three-day-notice-says-close-relative-of-tablighi-jamaat-chief/story-foXxqoeOHAH7IawxokR0xL.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||All Delhi hospitals will start OPDs and surgeries on Monday, with social restriction||All Delhi government hospitals will start their routine services — outpatient clinics and non-emergency surgeries — from Monday onwards, officials of the state health department said. Only two of the dedicated hospitals — Lok Nayak and Rajeev Gandhi Super-Specialty — will be exempt and will continue to cater exclusively to Covid-19 patients, according to sources. With 477 positive patients being treated at the hospital, Lok Nayak is the busiest Covid-19 facility. These hospitals have stopped all other facilities — including emergency services — other than the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Delhi had till Saturday witnessed 1,893 Covid-19 positive cases with 43 deaths.All Delhi government hospitals had curtailed their out-patient clinics to ensure social distancing and postponed routine surgeries to ensure the availability of beds and manpower to treat Covid-19 patients in March end. Together the 37 Delhi government hospitals, including AYUSH hospitals, treat over 60,000 patients daily at its clinics. The hospitals together perform over 2,000 surgeries in a day. “It is important to take care of those with Covid-19. But, it should not come at the cost of other patients. We cannot keep them waiting forever for the care that they need. So, the services at hospitals, other than the Covid-19 ones, will resume. It will be business as usual for them,” said an official from Delhi government’s health department. Another official from the health department, present at the meeting where the decision was taken, confirmed the same.The health ministry on March 20 had advised all hospitals – both government and private – to postpone their non-emergency planned surgeries and to maintain social distancing norms in their out-patient clinics. The guidelines had also said that patients with flu-like symptoms should be treated in a separate section.A set of guidelines released by the Union home ministry on April 15 states that all hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics, even those providing AYUSH services, will keep running during the extended lockdown period.Although, emergency services were allowed, the inability to reach hospitals and clinics and hospitals remaining shut had made it difficult for patients to access proper care during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences – which is also treating Covid-19 patients – however, will be unable to reopen its out-patient clinics for the time being, although the block is completely removed from Covid-19 areas, officials said.Covid-19 suspected patients are admitted to the new private ward block in AIIMS. Confirmed Covid-19 cases with mild symptoms are moved to AIIMS Jhajjar campus, and those with severe symptoms are moved to AIIMS trauma centre, across the road from the main campus. “What would be the use of opening up OPDs if we are not able to provide any other services. And, we cannot start surgeries at the moment because we have moved patients from the AIIMS trauma centre, which has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility. We do not really have space to do much else,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital.However, the hospital has decided to start tele-consultation services for all its follow-up patients. Patient in need of follow-up appointments can get it on the website http://ors.gov.in/followup/. Once a patient registers him/herself, the doctors will call them and provide requisite medical advice on the given date, according to the hospital. Private clinics and hospitals in the city will also start scaling-up their services Monday onwards. “There was an advisory to stop routine procedures, but now private hospitals will slowly start opening up these services from Monday onwards. We have advised all our hospitals to ensure social distancing in the clinics and conduct only 2-3 surgeries a day,” said Dr PK Bhardwaj, secretary, Delhi Voluntary Hospitals’ Forum. The Delhi Medical Association is also in the process of drafting guidelines for hospitals and clinics to restart their services while ensuring safety. “We have to ensure that the doctors and healthcare workers are safe after they open up the services. Also the government needs to support the centres that had to be closed down after accidental exposure,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, president elect, Delhi Medical Association. Cancer institute to repoenThe Delhi State Cancer Institute, which had closed its services, after 25 of its healthcare workers had tested positive for Covid-19, will also start its out-patient clinic in a phased manner Monday onwards.The entire hospital has been sanitised thrice and samples have been collected from various places in the hospital to test for presence of the virus.“Initially we will allow only 10 or 20 people inside the OPD at a time, after being screened at a flu corner outside. Later on we will start are chemotherapy services,” said Dr BL Sherwal, director, Delhi State Cancer Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/all-delhi-hospitals-will-start-opds-and-surgeries-on-monday-with-social-restriction/story-7aXGzZKb3QPx5NfjK7a7EP.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||On-the-spot fine of Rs 1,000 for spitting in public in Delhi||Spitting and urinating in public in Delhi will now attract an on-the-spot fine of Rs 1,000, double the Rs 500 levied before—the south, north and east Delhi municipal corporations, and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), said in an order issued on Saturday.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued fresh directives for Covid-19 management, asking municipal bodies to make spitting “punishable with a fine under Section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act” on April 15, four days after it asked all states to prohibit the use and spitting of smokeless tobacco in public places to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.“This directive will remain in force till it is expressly withdrawn,” the notices brought out by the four Delhi municipal agencies said on Saturday.Dr. Lallan Verma, senior public health expert with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said, “Urinating in the open is a nuisance whereas public spitting is no less than a big health hazard for all. Even before Coronavirus arrived, open spitting is known to spread various diseases through droplets like tuberculosis, mumps, measles and meningitis,” he added. Till now, under Section 357 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act, sanitary inspectors were empowered to catch anyone spitting in the open and issue on-the-spot fines in the range of Rs 100-Rs 500. “We would generally see the profile of the offender. For example, if it’s someone spitting out of the window of his car, he would fined Rs 500,” said KC Bhardwaj, a sanitary superintendent with SDMC. “But now, it’s Rs 1,000 for all. In case the violator does not have money to pay the fine, the person’s address from an ID card such as a driving licence or Aadhaar card will be taken. Otherwise, his or her photograph will clicked mobile along with details disclosed by her/him. If the violator does not agree, the challan will be sent to the magistrate to recover from her or him,” said SDMC spokesperson, Radha Krishan.Civic body officials said that though spitting in public is the most common offence, but it is also the one that is the most difficult to prosecute.A senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation officer, who requested anonymity, said, “Catching people who spit in public places is particularly difficult. They spit on even flowerpots installed on roadsides and dividers, and feign innocence. They start asking for proof when we threaten to challan them. So we are forced to take an educational stance, telling them about the law and the fine. More recently, we have deputed bike-borne teams in markets to catch such people.”Officials said that with a large section of the population addicted to gutkha, spitting is common across the city. The New Delhi Municipal Council had once proposed to put a ban on sale of paan (betel leaf) and gutkha/supari at Delhi Connaught Place, a heritage shopping arcade, after the freshly painted white walls were stained red by those who spat after eating paan and gutkha. The white columns of the market are painted regularly but despite civic agencies placing boards requesting people not to spit, the columns have red stain marks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/on-the-spot-fine-of-1-000-for-spitting-in-public/story-B3K3AiPjFCYcvoxK2ReNzO.html
19-04-2020||Mumbai||Recovered GRP cop gets hero’s welcome||After almost 16 days in hospital, a 51-year-old officer of the Government Railway Police (GRP) received a hero’s welcome when he returned to his home in Kalyan on Thursday evening. Approximately 500 people greeted Vijay Kumar Shelar, many singing the national anthem in his honour. “It was emotional for my father. He couldn’t hold back his tears,” said his 26-year-old son, Rohan. For the family, to have the 51-year-old back is a great relief. Diagnosed late, the railway officer had spent 10 days on a ventilator. “My mother was most scared and kept crying. She wouldn’t eat and waited for my father’s health updates from the hospital,” said Rohan.Employed with the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) GRP, the officer developed symptoms of Covid-19 — fever, cold and cough — towards the end of March and was prescribed medicines for seasonal influenza by a general physician. Around the time his symptoms developed, Shelar had been assigned the responsibility of taking undertrial prisoners to and from Taloja Central Jail. He had no history of foreign travel or contact with any Covid-positive patient. When his condition deteriorated, he was taken to Kasturba Hospital where a test confirmed he was positive for Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19. On April 1, the officer was shifted to Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital-managed treatment centre at SevenHills, in Marol, when his lungs started failing. He remained on a ventilator till April 10. “He doesn’t remember anything about those 10 days when he was on a ventilator. We would [later] ask what happened in those days and he would make up stories,” said Rohan.After testing negative for Sars-Cov-2 twice, the railway officer was discharged on Thursday. His family said he is still very weak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/recovered-grp-cop-gets-hero-s-welcome/story-m4OFNNkQb9DD3EzZQsDG7H.html

19-04-2020||Delhi||26 of Jahangirpuri family test Covid-19 positive, none had symptoms||Twenty-six members of an extended family in Jahangirpuri’s C block, which has been declared a containment zone, have tested positive for Covid-19. The 26 people are all related to an 80-year-old woman in the area who died of the disease, after which the area was declared a containment zone.None of the 26 showed any symptoms of Covid-19 but have all tested positive, government officers said.Meanwhile, the Delhi government declared eight more areas as containment zones, taking the total to 77. According to senior district officials, all 26, including a senior couple and two children, have been kept under observation, and all of them lived in the same block as the 80-year-old woman.“We had declared the area a containment zone after the woman’s death as we are still trying to trace where she contracted the infection. We had put all her family members under observation, but they weren’t showing any flu-like symptoms,” a senior district administration official said. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday expressed his worry at people roaming the streets and by-lanes, despite authorities sealing the area. “I am worried because people within some containment zones are not properly following the social distance guidelines. In Jahangirpuri within a containment zone, 26 people related to one family have found to be positive. This means that they have not followed the orders of social distancing and visited each other’s houses. My appeal to all that you should not be in this illusion that you will not be affected by Covid-19 because the source of the virus is difficult to find out. This virus is above any religion, caste, gender and it can happen to anyone and everybody has the same kind of vulnerability towards Coronavirus infection,” Kejriwal said. “We are trying to trace their contact history. Some of the extended family members had attended the old woman’s funeral,” an official said. The district authorities said \they have collected samples of 64 people in C block, of which 33 have tested negative and 26 family members of the elderly woman’s extended family tested positive. Of the five containment zones in north Delhi, four are in Jahangirpuri. The district has reported 46 cases so far, including the 26 reported on Saturday. The Delhi government declared eight new containment zones on Saturday taking the total number of containment zones to 77. In new zones are located in A block Khizrabad in south-east Delhi’s New Friends Colony, Israel Camp in Rangpuri Pahari and Budh Nagar, Inderpuri in New Delhi district, another house in Mansarovar Garden and Nihal Vihar in west Delhi, two areas in Shastri Park and one lane in Gautampuri in northeast Delhi. A senior police official said that the area in Khizrabad has been declared a containment zone after two cases of Covid-19 were confirmed two days back. As per the containment order for Israel camp in New Delhi, two people, who had travelled to Delhi on April 3 from Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, tested positive The entire camp, of 6,000 people has been declared a containment zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/26-of-jahangirpuri-family-test-covid-19-positive-none-had-symptoms/story-bGh83Fv0EJkvBzPQ2fGLGK.html

19-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi 5-star hotel tells hospital staff in quarantine to vacate rooms||At least 15 nurses and lab technicians who were in quarantine after treating Covid-19 patients for two weeks, were asked late on Friday night to vacate their rooms in a five-star hotel where they were put up, because the facility was “only for doctors”, according to several people who were part of this medical team.Two registered unions for health care workers — one representing nurses at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and the Indian Medical Laboratory Technologist Federation (IMLTF) — have written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendar Jain that these nurses and paramedics were made to check out of the Leela Ambience Convention Hotel in East Delhi at around 11.30pm, not provided transportation, and not told where to go for more than two hours by hotel authorities.In letters sent on Saturday, the unions have asked the government to intervene and called for strict action against those responsible for risking lives by forcing quarantined medical professionals to move out.A team of 45 doctors, nurses and paramedic staff from various hospitals — including Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital, Dr Baba Sahib Ambedkar Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital — were staying at the hotel since they started their 14-day duty period on April 1. This was to be followed by a 14-day quarantine at the hotel starting on April 15, as per a government order issued late last month.“Members of our nursing staff were asked to vacate their rooms in the middle of the night (April 17), despite the Delhi government having clearly mentioned in their order that accommodation will be provided for all 28 days of duty and quarantine. We have written to the hospital administration and to the government to intervene and provide clarity,” the nurses’ union of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital said in a statement on Saturday.At least three of the nurses and paramedics who were a part of the team alleged that hotel authorities told them that the facility was “only for doctors”, and could not be extended to them. They blamed a lack of coordination between the Delhi government and the hospital administration for the situation.When contacted, state health minister Jain did not give a specific response to the incident at the Leela. But a senior health department official who asked not to be named said, said they will “look into the incident and discuss the matter with the hospitals”. The Leela Ambience Convention Hotel declined to comment on the incident.A Delhi government order dated March 29 said doctors, nurses and paramedics would work continuously for 14 days, and then go on a 14-day quarantine break. The order stated that doctors, nurses and paramedical staff would be provided accommodation for the entire period of 28 days.“Till the time we were on duty, we were staying at the Leela Ambience Convention Hotel. But as soon as we started our 14-day quarantine, the hotel staff started asking us to check out. All of us have submitted our samples for testing, and the results are not out yet. We do not know how many of us have contracted the infection. Is it safe for us to be walking around the streets?” asked Vivek Singh, a member of the Indian Medical Laboratory Technologist Federation (IMLTF), who was staying at the hotel.Singh said that they first got a warning from the administration of hotel on April 16, and were asked to shift to a guest house near Ghaziabad. “The confusion was temporarily resolved, but later the hotel staff again gave us a deadline to vacate our rooms. Our hospitals are also not giving us any clarity,” he said.Nurses from GTB hospital also said that the team were checked out of their rooms on Friday at around 11.30, with no information of an alternative arrangement till 1.30am. They said that they were not even provided transportation to go to a new facility — a guest house in Mayur Vihar.“We finally moved to the guest house at about 2am. When we got there, the building was locked, but we managed to make a few phone calls and get them to open the rooms. The rooms are dirty, there are dogs roaming the hallways, and we got only a slice of bread and some ketchup for breakfast,” said one of the nurses, who asked not to be named.Another nurse, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they are supposed to stay in their rooms through the quarantine period and have no contact with others. However, because of the confusion over accommodation, several of her colleagues have decided to go back to their homes.“We do not want a five-star hotel, we just want to complete our quarantine without infecting anyone,” the nurse said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-5-star-hotel-tells-hospital-staff-in-quarantine-to-vacate-rooms/story-7Iya4Pk0raDM59o6iuEEyJ.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||Asha workers on Covid-19 duty demand timely, better wages||Deployed as frontline workers in the fight against Covid-19 in the national capital, Asha workers are demanding timely and better wages. Of the 5,900 Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) in Delhi, a large number of them are currently conducting door-to-door surveys for Covid-19, especially in the containment zones.The Delhi Asha Workers’ Association claim they were not paid salary for the month of March and that the incentive assured by the government is less than the assistance given to construction workers and auto drivers to compensate for loss of work due to the lockdown. The association wants the Delhi government to pay workers minimum wages or at least ₹10,000 per month till the time they are on Covid-19 duty.Asha workers are community health workers working with the state health missions, constituted under the Union health ministry programmes. They work on the basis of incentives — i.e. for every health activity such as immunisation, hospital delivery, routine checks of people, these workers are given incentives, not fixed salary. The workers are mostly women and attached to local government-run dispensaries. Each worker caters to 400 households, mostly near her residence. According to the association, an Asha worker earns between ₹7,000-₹9,000 per month.According to an order issued on April 13 by the Delhi State Health Mission’s state nodal officer for Asha (a copy of which HT has seen), they will get ₹3,000 as core incentive and along with ₹1,000 for Covid-19 duty as announced by the Centre from April to June.Usha Thakur, general secretary Delhi Asha Workers Association, said “Most of us are doing regular duty in high risk areas. And the ₹4,000 payout is less than the ₹5,000 the government is paying construction workers and auto drivers for loss of work.” The association had written to Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain earlier this month and are planning to write to him again demanding enhanced compensation for those on Covid-19 duty.“Our salary is based on the work done through the month. We submit our reports on the 25th of every month. Last month, due to the lockdown, our work couldn’t be registered in government records. We are yet to get our salaries. A lot of us are sole bread earners,” said Thakur.Despite attempts, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain couldn’t be reached for comment.The association is demanding they be given ₹10,000 for March.“It has become difficult for Asha workers to run their households due to the lockdown. We have requested the Delhi government to pay ₹5,000 in addition to the core incentive (₹3,000) to all Asha workers. And those who are on Covid-19 duty should be paid ₹750 per day,” said Kavita Yadav, state coordinator for Asha workers, All India United Traders Union Centre. “Most of the Asha workers are working on Covid-19 duty. They should be paid more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/asha-workers-on-covid-19-duty-demand-timely-better-wages/story-x3g8ewZPlDzFe89ceNhu8J.html

Weather agencies stated that the speed of the dust storm was up to 60 kmph or more, followed by rain and hail in some parts.While most areas across Delhi-NCR experienced strong winds and dust storms, the intensity was particularly high in Noida and Ghaziabad areas because of the induced effect of river Yamuna and higher temperature.According to weather analysts, phenomena such as rains are likely to continue till Sunday, while another Western Disturbance (WD) on Monday may recreate conditions seen on Saturday evening.“The rain and heavy storm was subjected to a few parts only in NCR only, like Noida. This is expected to continue as there are three more WDs likely to hit the region before April ends,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the recurring WD – a phenomenon that causes rains and storms in the national Capital region, is likely to affect the region with “proper pre-monsoon activities” on April 23 and 27 as well.He added that heavy winds are likely to strike the region Sunday evening as an effect of the current WD that would bring a very slight respite in maximum and minimum temperatures, dropping them by a degree or two.“There are more western disturbances, which may cause dust storms, rains and hails in Noida and adjoining regions on April 23 and 27 as well. The effect on the temperature will not be long lasting, however maximum temperatures may drop below season’s average, which is around 37 to 38 these days for next few days,” said Palawat.According to the IMD, the effects of dust storms are likely to be intense over Noida as compared to Delhi.“Most of the stations in Delhi realised that the effect was comparatively low in parts of Delhi but not in Noida and Ghaziabad. It’s because the weather system moved from Central Delhi towards East, upon crossing Yamuna river it intensified because the weather system got moisture from the river and got charged up, the additional afternoon temperatures added to the intensity,” said Kuldeep Srivastva, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.Stating that while it’s quite difficult to assess the exact time of such storms, the most plausible time of such activity is often after 3pm, when the temperatures have already reached their day time peak.“There is a possibility of soothing weather towards Sunday evening. Between April 20-21, there is a possibility of another light thunderstorm. However, if the temperature rises, Noida and neighbouring regions may see strong dust storms followed by rain or hail,” Srivastava added. Saturday’s maximum temperature was 37 degrees Celsius, which is expected to remain the same for Sunday as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/dust-storm-rain-lash-noida-brings-down-temperature/story-AFwyDVUus9g4e9ohYEOnYM.html
19-04-2020||Noida||Migrants in slums travel miles to fetch water, regret not leaving for home||For nine-year-old Sunil and his younger sister, two of the many slum dwellers in the city, the day begins with a bicycle ride to find water and fetch as much as they can carry. Entirely dependent on the mercy of the security guards of factories, who may or may not give them some from the bore wells on the premises, the siblings know that they can’t give up despite being turned away repeatedly. Meanwhile, their parents, migrant labourers from Mahoba district, also go scouting for water like thousands of others and try to cover as much area as they can. “We try to avoid the crowds as the entire basti goes to fetch water and the security guards refuse to give us any if we’re part of a large crowd. There is a pumping station near Sector 66, about 2km from our basti, and some temples in Sector 62 and Mamura where we can get water from. We manage to carry two buckets on our cycle,” Sunil, who lives in a slum in Sector 67, says. He adds that the farthest he and his sister Guddi have travelled to fetch water is Garhi Chaukhandi — a distance of eight kilometres (back and forth).“The best time to fetch water is when people in factories are bathing or watering plants because the motors are already switched on,” says seven-year-old Guddi, who understands that going back without water is not an option.As many pumping stations and factories have closed because of the lockdown, locating new sources of water and persuading the guards or workers to give them some have become daily chores.With the soaring heat, the demand for water has increased and because of zero supply in the illegal slums in Noida’s industrial sectors, water has become a rare commodity for stranded labours, who now regret that they did not leave for their villages when they had a chance.“The biggest issue is water scarcity. We get food twice a day, sometimes once a day. Even if we don’t, we can still manage without food, but not water. A truck supplies 20-litre water bottles which cost us ₹25 each; but with the days becoming warmer, even two bottles a day are not enough and that costs us a lot. So we have to fetch water from wherever we can. If the water seems dirty, we boil it,” says Kumari Saraswati, another migrant from a slum in Sector 68, who hails from the town of Tilaiya Parma in Koderma, Jharkhand.“We called the helpline, but they said that they could only provide us food and gave us another number to call,” she adds.With work stalled because of the lockdown, managing enough water for drinking, cooking and cleaning has become a privilege for these migrants.“We have lived here for over five years and never seen such water scarcity. We are daily wage labourers and cannot afford to spend ₹50 or ₹70 per day on drinking water. We have no way to earn, and even if we buy drinking water, we still have to go several kilometres to fetch water for cleaning and bathing,” says Vineeta Yadav, a stranded labourer who belongs to Mahoba district.Thousands of families who didn’t leave, expecting that the lockdown would end soon, now regret their decision.“We should have left when there was time. At least back in the village, there is no water crisis and we could’ve managed food too. No one from the government has ever come to take heed of our circumstances. The only government official we can complain to is the police and everyone fears them. The basti is dirty, but we have to live here, anyway. If our children don’t bathe every day or drink dirty water, they fall sick. It looks like if this virus doesn’t kill us, the water scarcity will,” says Parvati Devi, a migrant worker from Khagaria district, who lives in a Sector 66 slum along with her husband and three children.According to officials, since the slums are illegally constructed, they cannot provide proper water connection; however, they say they could manage to supply water in tankers in such a crisis.“The authority has enough water, but we cannot provide proper connections in such slums or illegal constructions. However, in such a crisis, the best we can do is send a few tankers to those slums if we get complaints,” BM Pokhariyal, deputy general manager, Noida authority, says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/migrants-in-slums-travel-miles-to-fetch-water-regret-not-leaving-for-home/story-87SLsqwQTNgqg4AUurWGVO.html

Notably, the district had not reported any new Covid-19 case since April 9 when 12 persons were found positive for coronavirus. All the four men from Sohna, who are in the age group of 20-25 years, had come in contact with a Covid-19 patient from Alwar in Rajasthan, the officials said.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “The four men used to work, along with a 22-year-old man from Alwar, at a factory in Mewat. They all stayed together in Sohna. The 22-year-old, who had visited Alwar too, was confirmed Covid-19 positive earlier this week, and is admitted to a Rajasthan hospital.”“On Thursday, we took samples of 70 people in Sohna who used to work with the Alwar man, of which four were confirmed positive,” Punia said, adding that it is difficult to comment on how the Alwar-based Covid-19 patient contracted the virus. “Due to his movement in three cities, it is difficult to say how he contracted the virus. In all likelihood, he did not get infected in Sohna,” the CMO said.The officials said that all four Covid-19 patients have been admitted to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10. In Haryana, Gurugram is a declared ‘red zone’ for having a large number of Covid-19 positive cases, along with Nuh (57 cases), Palwal (34), and Faridabad (33). Of the 36 cases in Gurugram, 19 are undergoing treatment. Of the 36 positive cases, two patients are from Agra, two from Sector 54, five from Pataudi, 10 from Sohna, and the remaining are Tablighi Jamaat attendees. According to the officials, more than 2,000 people are still continuing with their 14-day quarantine period while 55 others are under surveillance at a quarantine facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-reports-four-new-covid-19-cases-after-a-gap-of-9-days-total-touches-36/story-LWjJARBwQRCWHlLyhxv4cM.html

However, the offices of the three authorities will remain shut for visitors untill the nationwide lockdown is lifted, officials said.The decision to resume departmental work at the authorities comes after the Uttar Pradesh government issued a letter asking each department that includes group housing, engineering, health among other wings to start work from April 20 with a 33% workforce.The state government had ordered the closure of all its government offices on March 22 (on the occasion of Janta Curfew), two days before the nationwide lockdown was announced in order to contain the spread of Covid-19.

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||Frontline Covid warriors: At risk of contracting virus, ambulance drivers feel duty-bound to ferry patients||Ambulance drivers ferrying patients from their homes to hospitals and vice versa are among the frontline soldiers in the battle against Covid-19 who are at a high risk of contracting the disease. But for many in Punjab’s coronavirus hotspots that’s hardly a deterrent as they are leaving no stone unturned in performing their duty round the clock. Bhupinder Singh (55) and Udham Singh, both Punjab Roadways drivers, were directed to report to the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar civil surgeon’s office on March 20 and were deployed on ambulance service in Punjab’s first virus containment zone of 15 villages, including Pathlawa. It was Pathlawa resident Baldev Singh (70), a preacher, who became Punjab’s first coronavirus casualty and had infected at least 27 persons, including 14 of his family Bhupinder says though it was really risky amid a sense of fear, especially in the initial days, he didn’t give up as someone needed to take charge of the situation to win the war against the pandemic. “It was heart-wrenching to see Covid-19 positive patients crying in the ambulance. But I chose to perform my duty by taking proper precautions. We regularly sanitised the ambulance after dropping the patients and wore personal protection equipment (PPE) kits. But still, the risk of infection remained there,” adds Bhupinder, who joined the roadways in 1997. “I do not enter my house without taking a bath and put my clothes in hot water. It is a matter of great satisfaction that there is no case in SBS Nagar district for many days (since March 26),” he says.Udham, who was tasked with transporting patients from Sujjon and Jhikka villages in the containment zone, says, “It was a challenge. I would sanitise myself and my helper. My children motivated me to perform my duty in the fight against Covid-19.”In Jalandhar district, where the second highest number of positive cases (38 till Friday) has been reported in Punjab, more than 30 ambulance drivers, including retired army personnel, performed their duty with zeal in the fight against the disease.Jasbir Singh, an ambulance driver at the civil hospital, says, “Our men are performing their duty like soldiers to secure people and contribute to the fight.” Sukhwinder Singh and Kamaljit Singh started working as ambulance drivers after they retired from the army. Kamaljit, who joined the health department in 2013, says they have to be strong amid the pandemic as they have a great responsibility on their shoulders. Jeevan Ram, a temporary driver with the Punjab roadways, is stationed along with six other transport department drivers in the civil hospital, says he is proud for having contributed to the cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/frontline-covid-warriors-at-risk-of-contracting-virus-ambulance-drivers-feel-duty-bound-to-ferry-patients/story-8TweTf4kQYZagWl8w6HPpM.html

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||Residents of Chandigarh’s Sector 40 to screen outsiders, sanitise vehicles from today||Residents of Sector 40, along with other stakeholders, have decided to thermal scan the outsiders entering the area from Sunday onward. Besides, the residents have also decided to sanitise the outsiders’ vehicles to prevent the spread of the virus.Chandigarh’s Sector 40 is the first one to take this initiative and UT adviser Manoj Parida will formally launch it on Sunday. The decision was taken during a meeting held at the sector’s community centre where residents, police and local area councillor Gurbax Rawat were present. Rawat said, “The stakeholders contributed money and formed a team of 16 volunteers to monitor the two entry and exit points of the sector and check all those entering the area.” She said only people with valid movement passes will be allowed to pass through the sector.Rawat further said, “The administration has sealed one exit point and plans to seal the other soon. To ensure the safety of volunteers, the administration will provide them with personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, she said, adding that the volunteers will be on duty from 7am to 7pm.Through the contributions, residents have purchased four thermal scanners of ₹ 8,000 each. They have also purchased chemicals worth ₹ 8,000 for preparing sanitiser liquid to disinfect vehicles entering the sector. Volunteers have also been knitting masks and have made over 400 besides 1,000 three-ply masks for distribution among the people. The residents have also bought 1,000 pairs of gloves. Sector 40 resident welfare association (RWA) president Dalwinder Singh Saini said the residents have also formed a team of volunteers to help senior citizens and differently-abled persons.“Anyone who needs help can approach their RWA heads or the councilor.

19-04-2020||Chandigarh||Hooda asks Haryana govt to simplify procurement process for farmers||Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Saturday urged the Haryana government to understand the distress of farmers and buy every grain of their produce.“Money is being deducted in the name of moisture content from farmers who are arriving with their mustard crops in the market. They are being denied full crop rates. The buying process is so complex that it is beyond the comprehension of most farmers. Instead of buying crops in one lot, farmers are being called to the mandis repeatedly. This increases the transportation expense and also forces them to make unnecessary trips to the mandi, thereby breaking lockdown and social distancing rules,” Hooda said.He said the government has purchased about 5% mustard (of its estimated production) in the last three days. “Based on the trends so far and the arrangements made, it seems difficult if the government will be able to buy the entire crop within the schedule. Farmers are given one-day notice to sell their crops and they get the message only a day before the date of purchase. Therefore, it becomes difficult for them to make arrangements and reach Mandi at such a short notice,” Hooda said.He said the government should coordinate with grain merchants and should make them the handling agents. A spokesperson of the agriculture department said the procurement of mustard will continue till every grain is purchased. About 82,886 metric tonnes of mustard has been procured from 32,779 farmers in the first four days. On Saturday, 9,303 farmers reported at the 163 procurement centres and about 25,263 metric tonnes of mustard was purchased by Hafed and State Warehousing Corporation, the spokesperson added.Govt making more arrangements to purchase mustard: DalalHaryana agriculture minister Jai Prakash Dalal on Saturday visited the grain market of Mandi Adampur in Hisar district to check mustard procurement here. While addressing mediapersons, the minister said he came to know that at many areas some officials and commission agents are deducting the cost of mustard grain in the name of moisture content. He said strict action will be taken against such officials and commission agents if they reject mustard seeds of the farmers.He said farmers must register themselves with the Meri Fasal portal. “The state government is making arrangements to purchase mustard from the farmers by making small grain markets in the villages,” Dalal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooda-asks-haryana-govt-to-simplify-procurement-process-for-farmers/story-AIGgPYmp9G960duxCwceRJ.html

They are stranded there and in trouble. Since the administration has made no arrangements for them, the pilgrims are struggling with hunger and facing a tough time,” Giani Harpreet Singh said in a statement here.He said the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada and Malaysia had taken back their citizens from India through special flights. “So, it’s the moral responsibility of the Indian government to ensure that people stuck at different places due to the countrywide lockdown, returned to their homes on priority,” said the head of the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs.WANTS PASSES FOR THE STRANDEDHe demanded that the Centre and the Punjab government issue passes to the sangat stuck in Indore and that concrete steps should be taken to bring back thousands of pilgrims stranded at Nanded.Nearly 2,500 pilgrims, mostly from Punjab, are stranded at Takht Hazoor Sahib, one of the five Sikh temporal seats.A few days ago, some pilgrims had attempted to return to Punjab by road, but the Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan governments did not let them enter their states. The shrine’s management board also raised their plight but in vain.SGPC CHIEF WRITES TO AMIT SHAH Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal on Saturday wrote a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah requesting him to ensure homecoming of the pilgrims stranded at Nanded. He said the letter has also been marked to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray. He said the SGPC is ready to cooperate the government in this matter and send its vehicles to ferry them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sikh-pilgrims-returning-from-nanded-stopped-in-indore-akal-takht-seeks-govt-intervention/story-2SXFbwmuB4RtioKL0Gu3nI.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||Lockdown keeps another curve flat — number of unnatural deaths||On average, 4 people die in road accidents in Delhi every day. Between March 23 and April 14, only nine died in accidents.On average, there is one case of murder in Delhi every day. Between March 23 and April 13, there were 13 murders. The numbers can be credited to the ongoing lockdown that is aimed at combating the spread of the coronavirus disease, Covid-19. With people asked to stay at home as much as possible, and few vehicles allowed on the streets, all activity, including crimes and accidents, have almost come to a standstill.As a result, the number of unnatural deaths in the city-state has fallen, according to data from police and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences(AIIMS).Delhi police officers said that the number of murders, road accidents and unidentified bodies being found on the city’s streets have reduced in comparison the period before the lockdown.On March 22, after the completion of the first day of the voluntary lockdown (Janata curfew) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Delhi police imposed prohibitory orders under section 144(a ban on assembly of more than four persons) across the city. The following morning chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a complete lockdown of the national capital as a measure to contain the spread of Covid-19. On March 24, Modi announced a national lockdown for three weeks starting March 25. Earlier this week, he announced its extension till May 3.According to police data, between March 1 and 22, there were 41 murders across the city. The number of murders since then (between March 23 and April 14) is 13.Additional commissioner of police, Mandeep Randhawa said crime has decreased since the lockdown. “The few murders are not related to any criminals. There are cases of a person murdering his friend or a man involved in a neighbour’s murder. Police are on the roads so crime has decreased.” Road accident deaths -too have seen a steep decline. According to Delhi police data, while 44 persons died in accidents between March 1 and 22, the number of dead thereafter (until April 14) is only 9.Doctors at AIIMS and Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC) confirmed that the number of post mortem cases at the hospital have reduced. A post mortem is conducted in cases of unnatural deaths such as suicides and suspected murders. Between March 1 and March 22, doctors at AIIMS conducted 130 but after March 23 and till April 14, the did just 81. At JPNATC, the corresponding numbers are 40 and 7 .Dr Sudhir Gupta, Professor & Head, Department Of Forensic Medicine at AIIMS confirmed that there is a drastic reduction in the number of road accidents and homicides.Many of the bodies that come in for post mortem in the city’s government hospitals are of unidentified persons found dead on the city’s streets. Most are homeless; some die of a drug overdose; others of illness or starvation; and still others are run over by vehicles at night.According to police data, between March 1 and 22, there were 233 such unidentified bodies. The number since then, and till April 14 has reduced to 171. A senior police officer said that the number of drug overdose deaths among the homeless has decreased because the drug supply chain has been broken during the lockdown.Indu Prakash Singh, a member of the state level shelter monitoring committee, set up on the orders of the Supreme Court , said that the deaths of the homeless have come down because of the government’s efforts to feed them.“The homeless usually die of hunger, infection and also drug overdose in some cases. Now that everyone is working to feed them, the numbers are coming down. Many of our homeless on the streets who have minor infections die because they do not get food. They cannot go out to work and die anonymous deaths. There should be a permanent programme to feed the homeless after the lockdown too.”Delhi police’s spokesperson, Mandeep Randhawa said police across the city are working to feed the homeless. “Every police station is working to feed the needy in the area. Police have fed several lakhs of needy citizens during the lockdown. At every police station, we have taken help of good Samaritans and NGOs. Our endeavour is to ensure that no one sleeps hungry,” Randhawa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lockdown-keeps-another-curve-flat-number-of-unnatural-deaths/story-JXYzIlKSh1GK5ldPGLJQhL.html
19-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi starts drafting rules for food delivery persons||The Delhi government has started drafting safety norms for delivery firms and stand-alone restaurants to prevent further spread of coronavirus in the Capital. The move has been necessitated due to a delivery person, working for a restaurant in Malviya Nagar, testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), following which at least 72 households have been placed in home-quarantine.The guidelines are expected to be released early next week.Delhi chief secretary, Vijay Dev, on Friday directed the state health department to prepare a mandatory standard operating procedure (SoP), after taking cognisance of a report in HT that highlighted the absence of safety norms for eateries and their delivery persons.“The HT news report has been brought to my notice. I am ordering the principal secretary (health) to lay down the rules immediately,” Dev said.District magistrates (DMs), who are currently at the helm of all containment activities, had also demanded mandatory thermal screening of delivery persons at all eateries and issuance of fitness certificates by the employers on a weekly basis.The Malviya Nagar incident has become a reference point for the DMs, as the Covid-19 positive delivery person continued to work despite exhibiting flu-like symptoms for almost a month. While the infected man is now being treated at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur, at least 16 employees and the owner of Box 8 restaurant have been placed in institutional quarantine at a Chhatarpur facility.“Most of the delivery persons are young boys, which means they could be asymptomatic for a long time. There’s also a fear of retrenchment due to which some, despite being ill, like in this particular case, continue to work,” said Nidhi Srivastava, DM (Central).“The rules must make it mandatory for the employer to grant leaves with job security in case a worker linked with the eatery is showing symptoms of illness, even if it is not Covid related,” she said.While larger food delivery chains and essential supplies providers have strict processes to ensure safety standards, smaller firms may go below the radar, senior civic officials said, highlighting the need for standardised norms.To keep a check on compliance by the smaller firms, DM (South), BM Mishra, suggested that ASHA or anganwadi workers, who are part of the 13,742-strong Corona FootWarriors Containment and Surveillance Team across the city, be made nodal officers for health checks of workers in such eateries.“These outlets need to declare to us that they are open and mention the number of workers engaged. We can even prepare a format for the fitness certificates. But, all this needs a set of rules,” Mishra said.Officials in the health department said all the suggestions given by the DMs will be considered while drafting the rules. “If need be, we will also hold a meeting with the DMs to further fine-tune the policy,” a senior official, who did not wish to be named, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-starts-drafting-rules-for-food-delivery-persons/story-7ihx3ZOxrVT8ikIqopepNK.html
19-04-2020||World||US President Trump’s lockdown exit plan ‘delusional’ say opponents||President Donald Trump’s administration clashed with state governors Sunday over lifting coronavirus lockdowns, in a standoff embittered by his support for protests against the restrictions.Vice President Mike Pence said that every US state has the ability to do enough testing to allow preliminary re-opening of the economy and a partial restart of normal life in America.But some state governors said testing capacity was far behind levels needed to avoid sparking new outbreaks of the virus.The United States has so far recorded 735,000 coronavirus cases -- the highest number of any country -- and registered 39,000 deaths.“We believe the testing that we have today... once we activate all of the labs that can do coronavirus testing, is sufficient for any state in America to move into phase one,” Pence told FOX News Sunday.“Phase one” ends stay-at-home restrictions for healthy people, and allows restaurants, cinemas, sporting venues, places of worships and gyms to re-open with physical distancing.“We have every confidence that we can have a sufficient amount of testing to be able to re-open America,” Pence said, vowing to double the numbers of tests.But Virginia Governor Ralph Northam pushed back at the Republican administration’s claims that there was enough testing, saying “that’s just delusional.”Gretchen Whitmer, Democratic governor of Michigan, said “we could double or even triple the number of tests that we’re executing daily if we had the swabs and reagents” and called for more federal government help.As the US struggles to quell the mounting death toll, political battle lines are also being drawn ahead of the November election as Trump seeks to reduce damage to his chances of holding onto office.Anti-lockdown protests have sprung up in several US cities in recent days, with support from Trump who in tweets has called to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia -- all states with Democratic governors -- from stay-at-home orders.“Our president, obviously, has been unable to deliver on tests. Now he has chosen to focus on protests,” Northam told CNN’s “State of the Union.”Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington state, also a Democrat, went further still: “To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law... it is dangerous.But even the Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, said Trump’s encouragement of protesters who picketed the colonial-era statehouse in Annapolis a day earlier was “not helpful.”“To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, on Thursday, it just doesn’t make any sense,” Hogan told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-trump-s-lockdown-exit-plan-delusional-say-opponents/story-1DXlWyieh27fLITh4i3uQL.html
19-04-2020||World||‘Cartels are scrambling’: Covid-19 snarls global drug trade||Coronavirus is dealing a gut punch to the illegal drug trade, paralyzing economies, closing borders and severing supply chains in China that traffickers rely on for the chemicals to make such profitable drugs as methamphetamine and fentanyl.One of the main suppliers that shut down is in Wuhan, the epicenter of the global outbreak.Associated Press interviews with nearly two dozen law enforcement officials and trafficking experts found Mexican and Colombian cartels are still plying their trade as evidenced by recent drug seizures but the lockdowns that have turned cities into ghost towns are disrupting everything from production to transport to sales.Along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border through which the vast majority of illegal drugs cross, the normally bustling vehicle traffic that smugglers use for cover has slowed to a trickle. Bars, nightclubs and motels across the country that are ordinarily fertile marketplaces for drug dealers have shuttered. And prices for drugs in short supply have soared to gouging levels.“They are facing a supply problem and a demand problem,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former official with CISEN, the Mexican intelligence agency. “Once you get them to the market, who are you going to sell to?”Virtually every illicit drug has been impacted, with supply chain disruptions at both the wholesale and retail level. Traffickers are stockpiling narcotics and cash along the border, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration even reports a decrease in money laundering and online drug sales on the so-called dark web.“The godfathers of the cartels are scrambling,” said Phil Jordan, a former director of the DEA’s El Paso Intelligence Center.Cocaine prices are up 20 percent or more in some cities. Heroin has become harder to find in Denver and Chicago, while supplies of fentanyl are falling in Houston and Philadelphia. In Los Angeles, the price of methamphetamine has more than doubled in recent weeks to $1,800 per pound.“You have shortages but also some greedy bastards who see an opportunity to make more money,” said Jack Riley, the former deputy administrator of the DEA. “The bad guys frequently use situations that affect the national conscience to raise prices.”Synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl have been among the most affected, in large part because they rely on precursor chemicals that Mexican cartels import from China, cook into drugs on an industrial scale and then ship to the U.S.“This is something we would use as a lesson learned for us,” the head of the DEA, Uttam Dhillon, told AP. “If the disruption is that significant, we need to continue to work with our global partners to ensure that, once we come out of the pandemic, those precursor chemicals are not available to these drug-trafficking organizations.”Cartels are increasingly shifting away from drugs that require planting and growing seasons, like heroin and marijuana, in favor of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which can be cooked 24/7 throughout the year, are up to 50 times more powerful than heroin and produce a greater profit margin.Though some clandestine labs that make fentanyl from scratch have popped up sporadically in Mexico, cartels are still very much reliant upon Chinese companies to get the precursor drugs.Huge amounts of these mail-order components can be traced to a single, state-subsidized company in Wuhan that shut down after the outbreak earlier this year, said Louise Shelley, director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, which monitors Chinese websites selling fentanyl.“The quarantine of Wuhan and all the chaos there definitely affected the fentanyl trade, particularly between China and Mexico,” said Ben Westhoff, author of “Fentanyl, Inc.”“The main reason China has been the main supplier is the main reason China is the supplier of everything — it does it so cheaply,” Westhoff said. “There was really no cost incentive for the cartels to develop this themselves.”But costs have been rising and, as in many legitimate industries, the coronavirus is bringing about changes.Advertised prices across China for precursors of fentanyl, methamphetamine and cutting agents have risen between 25% and 400% since late February, said Logan Pauley, an analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington-based security research nonprofit. So even as drug precursor plants in China are slowly reopening after the worst of the coronavirus crisis there, some cartels have been taking steps to decrease their reliance on overseas suppliers by enlisting scientists to make their own precursor chemicals.“Because of the coronavirus they’re starting to do it in house,” added Westhoff.Some Chinese companies that once pushed precursors are now advertising drugs like hydroxychloroquine, which President Donald Trump has promoted as potential treatment for COVID-19, as well as personal protective gear such as face masks and hand sanitizers.Meanwhile, the gummed up situation on the U.S.-Mexico border resembles a stalled chess match where nobody, especially the traffickers, wants to make a wrong move, said Kyle Williamson, special agent in charge of the DEA’s El Paso field division.“They’re in a pause right now,” Williamson said. “They don’t want to get sloppy and take a lot of risks.”Some Mexican drug cartels are even holding back existing methamphetamine supplies to manipulate the market, recognizing that “no good crisis should be wasted,” said Joseph Brown, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Texas.“Some cartels have given direct orders to members of their organization that anyone caught selling methamphetamine during this time will be killed,” said Brown, whose sprawling jurisdiction stretches from the suburbs of Dallas to Beaumont.To be sure, narcotics are still making their way into the U.S., as evidenced by a bust last month in which nearly $30 million worth of street drugs were seized in a new smuggling tunnel connecting a warehouse in Tijuana to southern San Diego. Shelley said that bust was notable in that only about 2 pounds of fentanyl was recovered, “much lower than usual shipments.”Trump announced earlier this month that Navy ships were being moved toward Venezuela as part of a bid to beef up counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean following a U.S. drug indictment against Nicolás Maduro.But the pandemic also has limited law enforcement’s effectiveness, as departments cope with drug investigators working remotely, falling ill and navigating a new landscape in which their own activities have become more conspicuous. In Los Angeles County, half of the narcotics detectives have been put on patrol duty, potentially imperiling long-term investigations.Nonetheless, Capt. Chris Sandoval, who oversees special investigations for the Houston-based Harris County Sheriff’s Office, said there’s a new saying among his detectives: “Not even the dope dealers can hide from the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cartels-are-scrambling-covid-19-snarls-global-drug-trade/story-Py4zxqwPlNPBbLcPhHulVK.html

19-04-2020||World||Coronavirus deaths down in New York, but officials urge vigilance||The coronavirus death toll in New York dropped again, a sign that Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday means the state is “on the other side of the plateau” and that ongoing social distancing practices are working to stem the spread of the virus.Cuomo said 507 people died on Saturday, down 43 from the previous day. Hospitalizations and other medical indicators are trending downward.But Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio maintained their warnings that people in New York City and the rest of the state need to stay vigilant to curb the spread of the virus.“We showed that we can control the beast and when you close down, you can actually slow that infection rate, but this is only halftime,” Cuomo said Sunday at a briefing. We still have to make sure that we keep that beast under control, we keep that infection rate down, we keep that hospitalization rate down as we all get very eager to get on with life and move on.”Here are the latest coronavirus developments in New York:DECLINING DEATH TOLLThe drop in the death toll in New York reported Sunday prompted Cuomo to say, “We are on the other side of the plateau.”But both Cuomo and de Blasio said the crisis is far from over, cautioning that the temptation for cooped-up New Yorkers to take advantage of the spring weather presents new challenges to keep the outbreak in check.Police and park officers will be out in force to break up outdoor gatherings that pose a risk, with violators facing potential fines of up to $1,000, the mayor said. The city is encouraging people to text authorities photos when they spot the gatherings.“We do not want to see this disease boomerang,” he said. “We do not want to see it come back with a vengeance.”For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with underlying health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.DE BLASIO BLASTS TRUMPPresident Donald Trump is betraying his fellow New Yorkers by failing to push for billions of dollars in additional federal aid needed to help the city deal with the coronavirus economic crisis, de Blasio said Sunday.The mayor had harsh words for the Queens-born president, claiming both he and Vice President Mike Pence have ignored his overtures on the stimulus funds.“Right now you are failing to protect the very people you grew up around,” de Blasio said of Trump. “When New York City is in need, where are you?”De Blasio even referenced an infamous tabloid headline - “FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD” - from 1975 when then-President Gerald Ford denied assistance to spare New York from bankruptcy.“Are you going to save New York City,” the mayor said, “or are you saying to New York City ’drop dead?”FEWER POLICE OUT SICKThe number of New York Police Department officers calling out sick is declining.The nation’s largest police department reported that 5,324 uniformed members — about 15% of the force — were out sick on Saturday. That’s down from a high of 7,155 officers — nearly 20% of the force — on April 9.So far, more than 2,000 members of the NYPD have returned to work full duty after recovering from a positive test for the coronavirus, police officials said.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSTony Award-nominated actor Nick Cordero had his right leg amputated after having complications from the coronavirus, his wife said.

19-04-2020||World||Turkey blocks Saudi and UAE news websites||Turkish authorities blocked Saudi and United Arab Emirates news websites on Sunday, days after the sites of Turkey’s state broadcaster and news agency were blocked in Saudi Arabia.The apparently reciprocal moves come four weeks after Turkish prosecutors indicted 20 Saudis over the killing of journalist Jamal Kashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a killing that soured relations between Ankara and Riyadh.Internet users in Turkey trying to access the sites of Saudi news agency SPA, the UAE’s WAM news agency and more than a dozen other sites saw a message saying that they were blocked under a law governing internet publications in Turkey.A spokesman at Turkey’s Justice Ministry declined to comment on the actions and Saudi Arabia’s government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The Turkish website of the UK-based Independent newspaper, which is operated by a Saudi company, was one of the sites to blocked on Sunday, in a move that its editor said reflected political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey.“We believe the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey reflected on us,” editor Nevzat Cicek told Reuters. Sunday’s decision appeared to be “retaliation against Saudi Arabia”, he said.Saudi Arabia had blocked access to several Turkish media websites a week earlier, including state broadcaster TRT and the state-owned Anadolu agency. Residents in the United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Saudi Arabia, said the Turkish websites were accessible on Sunday.Tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia escalated sharply after Saudi agents killed Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.Last month Istanbul prosecutors indicted one of the prince’s close aides and a former deputy head of Saudi general intelligence on charges of instigating Khashoggi’s killing, as well as 18 men it said carried out the operation.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the killing was ordered at the “highest levels” of the Saudi government. Prince Mohammed has denied ordering the killing but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto leader.(Reporting Irem Koca Writing by Dominic Evans Editing by David Goodman)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-blocks-saudi-and-uae-news-websites/story-LSP6xFWwixoE7ojklAdrxO.html
19-04-2020||World||Pak PM Imran Khan, OIC criticise India over treatment of Muslims||Pakistan’s top leadership and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Sunday criticised what they described as the deliberate targeting of Muslims by the Indian government against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.Prime Minister Imran Khan followed up on tweets by the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission of the OIC on the issue and compared the Indian government’s treatment of Muslims to what the Nazis did to the Jews in Germany.The deliberate & violent targeting of Muslims in India by Modi Govt to divert the backlash over its COVID19 policy, which has left thousands stranded & hungry, is akin to what Nazis did to Jews in Gerrmany. Yet more proof of the racist Hindutva Supremacist ideology of Modi Govt.In a tweet, President Arif Alvi, a close aide of Khan, accused the Indian government of suppressing the Kashmiri people through “extreme violence, torture and oppression”. He posted a graphic with figures that purported to show that the ratio of soldiers to civilians in Kashmir was higher than the ratios for the number of ventilators and doctors.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the remarks by the Pakistani leadership.In recent months, Khan has repeatedly criticised the Indian government’s attitude towards the country’s Muslim minority and the external affairs ministry has pushed back against his remarks, describing them as interference in India’s internal affairs. The Indian side has also targeted Khan for failing to counter cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil.Khan tweeted: “The deliberate & violent targeting of Muslims in India by Modi Govt to divert the backlash over its COVID19 policy, which has left thousands stranded & hungry, is akin to what Nazis did to Jews in Germany.”1/2 #OIC-IPHRC condemns the unrelenting vicious #Islamophobic campaign in #India maligning Muslims for spread of #COVID-19 as well as their negative profiling in media subjecting them to discrimination & violence with impunity.Hours earlier, the OIC’s Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission had, in a string of tweets, condemned what it described as the “unrelenting vicious Islamophobic campaign in India maligning Muslims for spread of #Covid-19 as well as their negative profiling in media subjecting them to discrimination & violence with impunity”.2/2 #OIC-IPHRC urges the #Indian Govt to take urgent steps to stop the growing tide of #Islamophobia in India and protect the rights of its persecuted #Muslim minority as per its obligations under int"l HR law.It urged the “Indian government to take urgent steps to stop the growing tide of #Islamophobia in the country and protect the rights of its persecuted Muslim minority as per its obligations under [international human rights] law”.The commission is an expert body of the OIC with advisory capacity.India’s foreign minister was invited as a special guest at a meeting of foreign ministers of OIC states in the UAE last year, marking a high point in New Delhi’s often testy relations with the Islamic grouping.However, in recent months, the OIC has repeatedly criticised the Indian government’s handling of the situation in Kashmir and attacks on Muslims. The external affairs ministry has rejected this criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-oic-criticise-india-over-treatment-of-muslims/story-nuoD7kNRvqtAmGK4RusRtJ.html
19-04-2020||World||Right wing-led protests spread against Covid-19 curbs in US||More than 1,890 people died of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours as right wing-led protests against restrictions in force to combat the spread of the coronavirus spread to more US states Saturday, after President Donald Trump came out in their support and encouraged them with “LIBERATE” tweets.Hundred of protestors congregated in states capitals in Texas, Maryland, Utah, California, Arizona, Washington and Colorado, with signs and chants protesting the restrictions as a violation of their rights. Some carried signs saying the virus was a hoax, and some in Texas called for firing a top epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, who is a member of Trump’s coronavirus task-force but has come to be seen by some on the far right as someone who is undermining the president; he was recently given a security detial after receiving threats.People chanted “Let us work” and “Make America Free Again”, at a protest staged in Austin, Texas, called by Infowars, a right-wing outfit that has been banned by social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter for advocating conspiracy theories. Its founder Alex Jones, who is also banned by these outlets, made a brief appearance, according to local news media outlets.Protestors at these gatherings, which took place in Michigan, New York, Kentucky and some other states earlier, have defied social-distancing norms in force in these and other states, as per the guidelines issued by the Trump administration. They remain in force also in line with the “reopening guidelines” unveiled by the president last week recommending steps states could take to lift the restrictions in a “science-based” phased manner.But Trump has supported them, unwilling, critics have said, to take on his own base and supporters. He went further with a series of tweets Friday saying, “LIBERATE Michigan”, LIBERATE Virginia” and “LIBERATE Minnesota”; all three states with Democratic governors.Most governors are moving towards reopening their states, but want to rush into it. They have sought to ramp up testing as a key step to link reopening to verifiably sustainable declining numbers of new cases. They have sought federal support for it, which has put some of them at odds with the president.There is all-around agreements among public health officials and experts that the United States is past the peak now, and that the worst is over, in new infections. Fatalities will take a while reflecting it as they follow a two-week lag, according to experts.The US toll went up 1,891 over the past 24 hours to 39,025 Sunday morning and infections rose by 32,491 to 735,366. New York state, the epicenter of the US outbreak accounted for 17,627 of the fatalities; 13,157 in New York city alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/right-wing-led-protests-spread-against-covid-19-curbs-in-us/story-HMNo2eBWizIBjt0hstSESI.html
19-04-2020||World||White House, Democrats ‘very close’ to deal to aid Covid-19-hit businesses||The White House and congressional Democrats said Sunday they could reach agreement soon on expanding funds to small businesses devastated by the coronavirus, with Democrats hoping to add money for hospitals, testing and state governments.“We’re very close,” Vice President Mike Pence told talkshow Fox News Sunday about negotiations on replenishing the Paycheck Protection Program whose entire $349 billion funding was exhausted by last Thursday.“We’re going to work to expand that so that no one working in a small business in America would have to worry about missing a paycheck.”President Donald Trump has insisted his administration will do right by millions of American families and businesses ravaged by a pandemic that has infected 735,000 people in the United States, 39,000 of whom have died.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed hope a deal could be reached and passed by Congress in the coming days.“I think we’re very close to a deal today,” Mnuchin told CNN’s State of the Union, as he put forward a new target number of $300 billion, beyond the $250 billion under discussion last week.Mnuchin said the White House has also agreed to add $75 billion to hospitals and first responders, and $25 billion to ramp up virus testing -- clear wins for Democrats.Critics have savaged the administration for lagging on testing efforts and say testing should be massively expanded.Mnuchin, however, said Trump wants additional funding for state and local governments -- stretched to the limit as they battle the pandemic -- included in a broader bill to come later, not in the interim package.Democrats joined the optimism about the pace of negotiations.“We’re on a very good path” and a deal could be reached “soon,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Fox.That marked a notable quickening of her timeline from last week, when she suggested the interim bill could clear Congress “before the end of the month.”Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer was more direct, saying “I’m very hopeful we could come to an agreement tonight or early tomorrow morning.”US officials said Friday that the massive business loan program has aided 1.6 million enterprises to date.Democrats are stressing that some money in the interim package be set aside for businesses in rural and minority areas where there is often less access to banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-democrats-very-close-to-deal-to-aid-covid-19-hit-businesses/story-xBP9oKLaSJYtLYyk45JbtK.html
19-04-2020||World||US citizens across several states protest against Covid-19 lockdown rules||Hundreds protested Saturday in cities across America against coronavirus-related lockdowns -- with encouragement from President Donald Trump -- as resentment grows against the crippling economic cost of confinement.An estimated 400 people gathered under a cold rain in Concord, New Hampshire -- many on foot while others remained in their cars -- to send a message that extended quarantines were not necessary in a state with relatively few confirmed cases of COVID-19.The crowd included several armed men wearing military-style uniforms, with their faces covered.In Texas, more than 250 people rallied outside the State Capitol in Austin, including far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, founder of the Infowars site, who rolled up in a tank-like truck.“It’s time to reopen Texas, it’s time to let people work, it’s time for them to let voluntary interaction and good sense rule the day, not government force,” said Justin Greiss, an activist with Young Americans for Liberty.Stay-at-home mother Amira Abuzeid added: “I’m not a doctor but I’m an intelligent person who can do math and it looks like at the end of the day, these numbers are not that worrisome.”Few if any observed social distancing recommendations.Demonstrators outside Maryland’s colonial-era statehouse in Annapolis stayed in their cars but waved signs with messages like “Poverty kills too.”Dolores, a hairdresser, told AFP she is not eligible for unemployment because she is a business owner, not an employee.“I need to save my business. I need to work to live. Otherwise I will die,” she said.Other demonstrations took place across the country in cities such as Columbus, Ohio and San Diego, California, as well as the states of Indiana, Nevada and Wisconsin.Few practiced social distancing but many of the protesters waved American flags.‘Live Free or Die’Protesters have drawn encouragement in certain Democratic-led states from tweets by Trump, who has said he favors a quick return to normal, though protests have also taken place in Republican-led states like New Hampshire and Texas. The US has seen more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country in the world -- with more than 734,000 confirmed infections and 38,800 fatalities as of Saturday evening.The vast majority of Americans are under lockdown orders restricting public movement and keeping all but essential businesses closed.In Concord, demonstrators carried signs with slogans like “The numbers lie” and “Reopen New Hampshire.” Their common demand was that the stay-at-home order for the state of 1.3 million people be called off before its scheduled May 4 end date.Others, amid a sea of American flags, chanted the state’s Revolutionary War-era slogan, “Live Free or Die.”“People are very happy on a voluntary basis to do what’s necessary,” one demonstrator, 63-year-old Skip Murphy, told AFP by phone.He added, however, that “the data does not support the egregious lockdown we are having in New Hampshire.”As of early Friday, New Hampshire had reported 1,287 confirmed coronavirus cases and 37 deaths.‘Free country’“All over the country, a lot of people are saying, ‘We will do our part, but at the same time, this is supposed to be a free country,’“ Murphy said.“When that gets transgressed, people start to say, ‘Wait a minute, this is wrong.’“Most Americans -- by a two-to-one margin -- actually worry about virus restrictions being lifted too soon, not too late, a recent Pew survey found. But demonstrators found encouragement Friday from the president, who in a series of tweets called to “LIBERATE” Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia -- all states with Democratic governors -- from stay-at-home orders.Trump has repeatedly called for the earliest possible return to normality as virus-related closings have had a crushing impact on American workers and businesses. “I really think some of the governors have gotten carried away,” Trump said at a White House news conference on Saturday.He welcomed the reopening of some businesses in Texas and Vermont on Monday “while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions.”The largest protest against stay-at-home rules so far took place Wednesday in the Michigan capital of Lansing, which drew some 3,000 people.Murphy said he had voted for Trump, but insisted his motives were not partisan. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu is a Republican, he noted.“This has nothing to do with Trump or the Democratic and Republican governors,” Murphy said.“It is a case of one size not fitting all -- the lockdown should cease where it does not make sense.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-citizens-across-several-states-protest-against-us-covid-19-lockdown-rules/story-h3MGVQSvIn38NXTK6B1OzN.html

Reports from care homes and charity organisations say thousands have died outside hospitals that are not reflected in the daily hospital figures.Michael Gove, senior cabinet minister, rejected several reports in the Sunday press alleging that Johnson did not attend five emergency meetings related to the pandemic, and that ministers were slow in responding adequately despite scientific evidence of its seriousness.There have been demands that as in other countries, the UK should ease some restrictions as part of an ‘exit plan’, but Gove said the government was taking “a deliberately cautious and measured approach guided by the science”.He said: “When we have the information, when we have the data that allows us confidently to relax those restrictions we will do so, but that data, that information, is not yet in place,” adding that there is no certainty when a vaccine for the virus would be available.Sarah Gilbert, who is leading a team developing a vaccine at Oxford University, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that they hoped to start clinical trials towards the end of next week but nobody could be sure it was possible “to find a workable vaccine”.She said they would need government support to accelerate manufacturing because the UK currently does not have the facilities to make the vaccine on a large scale.Jeremy Farrar, who is a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told Sunday television that the UK may be past the peak of the ‘first wave’ of the virus, but cautioned against easing the lockdown.“If we were to release those lockdowns too soon whilst the infection rates are still high … then the epidemic would come back again, it would come back very quickly. It would rebound within a few weeks or a couple of months.”On vaccine development, he said: “It’s not a given that we will make a vaccine. If we did have a vaccine, let’s say late in 2020 or into 2021, we would then need to manufacture it in billions of doses and make those billions of doses available to the world”.“So just having a vaccine that is safe and effective, proven, is not enough. If there is any country vulnerable, if there is any country where there is still transmission of this virus, then in fact every country is vulnerable.“I hope we would have a vaccine towards the end of this year – but that’s a vaccine in a vial, it’s a vaccine that we believe to be safe, a vaccine we think might be effective. That’s not having a vaccine for the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-not-to-ease-lockdown-as-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-16-000/story-t9IGI1azUzXUbYquRsXUFL.html

More than 40,000 Pakistanis in the Gulf Arab state have registered with the consulate to return home, two UAE newspapers reported.The UAE and other Gulf states have reported increased infections among low-income migrant workers who live in overcrowded quarters. Some have moved to re-house them in shuttered schools or dedicated centres, and are trying to arrange flights to repatriate them.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe UAE last week said it would review labour relations with states refusing to evacuate citizens, including those who have lost jobs or been put on leave, after the ambassadors of India and Pakistan said their countries were not yet ready to do so.PIA said on its website that it would not be able to provide services for inbound flights beyond Islamabad International Airport due to suspension of domestic flights and a lockdown in the country.Millions of foreign workers, many from Asia, form the backbone of Gulf economies and work in sectors that have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.The pandemic is also likely to disrupt the significant remittances those workers send back to their home countries.The total infection count in the six Gulf states has risen steadily to more than 25,000, with 161 deaths, despite containment measures such as halting passenger flights, curfews and in several cases locking down districts with large populations of low-income expatriate workers.On Sunday the UAE announced another 479 new cases and four more deaths, bringing its total to 6,781 cases and 41 deaths so far. Kuwait’s 90-year-old ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, on Sunday addressed the nation to welcome back the first group of Kuwaitis returned home under a new repatriation programme. He urged them to comply with all isolation and quarantine guidelines given by authorities in the Gulf state, which has recorded seven deaths, including one on Sunday, and almost 2,000 cases of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-starts-repatriating-uae-based-nationals-stranded-by-coronavirus/story-PsBZnBSwDKuJaMAus40HPI.html

The coronavirus outbreak, that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, has spread across continents to become a pandemic that has locked down more than half of the planet. Here are the latest Covid-19 developments from all across the world: 1. The UK government is not considering lifting the coronavirus lockdown. The lockdown was imposed almost four weeks ago.2. Wuhan virology lab chief denied that coronavirus originated from the institute, said the virus cannot be man-made. The institute rejected as “impossible” US theories that suggest it is the cradle of the pandemic.3. Spain’s death toll appears to be slowing. On Sunday, the number of fatalities rose by 410, down from 565 on Saturday. This was the lowest daily increase in coronavirus fatalities for Spain in about a month.4. The British government has said that the increase in Covid-19 deaths is “deeply worrying”. More than 15,000 people have died in Britain so far due to coronavirus.5. The United States still accounts for the maximum number of coronavirus deaths in the world with 39,090 fatalities, followed by Italy (23,227), Spain (20,453), France (19,323) and Britain (15,464).6. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is “on top of things” following his battle with coronavirus, a senior government minister said on Sunday. The UK PM has been facing criticism for being “missing in action” at the beginning of the outbreak.7. South Korea reported just eight new coronavirus infections, the lowest in two months. The country extended its social distancing policy on Sunday with some relaxation. 8. After the UAE threatened to review labour ties with countries refusing to take back their nationals amid the coronavirus pandemic, Pakistan has started repatriating some of its citizens from the Arab nation.9. Iran on Sunday announced that its Covid-19 death toll rose to 5,118, up by 87.10. In a bid to salvage its hammered currency amid coronavirus lockdown, Sri Lanka has put a three-month ban on a wide range of imports. The country will lift its month-long coronavirus curfew on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-deaths-appear-to-slow-down-in-spain-uk-not-ready-to-lift-lockdown-10-points/story-u7SZeL6qSigkGbDe5o6rLL.html

19-04-2020||World||Buy a newspaper, Britons told, as Covid-19 enfeebles UK media||Add buying a newspaper in your to-do list during lockdown, the Boris Johnson government has urged Britons, as the United Kingdom grapples with steep decline in advertising and circulation in national as well as local news media.Oliver Dowden, Culture secretary, made the plea in an article in The Times, reminding readers that the ‘news industry’ is providing a vital service by giving important information to people as the pandemic takes an increasing toll of lives in the UK: over 15,000 deaths.The news media’s dwindling revenue is accentuated by so-called ‘blacklists’ of words that leads to adverts not appearing online beside stories that include words such as coronavirus, Covid-19 or deaths. Estimates of loss due to such blocking are in the hundreds of millions of pounds.Dowden notes that according to the News Media Association, ad revenues have plummeted by up to 90 per cent: “National, regional and local newspapers are under huge financial pressure, largely because of plummeting commercial advertising on their printed pages and websites”.“Falling demand for advertising has also been exacerbated by something called keyword blocking, where advertising linked to specific keywords is prevented from being served on papers’ web pages. Some major UK brands and parts of the advertising industry are blocking adverts appearing next to coronavirus-related news stories”.His plea to support the news media by buying newspapers is backed across the political spectrum. Under UK lockdown curbs, people are allowed to go out of homes while maintaining distance to buy food in shops and supermarkets, where newspapers are on sale.Sajid Javid, senior Conservative MP and former chancellor, backed Dowden: “Newspapers are indeed our ‘fourth emergency service’. Our democracy depends on a vibrant, free press. Big brands, please stop ad-blocking Covid-19 stories”.Dowden adds: “We increasingly live in an age of online echo chambers and self-reinforcing algorithms which can compound the spread of misinformation. The single best way to tackle it is through fact-checked news, and I’m pleased to see newspapers playing their part against false stories”.“I have written to the 100 biggest brands in the UK to urge them to review their advertising policies and check they are not inappropriately blocking adverts from appearing next to news providing a vital public service”.“Newspapers are at heart of the British media and essential to its vibrant mix. People across the country are rising to the coronavirus challenge and I suggest we all add one small thing to our to do list: buy a paper”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buy-a-newspaper-britons-told-as-covid-19-enfeebles-uk-media/story-1XdxPfif7TJE7R2fCiTxrN.html
19-04-2020||World||Covid-19: Japan government faces complaints after giving out dirty masks||Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s unpopular handouts of old-fashioned cloth masks as part of his coronavirus measures faced complaints, as thousands of those sent to pregnant women were dirty..The health ministry said over the weekend that it has received at least 1,900 cases of the problems reported by 80 municipalities that the masks came with stains, dust and other contamination. The dirty masks were among a half million masks that the government started sending to pregnant women in Japan as a priority last week. Abe announced a plan on April 1 to mail two cloth masks each to all 50 million households in Japan amid dire shortage of masks.The faulty masks were the latest embarrassment for Abe’s government already criticised for its coronavirus measures inadequate, off-target, too little and too late.The cloth masks also seem to have a size problem. When the masks also arrived at elderly care centres, television talk shows showed some caregivers struggling to fit the mask, saying the it was too small to cover both nose and mouth at the same time.The ministry said it has urged mask makers to resolve the contamination problem, while asking municipal officials to visually inspect the masks before mailing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-japan-government-faces-complaints-after-giving-out-dirty-masks/story-wWtMQptAvsPot7mZs1uzvI.html
19-04-2020||World||What it looks like when the world stands still | Opinion||Easter weekend? What Easter weekend? I spent the entire time following the twists and turns of the extraordinary attempt by oil producers to cobble together the biggest output cut in history, only to see the price fall when commodity markets opened on Monday. Lockdown? I was glued to my computer all weekend and wouldn’t have noticed if all restrictions had been removed. Of course, they weren’t, and that got me thinking about just how our lives have come to a screeching halt.Enjoy the stillness. I live under a flight path into one of London’s major airports, so the grounding of planes does have its upside. As do the quieter roads when I take my bike out for my morning “commute” — halfway to the office and back each morning.Cities have become noticeably quieter with far fewer cars out on the roads. Restrictions came later to London than many other European towns, and traffic flows only started to wane in the second half of March. The impact on congestion shows, but it’s been significantly less than in Milan in northern Italy, for instance. Last year drivers in London, like their counterparts in Italy, could expect a peak-time journey to take about 75% longer than the same trip on empty roads — an additional 45 minutes on a one-hour trip. Now that same “one-hour drive” in London takes around one hour and 10 minutes.In northern Italy, where restrictions were introduced during the second half of February, peak-hour delays have been reduced to around 5 minutes from as much as 45 minutes on a one-hour journey.To examine how driving has slumped and how, in a few places, it’s picking up again, I used figures from the TomTom Traffic Index to make these charts. The data show how much longer journeys in selected cities take during each hour of the week than they would on uncongested roads. The original numbers are in the form of a percentage increase over all journeys. I have standardized them to show how many more minutes drivers could expect to spend in their cars for a journey that would take an hour on empty streets.Congestion patterns in the Middle East show a similar picture to those in Europe. It’s a region that has received much less coverage of the virus’s impact, except for Iran where the outbreak appears particularly severe. But here, too, streets have gone quiet. Kuwait City has seen traffic congestion fall to almost zero, with stringent restrictions in place for nearly two months and showing no sign of being lifted.In the U.S., urban traffic congestion also tumbled during the first half of March, as Americans joined the Great Silence. Here, the additional time spent in the car during peak hours has fallen by around 90% compared with the same day of the week last year. As the West stays home, Chinese cities are coming out of lockdown. But a careful look at traffic congestion data shows that things are far from back to normal, even in cities where restrictions were eased weeks ago. The experiences there are illustrative of what the rest of us may face when our own governments start to ease the strictest confinement measures.Beijing and other Chinese cities provide the clearest data on how a place recovers from lockdown imposed to fight the Covid-19 virus. The chart below shows that journey times have risen slowly over recent weeks, as more and more traffic returns to the city’s roads. By last week, it looks as though gridlock had returned to Beijing, with journeys taking just as long as they did on average last year.But that picture is deceptive and we need to look a little closer to see why.Pulling out the data for the most recent week, it becomes clear that normalcy isn’t fully back to every corner of life in Beijing. While congestion has indeed returned during the morning and evening rush hours, the volume of traffic on the roads at other times of the weekday and weekends remains at extremely low levels. People may be traveling as normal to get to and from work, but driving for social purposes — to get to the mall, or cinema complex, or museum, or to visit family or nearby parks — remains at a very low level. Journeys outside of rush hour are still taken on almost empty roads.Of course, I couldn’t finish without saying a few words about oil. The impact of the enforced stay-at-home policies on U.S. gasoline use has been dramatic, to put it mildly. The Energy Information Administration reported four-week average demand in the period to April 10 at just 6.4 million barrels a day — its lowest level in data going back to 1991. The figure is down by nearly a third, or 3 million barrels a day, in the past month.Judging by the picture emerging from Beijing, even if some U.S. cities and states begin to ease shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions, demand may not rebound quickly if citizens remain wary of travelling too far and gathering in crowded public spaces. Commuters will be the first to feel the tedium of increasing traffic as restrictions are eased. Those driving for pleasure — at least, those who venture forth — may experience empty roads for a while longer.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-it-looks-like-when-the-world-stands-still-opinion/story-sFlQ02YCaifFNR1F6YnXLP.html

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the additional figures took the country’s total to 10,661 with 234 deaths. It said 8,042 people have recovered and been released from quarantine and 12,243 others were undergoing tests to determine whether they contracted the virus. “We must not loosen our guard until the last confirmed patient is recovered,” President Moon Jae-in said. South Korea’s caseload has been waning in recent weeks since it recorded hundreds of new cases every day between late February and early March, mostly in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas. Despite the recent downward trend, South Korean officials have warned about the possibility of a broader “quiet spread” with people easing up on social distancing. Moon urged South Koreans to support his government in saving jobs and revitalizing the economy. “Government efforts alone aren’t enough amid a grave world economic crisis. Public solidarity and cooperation is also needed to revive our economy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-fewer-sick-in-south-korea-infections-rise-in-japan/story-a9OSzyyugh1SE5O4pu4z3O.html
19-04-2020||World||Chinese administration protecting Xi from global criticism over Covid-19, say analysts||The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan city of central China last December, continues to wreak havoc across the world affecting millions of people. However, experts believe that since the very beginning, the mainland has been hiding facts regarding pandemic outbreak and now shielding its premier Xi Jinping from global criticism.Dr Suvrokamal Dutta, a political and foreign policy expert, who is also an external advisor with PV Savani University, Surat, told ANI, “Had China warned the world beforehand, perhaps the situation today would have been different across the world.”Over 2.3 million people in some 210 countries are corona positive, while over 1 lakh others have succumbed to the deadly infection. “Several suspicions have been raised against China in relation to this dreaded virus across the globe which are not just assumptions but have substance behind it. Now that China is getting cornered due to the outrage, it is quite obvious that the Chinese administration is trying to save its president and make small leaders at local level scapegoats in the process which it has already started,” the analyst said.He added, “This is being done with a two-pronged strategy; one by shielding the Chinese president from global criticisms and, 2; by deflecting the blame game on China at the global level. In this mission, the mainland has been using the western press as a soft toy.”Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of BILD, a German Newspaper, responding to the Jinping’s response over the contagion spread, said, “You (Xi Jinping), your government and your scientists had known that the virus is highly infectious. But you still left the world in absolute darkness about it.”Raising questions, Reichelt wrote, “You have created an inscrutable and non-transparent China. China was known as a surveillance state and is now using it to infect the world with the deadly disease. That is your political legacy.”Earlier, western experts had warned that the administration in the mainland is trying to absolve Jinping by using a section of the western media to influence public opinion globally.“There are clear indications that China is conducting activities in a persistent and systematic manner to influence public opinion-making, academia, think tanks and political decision-making among the member states of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in general and western capital cities in particular,” Siegfried O Wolf, Director of Research at Brussels-based think tank South Asia Democratic Front, told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-administration-protecting-xi-from-global-criticism-over-covid-19-say-analysts/story-aBaVmeBwTE7EqTifEjevfK.html
19-04-2020||World||Covid-19: ‘It made a world of difference’, says UK doctor treated by ex-students||At his darkest moment with the coronavirus, Dr. Poorna Gunasekera glimpsed three rays of light.Following a severe deterioration in his Covid-19 symptoms, Gunasekera was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, southwest England, in the early hours of March 30, and three former students came to treat him.Upon entering the “red zone,” which is one step below the intensive care unit, the 57-year-old associate professor of biomedical sciences at the city’s university was put into isolation.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “It was wonderful that during that time, two of my former students, who are doctors, and another, who is a nurse, actually came and they identified themselves,” he told The Associated Press following his discharge from the hospital on April 9.His voice choked with emotion as he remembered the encounters.“It made a world of a difference to me,” he said. “I couldn’t have seen their faces, they were all in their protective things, but they came, and they not only treated me, they did some really difficult procedures ... it gave me so much strength to know that these wonderful people were actually there.” The feeling of respect was mutual.Gertrude Magama, a 45-year-old nurse from Zimbabwe who has known Gunasekera since she volunteered for one of his projects, said it was an “honor” to look after him.“I was touched when he reassured me that I was doing well when he was going through pain and discomfort,” she said. “In my eyes, he will forever be a valuable part of my future success in my nursing profession.” Gunasekera, better known to friends and colleagues as PG, grew up in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and led the Guard of Honour accorded to Queen Elizabeth II during her visit in October 1981.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage He came to the UK in 1999 on a Commonwealth scholarship to study for a Master’s at University College London and has been in the academic field ever since, and at Plymouth since 2012.Medical knowledge doesn’t necessarily bestow wisdom. He readily admits he underestimated his deterioration, even when his temperature soared above 39 C (102 F) and he lost 6.5 kilograms (around 14 pounds) with diarrhea. While people infected with the coronavirus often experience mild or moderate symptoms, possible complications like pneumonia can put their lives at risk.“As he is a doctor and trains doctors on a daily basis, I trusted him and gave him the benefit of doubt when he told me he was slowly starting to feel better,” said his 26-year-old daughter Saki. “In hindsight, I think he was just trying to channel crazy levels of positive thinking so as to calm both his and my own worries.” Eventually, Saki, who had mild symptoms along with her boyfriend George, “decided to overrule” her father and had him rushed to hospital. It was a decision he acknowledges ultimately saved his life.Gunasekera spent about a week hooked up to oxygen supplies as his lungs had taken a “battering.” Something curious occurred to Gunasekera on the “crucial” third or fourth day. He entered a pain-free phase “where the body stopped kind of talking to me” and his sense of proprioception — the awareness of one’s body in space — switched off too.“I wouldn’t call it levitation, but I lost senses,” he said. “It was the most peaceful state in life I’ve ever been in. It was almost as if some authority up there said ‘stop worrying’ and it was so convincing I actually stopped worrying.” He thinks it was a taste of nirvana, the ultimate goal of Buddhism when individuals enjoy indescribable peace.“It was a state of absolute bliss,” he said.Yet the worrying resurfaced as his health improved and a few days later, Gunasekera was moved to a ward with three other recovering patients: “I was the baby of the bunch.” On their first day, none could speak, since they were all hooked up to oxygen. But on the second day, an 80-year-old ex-Royal Navy officer, known only as Robert, single-handedly raised their spirits.“He was a piece of pure magic,” Gunasekera said.All four shared the same guilt of becoming new sources of outbreaks.“All of us were ready for a kind of stigmatization that could come and we understood it,” he said. “If the roles were reversed, I’d be careful of meeting someone who has been diagnosed as COVID-positive even if it was a long time ago.” Now he can’t wait to see his new partner, Hayley, and her family again after his 14-day self-isolation is over. He’s recuperating with Saki and George and his dog Barney in the tiny village of Filham in south Devon, and reflecting on how fortunate he is to get a second chance, unlike so many thousands of others. Britain has already had more than 15,000 people die in the pandemic and expects eventually to have the worst death toll in Europe.Gunasekera is especially admiring of the current generation of medical practitioners, of whom he has taught many, for being so much more “humble” than his.“Having gone through medical school myself, I remember we came out with this feeling that we are God’s gift to humanity, we were the supreme beings,” he said.The new generation, he said, are “taught to acknowledge that there is a limit to our knowledge, and that there is so much uncertainty out there.” Gunasekera hopes a more “cohesive society” will emerge that relates betterto the struggles of Britain’s National Health Service and that bridges the gap between generations.“Social distancing, though it’s physical distancing, the beauty is it’s brought emotional connections,” he said.“This is almost a reset button that society needed and perhaps we’ll come out of this a far better society, far better group of people than ever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-it-made-a-world-of-difference-says-uk-doctor-treated-by-ex-students/story-mgOZstOqQCi3q7LlZxypeP.html

It includes photos of ballistic missile launchers, nuclear sites and vessels recommended for blacklisting.The panel made 39 recommendations to the Security Council, including on the blacklisting of 14 vessels.It said one vessel is registered in Sierra Leone and six were previously registered in the West African nation. Two are North Korean, one is Chinese, one Vietnamese, one was formerly registered in Togo, one was formerly registered in St. Kitts and Nevis, and the flag of one is unknown.China has been neighboring North Korea’s largest trading partner and has been considered critical to enforcing UN sanctions.The panel said the Chinese-flagged Yun Hong 8 — which it recommended for sanctions — made at least 10 port calls between February and October 2019 at the North Korean port of Nampo and delivered refined petroleum. It was also observed during that period receiving refined petroleum from other foreign-flagged vessels, which an unidentified UN member state said was likely for delivery to the DPRK, the experts said.China responded to the panel’s inquiry about the vessel by questioning “the serious lack of accuracy of the relevant information,” the report said.China’s Foreign Ministry and UN ambassador have said the country is implementing the sanctions.A photo in the report provided by an unnamed UN member state shows multiple coal-laden DPRK-flagged vessels at anchor near Lianyungang, China, which the panel said is being used to conduct ship-to-ship coal transfers. The panel said it is investigating a Vietnam-flagged vessel, the Phuong Linh 269, suspected of delivering coal originating in North Korea to the Chinese port of Qisha on multiple occasions.Despite a UN ban, the panel said North Korea’s coal exports increased in 2019. It cited an unnamed member state saying the DPRK exported 3.7 million tons of coal between January and August 2019, with an estimated value of $370 million.The Security Council also banned the export of earth and stone, which includes sand.The panel said an unidentified member state reported that a substantial sand-export operation from the DPRK to China has been carried out since May 2019 with over 100 illicit shipments involving at least 1 million tons of sand worth at least USD 22 million.“China responded that it attached great importance to the clues provided by the panel in relation to the smuggling of sand originating in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” but was unable to confirm that the sand had been transported to Chinese ports, the report said.As for the import of refined petroleum products, which is limited 500,000 barrels annually, the panel said the addition of larger foreign-flagged tankers delivering to the DPRK has expanded its illicit imports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-want-to-blacklist-14-ships-over-north-korea-sanctions/story-2Ymfn9QxXRrol7CUGjxsfP.html

Lauderdale to St. Louis (both in the US) on Thursday.Bob Pitts was surprised to find himself as the only passenger on the flight, and documented the entire experience in a series of video which he later gave to NBC News.He called it a “very, very, very unique experience” and recorded the conversation with the crew “as there was nobody to talk to”, according to NBC News.Pitts was headed to St Louis for his mother’s wake. He travelled in the flight wearing a bandanna as a face covering.The crew thanked Pitts “for coming along with us”, and even presented the safety instructions, but in a humourous way. Pitts was asked to wear his seatbelt, and ensure that the tray table is in its most “uncomfortable” position, according to the NBC report based on his videos.He was personally greeted by the flight attendant and pilot.The coronavirus pandemic has hit the aviation sector very hard. International seat capacity has dropped by almost 80 per cent from a year ago and half the world’s airplanes are in storage, suggesting the aviation industry may take years to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.Carriers including United Airlines Holdings Inc and Air New Zealand Ltd have warned they are likely to emerge from the crisis smaller, and there are fears others may not survive.Planemakers are looking at drastic cuts in wide-body production amid a slump in demand for the industry’s largest jetliners, manufacturing and supplier sources said.Deliveries of long-range jets, such as the Boeing Co 777 or 787 and Airbus SE A350 or A330, have been particularly badly hit as airlines seek deferrals and many withhold progress payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-he-was-the-lone-passenger-on-a-us-flight-got-vip-treatment/story-if167vGGdTxU4h9xbvhucM.html
19-04-2020||World||Australia demands coronavirus enquiry, adding to pressure on China||Australia on Sunday added to growing pressure on China over its handling of the novel coronavirus, questioning its transparency and demanding an international investigation into the origins of the virus and how it spread.The coronavirus is believed to have emerged in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. It has spread around the world infecting some 2.3 million people and killing nearly 160,000 of them, according to Reuters calculations. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, said her concern about China’s transparency was at a “a very high point”.“The issues around the coronavirus are issues for independent review, and I think that it is important that we do that,” Payne told ABC television. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“In fact, Australia will absolutely insist on that.”Australia has managed to get its epidemic under control before it strained its public health system, reporting 53 new cases on Sunday. They took its total to 6,586, according to the health ministry data. There have been 71 deaths in Australia. The rate of increase in new cases has been below 1% for seven consecutive days - much lower than in many other countries.Payne’s call for an enquiry into the outbreak comes at time of tense ties between her country and its most important trading partner.Relations have deteriorated amid Australian accusations of Chinese meddling in domestic affairs and concern about what Australia sees as China’s growing, and undue, influence in the Pacific region.“My trust in China is predicated in the long-term,” Payne said. “My concern is around transparency and ensuring that we are able to engage openly.”Australia’s call for an investigation comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has been stepping up his criticism of China.Trump and his senior aides have also accused China of a lack of transparency after the coronavirus broke out. On Saturday, Trump said China should face consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the pandemic.China dismisses such criticism saying it has been open about the outbreak and in warning the world about it.‘Didn’t help’Last week, Trump suspended aid to the World Health Organization accusing it of being “China-centric”.The Geneva-based agency rejected that but Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt also criticised it, saying some of its response to the coronavirus was not helpful.“What we saw from some officials in Geneva, we think was a response which didn’t help the world,” Hunt told a briefing.“We have done well because we made our own decisions as a country.” Australia went against the advice of the WHO on Feb. 1 and banned people arriving from China. It later closed its borders and imposed strict curbs on public movements.Hunt said Australia was winning in its campaign against the coronavirus but had not yet won.“We have to focus on containment and capacity,” he said.Neighbouring New Zealand, which adopted one the world’s harshest lockdowns even before reporting a first death, has been even more successful in suppressing coronavirus. There were four new confirmed cases in New Zealand on Sunday, bringing the total of infections to 1,098. Eleven people have died, health ministry data showed.“I know it hasn’t been easy, but it has been working,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a televised briefing. She said her government will meet on Monday to decide whether to ease social distancing restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-demands-coronavirus-enquiry-adding-to-pressure-on-china/story-gIkLFtufvhlRqhpKzORWYJ.html
19-04-2020||World||‘Covid-19 virus cannot be man-made’, Wuhan virology lab chief denies it originated from institute||A premier Chinese virology laboratory in Wuhan, which is in the eye of the storm for allegedly being the source of the novel coronavirus, has for the first time refuted the charge, including those of US President Donald Trump, that the deadly virus originated from his lab before it spread across the world and wreaked havoc.China has come under increasing global pressure over lack of transparency in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far infected over 2,333,160 people and claimed more than 160,790 lives across the world.President Trump on Saturday said his administration was looking into reports that the novel coronavirus “escaped” from a Wuhan laboratory before it spread to the world. “We’re looking at it, a lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense,” Trump told the media when asked if there was an investigation into whether the coronavirus disease escaped from a lab in China’s Covid-19 ground-zero city of Wuhan. Ever since the virus came to light in Wuhan in December last year, speculation has been rife on whether the viral strain originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) or from its nearby Huanan Seafood Market. The WIV, specifically its P4 laboratory, is equipped to handle dangerous viruses.Though the laboratory denied the rumours in a statement in February, its director Yuan Zhiming, in a first media interview, rejected the rumours that his institute is the original source of Covid-19. “We know what kind of research is going at the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples. There is no way that virus came from us,” he told the state-run CGTN TV channel. “We have a strict regulatory regimen. We have code of conduct for research so we are confident of that,” the director said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe said since the Institute of Virology and the P4 lab is in Wuhan, “people can’t help but make associations”. Referring to US allegations, Yuan said it is unfortunate that some people are “deliberately misleading” people without having any “evidence or knowledge”. “This is entirely based on speculation. Part of the purpose is to confuse people and interfere with our anti-epidemic and scientific activities. They may have achieved their goal in some way but as a scientist and science and technology manager, I know it is impossible,” he said.The virus “cannot be man-made”, Yuan said, noting that there is no evidence to prove that Covid-19 is artificial. “Besides some scientists believe that to synthesise a virus requires extraordinary intelligence and workload. So never believed that we humans have the capability at this time to create such a virus,” he said.Yuan said after the virus broke out, his institute shared the genome sequence of Covid-19 and the latest research on the animal model Research and Development (R&D) with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN. “As for the institute of virology and the institute of laboratory animal science, we are first in the world to build animal models. After all conspiracy theories are not widespread,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cannot-be-man-made-wuhan-virology-lab-chief-deniescovid-19-virus-originated-from-institute/story-2ZvvnGJjTXAc3Loegq9e3K.html
19-04-2020||World||Epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, America’s new hero amid Covid-19 pandemic||Move over, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. There is a new feisty super senior in Washington who is captivating American hearts. Anthony Fauci is everywhere these days -- not just as the straight-talking coronavirus point man at President Donald Trump’s daily pandemic briefings but on T-shirts, coffee mugs and, yes, even donuts. Indeed, for many, the diminutive 79-year-old epidemiologist with a heavy Brooklyn accent is the country’s new hero -- a no-nonsense scientist speaking truth to a terrified nation led by a president who sometimes has a loose grasp of the facts. Nick Semeraro, owner of Donuts Delite in Rochester, New York, is just one of the business owners paying tribute to the doctor -- and simultaneously cashing in on Fauci-mania. Semeraro is churning out donuts that feature a picture of Fauci on edible paper where the hole should be -- his way of honoring the government’s top infectious disease expert. “I’ve never met a guy so admired by so many people. I have never heard one negative comment about him,” Semeraro told AFP. “In my opinion, he was like a cool calm voice in chaos,” he said of Fauci’s behavior at Trump’s daily coronavirus briefings, which can morph from a recounting of scientific facts into something more like a campaign rally. Semeraro said demand for his treats is so high that he has had to open up extra telephone lines, and is now shipping the Fauci donuts across the country.‘In Fauci We Trust’ Fauci’s craggy, bespectacled face is showing up elsewhere, too: on T-shirts with the slogan “In Fauci We Trust” and on coffee mugs with the line “Keep calm and wash your hands.” Americans can even buy Fauci socks and candles.  Online marketplace Etsy now offers more than 3,000 items dedicated to the doctor, who has been in the public eye for decades. On Facebook, the “Dr Anthony Fauci Fan Club” has more than 79,000 members. A video game called “Fauci’s Revenge” has lasers shooting out of his eyes to help defeat the virus. And in the US capital, one restaurant is selling the “Fauci Pouchy” -- cocktails in a pouch with a straw, for pickup and delivery, of course, in these days of the Great Lockdown. The original is made with vodka, lemonade, elderflower and grapefruit juice. “They’re selling out like crazy,” said Rohit Malhotra, beverage director at Capo Italian Deli in Washington, which has a backroom speakeasy. “Our highest was around 300 in a day.” ‘Sense and Science’Probably no one expected this soft-spoken man who first rose to prominence during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s to become a pop culture icon. With his frequent White House appearances, Fauci has been “propelled into everyone’s consciousness,” said Robert Thompson, an expert on television and popular culture at Syracuse University in New York. Fauci is all over social media, giving live interviews in his raspy voice on Snapchat, answering questions from basketball star Stephen Curry on Instagram and talking to late night funnyman Trevor Noah on YouTube. Many Americans like Fauci because of his direct way of explaining a world that has been transformed by the pandemic. He is often in the excruciating position of having to gently correct things Trump says as the president stands next to him, glowering. “In a moment of crisis like this, Americans are desperate for heroes,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “Even in a difficult political environment, Fauci has insisted on speaking the truth -- even with an angry president standing besides him,” said Zelizer. For Thompson, “he seems to be talking sense and science.” ‘God bless his soul’ Tony Mastrangelo, who drove three hours to buy Fauci donuts in Rochester, said the doctor “is very honest and doesn’t spin anything a certain way. He doesn’t have an agenda which I think is awesome.” “He reminds me of my grandpa. God bless his soul. He was a little Italian guy who was just honest. And that’s how I think Fauci is,” said Mastrangelo. But Fauci has also earned himself enemies among US conservatives for correcting Trump. He has been the target of insults on social media, which led the government to boost the security around him. Trump himself retweeted a tweet with a #FireFauci hashtag, but said later he has confidence in him and called him a “fantastic guy.” Amid all the love and hate, Fauci remains stoic. When asked about a petition drive to have him declared People magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2020, he replied: “When they show this to me at my age, I say, ‘Where were you when I was 30?’“ So far, more than 18,000 people have signed the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epidemiologist-anthony-fauci-america-s-new-hero-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-ywjhKO7kndz5VLNDJChUgN.html
19-04-2020||World||Schools, shops re-open across Europe as Covid-19 cases plateau, but experts warn caution||People reading in downtown Rome, children going to elementary schools in Demark, Italians returning to bookstores and Austria allowing gardening stores to sell flowers again - life seems to return to normalcy as an initial sign of hope and optimism that the first wave of Europe’s devastating pandemic is coming to an end.After originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last December, the novel coronavirus infection that spread to at least 185 countries and regions across the world, killing over one lakh people and infecting more than 2 million others, has almost brought the daily lives to a standstill.However, a group of authors, including William Booth, Chico Harlan, James McAuley, Loveday Morris, and Michael Birnbaum say in their The Washington Post article that from Ireland to Greece, officials are seeing hopeful signs that the contagious infections have begun to plateau or recede after reaching a peak, further pointing to intensive care beds that are now started registering daily reduction in the number of new hospitalisations.In Paris, Milan, and Madrid, hospitals and staff that were stressed to their limits just a few weeks ago, as thousands of coughing, fevered, breathless patients surged through their doors, are now reporting empty beds in their ICUs, the article read.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Severo Ochoa Hospital in Madrid made international news with images last month of sick patients sleeping on the floor, waiting to be seen by a doctor. Now there are a few spare beds in Spain, the authors said the Post.But it’s not yet time to completely let up, officials caution.Hans Kluge, World Health Organization director for Europe, said “the storm cloud” of the pandemic “still hangs heavily over the European region.”Members of the European Union and Britain account for almost two-thirds of the 150,000 deaths recorded worldwide.At the same time, infectious disease experts also opine that Europe’s effort to slow the pandemic -- instituting quarantines across the continent more widespread and draconian than those seen during the plague in the Middle Ages -- has worked.“There is light at the end of the tunnel. But we are now at both a delicate and a dangerous stage in this pandemic,” Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, told the country when he announced that its lockdown would continue for another three weeks at least.In Italy, there is a broad consensus that the emergency phase is starting to relent after a two-month period wherein more than 20,000 people died. Health authorities further reported that the number of patients in intensive care has fallen 25 per cent from the peak two weeks ago.Martin Hirsch, the director of the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, the largest public hospital system in Europe, told the Post that in the Paris region, the hardest hit by the coronavirus, the total number of cases had stabilized for the first time since the start of the pandemic. “We are now in what we’ve called the ‘high plateau,’ “ Hirsch said, “which is to say a stabilization at a very high level, and always with an increase in the number of cases in our geriatric units, which face difficult situations. But we can share several encouraging signs.”As Spain finished its first month of confinement this week, Fernando Simon, who heads the Emergency Health Response for the Health Ministry, said quickly adopting social distancing and personal hygiene measures following the WHO’s declaration of the pandemic brought down the spread of COVID-19.However, Angela Hernandez Puente, vice-secretary general of Madrid’s Doctors Union, noted that the end to the contagious outbreak, according to her, may not be necessarily so close or what is considered to be a continual, linear decline. “It may be more like a zigzag, up and down.” “We’ve always seen light at the end of the tunnel, but the question is: At what cost?” she said, adding, “How much suffering in terms of the number of lives and the efforts on the part of health professionals?”Reiterating her words, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also stressed, “But it is thin ice.”“It is really a situation where caution is the order of the day and not overconfidence,” she opined over the first tentative steps taken by her people toward normalcy.

19-04-2020||World||Hungry, jobless Americans turning to food banks to survive Covid-19 pandemic||American families slammed by the coronavirus pandemic are turning more and more to food banks to get by, waiting hours for donations in lines of cars stretching as far as the eye can see.And with 22 million people out of work seemingly overnight as business after business closes under the Great Lockdown, these charities feeding hungry and scared people fear the day will come when they cannot cope with the tsunami of demand.On Tuesday, for instance, some 1,000 cars lined up at a distribution center set up in Pennsylvania by the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Demand for its bags of food soared nearly 40 percent in March.At eight centers like that one, some 227 tonnes of food were placed in the trunks of cars of families suddenly unable to put meals on the table, said the organization’s vice president Brian Gulish.“A lot of people are utilizing our service for the first time. They’ve never turned to a food bank before,” said Gulish. So they do not know there is a network of 350 distribution points in southwest Pennsylvania.“That’s why those lines are so long. Because they don’t know that network that we have,” Gulish added.All over America, from New Orleans to Detroit, people abruptly stripped of a paycheck are flocking to food banks -- sad scenes of desperation among people waiting for their small share of stimulus money included in the $2.2 trillion emergency relief package approved by Congress last month. Perhaps the most dramatic picture of some Americans’ new food insecurity unfolded April 9 in San Antonio, Texas, where a staggering 10,000 cars showed up at one food bank, with some families arriving the night before to just sit and wait.“We have gone for months without work,” a woman who gave her name only as Alana said at a food distribution center in Chelsea in suburban Boston.“I find a lady yesterday with a 15-day-old baby, a newborn. The husband is not working, she has two more kids. She was having no food in her house,” said Alana.Everywhere, food bank officials say their needs in the pandemic era have skyrocketed all of a sudden -- by 30 percent, for example, at a network in Akron, Ohio.“We built a supply chain over the years that would serve a certain anticipated need for food. Ramping that up 30 percent overnight is nearly impossible,” said Dan Flowers, CEO of the Akron-Canton Regional Foodbank.In part this is because the food banks are caught up in the maelstrom that has hit the US food industry.With restaurants closed because of the lockdown, Americans are stocking up on everything in grocery stores, which no longer can make as many product donations as they usually do. Ditto for restaurants that often donate surplus food to homeless shelters. Fortunately, the US food industry is in fact making donations.Food banks including 200 local branches of an organization called Feeding America are even getting special kinds of loads to hand out.US food giant JM Smucker, maker of many well-known products such as Folgers coffee, is a regular donor and has sent extra pallets of food to banks in Ohio. And a distillery called Ugly Dog in Michigan dispatched a truckload of hand sanitizing gel made from residual alcohol and packed in pint bottles that normally hold booze, said Flowers. Worn out ‘ Cash donations are also coming in, ranging from anonymous people to the likes of Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, who donated $100 million to Feeding America.“If it wasn’t for that, these food banks would not be able to meet this demand,” said Flowers.The Food Bank For New York City, a major one in the Big Apple, is ordering higher volume than it normally does, said Zanita Tisdale, its director of member engagement.“We know if we’re going to go back in a week the cost may have increased significantly or the turnaround time for getting that product to our warehouse may have extended exponentially,” she said.As supply chains get more complex and the legions of desperate families grow, there is the issue of those manning the food banks, who are simply exhausted after weeks of toil.“Our staff is worn out. They’ve been working so hard. We’re all ready for this to end,” said Flowers.After a month of all this frenetic work, the food banks are holding up, at least for now. But the future -- like for so much of the new world created by the pandemic -- is uncertain.“The supply is still good, but a month from now we don’t know,” said Gulish.The relief plan passed by Congress includes $850 million for food banks and Flowers says he expects that cash to start flowing in June.“I think we’ll get back on track then. I’m mostly concerned about the next six to eight weeks,” said Flowers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungry-jobless-americans-turning-to-food-banks-to-survive-covid-19-pandemic/story-2OLy6bktMqr6hxdnIgYtjP.html
19-04-2020||World||China declares Wuhan low-risk area despite new Covid-19 cases being reported in country||China has classified the coronavirus epicentre Wuhan as a low-risk area, days after it revised the city’s death toll by 50 per cent, even as 16 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the country, health officials said on Sunday. According to the risk criteria defined in a guideline issued by China’s State Council, cities, counties and districts with no newly confirmed cases in the last 14 days are categorised as low-risk areas.Those with fewer than 50 cases or those with over 50 but without a concentrated outbreak are classified as mid-risk areas, and those with over 50 cases as well as a concentrated outbreak are classified as high-risk areas. China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Sunday that 16 new confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported in the country on Saturday, with nine imported cases and seven local transmissions. The death toll remained at 4,632 as no new fatalities were reported on Saturday, it said. The overall confirmed cases in China had reached 82,735 by Saturday, including 1,041 patients who were still being treated, 77,062 people who were discharged after recovery, and 4,632 people who died of the disease. The NHC said the total number of imported cases climbed to 1,575. Another 44 new asymptomatic cases were reported on Saturday, the NHC said, adding that 999 asymptomatic cases, including 186 from abroad, were still under medical observation. Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged in December last year and spread to the world like wildfire, has been classified as low-risk area, 12 days after lifting the lockdown over the city of 11 million people, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The Wuhan municipal authorities on Friday revised the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and casualties abruptly amid criticism from the US and several other countries for its alleged cover-up and under-reporting of the cases. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman on Friday denied any cover up and accused the US of attempting to divert public attention.“I want to emphasise that the revision of the data regarding infectious disease is an internationally accepted practice,” Zhao Lijian told a media briefing, defending the sharply upward revision of figures. He said in the early stage of the outbreak there were some late reports, omissions, and inaccurate information. “But there has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment,” Zhao said. As of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was increased by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869 and national death toll to 4,632 people. The low risk classification also followed as the virus cases and deaths abated in the city as per official notifications. While declaring Wuhan as a low-risk area China has strengthened nucleic acid testing to detect coronavirus for people leaving Wuhan. The test is required before people resume work, production or study elsewhere, it said. Those who are set to work as teachers, medical workers or service providers at public places after leaving Wuhan should all undergo nucleic acid testing before leaving, which is free of charge, noted the circular issued by a State Council inter-agency task force. Others leaving Wuhan are encouraged to take nucleic acid testing on a voluntary basis and pay testing fees, the report said. By the end of Friday, the central province of Hubei, which administers Wuhan, had 76 low-risk cities and counties and none with high risk or medium risk, Xinhua report said. Hubei with over 56 million population remained under lockdown along with Wuhan from January 23.

That does not mean, however, that Maze isn’t responsible for the attack, according to Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emisoft.“The group could simply be A/B testing alternative negotiating strategies to see whether permitting companies to control the release of information, at least during the early stages, results in better outcomes,” Callow said in an email. “At this point in time, groups are likely not finding it so easy to extort money from companies as many are financially distressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”The alleged targets of Maze have included the city of Pensacola in Florida, cybersecurity insurance provider Chubb Ltd. and Canadian construction company Bird Construction Inc., according to various media reports. The Maze group has claimed to post files from all three companies on its website.In January, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an alert warning to U.S. companies about the Maze tactic of threatening to release company information, CyberScoop reported, citing an advisory it obtained.Cognizant shares have declined 13% this year, compared with the 11% drop in the S&P 500 Index.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-services-giant-cognizant-attacked-by-maze-ransomware/story-yXNMwl29vX30tUl8PA0MiN.html
19-04-2020||World||Japan Covid-19 domestic cases cross 10,000||Japanese health ministry said Sunday that 568 new cases of the coronavirus were reported the day before, bringing a domestic total to 10,361. A combined total including 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year came to 11,073, with 174 deaths.The number of cases is still relatively small compared to the U.S. and Europe, but that’s only as many as Japan’s limited testing has detected and actual infections are believed to be far more widespread.Japan has finally started setting up additional testing centers in Tokyo and elsewhere, allowing primary care doctors to send suspected patients directly to testing stations rather than having them go through public health centers to screen eligibility, an earlier requirement that had prevented and delayed testing and treatment of many people.Experts have noted that their strategy of going after clusters to trace infections is no longer effective to keep up with the surging cases and more tests are needed.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday expanded a state of emergency, which was limited to Tokyo and six other urban areas, to all of Japan, in a bid to prevent further spread of the virus nationwide amid concerns that hospitals are already overburdened with influx of patients.It took two months for the cases to reach 1,000 since the first case was detected in mid-January, but the spread of the infections has accelerated in recent weeks and the number doubled from around 5,000 in just 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-covid-19-domestic-cases-cross-10-000/story-uMy3N6xYrxkzLHTMDQldNI.html
19-04-2020||World||China tests thousands to calculate true spread of coronavirus||When Tiger Ye caught the coronavirus in January, his mother and grandmother nursed him back to health. Later that month, both women developed fevers, but with Wuhan’s hospitals overflowing they chose instead to bear it out at home.Months later, with China’s epidemic appearing under control, the pair took a blood test that confirmed they had in fact contracted and fought off the virus. But they were never counted in the country’s official tally of more than 82,000 infected and nearly 5,000 dead.“They are lucky to have recovered all by themselves,” said Ye.Now, amid accusations that China has under-reported its virus data, the nation is embarking upon a program that could capture the true scale of their outbreak. If undertaken globally, it could find millions more infections than the 2.1 million currently detected.The effort, called a serological survey, involves researchers taking blood samples from a representative group of people to see if they have generated antibodies to fight the virus, a sign they’ve been infected. Scientists then extrapolate from there the magnitude of the pathogen’s spread in the broader population. Such studies could also shed light on how the virus transmitted among people, including what role seemingly less-affected groups, like children, have played in its dispersion.China Boosts Virus Death Tally, Rejects Accusations of Cover UpMore DeathsChina has refuted charges from U.S. intelligence officials that it concealed the extent of its outbreak, although multiple revisions to its epidemic data have fueled mistrust both domestically and from other countries. This week, the country added more than 1,200 deaths to its official count, including people who died at home without being tested and late reporting from overwhelmed hospitals.While China has a long history of questionable economic statistics, under-reporting when it comes to the coronavirus is an issue across the world. New York City recently added more than 3,700 previously unreported deaths to its count, and the World Health Organization says many countries will likely have to review their numbers. The lack of widespread testing is one of the main reasons. Besides people like Ye’s mother and grandmother -- who choose not to or aren’t able to go to hospital -- many countries simply don’t have enough testing kits to detect all their cases.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAnother significant factor behind under-counting is the existence of a puzzling group that show no outward signs of illness, known as asymptomatic infections. Such patients are unlikely to be tested because they have no idea they’re even sick. Early indications are that asymptomatic carriers have played a key role in the pandemic spreading as wide and fast as it has.China’s Data on Symptom-Free Cases Shows Most Never Get SickNo SymptomsEven after bringing its official count of new infections to zero, China is still detecting hundreds of asymptomatic cases by testing people who’ve come into contact with infected patients, showing that the virus hasn’t been eradicated even as the country’s biggest cities -- including Wuhan, where the pathogen first emerged -- start resuming normal activity.“In all systems, cases are under-reported,” said Antoine Flahault, a public health professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. “Some infections are asymptomatic and cannot be detected by the health care system, some test results come back negative when the person is actually infected, and some can be mis-classified as cases of pneumonia or influenza without any proper testing procedures.”As China’s Virus Cases Reach Zero, Experts Warn of Second WaveAs countries that have quelled their first outbreaks worry that the highly-contagious virus will return in subsequent waves, the survey’s findings could help policymakers plan a better defense for its resurgence, including ways to normalize economic activity while controlling infection. China is undertaking serological surveys in a number of regions, Feng Luzhao, a researcher with the country’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in Beijing on April 2.Group ImmunityWhile whole populations are unlikely to have mass immunity, some groups -- children, or older people -- could be found to have group immunity, allowing economically-costly social distancing measures to be tailored to minimize disruption.Other countries are making similar efforts on a smaller scale: New York is testing medical and other essential workers for antibodies, while Italy has tested everyone in Vò, a small town of 3,300 near Venice. Their aim is to create a full “epidemiological picture” of the outbreak, and findings indicate that many were infected but had no symptoms.As the outbreak’s original epicenter and the only major country at a mature enough stage of its epidemic to start concertedly looking back, China’s serological effort will be closely tracked by the global scientific community.In Wuhan, investigators are blood testing a random group of 11,000 people who lived in the city for no less than two weeks between January and March.Those participating in the survey, which includes all members of chosen households and people like police officers, community workers and taxi drivers, take tests for the virus and for antibodies generated to fight it, according to local newspaper Hubei Daily.The survey’s findings will be used to “inform adjustment in response strategies,” state media CCTV reported.China has done this before. In 2003, researchers embarked on a serological survey after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, outbreak, which sickened 8,000 people and killed almost 800, mostly in Asia.The study conducted in southern Guangdong province, where SARS emerged, involved 130 patients diagnosed with the disease along with 119 close contacts and 100 healthy people. It revealed that most of those who have been infected with the SARS virus developed long-lasting antibodies that protected them and likely those around them against future infection.How Herd Immunity Works, Offering Key to Pandemic’s End: GraphicIn 2006, China’s health authorities also launched a nationwide survey of 79,000 people for hepatitis B. It found that the total number of children infected fell by 80 million since 1992 thanks to mass vaccination efforts, and there were still 93 million carriers concentrated in the country’s western hinterland.In an interview with state news agency Xinhua in mid-January, Wang Chen, the dean of Peking Union Medical College, described a serological survey as “the most pressing task” for the country, because it will help policymakers figure out if the coronavirus will disappear like SARS did 17 years ago, or is here to stay like the flu.It could also determine if the virus can linger in people for a long time the way hepatitis B does in those without sufficient immunity. This tendency to “linger” could be why Korean doctors have found what they termed a “re-activation” of the coronavirus in 51 recovered patients.Many ChallengesDespite its urgency, serological surveys are challenging to conduct right, especially in populations as vast as China’s.A key determinant of the survey’s accuracy is whether the sample of people chosen best represents the population at large, said Jeffery Gilbert, an epidemiologist on the Covid-19 incident management team at the World Health Organization.“China is a mix of European country-sized provinces with very different population densities,” Gilbert said. “Without enormous amounts of testing throughout the country, a full picture of China is exceedingly challenging to get.”China has disclosed that it is testing 11,000 in Wuhan but not how many people are involved in other provinces and cities. China’s CDC didn’t respond to questions from Bloomberg on the survey.Another challenge lies in the antibody test employed. Western biotech companies have launched tests that have been found to be inaccurate after countries had ordered millions.Biotechs Are Battling to Make First Good Blood Test For Covid-19“It must be highly specific and sensitive – that is, it must identify only SARS-CoV-2 and not cross-react with antibodies from other coronavirus infections,” said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, referring to the scientific name of the new coronavirus.An average person’s blood could also have antibodies for common viruses like influenza, which is from the same coronavirus family as SARS-CoV-2.This difficulty in differentiating antibodies is what’s stopping South Korea, which has also shown success in curbing its outbreak, from kicking off its serological survey. The country’s CDC told Bloomberg it is testing whether certain antibodies are reacting only to the new virus, and not others.The agency won’t initiate a serological survey until researchers have verified the antibody test’s specificity, it said.“If the Chinese test is validated and meets sensitivity and specificity standards, then the results will be a valid reflection of previous infection in the community,” Heymann said.Beyond the true number of infections, a serological survey will be able to ascertain the exposure of various groups to the virus. It could also yield insight into the susceptibility of those with previous medical conditions.‘Help Us’“One of the burning questions has been about younger people and how much of a part they played in the virus’s spread,” the WHO’s Gilbert said. While official infection tallies skew toward older people, the survey could find that children were just as infected but their immune systems acted more quickly to fight the virus, preventing serious symptoms from developing, he said.Should Schools Close to Fight Virus? These Places Say NoHotly-debated questions, such as whether school closures are necessary to stem the virus’s spread, could be answered definitively with these sorts of findings.“A lot of people are waiting with anticipation to learn more,” Gilbert said, “It will help us develop or change guidance for other countries where they haven’t been hit so hard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-thousands-to-calculate-true-spread-of-coronavirus/story-0YbLqoZaAE2LXhsOr0dIaJ.html
19-04-2020||World||‘China is number one’: Trump claims China’s Covid-19 fatalities way ahead of US||President Donald Trump has expressed his doubts over the official Chinese figures on the number of deaths in their country due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, claiming that the fatalities were way ahead of the US. Trump’s comments come two days after another 1,300 fatalities were added to the official count in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started. The revision puts China’s overall death toll to more than 4,600. “We are not number one; China is number one just so you understand,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Saturday. “They are way ahead of us in terms of death. It’s not even close.” According to Trump, when highly-developed healthcare systems of the UK, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain had high fatality rates, it was O.33 in China. The president asserted that the actual number was much more than the official Chinese death toll figures, which he said were “unrealistic”. “You know it, I know it and they know it, but you don’t want to report it. Why?” he asked. “You will have to explain that. Someday I will explain it.” He also highlighted that on a per-capita basis, the mortality rate in the US was far lower than other nations of Western Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-death-toll-way-ahead-of-us-says-prez-trump/story-8lTrH5OS2q6SwSUlpxGv4L.html
19-04-2020||World||UK health service counts the cost of funding cuts amid Covid-19 crisis||Britain’s state-run National Health Service, described by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the country’s “beating heart” after saving his life, is creaking under the strain of coronavirus after a decade of underinvestment. While millions across the country take to the streets each week to applaud cherished health workers, doctors and nurses are warning that they are being left to fight the virus without proper protective equipment.That, along with insufficient Covid-19 testing across Britain, is blamed by experts on a decade of underinvestment following the global financial crisis.“The UK National Health Service is acknowledged to have suffered from a funding crisis since 2010,” Elias Mossialos, professor of health policy at the London School of Economics, told AFP.“NHS expenditure is 7.6 percent of (Britain’s) GDP, which is approximately the same as it was in 2012.”Mossialos said a slowdown in annual NHS budget increases “has hindered the preparedness and response to coronavirus”.£34 billion more Ahead of their general election victory in December, Johnson’s Conservatives pledged to boost NHS funding by £34 billion ($41.9 billion, 38.4 billion euros). But because the figure covers a four-year period until 2024, inflation could take a large bite out of the sum.The new government has also promised 50,000 more nurses through better retention and new recruits, as well as an additional 6,000 doctors. New hospitals have also been pledged, but people did not count on one being built so soon.Earlier this month, Britain opened a temporary 4,000-bed hospital to treat the most seriously ill coronavirus patients -- the Nightingale in London.While Johnson’s recent experience might prompt him to pump more money than promised into the NHS, experts say a big problem lies in Britain’s largest employer struggling to recruit staff.That could even worsen following the country’s exit from the European Union.The NHS, which claims to be Europe’s biggest employer with a staff of more than 1.3 million, currently has around 100,000 vacancies.Britain’s government has responded to the pandemic by asking doctors and nurses to come out of retirement, even if many fall into the category of being highly at risk of catching the virus.“In terms of nurses, the UK is one of very few OECD countries where the number of nurses has been going down,” said Franco Sassi, professor of international health policy at Imperial College London.The NHS suffers also from a severe shortage of beds, according to Mossialos. OECD data reveals that the UK has only 2.5 beds per 1,000 people, compared with six per 1,000 in France and eight per 1,000 in Germany, he said. The UK meanwhile has around 6.6 critical care beds per 100,000 -- around half France’s total and around fives times fewer than in Germany.NHS appreciation News bulletins show NHS nurses in good spirits, applauding and making guards of honour for patients who have beaten the virus that has so far claimed more than 15,400 lives in Britain. But the fact is that most have been left exhausted.“We will see the effect at the other side of the epidemic,” said Fiona Johnson, spokeswoman for the health think tank Nuffield Trust.“You have an exhausted workforce,” she said, noting also that many operations had been postponed to allow hospitals to deal with coronavirus patients.Britons are making a point of paying tribute to the NHS, which was set up in 1948 and has long been a cherished institution.At 1900 GMT each Thursday, people come out of their homes to show their appreciation for its staff and Britain’s other key workers, by applauding for a couple of minutes. Children are seen banging frying pans.Meanwhile, a 99-year-old British World War II veteran, Tom Moore, on Thursday completed 100 laps of his garden in a fundraising challenge for healthcare staff, raising around £20 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-service-counts-the-cost-of-funding-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-AZkzVr0o5UFzyOObdWf2dI.html
19-04-2020||World||‘Mistake is a mistake’: Trump warns China of ‘consequences’ for Covid-19 outbreak||President Donald Trump on Saturday said China should face “consequences” if it was found to have been “knowingly responsible” for the novel coronavirus outbreak.“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t, and the whole world is suffering because of it,” Trump said at the daily briefing by the White House task force on coronavirus.“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake,” he added. “But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences.”The American president offered no evidence, but conservative media and his allies have for some time now contended, again with no proof, that the virus escaped a virology lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak that last week revised its death toll by adding 50% previously unreported fatalities.There have been news reports of this lab receiving US funding and US diplomats expressing serious concerns about safety at the facility. There have also been reports in conservative media that US intelligence agencies have launched an investigation into the lab and they expect to submit a report shortly.Asked about the role of the lab, Trump told reporters Friday, “We’re looking at that. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense. They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn’t in that area. If you can believe this, that’s what they’re down to now, is bats. But that bat is not in that area. That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone. It wasn’t sold there. That bat is 40 miles away.” The origin of the pandemic is traced, by some, to a wet market (a fresh produce market) in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have been transmitted to humans.President Trump began pointing to China as the origin of the pandemic first by identifying the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus”, which fueled anti-Asian sentiments already coursing through the country. Other US officials chose to call it the “Wuhan virus”, after the city where the epidemic is believed to have started. Some US officials and Republican lawmakers attacked China alleging it was concealing the true magnitude of it outbreak; they cited intelligence reports .As the American president came under mounting criticism for his administration’s delayed and botched response to the epidemic, he went after the World Health Organization, accusing it of helping China conceal the magnitude or its outbreak and mismanaging its own response to the crisis.China has since revised its numbers upwards, by 50% in Wuhan.But US officials have sought more transparency. Trump, who had previously said China numbers are “larger” than America’s and that it has the “most” in the world, said Saturday, “China is number one, just so you understand. China is number one by a lot. It’s not even close.”“Does anybody really believe this number?” Trump said later, referring to China’s reported mortality rate of 0.33 per 100,000 people, on a chart presented at the briefing by Deborah birx, coordinator of the task force.Birx said that she had included China on the chart to show how “unrealistic”those numbers are. The US mortality rate is 11.24 per 100,000, in comparison, which is much higher in comparison to China’s reported numbers, but much lower than some of the other countries such as Belgium, which led the world with 45.2 fatalities per 100,000, followed by Spain with 42.81, and Italy with 37.64.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mistake-is-a-mistake-donald-trump-warns-china-of-consequences-for-covid-19-outbreak/story-XgTmxWy8bZwIFRT32AUwrO.html

Because I’ve seen a great disparity in this country.”“They go after Christian churches but they don’t tend to go after mosques,” he said.Ramadan, which begins at sunset on Thursday, falls a week and a half after Easter, when some Christians bucked public health regulations to attend illicit services.Asked whether he thought imams would refuse to follow social distancing orders, Trump responded: “No, I don’t think that at all.” “I am somebody that believes in faith. And it matters not what your faith is. But our politicians seem to treat different faiths very differently.”Trump has been accused of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the past and one of his first acts upon entering office was to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries.More than 700,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, forcing religious communities across the country to shutter their doors. The Islamic Society of North America, alongside Muslim medical experts, has urged the suspension of group prayers, among other gatherings.Jewish Americans were likewise forced to turn traditional Passover seders into virtual affairs when the eight-day holiday began at sundown on April 8.Despite similar measures taken across much of the Christian community, a Virginia pastor who continued to preach in defiance of stay-at-home rules died a week ago of coronavirus. And pastors at two megachurches in Florida and Louisiana have been arrested on misdemeanor charges for flouting stay-at-home orders. “The Christian faith is treated much differently than it was,” Trump added on Saturday, “and I think it’s treated very unfairly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-distancing-rules-should-be-same-for-ramadan-easter-says-donald-trump/story-sHGG95ykFJPWWG8fEIjcoJ.html

19-04-2020||World||44 suspected members of Boko Haram found dead in Chad prison: Report||A group of 44 suspected members of Boko Haram, arrested during a recent operation against the jihadist group, have been found dead in their prison cell, apparently poisoned, Chad’s chief prosecutor announced Saturday.Speaking on national television, Youssouf Tom said the 44 prisoners had been found dead in their cell on Thursday.An autopsy carried out on four of the dead prisoners revealed traces of a lethal substance that had caused heart attacks in some of the victims and severe asphyxiation in the others, he said.The dead men were among a group of 58 suspects captured during a major army operation around Lake Chad launched by President Idriss Deby Itno at the end of March.“Following the fighting around Lake Chad, 58 members of Boko Haram had been taken prisoner and sent to Ndjamena for the purposes of the investigation,” said Tom.“On Thursday morning, their jailers told us that 44 prisoners had been found dead in their cell,” Tom said, adding that he had attended the scene.“We have buried 40 bodies and sent four bodies to the medical examiner for autopsy.” An investigation was ongoing to determine exactly how the prisoners had died, he said.‘It’s horrible’ A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity told AFP that “the 58 prisoners were placed in a single cell and were given nothing to eat or drink for two days”. Mahamat Nour Ahmed Ibedou, secretary general of the Chadian Convention for the Protection of Human Rights (CTDDH), made similar accusations. Prison officials had “locked the prisoners in a small cell and refusing them food and water for three days because they were accused of belonging to Boko Haram”, Ibedou told AFP. “It’s horrible what has happened.” The government denied the allegations. “There was no ill-treatment,” Chad Justice Minister, Djimet Arabi, told AFP by telephone. “Toxic substances were found in their stomachs. Was it collective suicide or something else? We’re still looking for answers,” he said, adding that the investigation was still ongoing. One of the prisoners was transferred to hospital on Thursday, but he was “faring much better” and had rejoined “the other 13 prisoners still alive and who are doing very well,” the minister said. Major operation against Boko Haram Earlier this week, the minister told AFP the captured men had been transferred to Ndjamena on Tuesday evening and handed over to the court system for trial.The military operation against Boko Haram killed more than a thousand of the group’s militants and cost the lives of 52 soldiers, a Chadian army spokesman said. The operation ran from March 31 to April 8.It was launched in response to a devastating attack on Chadian troops on March 23 on a base at Bohoma, in the Lake Chad marshlands, that killed 98 soldiers. It was the largest one-day loss the army has ever suffered.Since then, Idriss has warned his allies in the region that Chad’s army will no longer take part in operations outside the country.The force, considered one of the best in the region, has fought Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region as part of the Joint Multinational Force with Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger.But on Friday, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said Chad remained committed to the G5 Sahel anti-jihadist force operating in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/44-suspected-members-of-boko-haram-found-dead-in-chad-prison-report/story-2OtDAMtWliuNb16B35VZ5M.html
19-04-2020||World||Europe’s Covid-19 death toll tops 100,000, protests against curbs spread in US||Coronavirus deaths surged past 100,000 in hardest-hit Europe on Saturday as hundreds of Americans frustrated by lockdown orders and egged on by President Donald Trump staged protests in several US cities.As the latest grim data emerged, performers from around the world kicked off an hours-long live-streamed concert aimed at supporting health care workers, and cultivating a sense of community in a time of crisis. The six-hour event, which includes A-listers ranging from cellist Yo-Yo Ma to award-winning teen singer Billie Eilish to the Rolling Stones, was brought together by the advocacy group Global Citizen with the World Health Organization.Worldwide, more than 2,289,500 people have tested positive for the highly contagious virus.Europe accounts for a total of 100,510 deaths -- nearly two-thirds of the 157,539 fatalities worldwide, according to an AFP tally, while nearly a quarter of deaths have come in the United States.The United States has the highest caseload of any country and by Saturday had lost some 38,000 people to the virus, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. Progress was marked in some places, with New York state reporting the lowest number of deaths in weeks, which Governor Andrew Cuomo attributed largely to social distancing. But as Americans and others around the world chafe after weeks under shelter-at-home orders, rising resentment erupted this week.Demonstrations Saturday at the capitols of states including Texas, Maryland, New Hampshire and Ohio drew hundreds of people, many waving American flags and some carrying arms, demanding a quick end to state-ordered confinement. ‘Carried away’ The spreading anti-lockdown movement drew encouragement Friday from Trump, who tweeted that three states should be “liberated” from the stay-home orders.Trump has called for a rapid return to normality to limit the devastating damage to the US economy -- while largely leaving the final decision on easing lockdowns to state officials.The US leader told reporters on Saturday that some state governors had gotten “carried away” and imposed “unreasonable” restrictions.But Americans, by two-to-one, disagree with the protesters. A new Pew survey found that most were more concerned about ending home confinement too soon rather than too late.At a White House briefing, Trump also warned that China could face consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the coronavirus outbreak which began in the city of Wuhan in December.“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t,” Trump said. “And now the whole world is suffering.”“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake,” he said. “But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences.”Trump also cast doubt on official Chinese figures showing the country has suffered just 0.33 deaths per 100,000 people.“The number’s impossible,” he said.The United States, according to a chart displayed at the briefing, has had 11.24 deaths per 100,000 people while France has had 27.92 and Spain 42.81.China’s death toll jumped to 4,632 on Friday after it raised by 50 percent the number of fatalities for Wuhan. ‘Under control’ Mounting evidence suggests that social distancing slowed the pandemic after more than half of humanity -- 4.5 billion people -- were confined to their homes.Many countries are testing only the most serious cases and the number of confirmed infections is likely to be a fraction of the true total.

19-04-2020||World||Trump warns China of consequences if found responsible for Covid-19||US President Donald Trump has warned China of consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Trump, who as expressed his disappointment over handling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by China, alleged non-transparency and initial non-cooperation with the US on this issue.“If they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences,” he told reporters at a White House news conference on Saturday. “You’re talking about, you know, potentially lives like nobody’s seen since 1917.” Trump said his relationship with China was very good till the time the deadly Covid-19 swept the world. “The relationship was good when we were signing that, but then, all of a sudden, you hear about this. So, it’s a big difference. “You know, the question was asked would you be angry at China. Well, the answer very well might be a very resounding yes, but it depends,” Trump said. The president underlined that there was a big difference between a mistake that got out of control or something done deliberately. “In either event, they should have let us go in. You know, we asked to go in very early and they didn’t want us in. I think they knew it was something bad and I think they were embarrassed,” Trump said. He claimed that China was pitching for former vice president Joe Biden, who is the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party for the presidential election. “If sleepy Joe Biden wins, China will own the United States,” Trump said, adding that his administration had gained billions of dollars from China due to his assertive trade policies. The president said the coronavirus crisis had hurt everybody. “We had the greatest economy in the world by far. China isn’t even close. Go back two months. And we’re going to keep it that way,” he said. Trump asserted that Iran was now a much different country than it was before. “When I first came in, Iran was going to take over the entire Middle East,” he said. “Right now, they just want to survive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-warns-china-of-consequences-if-found-responsible-for-covid-19/story-Abx3e6ngecVM5vp5rV5vFL.html

19-04-2020||World||After China, others may revise death tolls: WHO||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday that many countries would likely follow China in revising up their death tolls once they start getting the coronavirus crisis under control. Wuhan admitted missteps in tallying its death toll, abruptly raising the city’s count by 50%.The WHO said Wuhan had been overwhelmed by the virus, which emerged in the city in December, and the authorities had been too swamped to ensure every death and infection was properly recorded.Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead, said, “I would anticipate that many countries are going to be in a similar situation where they will have to go back and review records.” Wuhan added 1,290 deaths to its toll, raising the total to 3,869, and added a further 325 cases, bringing the cases to 50,333.Michael Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, said, “All countries will face this.”Tests mandatory for those leaving Wuhan The Chinese government ordered on Saturday that anyone in Wuhan working in certain service-related jobs must take a coronavirus test if they want to leave the city. The order comes after the central city recently lifted a 70-day lockdown that all but ended the epidemic there. China runs out of drug test candidates Several clinical trials of drugs including one of the first to be identified as a potential anti-Covid-19 medicine, remdesivir, have been cancelled in China because of the lack of testing candidates.As of Thursday, 598 coronavirus-related clinical trials had been registered in China, but some 40 had been cancelled. UN body not sure if antibodies will workThe WHO is not sure whether the presence of antibodies in blood gives full protection against reinfection with the new coronavirus, a top official said on Friday.Top emergencies expert of WHO Mike Ryan said that even if antibodies were effective there was little sign that large numbers of people had developed them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-china-others-may-revise-death-tolls-who/story-yszcTK7logKhGHVaQFHj5O.html
19-04-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak: In vaccine race, all eyes on Oxford trial’s deadline||United Kingdom’s top experts believe a trial at University of Oxford could give a crucial indication as early as next month on whether the world is on track for an early vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which,in a best-case scenario, could be developed as soon as this year.The vaccine being developed at Oxford is one of four that has progressed to clinical trials – the first stage of a vaccine being tested on humans – but it accounts for the largest sample size, making it one of the most watched among all efforts. “The crucial thing is you have to do a proper trial because safety is really important for these things. But if we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. And they may well get across the finish line by mid-August,” Oxford University professor of medicine, John Bell, told BBC.Bell is part of a task force UK’s business secretary Alok Sharma announced on Friday while earmarking millions of pounds for vaccine development.Till now, the consensus among researchers is that a vaccine is likely to take 12-18 months before it is approved for public.Bell added that the UK currently does not have the capacity to produce the amount of vaccine it needs to tackle coronavirus, but “is in a really good place” for vaccine development.“One of the reasons that we were rushing is to try and catch this wave of the disease. Because when the disease goes away there will be very, very few incident cases until we get a second wave,” Bell said in his comments to BBC.According to the World Health Organization’s April 11 compilation of vaccine development efforts, there are 70 projects that researchers are working on across the world. In addition to the Oxford University vaccine trial, the others include Moderna, Inovio and CanSino that have begun recruiting members for clinical trials. The Oxford trial will include up to 550 subjects split into several groups, far larger than any of the others. Most of these are in the first phase of trials with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug’s most frequent and serious side effects and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-in-vaccine-race-all-eyes-on-oxford-trial-s-deadline/story-tXlkN8zVyOshDiD3o2qgcM.html
19-04-2020||World||Hong Kong Police arrests at least 14 opposition activists for holding unlawful protests last year: Report||Hong Kong police arrested at least 14 opposition activists on Saturday for allegedly holding unlawful protests last year, the South China Morning Post reported.Former lawmakers Martin Lee, Albert Ho and Leung Kwok-hung were among those arrested, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified legal sources. Police also visited the home of Hong Kong media tycoon and prominent democracy advocate Jimmy Lai but he wasn’t there, the Morning Post said. Lai was charged for unlawful assembly in February.The group was arrested for allegedly organizing unlawful assemblies on Aug. 18, Oct. 1 and 20 last year, according to the Morning Post.The city is experiencing a lull in protest activity as it battles the coronavirus outbreak. Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other pro-establishment figures have recently accused the opposition of endangering Hong Kong’s autonomy and livelihoods, echoing criticism from China.The mainland’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, the top agency overseeing the financial hub, accused lawmakers of potentially violating their oaths by blocking action by the local legislature. Opposition lawmakers have prevented the body’s agenda-setting House Committee from electing a chairman since October, barring the panel from conducting business, it said.“Some opposition lawmakers have resorted to sleazy tactics to paralyze the legislature for political gain at the expense of the public, which is tantamount to ‘political mutual destruction,’” the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said. “They could have violated their oath, which could mean misconduct in public office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-arrests-at-least-14-opposition-activists-for-holding-unlawful-protests-last-year-report/story-Y2dXzdQHmeM2dc46GDS7lI.html
19-04-2020||India||Non-essential deliveries by e-tailers remain prohibited||E-commerce companies such as Amazon and Filpkart are not allowed to sell products unless they are in the essential items list, the Union home ministry said in an order on Sunday, appearing to backtrack from an earlier announcement that allowed these companies to deliver products such as laptops, mobile phones and appliances from April 20.On April 15, the government put e-commerce in the list of what will be allowed once some curbs are lifted from areas with no Covid-19 outbreak, a decision that trader lobbies criticised for giving being discriminatory against brick-and-mortar retailers. “Supply of non-essential goods by e-commerce companies to remain prohibited during Lockdown 2.0 to fight Covid,” said a spokesperson of the ministry of home affairs citing the new order, which, he said, clarifies a misinterpretation of last week’s directions.Clause 14 (v) for e-commerce companies in revised consolidated guidelines on April 15 was technically misinterpreted as allowing the delivery of non-essential items, since the clause did not specify “essential or non-essential items”, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said in a letter sent to all states on Sunday. On Saturday, the opposition Congress too opposed the April 15 decision, saying the government was doing injustice to retail traders by allowing e-commerce companies to deliver non-essential items. Similar objection was raised by the Confederation of All -India Traders in a letter to the PM. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday the move will help in creating a level playing field.Amazon India, one of the biggest e-commerce websites, said Sunday’s decision will affect customers who may need some products essential to working or studying from home. “The new guideline will disappoint not only the consumers whose list of essentials had expanded to work from home and study from home products but also the thousands of small businesses, sellers and manufacturers across the country, who had geared up in the last 48 hours to provide millions of people with safe access to products,” a spokesperson said. The company said it will continue to follow guidelines and deliver essential products, and was working closely with authorities for expedited processes to make safe deliveries of priority products. On Sunday, CAIT issued a statement, saying it had “demolished sinister plan of e-commerce companies to trade in non-essential commodities”. Since March 25, when India was put under what is the world’s largest shutdown in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the government has largely allowed only items of basic necessities to reach people.Efforts have been made to ensure that milk, vegetables, cooking oil, milk and such products reach people, with a special emphasis on doorstep delivery in many parts of the country, the official cited above said.When Modi extended the lockdown till May 3, he said that certain economic activity in regions that contain the outbreak successfully can be relaxed, but with “very strict guidelines on how people step out of their homes” . These allowed some construction and industrial activity as well as operation of offices with strict social distancing protocols, as long as these were in areas not classified as hot spots. Work by some self-employed individuals, such as cobblers and roadside vendors, was also put on the list of what could be allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/non-essential-deliveries-by-e-tailers-remain-prohibited/story-IPxhNwvQMSVfWF2ljPFuNO.html
19-04-2020||India||Capital curbs won’t be eased today||New Delhi: Delhi will not immediately ease any restrictions clamped under the national lockdown because coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are on the rise in the national capital, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, even as several other states announced relaxing some norms beginning Monday to jump-start the virus-hit economy.Hindustan Times reported on Sunday that the Delhi government did not want to ease restrictions on April 20 on the grounds that the city-state was a “high-risk zone”. All 11 revenue districts in the state are now designated as virus hot spots, with one remaining district (north-east Delhi) joining the list.At a news conference on Sunday morning, Kejriwal said the government will assess the situation after one week. “There have been instances where people without symptoms were found infected by Covid-19,” the chief minister said. “Delhi has 2% of the country’s population but 12% of the total active cases,” he added.Kejriwal said many people were facing difficulties because of the lockdown. “But if we give relaxations and if there is a shortage of ICU, ventilators, oxygen in hospitals and people lose their lives, we wouldn’t be able to forgive ourselves. Hence, the decision to not relax lockdown was taken,” he added.Out of 736 samples collected recently, 186 people were found to be infected by Sars-CoV-2 on Saturday and all of them were asymptomatic, he said, adding that the people did not suspect they had contracted the disease. “This suggests that they would have compromised with isolation norms and potentially spread the virus without even knowing. This is a scary situation.”At 2,003 cases -- 110 people tested positive on Sunday -- Delhi has the second most Covid-19 infections after Maharashtra, which has 4,200. The city has 80 “containment zones”, where the restrictions are stricter, movement is barred, and home delivery of essentials is facilitated by the administration.On April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the national lockdown – first imposed on March 25 – will be extended till May 3, but said some of the curbs would be lifted in places outside “containment zones” and in areas where the potential of the pathogen spreading was low, to revive economic activity.An order released by the Union home ministry a day after PM Modi’s address laid down guidelines for the conditional lifting of some restrictions.The Delhi government, however, decided to send a proposal to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Friday evening against the lifting of restrictions after the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) informed it of “large outbreaks” in several parts of the city, according to a senior government official who asked not to be named.Kejriwal attributed the large number of cases in Delhi to heavy airport arrivals from Covid-affected countries and a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin recently.The tally of Covid-19 cases first jumped in India after the detection of hundreds of patients who attended gatherings of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary group, in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month. Once the cluster – the largest single source so far in the country – was identified and isolated on March 30, daily cases surged. The number of cases in Delhi increased from 72 on March 29 to 2,003 so far – more than 1,000 cases can be linked to the Nizamuddin gathering.“If there had been no lockdown, the situation here would have been similar to Italy and Spain,” Kejriwal said.According to an order issued by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, the government will review the situation on April 27.Food distribution centres in Delhi also came up on the radar after a volunteer tested positive for Covid-19. Kejriwal said people linked to the centres will be among the first batches to be tested with rapid antibody kits.Of the first batch of 42,000 rapid testing kits that arrived in Delhi on Friday, some were used to evaluate 92 cured patients being discharged from Lok Nayak hospital for plasma therapy trial to treat other Covid-19 patients.Schools, colleges and coaching centres will continue to remain closed; as will all public transport including buses, auto-rickshaws, taxis, cab aggregator services, e-rickshaws and the Metro. Construction and other business activities, including the operation of non-essential factories will also remain suspended. Goods transport and all essential services that were permitted through the lockdown will continue to operate.Experts said earlier that the sectors that could have witnessed some relief included self-employed workers such as electricians and plumbers, construction activities in cases where the sites had provisions for safe accommodation of labourers, and activities in industrial zones.Animesh Das, a labour activist and member of the Delhi government’s minimum wage board, said: “Delhi has around 600,000 constructions workers of which roughly 500,000 are left in the lockdown. Rest managed to leave the city before it was strictly imposed. A significant percentage of them resides at the construction sites. Since relaxations are out of question at this hour, the government should take up an exercise of construction site visits and provide them with direct cash benefits. The workers and their families are currently in poor shape.”Public health experts said not allowing any relaxation at this time was a good move as ideally all containment zones should have tight restrictions and complete lockdown for at least 28 days. Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Delhi is vulnerable because of its high population density. Mobility is directly proportional to chances of transmission and that is already visible to some extent after the first phase of the 21-day lockdown. So, stricter restrictions are a necessary step at this juncture. Currently, Delhi is not in a position to relax the lockdown. To contain the transmission of the virus, people have to cooperate.”Amita Baviskar, a professor of sociology at Ashoka University, said: “Well-to-do families with salaries and savings will sail through. The crisis has hit the lower middle and working classes – small businesses, street vendors, domestic workers, daily wage labourers, and industrial workers. The government may give them two meals a day but they need cash for other necessities such as rent, medicines, school fees, mobile recharge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capital-curbs-won-t-be-eased-today/story-8wHSBQwXCEUQaeEfNP3GgJ.html

19-04-2020||India||60,000 imported, donated PPE kits fail quality tests||New Delhi At least 60,000 of the nearly 200,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits donated by industry and philanthropic organisations have failed quality test over the past one month, officials familiar with the matter said on Sunday.Most of these kits were imported from China, the world’s largest supplier of medical products including drugs and diagnostics, which led India to look for manufacturers based in other countries. The highest rejections were in a batch of 170,000 kits that arrived on April 5.“There are no government-to-government donations; these are all philanthropic organisations that have come forward to donate necessary supplies in this moment of crisis. Our rules are clear that we do not let anything be distributed without necessary quality checks,” said a senior government official, requesting anonymity. “All imports, be it bought or donated, undergo stringent quality checks and are being looked for certificate of compliance before they are put to use. When dealing with such a large number there are bound to be some pieces that can be faulty, and we are rejecting those. It doesn’t mean the entire lot is faulty.”One of the big labs where the products are being tested is the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.The Union health ministry’s joint secretary, Lav Agarwal, in one of his press briefings, said, “India has put stringent standards in place for medical items, and whichever product does not meet the quality standards will not be accepted. We will not provide our health care workers anything substandard, and we are looking around the globe to identify manufacturers who can supply us not just PPE kits, but also diagnostic kits. We have enough PPE at the moment, and we will get more soon.” India is also looking at other countries to source essential medical supplies, such as South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany, France, the US, among others.While doctors across the country have been highlighting the need for more PPE in hospitals to reduce health care workers contracting infections, the government says it is ensuring that this demand is met.“There was shortage earlier as we were only importing PPE but now we are comfortably placed in terms of supply,” said Agarwal.According to health ministry sources, close to 400,000 PPE kits are already in stock in hospitals across India, and more shipments are expected in a week or so.“Over the past month we have placed orders for some 16 million PPE that have already started coming in. In a week or so we should receive most of our orders. Also, there is a significant number of domestic manufacturers now who have been identified for the job, and have started manufacturing. Some have even scaled up their capacity really fast,” said a health ministry official.From being totally dependent on imported PPE, India has managed to set up about 50 domestic companies in just the past one month to raise its PPE manufacturing capacity. Currently, all 50 of these companies have the capacity to manufacture about 60,000 PPE kits a day, and are in the process of scaling it up further, to be able to meet the country’s demand for about 100,000 kits a day.“There should be enough PPE in stock by next week. There is absolutely no shortage, and there won’t be any in future, too,” said the health ministry official cited above.Experts say rather than relying on imports, the focus now should be on manufacturing indigenously.“It is better to import critical missing raw material fabric for PPE that’s breathable and yet is fluid and viral-resistant, rather than importing planeloads of PPE kits that may not meet the quality criteria,” said Rajiv Nath, founder and forum coordinator of the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-000-imported-donated-ppe-kits-fail-quality-tests/story-6wDw1y8PAKYLKogJ95gW9H.html
19-04-2020||India||After lockdown ends, Odisha to put anyone who returns in 14-day quarantine||Setting the stage for the return of migrant labourers as well as other people from the state who will return to Odisha after the lockdown is lifted on May 3, the state plans to keep all of them in 14-day institutional quarantine in towns and villages.In a video message on Sunday, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said when the restrictions are lifted, Odisha in coordination with the host state and Government of India will facilitate the return of all those who want to come back home.“In spite of best efforts of our state and the host states, life is not normal for them and it pains me. In our state we have about 1 lakh people from other states whom the state is taking care. Similarly, there are lakhs of brothers and sisters from Odisha in other states (students, professionals, stranded pilgrims and patients and a large number of workers). Every person on return from outside Odisha would have to compulsorily stay in quarantine for 14 days observing the guidelines issued by the health and family welfare department,” Patnaik said, adding that one of the key factors in controlling the spread in Odisha was the mandatory registration of all foreign returnees and placing them in compulsory quarantine.Patnaik said every gram panchayat and urban local body in the state will have registration facility and those returning from other states will register themselves in the panchayats and urban local bodies.“Following this they will be kept in 14-day quarantine. Their treatment, food and accommodation expenses will be taken care of by the state government. Family members and relatives of the returnees will ensure that the registration happens,” Patnaik said.According to the CM, to implement this effectively and with a humane touch, the state government has delegated the powers of district collectors to sarpanches of the panchayats under the provisions of Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act of 2005, Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 and Odisha Covid-19 Regulations 2020.Registration, streamlined movement and 14 day quarantine are very important to protect the returnee, their own families, the community and the state at-large, he said.Odisha has so far reported 61 positive cases and 1 death due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-lockdown-ends-odisha-to-put-anyone-who-returns-in-14-day-quarantine/story-BhtC8xCEyJ3kPvQzog287K.html
19-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Highest single day rise in positive cases in Maharashtra, tally reaches 4200||Even as Maharashtra plans to ease the restrictions and resume industrial operations in rural areas from April 20, the state saw a sudden spike of 552 cases on Sunday-- the highest rise in a day-- taking the total to 4200 cases in the state. 456 of these cases were from Mumbai alone, taking the city’s total of positive cases to 2724. The Sunday surge is expected to impact the doubling rate which had improved in the last few days.The state on Sunday also reported deaths of 12 Covid-19 patients, taking the toll to 223. Six of the 12 new casualties were from Mumbai, four from Malegaon and one each from Solapur and Ahmednagar. Six of the deceased were aged above 60 years, while five others were aged between 40 and 60 years, according to the report released by the state health department. State officials attributed the spike in the cases to a delay in verification of tests conducted in Mumbai.“Some of the test reports added in today’s tally were conducted since April 12 in Mumbai taking the tally high,” the report stated. According to the officials from the health department, the reports of tests conducted by the private laboratories are verified by the government laboratories and this process led to the delay. “It leads to a spiralling of the numbers on the day the verification is done,” an official said.According to the officials, the doubling rate of the disease had come down to 5.5 days from 3.5 days a few days ago before the Sunday spike. “The sudden rise on Sunday may again disturb the rate,” he added.Maharashtra has conducted 72,023 tests including 67,673 that tested negative. 507 positive patients have fully recovered. Over 87 thousand people are under home quarantine across the state, while 6,743 patients are in institutional quarantine. The number of containment zones in the state has reduced to 368, most of them being in Mumbai. A total of 23.97 lakh people in the state have been screened for the disease with the help of 6359 teams.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, while announcing relaxation in the lockdown restrictions in rural parts of the state, clarified that the strict restrictions will continue in the containment areas and also in Mumbai and Pune, at least till May 3.“We are relaxing the restrictions in Green and Orange zones with no and fewer number of Covid-19 patients to a certain extent. The industrial operations in these zones will be allowed, but the employers will have to arrange for the fooding and lodging of the employees. The district borders will, however, remained sealed and no intradistrict activities will be permitted,” he said.The state government has also directed 10% of its employees to resume work from Monday in a gradual resumption of public services. Four districts (Nanded, Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli) have no coronavirus patients while positive cases in 18 plus districts are in single digits. “We expect the industrial units in pharmaceuticals, agricultural sectors to begin operating from Monday. They are expected to follow the standard operating procedures laid down under the lockdown restrictions for their employees. There are 10.26 lakh registered MSMEs in the state, including 4.5 lakh in areas partially exempted from April 20. We want 60% of them to be operationalised by the month end. However, the major industries of all sizes are in MMR and Pune, where the operations are unlikely to begin at least for next few weeks,” said an official from Industries department.Some of the industries have been directed to operate at 50% of their workforce, while others have been directed to arrange for workers’ food and lodging at the workplace.The vehicles carrying the workers will have to operate at 30-40% of their capacity in order to maintain social distancing. Shops selling Kirana, sweets, snacks will begin operating from Monday in areas not affected by Covid-19.“All these activities continue to be banned in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune city and Nagpur city as they have large number of virus cases. We are apprehensive about the pace of industrial and commercial activities in the state and the urban parts will continue to be under restrictions,” said an official from the state government.Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune city account for 89.4% of all positive cases (3262 of 3648 on Saturday) in Maharashtra and 90.5% of all deaths in the state (191 of 211 on Saturday) were also from these regions. MMR and Pune have less than 25% of state’s population. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The Maharashtra police have registered a whopping 55,393 cases related to violation of lockdown rules since March 22, the day chief minister announced completed lockdown in the state. The police helpline has received 72,644 calls related to the pandemic, while 11,645 citizens have been arrested over the last four weeks. Of the total offences, 105 were of assault on policemen, while 567 were related to violation of quarantine measures. The police have also booked 15 foreigners for visa-related violations. 241 cases related to the objectionable posts on social media were also registered in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-highest-single-day-rise-in-positive-cases-in-maharashtra-tally-reaches-4200/story-wUMcQz0u6oMjIAuH1tcOnL.html
19-04-2020||India||Meet the Jodhpur Covid-19 warrior who leads a survey team||When Heena Aftab, chosen to lead a team conducting a Covid-19 medical survey in the Nagauri Gate area of Jodhpur, showed her identity card to some residents on her first day at work, the reaction was one of open hostility.Her ID was tossed aside and she was told they knew she was collecting data for the National Register of Citizens (NRC) aimed at identifying illegal migrants, an exercise that hasn’t even begun. Aftab, a 32-year-old Yunani medical doctor, didn’t allow the incident to faze her.” I didn’t mind their words and behaviour as I know these youngsters had been brainwashed through fake messages circulating on WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms,” she said. On March 31, Aftab was transferred from the town of Mandor near Jodhpur to Nagori Gate, where she has gone everyday since to conduct the survey. She hasn’t taken a single day off for 18 days, putting in 10-hour work days.Jodhpur is the second worst-hit district of Rajasthan in the coronavirus outbreak. Until Friday morning, the district had reported 133 positive cases of the virus (out of 1,193 reported in all of Rajasthan), and 13 were from Nagori Gate. Aftab didn’t let any concerns about catching the infection come in the way of her work.“When I was sent to lead the medical survey team in Nagori Gate, I asked myself whether I would be able to do this job,” Aftab said, adding she felt uncertain because the area was new to her, the population was mixed, belonging to different classes, communities, religions and financial backgrounds.To win the trust of the people, Aftab, who is from Bikaner, learnt the local dialect, approached influential members of the community and sought their support to persuade the residents to respond to the survey. “These people cooperated with me and explained to the locals,” she said.She told the residents about the survey her medical team was conducting, and asked them to report anyone circulating fake messages to the contrary on social media.“Slowly and gradually, people started answering our questions honestly and cooperated with us by giving their samples too,” Aftab said.Aftab and her team, comprising of nursing students, auxiliary nursing midwifes and lab technicians and assistants, also educated residents of the area how to protect themselves from the virus and reduce chances of infection.The team visits around 90 houses daily for collecting responses to the survey, and also keeps tabs on whether people are following quarantine orders strictly. Aftab starts her work day at around 8.30 in the morning and returns home around 7 in the evening. She has two sons --four-year-old Faizan Ahmed and one-year-old Shahvez Ahmed . Her husband, Zahim Ahmed Qazi, is a veterinary doctor.“I do my work with lot of enthusiasm; my little corona warriors pray for me. Before I leave, Faizan daily wishes me good luck,” said Aftab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-the-jodhpur-covid-19-warrior-who-leads-a-survey-team/story-EWUwrXYwhw2wAvkh460S9M.html
19-04-2020||India||Covid-19: 60,000 imported PPE kits fail quality tests||At least 60,000 of the nearly 200,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits donated by industry and philanthropic organisations have failed quality test over the past one month, officials familiar with the matter said on Sunday.Most of these kits were imported from China, the world’s largest supplier of medical products including drugs and diagnostics, which led India to look for manufacturers based in other countries. The highest rejections were in a batch of 170,000 kits that arrived on April 5.“There are no government-to-government donations; these are all philanthropic organisations that have come forward to donate necessary supplies in this moment of crisis. Our rules are clear that we do not let anything be distributed without necessary quality checks,” said a senior government official, requesting anonymity. “All imports, be it bought or donated, undergo stringent quality checks and are being looked for certificate of compliance before they are put to use. When dealing with such a large number there are bound to be some pieces that can be faulty, and we are rejecting those. It doesn’t mean the entire lot is faulty.”One of the big labs where the products are being tested is the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.The Union health ministry’s joint secretary, Lav Agarwal, in one of his press briefings, said, “India has put stringent standards in place for medical items, and whichever product does not meet the quality standards will not be accepted. We will not provide our health care workers anything substandard, and we are looking around the globe to identify manufacturers who can supply us not just PPE kits, but also diagnostic kits. We have enough PPE at the moment, and we will get more soon.” India is also looking at other countries to source essential medical supplies, such as South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany, France, the US, among others.While doctors across the country have been highlighting the need for more PPE in hospitals to reduce health care workers contracting infections, the government says it is ensuring that this demand is met.“There was shortage earlier as we were only importing PPE but now we are comfortably placed in terms of supply,” said Agarwal.According to health ministry sources, close to 400,000 PPE kits are already in stock in hospitals across India, and more shipments are expected in a week or so.“Over the past month we have placed orders for some 16 million PPE that have already started coming in. In a week or so we should receive most of our orders. Also, there is a significant number of domestic manufacturers now who have been identified for the job, and have started manufacturing. Some have even scaled up their capacity really fast,” said a health ministry official.From being totally dependent on imported PPE, India has managed to set up about 50 domestic companies in just the past one month to raise its PPE manufacturing capacity. Currently, all 50 of these companies have the capacity to manufacture about 60,000 PPE kits a day, and are in the process of scaling it up further, to be able to meet the country’s demand for about 100,000 kits a day.“There should be enough PPE in stock by next week. There is absolutely no shortage, and there won’t be any in future, too,” said the health ministry official cited above.Experts say rather than relying on imports, the focus now should be on manufacturing indigenously.“It is better to import critical missing raw material fabric for PPE that’s breathable and yet is fluid and viral-resistant, rather than importing planeloads of PPE kits that may not meet the quality criteria,” said Rajiv Nath, founder and forum coordinator of the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-60-000-imported-ppe-kits-fail-quality-tests/story-aTjbZ488d8mjh3HjrV0VWM.html

19-04-2020||India||Amid lockdown, Bengal governor and government lock horns over ‘PDS scam’||Amid the lockdown to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, an alleged scam in the public distribution system (PDS) continues to snowball in Bengal with Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, senior leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) targeting the Mamata Banerjee government.The state government, on its part, blamed the Centre on Sunday for the shortfall of food grains and accused ration shop owners in the state of giving inadequate ration to the people.“The requirement of rice that the Centre was supposed to provide under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna is 3 lakh metric tonnes per month. As of Sunday, we have received only 1,41,000 metric tonnes. How can we collect less than half the requirement? Whom should we deliver and whom should not? Let them send at least a month’s supply,” said state food and supplies minister Jyoti Priya Mallick.Incidentally, following Dhankhar’s allegation on social media that there was a “PDS scam” in the state, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on Saturday wrote a letter to the governor in which he too alleged that the Centre was not sending adequate supplies.In an interview to Hindustan Times in Sunday, Dhankhar said, “I have personally spoken to union minister Ram Vilas Paswan and was shocked to know that the state had not even raised the requisition indent for the food grains that the Centre and the Food Corporation of India are ready to provide. Paswan had also spoken to Mallick a few days ago. The Centre has given all details and the same have been forwarded to the state administration.”Paswan is the cabinet minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution.Dhankhar said that there were three problems with the PDS in West Bengal. “First, supplies are not reaching the needy. Second, the PDS has been hijacked by the ruling party and distribution is taking place through them. And third, people are getting the food grains in lesser quantity and of poor quality,” Dhankhar said. Mallick, however, said that Bengal did not need to send requisition because it is a ‘direct procurement state’. “We never send requisition. The governor is unaware that we do not procure from the Centre. We procure directly from farmers. The Centre only needs to send what they have committed,” he said. The Trinamool Congress also has rubbished Dhankhar’s allegation of “political hijacking of PDS.”“The governor is misleading the people of the state. PDS is being distributed through ration shops. Whenever party leaders are distributing relief, it is they who are arranging for the funds. They are raising funds and paying from their own pockets. The governor should not confuse PDS with the distribution of relief material by our party,” said TMC spokesperson Snehasish Chakraborty.“Give us a single case of party leaders distributing PDS and action will be taken,” Chakraborty said. Mallick said that the chief minister has decided to provide free rice to 9.5 crore people of the state. The state’s present population is estimated at above 10 crore at present. It was 9.13 crore, according to the Census of 2011. Mallick however, conceded that there are problems at ration shops. “There are 21,000 ration shops and we don’t have enough staff strength to monitor the activities of every shop in real-time. Many of them were previously penalised by the state government but they won the cases in the high court. It is only a handful of ration dealers who are still indulging in malpractices. We are taking action as soon as reports are reaching us,” Mallick said.Mamata Banerjee has announced free ration – two kg rice and three kg wheat per head – to 9.5 crore people for six months. The food minister said that some ration shops could not provide people with the whole quota of 5 kg food grains due to a shortage of supply, as most rice mills remained closed.”“There are about 900 operational rice mills. Of them only about 200 are functional at present. We are trying to make the other mills operational at the earliest. In Kolkata, some ration shops are too tiny to store large quantities. They have been allowed to store in neighbouring schools.”Right to Food activist Anuradha Talwar said that shortage of supply was the main issue for a good number of people not receiving adequate rice.“Corruption is a minor issue. Going by the number of ration cards and the projected present population of the state, only 62% are to get rations. The state government additionally provides ration to another 20%. Altogether, only 82% are getting covered. It is absolutely essential that the Centre starts distributing food grains from its buffer stock which is meant for catastrophic situations,” said Talwar. Biswambhar Basu, general secretary of All India Fair Price Shop Dealers’ Association, refuted the allegations of corruption. “Not a single person who holds a digital ration card has been denied ration. Those who did not enrol for the digital ration cards and are no longer entitled to receive ration from our shops are the ones creating trouble,” Basu said.He admitted that in some cases people were given half their entitlement because the shops did not get enough supplies due to shortage of manpower, difficulties in transport and lack of storage space for the surge in demand. “Those who received half their entitlement would receive the rest before the end of this month,” he added.Over the past few days, Bengal has witnessed a number of protests against ration shop owners. Leaders of BJP and Left parties had alleged that PDS reach the leaders of the ruling party, the Trinamool Congress, instead of those who needed it.The administration over the past three days have lodged police cases against 36 ration shop owners and several of them have been arrested, according to a senior officer of the state food and supplied department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-bengal-governor-and-government-lock-horns-over-pds-scam/story-78cMR1yC9EE6okkh9pPXCO.html

19-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Bihar feast stirs political row, FIR filed||A formal police complaint has been lodged against Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Verma’s personal assistant for allegedly organising a house-warming party amid the Covid-19 lockdown, according to officials.Adding to the government’s discomfort was a video clip --- purportedly capturing visuals from party --- that went viral on social media.Chief minister Nitish Kumar has repeatedly urged people to follow the lockdown guidelines and turned down requests from opposition parties to bring back Bihar residents, including students and workers, stranded in other parts of the country.A police officer said the party was organised in Jehanabad, which is Verma’s hometown, on April 15. Several officials of the local administration and journalists participated in it, officials said. Taking cognizance of reports, the government asked the police headquarters to inquire into the matter. After the reports were confirmed, a first information report (FIR) was filed on Sunday against the minister’s personal assistant (PA), Pintu Yadav, and several officials, including Jehanabad’s sub-divisional police officer, block development officer and circle officer.“The minister’s PA threw a house-warming party and a large number of people, in batches of 50 and 100, took part in it. The officials also admitted having attended the party, as the invitation was from the minister’s PA,” the police officer said on condition of anonymity.“Many journalists also enjoyed the feast. As the FIR was lodged under bailable sections, all officials got bail but the investigation is on. A charge-sheet will soon be filed. The officials will also face departmental proceedings,” the officer added.Jehanabad’s superintendent of police Manish Kumar said action is being taken in the matter. Another police officer, who declined to be named, said the list of all the people who attended Yadav’s party is being drawn up.Soon after the incident came to light, the minister said he had received information that the block and district officials, who were busy distributing relief materials, had been requested by the people of his hometown to have lunch as a mark of respect.“I don’t know if social distancing was maintained. If there is anything wrong, there will be a proper investigation,” he said.However, the opposition parties criticised the state government.“The government must walk the talk. If this is what a senior minister’s PA does within the state and barely 75 km from Patna, it does not set the right example and the call to adhere to the lockdown will become meaningless,” said Congress legislator and spokesman Premchandra Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-bihar-feast-stirs-political-row-fir-filed/story-go0Px4xz5oEtYUzdZ8ejeO.html
19-04-2020||India||Two fresh Covid-19 cases in Kerala, late onset of disease worries state||Kerala on Sunday reported two new cases of coronavirus which took the total number of infections in the state to 401, the state’s health minister K K Shailaja said.Out of the 401, 270 have been discharged while 129 people are in different hospitals, she said in a statement.The latest two persons to test positive had returned from the Persian Gulf but more than the number of patients, health authorities are worried about the extended incubation period of the virus. There have been instances of the onset of the Covid-19 even after 25 days among people who came back from West Asia.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.The World Health Organization had set an incubation period of 14 days for the virus but in Kerala some cases have been reported even after 29 days of exposure.In Pathanamthitta in central Kerala a girl student, who travelled in a compartment in which some Tabligi Jammat members were also travelling, tested positive after 22 days of her trip. Under observation she remained asymptomatic throughout but turned positive when her observation period was about to be over. She was asymptomatic even after she tested positive on April 6, said district medical officer Dr N Sheeja. Similarly in Kozhikkode a man who was under observation was tested positive on 28th day when he was about to be taken out of quarantine.Despite these worrying points the state has shown a steady recovery rate.

19-04-2020||India||Khalilzad reaches out to Jaishankar on troubled Afghan peace process||The US special envoy for Afghan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, has sought India’s engagement in international efforts for a lasting peace in Afghanistan against the backdrop of growing concern in New Delhi over the US-Taliban deal.Khalilzad, who has been pushing the Afghan government to facilitate the implementation of the US-Taliban deal by releasing more Taliban prisoners, tweeted he had reached out to external affairs minister S Jaishankar to discuss the latest developments in the Afghan peace process.“We talked about the urgency of resolving the internal political crisis and the importance of Afghan leaders forming an inclusive government,” he said, in an apparent reference to differences between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah.“We also discussed the need for both the Afghan government and the Taliban to accelerate prisoner releases, support a prompt reduction in violence, and start intra-Afghan negotiations,” Khalilzad said in a separate tweet.Khalilzad said he had told Jaishankar that “the US welcomes Indian engagement in regional and international efforts for a lasting peace in #Afghanistan” and that the US is “committed to a sustained engagement with #India on this objective”.This was Khalilzad’s first outreach to the Indian side to discuss the troubled Afghan peace process since diplomatic engagements around the world were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Khalilzad said he and Jaishankar also spent time “covering the immediate and longer-term impact of the Coronavirus”.Jaishankar tweeted that Khalilzad had “called to update on recent Afghan developments”. Without giving details, he added: “Shared the Indian perspective. Our historical friendship with this close neighbour will always guide our Afghan policy.”Khalilzad’s outreach came against the backdrop of growing concern in New Delhi about the US-Taliban deal not leading to any significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan. Officials in the Indian government are also concerned that there has been no public move by the Taliban to distance itself from terror groups such as al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed that have a presence in Afghanistan.Former ambassador Rajiv Dogra, who has served in Pakistan and closely tracks developments in Afghanistan, said Khalilzad’s tweets appeared to be veiled suggestion to India to “stay off” as far as Afghanistan is concerned. “If one reads between the lines as far as Khalilzad’s tweets are concerned, the message seems to be very clear - don’t spoil our deal,” said Dogra. “One day a future US administration will judge Khalilzad.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khalilzad-reaches-out-to-jaishankar-on-troubled-afghan-peace-process/story-4AKXLb2jNbr6eBqVDhIrJK.html

Let us imagine what would have happened if these small traders and shopkeepers did not take the risk of their own life and did not deliver such necessities to fellow citizens?” PM Modi said in a series of tweets in Hindi.“Small shopkeepers have contributed significantly in maintaining the entire social system. The society and the country will always remember their contribution,” he said. The PM added that he realized how challenging it was to follow social distancing and get others to follow it too.ALSO READ | PM Modi says Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste and creed“In future also, shops should follow social distancing, we have to ensure this. All shopkeepers and traders deserve congratulations for their contribution in this hour of crisis,” he said.Earlier on Sunday, the Prime Minister said that the Covid-19 pandemic affects every human being equally irrespective of faith, colour or caste.“Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together,” PM Modi had said in a post on LinkedIn.He said the world is now facing a common challenge that will test humanity’s resilience.

Immensely happy to announce that all the COVID-19 positive cases in the state are now NEGATIVE,” Rane tweeted, thanking doctors and frontline workers “who worked tirelessly and risked their lives to save others”. In a separate tweet, chief minister Pramod Sawant said: “A moment of satisfaction and relief for Goa as the last active Covid-19 case tests negative. Team of doctors and the entire support staff deserves applause for their relentless effort. No new positive case in Goa after 3rd April 2020.” Rane, however, said the state authorities couldn’t afford to be complacent.“While we have good news of zero COVID-19 cases in Goa, it is too early to tag our state as a ‘green zone’. It’s time to intensify the testing facilities, we are now drawing up protocols for random testing – testing of migratory workers, industrial workers, etc,” he tweeted shortly after the announcement regarding the recovery of all positive cases.“We are also setting up smart kiosks, which will be placed at the borders, airport, MPT (Mormugao Port Trust), and several other locations that would be best suited for broadening our scope of testing,” he added.In a statement earlier, Rane said the state government was proud to announce that all the patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Goa had recovered.“While currently we do not have any active cases in the state, it is our responsibility to keep in mind the importance of the lockdown, maintain social distancing, increase the scope of testing and adhere to norms and guidelines issued by both Central and state governments,” he said. The patients who had recovered were moved to a hotel, where they will spend another 14 days in isolation before being sent home. This is being done as an additional precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-s-active-covid-19-count-down-to-zero-minister-warns-against-complacency/story-Eaeq4Y2LT1nvP61DtEyoHL.html
19-04-2020||India||Lockdown disrupts ₹5 meal kitchen, activist switches to doorstep delivery||After feeding the underprivileged for five years, wholesome and nutritious meals in only ₹5, through his ‘Dadi Ki Rasoi’ initiative, social activist Anoop Khanna refuses to be daunted by the lockdown and is now trying to ensure he provides rations to the hungry right at their doorsteps.Dadi Ki Rasoi, which began in Noida in August 2015, and literally translates to Grandmother’s Kitchen, catered to about 500 people every day. In his own words, he charges a nominal amount of ₹5 and does not give the food for free in order to respect the dignity of the recipient. “From students to private employees and daily labourers, all types of people comes to us and we provide the same meal to everyone”, says Khanna, who has been operating this kitchen all by himself and a few paid staffers, but is averse to adding unpaid volunteers.“I have observed many youngsters take interest in social initiatives but it quickly fades with time. I do not want to depend on people who might show up on one day and discontinue later. Also I am against the idea of full-time charity and want everyone who is getting involved in such initiatives to have a separate source of income, so that they do not use funds meant for social causes, for their own good,” adds Khanna, who operates two medical shops in the city and is also the president of a chemists’ association, a network that he put to use to identify the need for food in different parts of the city during the lockdown and made sure he reaches those places.“With the lockdown, we had to shut Dadi Ki Rasoi and there were concerns about how we continue feeding people. Hence we took this decision to make packets of dry rations and distribute them to the underprivileged in slums,” says Khanna. Dadi Ki Rasoi has not only inspired similar kitchens in different parts of the country but also earned laurels from President Ram Nath Kovind, and Khanna was felicitated at Rashtrapati Bhawan last year, as part of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatama Gandhi. Khanna was invited to the President’s house and was commended for his contributions which fulfilled the basic requirements of “roti, kapda and dawai” of the needy.While earlier he would set his food stall at around afternoon at a fixed place in sector 29, now his daily schedule includes driving around empty stretches of Noida, carrying along hundreds of packets of dry rations — a combination of a few kilograms of rice, wheat flour and pulses.“We have made small ration packets to discourage people from hoarding and to cover more households. We will keep revisiting these places within a gap of four to five days till this lockdown gets over,” adds Khanna, who now distributes over 400 packets of dry rations every day.As he has been serving the poor for so many years, procuring rations for distribution amid the lockdown hasn’t been a problem for him as vendors, familiar with his work over the years, were more than happy to make the products available to him.With a WHO advisory suggesting senior citizens to exercise maximum caution and preferably stay indoors, the 62-year-old pins hopes on his safety gears and continues to serve the underprivileged.“Everyone has his duty, be it healthcare professionals, policemen or civil society. In this hour, it is of utmost importance to keep serving people. It is only everyone’s collective effort that keeps humanity alive. I am using a mask, gloves and even a plastic apron to keep myself protected and we always maintain social distancing while distributing rations,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/lockdown-disrupts-5-meal-kitchen-activist-switches-to-doorstep-delivery/story-unKgNXl8fUG8DXHfEfX4fL.html
19-04-2020||India||British retiree spends savings to feed stranded labourers in Goa||Rowena Fuller, a 63-year-old retiree from Britain who was holidaying in Goa when the lockdown was announced, has used up most of her holiday nest egg — a tidy sum of Rs 90,000, set aside for a trip to South Africa — to feed migrants stranded in Agonda, a coastal village in the southern part of the state.“I think I have found my purpose,” Rowena told Hindustan Times. “We have crossed 1,000 meals per day and by May 3, we will have served over 2200 meals,” Fuller said. “But if the lockdown continues beyond that, I don’t think we will be able to continue with it.” A former social worker, Fuller came to Goa in August 2019. The plan, she said, was for her husband Peter and her to travel the world, leaving their life in the United Kingdom behind. When the lockdown was announced, the Fullers dug their heels in. Rather than fly home on one of the many repatriation flights that the UK government has organized for its citizens, they chose to stay back in Goa. Agonda is one of Goa’s most well known tourist beaches, and regularly makes it to the top ten lists compiled by travel portal TripAdvisor. An idyllic village in the far south corner of Goa that has none of the crowds, nightclubs and loud parties that other beaches can boast of, but it is a popular haunt for tourists, especially foreigners, looking for a quieter, cheaper holiday. It is also home to labourers, several of whom come from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka to earn a living in restaurants and other industries that are labour intensive. They live in shanties and make themselves available at a gathering spot each morning waiting for someone to call upon their services. Since the lockdown, however, they have been stranded with no way of returning home and no means of earning any income. In Goa, an unskilled worker is entitled to receive Rs 350 as daily wage.Fuller got in touch with a local restaurant, Fatima’s, which agreed to cook meals for them. With their help she has been delivering meals to 65 labourers and their families in the beach village. “I hope and pray that others will help me in this venture, but if they don’t I’ll do it anyway, I have food in my freezer, dried goods in my cupboards and am rich in comparison to so many here, even my paltry pension per month is enviable, so I shall continue. Fatima’s restaurant shall continue to cook for these deprived people, and Santosh (a local resident helping Fuller) shall continue to deliver to them all, and I shall sleep content that we made a difference,” she said. Initially, Fuller initially used her own money — paying Fatima’s Rs 100 per meal — but it has since run out, prompting her to approach her friends to spread the word around. They will need to generate Rs 220,000 to ensure that they are fed until May 3.“They send the money directly to the restaurant that cooks the food,” she said. Stevie Rodrigues the owners of Fatima’s said that though the food is simple, they too are bearing some of the costs. “We have been supplying them with simple food and are bearing some of the cost. At the end of the day it’s our village and we have to look after it,” he said.Supplies have not been a problem, Rodrigues said, as his network of suppliers ensure that he is well stocked.Each meal consists of a portion of rice, fish curry and a piece of fried fish along with some vegetable depending on availability. “I am not receiving donations personally, I am not a charity, just a person who cares and who, over the months and especially over the last few days, has come to realise the other side of paradise, the sick, the old, those with dementia, those who are blind, those who were migrant workers but got left by the wayside … the list is endless. I cannot help all, but by God I will help all those I can even if it empties my savings,” she said. Since then others too have pitched in to help. “They are day labourers, in short, if they work by the morning, they will have food to eat. No work. No food. If you have witnessed the scene of distribution, trust me you can’t have dinner. These men take their food to home where there are kids,” another tourist who has been volunteering with Fuller and who didn’t wish to be named, said. While Fuller hasn’t yet approached the government for help, she said that she would if the lockdown continued beyond May 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-retiree-spends-savings-to-feed-stranded-labourers-in-goa/story-MWIPXyJ9yi1GxjgznU0m1H.html

Besides them, AYUSH, ICMR, Department of Science and Technology, Biotechnology, CSIR, DRDO, DG Health Services and Drug Controller are also its members,” Agarwal said.He said 1,334 fresh COVID-19 cases were reported since Saturday with 27 deaths in the last 24 hours. Total cases stand at 15,712 and deaths at 507. As many as 2,231 COVID-19 patients, which is around 14.19 per cent, have been cured, Agarwal said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that from April 20 selective relaxation will be given in some areas. In accordance to that, there will be some relaxations in non-containment zones from midnight, Agarwal said.The joint secretary in the health ministry, however, said that containment areas in coronavirus hotspots will not get the relaxations.States and Union Territories may impose measures which are even more stringent than Centre’s guidelines, according to local requirements, he said.Hotspots or red zones are those areas where either there are large number of COVID-19 cases or the doubling rate of infection is less than four days, Agarwal explained.“In these hotspots, local administrations delineate containment zones and buffer zones to control spread of the disease. No relaxations are permitted in these containment zones,” he said, adding strict perimeter control will be continue and nothing except essential services will be allowed there.“We will give selective relaxation in non-containment zones, but states and districts have to ensure that existing lockdown measures are strictly complied with.” “Activities to be prohibited till May 3, even in cases of relaxation, are primarily passenger traffic movement by air, rail and road, educational institutions, industrial commercial activities and hospitality services unless they are specifically exempted,” the health ministry official said.Along with these, cinema halls, malls, shopping complexes, entertainment parks will be closed while social, political, cultural, religious or academic and sports gatherings continue to remain prohibited, he said.Relaxation will be there for agricultural activities, daily-wage earners and employment opportunities for some to be monitored, health services to be functional and supply of essential goods to continue, Agarwal said.An ICMR official said 3,86,791 tests for coronavirus tests have been conducted so far with 37,173 tests done on Saturday.

Notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic in the region, Pakistan has been resorting to unprovoked ceasefire violations along the Line of Control and making concerted efforts to push militants into Kashmir in the last several weeks. “As you would have gathered from the operations along the LoC (Line of Control) in the last two weeks, we are dominating the enemy through targeted intelligence based strikes on their launch pads and eliminating them before they set foot on Indian soil,” Singh said. Army Chief Gen Gen M M Naravane visited various forward locations along the LoC on Thursday and Friday to take stock of situation along the frontiers and directed the Army to maintain maximum vigil to foil any attempt by Pakistan to push terrorists into the Indian side. Military sources said a number of terror launch pads along the Pakistani side of the LoC were destroyed by the Indian Army in the last few days. India has been retaliating strongly to the Pakistani “misadventure” by targeting terror launch pads and ammunition storage across the LoC. Recently, Keran sector was the scene of a deadly operation in which five elite army commandos laid down their lives while eliminating a group of infiltrating militants. There have been frequent incidents of ceasefire violation by Pakistani side since India announced its decision to withdraw special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two union territories in August last year. Pakistan often resorts to ceasefire violations to push militants into the Indian side. Indian troops have also been retaliating to Pakistani actions under its policy of hot pursuit. According to official figure, Pakistani troops resorted to 3,200 instances of ceasefire violations in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, which was highest in the last 16 years. Of these, 1,565 ceasefire violations took place since between August and December after the India reorganised Jammu and Kashmir. In 2018, Jammu and Kashmir recorded 2,936 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan. A top Army official said India has not lowered its guard at all in strategically sensitive areas though it has been engaged in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. India went under a total shutdown of 21 days from March 25 to April 14 to fight the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced extending the lockdown till May 3. The Indian Army on Thursday directed all its military establishments, cantonments, formation headquarters and field units to totally restrict movement of forces in view of the government’s fresh lockdown related guidelines. Last month, Army Chief Naravane issued instructions to insulate the 13 lakh strong Army from the coronavirus pandemic. Gen Naravane also conveyed to the families of the soldiers guarding India’s borders with Pakistan and China that the Army is taking care of its personnel serving the country in this difficult time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-carrying-out-targeted-strikes-on-terror-launch-pads-along-loc-defence-minister/story-tlsAzCsqv4KQmFyllxo2pN.html
19-04-2020||India||Coronavirus outbreak: 50 to 82% Covid cases in India are asymptomatic||50 to 82 per cent of India’s total coronavirus patients registered across states are asymptomatic, say officials from different states, presenting a difficulty in the further easing of lockdown norms beyond May 3.An asymptomatic coronavirus patient doesn’t show any visible symptoms of the disease because of various factors including a strong immune system and is a carrier of the virus who can spread it further if unchecked.Doctors said showing signs of Coved-19 depends on the load of the virus, one’s age and body immunity.“If the load is not very high and virus is not virulent, the symptoms may not be there. But, it can be detected through test,” Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana said.Dr C Nagaraja, Director Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases in Bangalore said younger patient with a good immunity may not show any signs of the disease. Most of the asymptomatic patients are in the age group of 20-45. “Even older persons taking certain medicines may not show any signs initially. Those with weak immunity and co-morbid conditions show Covid signs faster,” he said. There have been instances when persons kept in observation have turned Covid positive after a long time. In central Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district, a girl student, who travelled in a train compartment with some Tablighi Jamaat members, tested positive after 22 days of her trip. Under observation, she remained asymptomatic throughout but turned positive when her observation period was about to end, said district medical officer, Dr N Sheeja.A 21-month old baby in Kolkata tested positive after being cured for mild fever. “There were no signs (of Covid). We got him tested when we saw patches in his lungs in his X-ray,” said a doctor, who was not willing to be quoted. Instances of persons reporting positive after being in observation for long period have been reported from Kozhikode in north Kerala and SBS Nagar in Punjab. Identifying such persons is difficult unless massive testing is done. As of now, the government tests contacts of a positive person and those living near the Covid containment areas to identify symptomatic persons. Testing of asymptomatic patients has started only in the recent past.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19However, with the government deciding to introduce rapid and pool testing, the reporting of such cases is likely to increase in the coming days. While all states have started rapid tests, some such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have initiated pool testing, in which samples of up to 64 persons are tested together. If the combined test is positive, then all persons are tested individually to identify those carrying the virus.Assam presents a scenario of a state that may not report many cases as most positive cases were found to be asymptomatic. Assam did not report any Covid cases till March 25. Nearly 82% of the 34 Covid-19 patients in Assam were asymptomatic, said health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. “They didn’t show any of the typical symptoms associated with the disease during treatment,” health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday.This is not restricted to smaller states.Around 75% of total Covid cases in Punjab, 50% in Karnataka, 65% in Maharashtra and 75 % in Uttar Pradesh were asymptomatic. “Most of the Covid-19 positive cases in Haryana are asymptomatic,” Dr Kamboj said.In Delhi, all 28 persons tested positive in Jehangirpuri on Saturday were symptom-free. “One of them was working at a food distribution Centre. We have isolated all persons working there and are identifying people he may have served food to,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.Countries such as South Korea, Japan and China, where the number of Covid-19 have declined have started an exercise to identify the asymptomatic carriers. According to a report in South China Daily Post, around 43,000 symptoms free careers have been identified and isolated. Similarly, in South Korea more than 30,000 such persons have been identified, reported multiple new agencies.Experts, however, said that asymptomatic patients are not a big threat if the chain of transmission is broken and the lock-down is an effective way of doing that.“Lockdown is effective in breaking the (transmission) chain,” said ICMR head Balram Bhargava.Dr. Karan Peepre, medical superintendent, AIIMS, Raipur, said the only way to deal with asymptomatic persons is quick identification through massive testing and isolation. Uttar Pradesh health secretary Amit Mohan Prasad said identifying hotspots is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease by symptom-free patients. Andhra Pradesh Covid nodal officer, D Arja Sreekanth said identifying such persons is not easy and therefore, they are conducting door to door survey.“We are also testing all those above 60 years having co-morbid issues like diabetes, hypertension, past history of tuberculosis etc, though they might not have Covid-19 symptoms,” he said.ALSO READ:Lockdown 2.0 relaxation: Government lists permitted and banned activities from April 20||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-latest-update-asymptomatic-covid-cases-between-50-to-82-highlight-the-threat-from-silent-carriers/story-sC6bMC5NPELoC1AowuiLQL.html
19-04-2020||India||Amid lockdown, illegal hunting of wild animals spikes in Northeast||Amid the lockdown across the country to prevent the spread of Covid-19, several incidents of wild animals being killed for food have surfaced in the northeast.It is not known how those who allegedly killed the wild animals could move around during the lockdown without being intercepted.A nearly 10-foot long king cobra was killed by residents of a village in Naharlagun area of Arunachal Pradesh on Friday. Video clips doing rounds on social media showed a person carrying the dead snake wrapped around his neck and body. Another one showed three persons placing the dead snake on banana leaves and getting ready to cut it. .“Because of the lockdown I felt like eating meat and went to the jungle…. I was hungry. Government officials please don’t get offended, we usually don’t do this,” said an unidentified person in the video.Senior forest officials in Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar confirmed the incident and said that the person who killed the snake and two others shown in the videos have been identified. The trio reportedly ate the snake meat.“A forest team went to the place to inquire and was able to verify the snake had been killed and consumed. The forest personnel had to retreat as local residents surrounded them. The main accused who is from Kurung Kumey district is absconding,” state deputy chief wildlife warden Umesh Kumar said.“King cobra is a very rare species listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act found in the foothills of forests. Killing it could lead to an imprisonment of up to 5 years or fine of Rs 25,000 or both,” he added.Chief Minister Pema Khandu told The Arunachal Times that strict action would be taken against those who indulge in illegal hunting of wildlife. He added that instructions have been issued to forest officials to ensure there is no hunting and illegal felling of trees during the lockdown.In neighbouring Assam, villagers in Golaghat district killed a leopard on Friday and decamped with its flesh, skin, claws, tail and teeth.“We came to know about the incident after photos of the animal was circulated on WhatsApp. Villagers didn’t help us, but we found traces of flood in a nearby jungle and found the leopard’s carcass buried in a pit,” said Mirel Ahmed, sub-inspector at Golaghat police station.“The leopard’s two hind legs, skin, tail, claws and teeth were missing. The forest officials have been informed about the incident and they are investigating. No one has been arrested yet,” he added.Another video clip which surfaced on Sunday shows at least two men killing several deer, one civet and some other animals inside a forest in Nagaland and roasting them on a temporary platform.The youths are seen saying that they are doing this during the lockdown. Though the exact location is yet to be confirmed, some reports say that it happened inside the Intanki, Nagaland’s lone national park in Peren district.Deputy Commissioner of Peren, Sentiwapang Aier said that he was not aware of the video or the incident and will have to get it confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-illegal-hunting-of-wild-animals-spikes-in-northeast/story-rujd1W94lvhMSWFDmYKvfJ.html
19-04-2020||India||Trump, WHO chief’s face-off over Covid-19 could spark fireworks at annual event||US President Donald Trump and his administration’s consistent attacks on the World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus have set up a face-off at the proposed annual meeting of the World Health Assembly on May 18.Trump, who has long accused the Tedros-led WHO of playing into China’s hands over the coronavirus disease, this week suspended funding to the global health body. By then, the Ethopian microbiologist who was elected to lead the WHO in 2017 with support from Xi Jinping’s China, had already galvanised support from African and most Non-Aligned countries.To be sure, diplomats based in Geneva where the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly take place told Hindustan Times that the three-hour long video conference would end up in an anodyne resolution calling for a global fight against the spread of Covid-19 with all member nations uploading their statements. Even the most hard-hit European countries and the UK have desisted from criticising the WHO director general at this point, saying this isn’t the time to play politics but fight the virus.Also Read: Geostrategic paralysis in face of Covid-19 could open a role for India | OpinionHowever, every representative of the 194-member body is expected to scrutinise the US statement as President Donald Trump has led the attack against Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, accusing him of playing into the hands of the Chinese government and downplaying the threat posed by the deadly virus that has claimed 157,000 lives worldwide.President Trump on Sunday went a step ahead when he warned of consequences to the Xi Jinping regime if it was found that China had deliberately suppressed facts about the origin and spread of the virus that originated from Wuhan province.The US charges against WHO were largely summed up by the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the US Congress, which in a letter on April 9 to Dr Ghebreyesus made it clear that the organisation was “no longer serving the needs of the world and instead taking its cues from China.”Also Read: Reforming the World Health Organization | OpinionWhile India has not formally taken a stand against Dr Ghebreyesus over its assessment that the focus should be Covid-19 and not WHO director general, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was first to indirectly question the body during a G-20 meeting last month when he wondered if a 20th century body would be able to handle the new-age diseases.The US position is in contrast to the stand taken by African Union and countries and Non-Aligned Movement. Dr Ghebreyesus hails from Ethiopia, which has been a member of the movement for nearly 40 years.The US is unhappy that as late as January 14, 2020, the WHO denied that there was community transmission in Wuhan despite warnings of human-to-human transmission by a non member Taiwan the previous month.The WHO, the Trump administration believes, was late to declare Covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) January 30, 2020.By this time the disease had infected almost 10,000 people. In fact, Dr Ghebreyesus congratulated the Chinese government for taking extraordinary measures to contain the outbreak.The WHO, despite declaring Covid-19 a PHEIC and extensive evidence of transmission through travel, did not warn any country against travel, to or from China. Between December 31 and January 31, as many as 430,000 people flew on direct flights from China to the US.Covid-19 was only declared a pandemic on March 11 after it had raced around the world, sickening nearly 120,000 people in 110 countries and killing close to 4,400.However, much to the chagrin of Donald Trump and US lawmakers, WHO routinely praised China for its efforts to combat the spread of Covid-19 contrary to the accusations that Beijing had underreported the threat and gagged professionals such as doctors and journalists for speaking about the severity of the disease.Even though the World Health Assembly in Geneva may end up in a very diluted outcome. diplomats expect that there would be increasing pressure on China to respond to criticism that it hasn’t been transparent enough about the disease and the WHO, for the steps that it should have taken.At the UN Security Council meeting that belatedly discussed the pandemic last week, the US drove home the point by calling for “complete transparency” in the reporting of coronavirus data, a clear reference to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-who-chief-s-face-off-over-china-s-covid-19-role-could-spark-fireworks-at-annual-event/story-ae607RTc5DQy0Dj2PFthiM.html
19-04-2020||India||Bengal to start rapid antibody tests for Covid-19 infections soon||The West Bengal government will soon start rapid antibody tests in hotspots, clusters and containment zones to identify Covid-19 cases, a top official of the state health department said on Sunday.Interestingly, however, the results of the tests will not be revealed instantaneously even to the person, who has been tested, to prevent any panic mongering.“The state government will start rapid antibody tests. These tests will be done in hotspots, clusters and containment zones,” a top official of the state health department said.In areas where no Covid-19 cases have emerged so far, this test could be done for epidemiological purposes.“Considering the limited number of testing kits and to avoid wastage of this precious resource, prior approval of the state health department will have to be taken to conduct the tests,” said a health department official.The rapid antibody test is a supplementary tool to assess the prevalence of the disease within a specific area or perimeter. The rapid antibody test will only be of utility after a minimum of seven days of onset of symptomsUnlike the RT-PCR, which detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid tests detect antibodies in the blood and indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus. It can show results within 30 minutes. Once a person tests positive after the antibody test, an RT-PCR test is done to confirm the result.On Thursday, India received a batch of 5,50,000 rapid testing kits (RTKs) from China. The state government, however, has not provided any data on how many kits have arrived in the state.At least 14 medical colleges and government laboratories in 28 districts have been identified, which will conduct the tests with prior approval of the state health department. In Kolkata three such institutions – IPGMER, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and School of Tropical Medicine, have been identified. On Saturday, the Bengal government had decided to start ‘pool testing’ of asymptomatic Covid-19 suspects to further ramp up its testing record after repeatedly drawing flak for its low rate of Covid-19 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-start-rapid-antibody-tests-for-covid-19-infections-soon/story-nQBPxVBTTmbzIcO62iz8BJ.html
19-04-2020||India||After aviation minister’s ‘advice’, Air India stops bookings on all flight||Air India has stopped taking bookings on all flights, said its officials, a day after Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri “advised” airlines to open bookings only after the government takes a decision on resuming passenger flights.The minister’s comment came on Saturday night, hours after the national carrier stated that it has opened bookings on select domestic flights from May 4 and on select international flights from June 1. Amid the second phase of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Air India officials said on Sunday: “We have stopped all forward bookings now. Any passenger who has booked tickets on a flight, which has been cancelled, would be getting a credit voucher for future travel.” On April 3, during the first phase of the lockdown, Air India had announced that it has stopped bookings on both domestic and international flights till April 30.A notification on Air India’s website on Saturday read, “Bookings for select domestic flights for travel from May 4, 2020, and for international flights for travel from June 1, 2020, onwards are open.” The notification has been removed from the website.Private sector airlines, however, continue to take bookings May 4 onwards.Several passengers have complained on social media that Indian airlines are not giving refunds for flights cancelled due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown and instead issuing credit vouchers for future travel.On April 16, the Ministry of Civil Aviation stated that travellers can ask airlines for full refunds if the bookings were done during the first phase of the lockdown for travel up to May 3.The first phase of the lockdown imposed in the country in view of the coronavirus outbreak was from March 25 to April 14. The second phase started on April 15 and will end on May 3.All domestic and international commercial passenger flight operations have been suspended during the lockdown period. However, cargo flights and special flights authorised by aviation regulator DGCA have been permitted during this period.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 507 and the number of cases to 15,712 in the country on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-aviation-minister-s-advice-air-india-stops-bookings-on-all-flight/story-M8BijSgVt5AqzYBOKBXfdP.html
19-04-2020||India||PM Modi shares LinkedIn post on Covid-19. Read full text here||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the Covid-19 pandemic affects everyone equally and does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking.“COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together,” PM Modi said in a post in LinkedIn.Here’s the full text of the LinkedIn post:It has been a topsy-turvy start to the third decade of this century. COVID-19 has brought with it many disruptions. Coronavirus has significantly changed the contours of professional life. These days, home is the new office. The Internet is the new meeting room.For the time being, office breaks with colleagues are history. No alt text provided for this imageI have also been adapting to these changes. Most meetings, be it with minister colleagues, officials and world leaders, are now via video conferencing. In order to get ground level feedback from various stakeholders, there have been videoconference meetings with several sections of society. There were extensive interactions with NGOs, civil society groups and community organisations. There was an interaction with Radio Jockeys too. No alt text provided for this imageBesides that, I have been making numerous phone calls daily, taking feedback from different sections of society.One is seeing the ways through which people are continuing their work in these times. There are a few creative videos by our film stars conveying a relevant message of staying home. Our singers did an online concert. Chess players played chess digitally and through that contributed to the fight against COVID-19. Quite innovative! The work place is getting Digital First. And, why not?After all, the most transformational impact of Technology often happens in the lives of the poor. It is technology that demolishes bureaucratic hierarchies, eliminates middlemen and accelerates welfare measures.Let me give you an example. When we got the opportunity to serve in 2014, we started connecting Indians, especially the poor with their Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar & Mobile number. This seemingly simple connection has not only stopped corruption and rent seeking that was going on for decades, but has also enabled the Government to transfer money at the click of a button. This click of a button has replaced multiple levels of hierarchies on the file and also weeks of delay. India has perhaps the largest such infrastructure in the world. This infrastructure has helped us tremendously in transferring money directly and immediately to the poor and needy, benefiting crores of families, during the COVID-19 situation.Another case in point is the education sector. There are many outstanding professionals already innovating in this sector. Invigorating technology in this sector has its benefits. The Government of India has also undertaken efforts such as the DIKSHA Portal, to help teachers and boost e-learning. There is SWAYAM, aimed at improving access, equity and quality of education. E-Pathshala, which is available in many languages, enables access to various e-books and such learning material. Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models. India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal can take the lead in providing a new work culture. I envision this new business and work culture being redefined on the following vowels.I call them- vowels of the new normal- because like vowels in the English language, these would become essential ingredients of any business model in the post-COVID world.Adaptability: The need of the hour is to think of business and lifestyle models that are easily adaptable.Doing so would mean that even in a time of crisis, our offices, businesses and commerce could get moving faster, ensuring loss of life does not occur. Embracing digital payments is a prime example of adaptability. Shop owners big and small should invest in digital tools that keep commerce connected, especially in times of crisis. India is already witnessing an encouraging surge in digital transactions. Another example is telemedicine. We are already seeing several consultations without actually going to the clinic or hospital. Again, this is a positive sign. Can we think of business models to help further telemedicine across the world?Efficiency:Perhaps, this is the time to think of reimagining what we refer to as being efficient. Efficiency cannot only be about- how much time was spent in the office.We should perhaps think of models where productivity and efficiency matter more than appearance of effort.The emphasis should be on completing a task in the specified time frame. Inclusivity:Let us develop business models that attach primacy to care for the poor, the most vulnerable as well as our planet. We have made major progress in combating climate change. Mother Nature has demonstrated to us her magnificence, showing us how quickly it can flourish when human activity is slower. There is a significant future in developing technologies and practices that reduce our impact on the planet. Do more with less.COVID-19 has made us realise the need to work on health solutions at low cost and large scale. We can become a guiding light for global efforts to ensure the health and well being of humanity.We should invest in innovations to make sure our farmers have access to information, machinery, and markets no matter what the situation, that our citizens have access to essential goods. Opportunity:Every crisis brings with it an opportunity. COVID-19 is no different.Let us evaluate what might be the new opportunities/growth areas that would emerge now.Rather than playing catch up, India must be ahead of the curve in the post-COVID world. Let us think about how our people, our skills sets, our core capabilities can be used in doing so.Universalism: COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together. Unlike previous moments in history, when countries or societies faced off against each other, today we are together facing a common challenge. The future will be about togetherness and resilience.The next big ideas from India should find global relevance and application. They should have the ability to drive a positive change not merely for India but for the entire humankind. Logistics was previously only seen through the prism of physical infrastructure – roads, warehouses, ports. But logistical experts these days can control global supply chains through the comfort of their own homes. India, with the right blend of the physical and the virtual can emerge as the global nerve centre of complex modern multinational supply chains in the post COVID-19 world. Let us rise to that occasion and seize this opportunity. I urge you all to think about this and contribute to the discourse.The shift from BYOD to WFH brings new challenges to balance the official and personal. Whatever be the case, devote time to fitness and exercising. Try Yoga as a means to improve physical and mental wellbeing. Traditional medicine systems of India are known to help keep the body fit. The Ayush Ministry has come out with a protocol that would help in staying healthy. Have a look at these as well. Lastly, and importantly, please download Aarogya Setu Mobile App. This is a futuristic App that leverages technology to help contain the possible spread of COVID-19. More the downloads, more its effectiveness. Will wait to hear from you all…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/read-pm-modi-s-full-linkedin-text-on-covid-19/story-5hRfwawDMU79iWcAsiFB1O.html
19-04-2020||India||Bihar BJP MLA gets pass to drive to Kota to bring back daughter||While Bihar chief minister Nitish has been steadfast in refusing to evacuate the state’s students stranded in in Kota in Rajasthan during the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, his ally BJP’s MLA from Hisua (Nawada), Anil Singh has just returned from Kota with his daughter.Singh had obtained a pass from the Nawada district administration for driving to Kota and back, a distance of over 2,200 km. Kota is a coaching hub for medical and engineering competitive exams and draws students from different parts of the country. After the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to evacuate its students in 250 buses, Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh governments are also planning to do the same, which would increase the pressure on Nitish Kumar further to carry out similar evacuation.Nawada ‘s sub-divisional officer (SDO) Anu Kumar, who is authorized to issue passes, said the MLA had claimed that his daughter who was preparing for medical entrance exams at Allen Institute, was not well and needed to be brought back.“He had met the district magistrate also. We do issue passes when required, but only to vehicles from Nawada needing to go anywhere,” he added.The pass was issued in the name of the legislator for a 10-day period from April 16 to April 25. He returned on April 18 after driving virtually nonstop.The MLA said that he had done no wrong nor any of his actions could be termed violation of lockdown in anyway. “There is provision for pass in view of extremely important work. I applied for e-pass as per laid down provisions as for me bringing my daughter was of utmost importance, the pass was issued and I went following the guidelines and returned. What is wrong in it? There should not be politics over it,” he asked.“Most of the children have left Kota after they met the district magistrate in groups and the latter issued passes to them to travel in buses. However, I don’t approve of that, as the very concept of social distancing would not be maintained in buses. I went on my personal vehicle along with food and water so that I did not have to stop anywhere,” he added.Poll strategist Prashant Kishor, however, was unsparing in his attack on Nitish Kumar, his former boss. “Nitishji rejected the appeal of hundreds of students stranded in Kota on the plea that it would be against the spirit of lockdown, but his government was quick to grant special permission to a BJP MLA to bring his ward back,” he tweeted.RJD was also quick to describe it as a reflection of VIP culture. RJD leader Mriyunjay Tiwari said there should not be double standard.BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said the MLA had followed all the procedures and there should not be any politics over it. “District administrations issue travel passes to anyone for a genuine cause. There is no special treatment. Some people are in the habit of misinterpreting things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-bjp-mla-gets-pass-to-drive-to-kota-to-bring-back-daughter/story-Pm6tqTprtriDhyhbUYV9WL.html
19-04-2020||India||Lockdown 2.0 relaxation: Government lists permitted and banned activities from April 20||The union government on Saturday reminded everyone that only selective relaxation will be allowed during the second phase of lockdown beginning midnight with the purpose of restarting the rural economy and providing earning opportunities to the daily-wage earning class including migrant labourers.Centre made it clear that the limited commercial activities will only be allowed in non-Covid-19 hotspots or containment zones. The government added that the relaxation will have no impact on most containment measures in force during the lockdown and people should remember that the prohibition on activities that threaten community transmissions will continue.Here’s the list of activities/services that will continue to be under suspension despite the relaxations that will come into effect from April 20 in certain areas. 1. Passenger traffic movement by rail, road and air--except in places where they have been exempted by the local administration as part of relaxations.2. Educational and related institutions including schools, colleges, vocational training centres.3. Most industrial, commercial activity and hospitality services including hotels (unless they are specially exempted)4. Cinema halls and entertainment complexes.5. Shopping malls, shopping complexes and entertainment parks.6. Social, political, cultural, entertainment, academic and sports gatherings.7. Religious places, places of worship and religious congregations.8. Taxi services including autos and cab aggregators.The government said it was important that no mistake is made while restoring services which could be counterproductive to the containment efforts leading to an outcome the country can ill-afford at this stage.“Agricultural and related activities should be functional, rural economy should be functional, daily wage earners employment opportunities should be monitored, health services should remain functional, the supply chain of essential goods should be maintained. Our effort is to gradually restore normalcy to ensure that both life and livelihoods are protected,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry while listing some of the services that will continue to be in operation in the last leg of the second phase of lockdown starting April 20.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Agarwal said that several offices, workplaces, factories and other establishments outside hotspots or containment zones will start operating from April 20 but they will have to ensure social distancing. He added that big industrial units are being encouraged to house migrant workers inside their premises to prevent a possible spread in infections.“Hotspots are those areas were a large number of Covid-19 cases have been found or where the doubling rate is less than 4 days,” Agarwal defined the term for the purpose of identifying containment zones.He added that if any of the areas enjoying relaxations report positive cases they can be converted into containment zones and relaxations will be withdrawn.He made it clear that lockdown SOPs will have to be followed even in areas outside these containment zones where selective relaxations will be allowed.No relaxation is permitted for containment zones where only essential services will be allowed.Also Read: Covid-19 Latest Update: India’s recovery rate showing improvement at 14.91%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-2-0-relaxation-government-lists-permitted-and-banned-activities-from-april-20/story-WhdmAH6Gq1gHB2iDVJZv9L.html

The plea, which said that health care workers and police officials have been attacked by mobs in some states while they were discharging their duties during the lockdown, has also sought a direction to the authorities for laying down guidelines and devise strategy to protect the fundamental rights of citizens.It has said that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the National Investigation Agency (NIA) should be directed to probe into matters related to assembly of people in various parts of the country during the lockdown, which has been extended till May 3.“In order to control the spread of coronavirus, proper lockdown is very necessary and in order to keep the lockdown...deployment of military force in each state of India is very necessary. Therefore, the military force should be deployed as soon as possible for the benefit of the citizens of India,” petitioner K R Shenoy has said in the plea.The petition has claimed that despite action taken by various states, people engaged in health sector and police officials were still being attacked and this was causing problem in controlling the novel coronavirus.“It is also pertinent to note that people who are quarantined or under treatment are continuously trying to run away from the quarantine centre, hospitals etc which is again increasing the chance of spread of coronavirus, therefore more security needs to be increased at these places,” the plea said.It has also raised issue of gathering of people in some states, where COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly, on the pretext of wanting to go back to their native places.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 507 and the number of cases to 15,712 in the country on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-plea-seeking-military-deployment-for-proper-implementation-of-lockdown-filed-in-supreme-court/story-EgnhqIwC7iBewkTjrxCj4K.html
19-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Plea in Supreme Court for action against landlords pressuring students, labourers for rent||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking action against the “arbitrary and unlawful action” of landlords demanding rent from students and labourers during the lockdown despite a government order to the contrary. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued an order on March 29 which stops landlords from demanding rent from students, workers and migrant labourers for a month. Those landlords who force people to vacate their houses will face action, the MHA statement warns.The order, issued under the Disaster Management Act, had said employers will pay their workers’ wages on due dates without any deduction.The petition filed by advocate Pawan Prakash Pathak and others, has sought implementation of the home ministry’s March 29 order that no landlord will collect rent from the labour class and students for a month during COVID-19 period and those who violate it would be punished.“Petition is being filled against the arbitrary and unlawful action of landlords in the state of Delhi amid COVID-19 where there is clear instruction issued by the Ministry of Home affairs that in order to maintain the lockdown situation and law and order during COVID-19, order dated March 29, 2020 ‘restraining all landlord to forcing labours and students to vacate their premises’, in case they fail to pay rent during this period,” the plea said.The PIL said irrespective of the MHA order, various landlords were forcing tenant students to pay full rent, failing which they will be thrown out of premises.“Many landlords are continuously putting pressure on students to pay their rent and the students are living in constant fear and depressions. They are feeling helpless in this situation as they can’t demand money from their parents because their parents are also suffering from financial crisis due to the lockdown. In such a situation one is left with one option i.e opportunity cost of money, either one can pay rent out of same amount or one can buy essential ration and food for family during this period,” the plea said.The petition said that in a situation like this, the students who are staying in rented accommodations have limited resources at their disposal.“Most of the students stuck are from humble background and they supplement their expenses by working part time -- for instance by taking up tuition. But in situations like this, they are struck in dire straits. If they will not be helped by the government concerned then they have to live in constant fear and depression caused by the financial crisis,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-plea-in-supreme-court-for-action-against-landlords-pressuring-students-labourers-for-rent/story-k8DateMuHq3F7yKWLv42YO.html

The rapid test kits help examine whether a person has developed antibodies in their blood stream to fight the novel coronavirus, which indicates whether a person has been exposed to or has COVID-19. The results of these tests take around 30 minutes. Doctors and healthcare workers can then determine the number of people who could be infected in a population sample. The kits would be used in the 83 red zones in the valley on a priority basis to help the administration expand the testing in these designated areas, the officials said. “We have received the first batch of 9,600 rapid testing kits,” Director, Health Services, Kashmir, Dr Samir Mattoo told PTI. Mattoo said the kits were being dispatched to red zones in the valley and it would be distributed to each such containment zone. The kits provide the results on the spot and would cut the time taken to determine the results, he said. The process will be hastened as these kits provide the results in about half-an-hour only, the director added. Health officials said the rapid testing kits would help in expanding the testing in the areas designated as red zones. These kits would first be used to test people in each red zone and would also be used to test the frontline health workers, the officials said. “Afterwards, the testing areas will be increased with the increase in the number of kits,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-first-batch-of-9-600-rapid-test-kits-arrive-in-kashmir-valley/story-2dTKgsHTu18aHNoMVIiI4N.html
19-04-2020||India||Lockdown 2.0 Update: Govt order on migrant workers resuming work explained||The union home ministry has issued a standard operating protocol for the movement of stranded migrant labourers within the states and Union Territories from April 20, when additional commercial activities resume in non-coronavirus hotspots. The government notice says that these migrant workers could be engaged in industrial, manufacturing, construction, farming and MNREGA works and the local administration could follow the guidelines being issued to facilitate their movement within the geographical boundaries of the state and or a Union territory.Here’s what this order means for hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers who are mostly living out of relief camps set up by state governments.1. A registration exercise will be carried out at the relief camps for migrants where their skills will be noted to identify their work area like construction, manufacturing, sanitisation etc.2. Migrant workers will be transported to their place of work within the state if they express a desire to do so. But they will be first screened for the possibility of coronavirus infection and only those found with no symptoms will be allowed to return to their place of work.3. In no condition will the migrant workers be allowed to move or transported outside the state or Union territory where they are located currently. That would mean that a migrant worker who was employed in Kerala but travelled to Karnataka before he was put up in a relief camp will not be allowed to return to Kerala and will need to find work in Karnataka for the time being.4. Buses transporting migrants will have to be sanitized and the migrants will have to observe social distancing norms while travelling to their places of work.5. The local authorites are also directed to provide food and water to the migrants for their journey to the place of work.6.The migrant labourers who will continue to stay at the relief centres should be given nutritious food to ensure they stay healthy.

19-04-2020||India||High self-isolation standards in Asia’s highest motorable village and lockdown orders from a goddess||Two villages in Himachal Pradesh with two distinctive identities, one with the highest motorable road and the other renowned for its potent “tourist attraction” and ancient governance system, have set high standards in how communities can self-isolate for protection against Covid-19 without the administration or police wasting valuable time enforcing rules.Welcome to Komic and Malana, where villagers, with remarkable maturity, have banned the movement of people voluntarily, knowing they have to save lives at any cost. The ruling deity in the latter village also issued lockdown orders much before the government didVillagers in Komic – situated 15,500 feet above sea level – now rarely step out of their homes and strictly adhere to guidelines issued by the state government. They have restricted farm activities too. “We hardly go out and the children study at home,” says local resident Palzor.The youngsters have made a time table which they follow diligently and study for four hours a day, she says.Komic does not have a ration depot, but the villagers who have to travel 30 km to the nearest market in Kaza, have stocked up for the next six months. They are habituated to doing so as the entire Lahaul and Spiti district remains cut from the rest of the state for about six months a year due to heavy snowfall in Rohtang pass.The only problem, Palzor says, is that relay signals for television are weak and they don’t have internet facilities.Deity’s orders Malana, an ancient village located in scenic Kullu district’s Parvati valley, was the first panchayat in HP to restrict entry of outsiders from March 18, much ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s March 24 lockdown call.Villagers like to say they have simply followed the orders of their supreme deity, Jamlu, who wished it so. Said to be descendants of Greek king Alexander’s soldiers, the Malanis as locals are known, have their own parliamentary system comprising an upper house called Jayeshthang and a lower house called Kanishthang.The reason why they anticipated problems and closed their borders ahead of others is the dubious local trade here in Malana cream, a strain of Cannabis hashish with high oil content and an intensely fragrant aroma.Despite the government’s efforts to stop its production, Malana cream still attracts people from all around the world.That’s also why many restaurants have sprung up here. “There are 20 odd restaurant owners who have remained in Malana. “We have told them that if they leave the village they would not be allowed to return”, says Bhagi Ram, head of the local panchayat, which has a population of 4,700 . Ram said ration was not a problem and they had adequate stocks.The Malanis use the Kanashi dialect, which is much different from the others spoken in the Kullu region.Traditionally, inhabitants of this land-locked village used to make baskets, ropes and slippers from hemp. But in the late 1980s, visiting foreigners taught people here the methods of extracting the intoxicating resin from cannabis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-self-isolation-standards-in-asia-s-highest-motorable-village-and-lockdown-orders-from-a-goddess/story-wrJRS595TQ6sEO5hwu0QbN.html

So we have decided to implement lockdown at Aurangabad jail. Arrangements for food and for the stay of police personnel will be made inside the jail complex,” Deshmukh said.The state government has also decided that no one will be allowed to come out or go inside the Aurangabad jail.In an attempt to stop the Covid-19 infection from spreading inside the prisons of Maharashtra, which are already packed to capacity, a similar decision has been taken for five more jails in Maharashtra, Deshmukh added.Earlier, this month, a city-based non-governmental organisation had moved the Bombay high court seeking speedy decongestion of prisons across Maharashtra, as ordered by the Supreme Court.Taking cognizance of the threat created by the coronavirus pandemic, on March 23, the apex court had directed all states and union territories to decongest prisons to the maximum possible extent. The Supreme Court had ordered setting up of high-powered committees at state levels to determine the class or classes of prisoners who could be temporarily released from prisons in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The apex court said the states and union territories could release certain categories of prisoners, like undertrials facing charges of offences punishable with imprisonment for up to seven years or prisoners convicted for similar offences.Maharashtra, which has been the worst-hit in the Covid-19 pandemic, leads in terms of the number of active cases of Covid-19, according to Union health ministry data. Active cases exclude deaths and recoveries from the list of confirmed cases.The number of coronavirus patients in Maharashtra has already crossed the 3000 mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-to-impose-lockdown-at-aurangabad-jail-5-other-prisons-deshmukh/story-r2pQoVAdAeM4TZqKP7Pg5N.html

The Army took day-time charge of the facility, one of the largest in the country for handling Covid-19 suspected cases, on April 16, the statement said.Established by the Delhi government in mid-March, around 1,250 people were kept in the centre, including an initial lot of 250 foreign nationals. A team of army doctors and nursing staff has been assisting the civil administration at the Narela quarantine centre since April 1.“Presently, 932 members from markaz (centre) are being taken care in the facility and 367 out of them have been tested Covid-19 positive,” the Army said. The Army team managing the facility includes six medical officers, 18 paramedical staff and a few personnel providing administrative security who have all volunteered to stay on the premises.As reported by Hindustan Times on April 7, the police filed an FIR against two Jamaat members, residents of Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki district, for defecating in front of their room at the Narela quarantine centre.“The professional approach of the army medical team has won the hearts of inmates, who have been very cooperative, facilitating smooth handling of all medical procedures,” the army said, adding that is “tremendous synergy” with the civil administration to run the facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-army-takes-over-day-time-management-of-delhi-quarantine-centre-which-houses-jamaat-members/story-Sp8DaKTQIDXEcmwMkhRxJN.html

It has been highlighted that the damage to the structure of the holy gurdwara has caused great consternation to the members of the Sikh community,” said one of the people cited above.“The Sikhs’ strong sense of faith and devotion to the holy site must be fully understood and appreciated. India has urged Pakistan that, in deference to the sentiments of the Sikh community, the deficiencies which led to the damage to the newly constructed structures should be urgently rectified and remedied,” the person added.The photos posted on social media appeared to suggest the damaged domes were made of some light material and not concrete reinforced with iron rods, which is usually used for such structures.On Sunday, Pakistani authorities also issued photos that showed the domes has been repaired.Despite security concerns and opposition to a service fee of $20 charged from every Indian pilgrim, the Indian government last year agreed to the opening of the cross-border Kartarpur Corridor that allows Indians to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib without visas.Pakistani authorities had said the $20 fee was aimed at raising funds for the maintenance and upkeep of the gurdwara.The gurdwara was renovated and a massive complex was created around it during 2019.

However, the workers should be in-situ. They should not travel,” Thackeray said, asking the businesses to take care of the workers and house them.Till Saturday, the state reported 3,648 coronavirus cases and 211 deaths. Green zones are where there have no reports of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, while orange zones are the ones where a few cases have been reported. India has identified 170 hot spot districts, or red zones, where the relaxations will not be applicable.Till Saturday evening, Maharashtra has conducted 66,800 tests, of which 95% were negative, Thackeray said. “Of the 3600 people tested positive, 75% are showing mild symptoms.

Unemployed, a large section of these migrant labourers is at present housed in shelters run by state governments and Union Territories (UTs).Such workers stranded in states and UTs should be registered with local authorities, and an assessment of their skills should be carried out, the home ministry order said. If these people want to return to their workplace within the state where they are stranded, a screening would be done and those not showing symptoms of Covid-19 will be ferried to the factory or the unit concerned.During the bus journey, social distancing norms will be followed, and local authorities should give them food and water for the road trip. The order also said federal guidelines issued on April 15, in which the government laid down the terms for conditional resumption of activities in certain areas, should be strictly followed.Late last month, the Uttar Pradesh government evacuated thousands of its workers from Delhi and the National Capital region who were stranded due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-bars-inter-state-movement-of-labourers-as-economy-reboots-monday/story-lPtxZOI4Hu9O1jbm1INCvN.html

At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in Kerala, the state IT department had inked an agreement with the US firm to process a huge volume of data collected by grassroot health workers of the state. Though no money was involved in the contract the opposition alleged that it was a breach of privacy and vital data. Later, it was found that the state cabinet and law department were not consulted before signing the deal.Earlier, the CM had defended the government’s decision saying no fee was involved in the contract and one of the top officials of the data firm was an NRI from the state and he offered the proposal to the government “in lieu of looking after his aged parents in Mavelikkara in Alapuzha district”. He had said there was no transfer of the data and it will be stored in a secure server in the country and denied any breach of privacy.As the controversy flared up, state IT secretary M Shivasankar, also the CM’s private secretary told the media on Saturday that he had taken the decision personally, as the pandemic situation was getting out of control in the state. Later, he also appeared in a promotional video of the deal which was removed from the Sprinklr’s website after the controversy cropped up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-fight-kerala-govt-lands-in-row-over-it-deal-with-us-based-firm/story-l1eGG3YSGG0u00jvBMaNtN.html

Long queues outside banks in rural areas have been seen in the second phase of lockdown that started on April 15.The death was reported from State Bank of India’s Common Service Centre at Ranighagar village under Masliya police station in Dumka district, around 300-km from capital Ranchi, on Saturday. The deceased was identified as Kaloni Tudu, resident of Kesho Raidih village.Masliya police station in-charge Sanjay Kumar said, “The woman went to draw Rs 500 from her Jan-Dhan account, which was credited by government. Tudu was in the queue for more than one and a half hour. She suddenly fainted and fell on the ground. Other persons who were in same queue sprayed water on her face but she did not wake up. Later, doctor declared her dead.”Her husband Karan Murmu said Tudu had left home with few other women of the village and joined the beeline before the CSC. “The CSC lacks even basic facility like drinking water and shade. Customers stand in scorching heat to draw money,” Murmu said.SBI’s Ranighagar branch manager Alok Kumar said the CSC was adjacent to the main branch. “The CSC was set up recently and the person handling it is also new and not so experienced. Therefore, the main branch is handling most of the customers. The woman, who died in the queue, was third in the queue. But, she suddenly fainted and died.”The branch manager, however, rejected the charge that there was no shade or drinking water at the bank. “We have ensured all basic facilities for customers in the CSC,” he said.From across the Hindi heartland of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan and Haryana, there have been reports of women having to wait for hours to withdraw Rs 500 from their Jan Dhan accounts paid by the government as cash relief during lockdown. The money has been deposited in around 200 million Jan Dhan accounts till April 3, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry.Bank officials in various states such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha said the rush has increased in the second phase of the lockdown as the savings of most poor families may have exhausted. The officials said a rumour, that the government will take back the money if not withdrawn in April, also contributed to the rush.In Jharkhand, a sexagenarian couple on Saturday walked for 10 kilometres to a bank branch to draw Rs 500 in Ranchi’s Lapung area. The woman Mangra Devi, who is visually impaired, walked to the branch with her husband Charku Paik using a stick. “We walked back home safely,” said Paik, happy to have got some money at the time of crisis. In Madhya Pradesh, a 65-year-old woman, Laxmi Devi, failed to withdraw the relief money even after three visits. “The queue is very long and the bank takes so much time to give the money. I did not get the chance and will go back again on Monday,” she said, while complaining of no water facility or shade outside the bank.Khushbu, 22, resident of Basini village in Bihar’s Kaimur district, walked 20 km, to withdraw Rs 500 on Saturday. “I reached the branch at about 1 pm and waited in the queue for 2 hours under scorching heat but could not withdraw the amount. Then the manager came out and assured us that the amount will neither lapse nor be returned and asked me to return home if there was no emergency for money,” she said.Widow Ram Singari Kunwar, 88, of Parhuti village in Bihar’s Bhagwanpur block has not been able to reach the bank, 5 km away from her village, in absence of public transport.Rural women across India are facing hardship in the process of withdrawing relief money from their Jan Dhan accounts.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Raj Kumar Pandey, a CSC operator at Bihar’s Ramgarh district said there is not enough women police force to ensure social distancing and it takes some time to give money to each person as most of the women are semi-literate or illiterate. Ajaz Hamid, lead bank manager in Rohtas district of Bihar said a lot of misinformation had also contributed to the sudden rush at the banks. “As there is a rumour that if money is not withdrawn in April itself it would be taken back, women were thronging to the CSCs,” he said.Bank officials said that the rush increased in the last few days. Jharkhand’s State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) senior manager Bibhaw Kumar said there was routine traffic of customers at the end of the first phase of lockdown. Between April 3 and April 9, a mere 15% to 16% of customers withdrew money.“Rush is being witnessed for the past three days in the second phase of lockdown. Withdrawal till April 18 reached 38%,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-woman-dies-waiting-in-a-bank-queue-to-withdraw-rs-500-from-jan-dhan-account-rural-areas-see-big-rush/story-AK17D75HOAYHXBNYu7jKoO.html

An expert committee was asked to look into it and they are of the opinion that there isn’t enough scientific evidence against it,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.The technical team extensively went through available evidence on the use of disinfectant as a spray.“In view of the above, the following advisory is issued: spraying of individuals or groups is NOT recommended under any circumstances. Spraying an individual or group with chemical disinfectants is physically and psychologically harmful,” the health ministry’s advisory stated.“Even if a person is potentially exposed [to] the Covid-19 virus, spraying the external part of the body does not kill the virus that has entered your body. Also there is no scientific evidence to suggest that they are effective even in disinfecting the outer clothing/body in an effective manner.”The advisory added, “Spraying of chlorine on individuals can lead to irritation of eyes and skin and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. Inhalation of sodium hypochlorite can lead to irritation of mucous membranes to the nose, throat [and] respiratory tract and may also cause bronchospasm.“Additionally, use of such measures may in fact lead to a false sense of disinfection and safety and actually hamper public observance to hand washing and social distancing measures.”The advisory further stated: “The strategy seems to have gained of lot of media attention and is also being reportedly used at local levels in certain districts/local bodies. Purpose of the document was to examine the merit of using disinfectants as spray over human body to disinfect them from Covid-19, and to provide appropriate advisory.”Disinfectants are chemicals that destroy disease-causing pathogens or other harmful micro-organisms. The term refers to substances applied on inanimate objects owing to their strong chemical properties.Chemical disinfectants are recommended for cleaning and disinfection only of areas and surfaces frequently touched by those who are suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19.Precautionary measures are recommended, such as wearing gloves while using disinfectants for cleaning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-health-ministry-advisory-against-spraying-disinfectant-on-people/story-o7jFgx5ALwjuF9URHKjndM.html

Permission was granted to resume work in the first week of April. But by that time, one cycle for plucking leaves was over and a huge quantity of green leaves was damaged, prompting farmers to dump them.“It is estimated that one crore kilograms of green leaves, worth ₹ 20 crore, was damaged in the past few weeks in the district.”The society has approached the Tea Board for compensation after a survey, he said.“The state government should provide some relief to small and marginal tea growers as they are not registered with the Tea Board, having small fields where tea is grown,” Daftari said.In Kishanganj, the yearly tea production is estimated at 75 lakh kg, while green leaf production is nine crore kilograms annually. There are 10 processing units in the district with most tea growers concentrated in Pothia, Thakurganj and Kishanganj blocks.Struggle of pineapple farmersThe condition of pineapple farmers is no better, and Dulal Singh, a grower in Pothia block of Kisganganj, said thousands of fruits perished in the past few weeks because there was no way to send the produce to the nearest markets in north Bengal.“We sell our produce to wholesalers in Bengal and it is then sent to several states and Delhi. But due to the lockdown, there were no buyers and transportation is difficult. Our fruits are perishing each day because the summer heat is rising, which damages the fruit,” he said.Singh said the tropical fruits are lying in the fields.Mohammed Rafiq, another pineapple grower, said: “We invested ₹ 1 lakh to ₹ 3 lakh for the produce. But we are not even getting ₹ 2 for one pineapple these days, whereas it usually fetches a good price. We have been pushed back almost 10 years to 15 years in terms of trade losses, which is in crores.”Rafiq said the yield per acre is usually 12,000 pieces of pineapples.Bihar’s agriculture secretary N Saravana Kumar said the state government has taken up the matter of allowing fast transportation of pineapples with the West Bengal and the Central governments.“We are coordinating with the West Bengal government and the Centre to ensure buyers are able to buy produce from the fields of Kishanganj and other areas. We are making arrangements to ensure the pineapples reach markets in north Bengal by road and the district magistrates have been directed to keep tabs on this,” Kumar said.Referring to losses in the tea sector, Kumar said tea is in the commercial crops category and there are no provisions for compensation. “We have allowed the tea gardens to resume work and operations are going on now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tea-pineapple-farmers-stare-at-big-losses-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-Ypi5VLlyyU4Sz4AAab8MCJ.html

Asked if the government is looking at any timeline to start passenger transport services like trains or airlines, he told PTI, “It has to start one day but which is that one day you don’t know at this moment. Discussion about it is futile because we are examining the situation every day and drawing new lessons.”  Some airlines, Javadekar said, decided on their own to start bookings from May 4, and noted that Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has already clarified that the government has not taken any decision in this regard. A final decision on the issue will be taken by the government, he said, advising against any speculation over the matter. The ongoing nation-wide lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic is scheduled to end on May 3. Some airlines, including Air India, had opened bookings on select domestic routes from May 4, prompting Puri to advise them to open bookings only after the government takes a decision on starting domestic and international commercial passenger flight services. “The Ministry of Civil Aviation clarifies that so far no decision has been taken to open domestic or international operations... Airlines are advised to open their bookings only after a decision in this regard has been taken by the government,” Puri had said on Saturday.

These businesses have been impacted equally hard with farmers in Kishanganj district being forced to dump their produce due to lack of processing and prospective buyers leading to heavy monetary losses in the last few weeks.The tea growers’ association in Kishanganj has estimated losses worth Rs 20 crore due to non-plucking of green leaves in time (from March end to April first week) as the gardens and factories remained shut for work after lockdown.As per reports, growers dumped a large quantity of green leaves in the first flush from March 22 to April 7 as there were no buyers for the produce.Raj Karan Daftari, a tea garden owner and president of Ashok Bihar Tea Plantation Development Society, Kishanganj, said, “Around 5,000 small and marginal farmers growing tea (a cash crop) in their fields have been hit due to non-plucking of green leaves.”“After lockdown, our processing units and factories came to a halt. Permission was granted to resume work in April first week. But, by that time, one cycle of plucking of leaves was over and huge quantity of green leaves were damaged prompting farmers to dump them. Estimated one crore kg of green leaf, worth Rs 20 crore, was damaged in the past few weeks in the district,” Daftari said.The society has already approached the tea board for compensation after necessary survey, he said. “The state government should provide some relief to small and marginal tea growers as they are not registered with the tea board having small fields where tea is grown,” he said.In Kishanganj, the total tea production is estimated to be 75 lakh kg annually while green leaf production is nine crore kg annually. There are 10 processing units in the district with maximum tea growers concentrated in Pothia, Thakurganj and Kishanganj blocks.Struggle for pineapple farmersOn the other hand, the plight of pineapple farmers is more pitiable. Dulal Singh, a pineapple grower based in Pothia block of Kisganganj, said thousands of fruit pieces had perished in last few weeks because there was no way the produce could be sent to the nearest markets in north Bengal.“We sell our produce to the whole sellers in Bengal and it is sent to several states, including Delhi. But due to lockdown, there are no buyers at all and transportation is difficult. Our fruits are perishing each day because the summer heat is rising, which damages the fruit fast,” he said. Singh said the tropical fruit pieces are lying unplucked in the fields.“We invested Rs 1-3 lakh in the fields for the produce. But we are not even getting Rs 2 for one fruit these days when it usually fetches a good price. We have been pushed almost 10-15 years back in terms of trade losses, which is in crores,” said Mohammed Rafiq, another pineapple grower. He said the yield per acre is around 12,000 pieces of the tropical fruit.Meanwhile, agriculture secretary N Saravana Kumar said that the state government had taken up the matter of allowing fast transportation of pineapples to north Bengal with the West Bengal government and central government.“We are coordinating with the West Bengal government and Centre to ensure that buyers are able to buy the produce from the fields in Kishanganj and other areas. We are making arrangements to ensure that the pineapple produce reaches the markets in north Bengal by road and the DMs have been directed to keep tab on it,” the secretary said.On the losses in tea sector, the secretary said that the tea comes in commercial crop category and there are no provisions for any compensation. “We have allowed the tea gardens to resume work and operations are going on now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-hits-tea-pineapple-growers-in-bihar-farmers-dump-produce/story-4qNKLoiBAkpX5vgibRxOBO.html

Kejriwal said the national capital is witnessing a surge in coronavirus cases. The number of containment zones are also being increased. The chief minister said that keeping in mind the present situation in the national capital, the administration has decided to provide no relaxation in the lockdown restrictions. “The situation will be reviewed again after a week,” he said.Kejriwal said that as per Centre’s directive, while non-hotspots regions can see some relaxation in lockdown restrictions in the country from April 20, those marked as Covid-19 hostpots and as containment zones shall not get any relaxation from the lockdown restrictions.“There are as many as 77 Covid-19 containment zones in Delhi at present and all districts are categorised as hotspots,” Kejriwal said.“Yesterday, we received reports of 736 Covid-19 tests and 186 of them came out positive for coronavirus. That is 25%, which is high,” the chief minister said. The CM said that all these 186 people who have tested positive for coronavirus are asymptomatic. “These people showed no symptoms. We have no idea how many people are asymptomatic and are carrying the virus and spreading it to others,” he said.The chief minister informed that of 186 people who have tested positive for Covid-19, one was working at one of the food centres set up by the Delhi government. “Don’t know how many people he must have infected there. I have ordered the administration to rapid-test all those who come to eat at these food centres as well as the volunteers and workers there,” he said. Kejriwal said that coronavirus infection in the national capital is spreading but the situation is under control.“We need to be disciplined to be able to control this pandemic,” Kejriwal said. He said there were no new Covid-19 cases in containment zones where people showed discipline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-witnessing-surge-in-covid-19-cases-no-relaxation-in-lockdown-measures-cm-arvind-kejriwal/story-8g9byg552IaCbEHTuIWWoJ.html
19-04-2020||India||Haridwar, Nainital districts in Uttarakhand classified as ‘red zones’ after spike in Covid-19 cases||Authorities in Uttarakhand have designated Haridwar and Nainital as ‘red zones’ or hotspots after a spike in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in these two districts, news agency ANI reported on Sunday.Two more people, both in Haridwar had tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the hill state on Saturday, taking the state’s tally to 42.Yugal Kishor Pant, additional secretary (Health), said that 80% of the Covid-19 cases in the state are from Dehradun, Haridwar and Nainital districts. The state capital, Dehradun, has already been classified as a ‘red zone’.Earlier this week, the government divided the country into colour-coded areas depending on the level of infection— red zones indicate infection hotspots, orange some infection, while green denotes an area with no infections.The Union health ministry had declared 170 hotspots—123 hotspot districts with large outbreaks and 47 hotspot districts with clusters—in 25 states and Union territories.The districts seeing a high number of cases or high growth rate of infections were marked as hotspots; districts where some cases have been found as non-hotspots; and those which have reported no cases as green zones. The districts or cities contributing to more than 80% of the cases in the country or the state will be classified as hotspots (red zone), according to the government. Places that show a high rate of infection with a doubling rate of less than four days will also be in this category.All six metros—Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad—currently have a high number of cases. Apart from the 123 hotspots, 47 districts were marked under ‘cluster outbreaks’, where the virus spreads in clusters, more than 15 cases are reported and the infection shows no sign of stopping.Furthermore, 207 districts have been identified as potential hotspots or where there have been cases but the numbers were limited.Officials said on Saturday that one of the two people to test positive for the coronavirus disease is a migrant labourer—the first such case in the state. The second patient is a close contact of a person who attended the event of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi last month.“A 24-year-old migrant labourer, who initially worked in Rishikesh, and a 45-year-old female who is a close contact of a Jamaat attendee tested positive for coronavirus,” Dr Saroj Naithani, chief medical officer (CMO) of Haridwar district, said. “The migrant labourer had come to Rishikesh from Hathras area in Uttar Pradesh to work, but he was caught by officials on March 30 near Roorkee and sent to a relief camp. He was caught when he along with three others were going back to Hathras by taking a lift from a truck driver,” Dr Naithani added.The samples of the migrant labourer were sent for testing on April 16 after he complained of sore throat. Test results of three more people travelling with him are awaited.Dr Naithani said they have isolated the 45-year-old woman, who was already staying in a quarantine centre since she was found to be a close contact of another positive Covid-19 patient. “On Saturday, her two children were also isolated and their samples sent for testing. Her husband, however, has tested negative but is still being monitored by health officials for any symptoms in future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haridwar-nainital-districts-in-uttarakhand-classified-as-red-zones-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-GmPqR0ZyndZBSgCtV98WqN.html

While the contagion has brought more than half of the planet to a grinding halt, scientists are busy tracing Covid-19’s path to the human body.There are many theories doing the rounds when it comes to the origin of the novel coronavirus. Some even believe it was a result of a failed lab experiment. A study conducted by the Pew Research Centre suggests that most Americans believe that Covid-19 was lab-grown. Nearly three in ten Americans or a quarter of the American population, as many as 29% of those surveyed, believe that novel coronavirus was grown in a lab, the survey indicated. 43% of Americans believe that the virus came about naturally. The more scientific and believable theories rest on the premise that links the virus to its zoonotic traces, connecting it to bats.China’s world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which is a live animal market, was the place where a man was first reported to have got the infection from an animal. How did the infection reach Wuhan’s seafood market is still debatable.The identity of the animal source of coronavirus remains a key and an urgent question.Coronavirus is being increasingly linked to bats as the obscure animals have traditionally been found to have links with outbreaks in countries like Uganda and Bangladesh. Bats are believed to be the natural hosts of the SARS, MERS and the Ebola virus.In the case of SARS and MERS, the virus came from bats but was transmitted to humans via other animals. The 2002 Sars outbreak got to humans from bats through cat-like civets. MERS-CoV spread from bats to camels to humans.Some of the recently conducted studies point at scaly, ant-eating pangolins to be the intermediary animal between bats and humans in the case of Covid-19. Researchers in Guangzhou, China believe pangolins could be the probable animal source of the coronavirus outbreak. However, it is reported that pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items sold in Wuhan, the sale of the mammal is illegal.As per a research paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology, two researchers from the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou identified pangolins as the potential source of the Covid-19 virus. The researchers made their theory public in February 2020.The experts based their findings on “genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and from humans infected during the recent outbreak,” the research published in the Journal of Medical Virology read. “By analyzing more than 1 000 metagenomic samples and using molecular biology testing, they found that the positive rate of β coronavirus in pangolins was 70% and that the genome sequence of an isolated virus strain was 99% similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 virus”. The study, therefore, called for further investigation into the role of pangolins in transmitting coronavirus to humans.Earlier this week, the Indian Council of Medical Research also stated the possibility of pangolins acting as the intermediary animal between bats and humans. “We also conducted surveillance, in which we found that there are two types of bats, and they carried coronavirus which was not capable of affecting humans. It’s rare, maybe once in 1,000 years that it gets transmitted from bats to humans,” Indian Council of Medical Research’s (CMR) Gangakhedkar said during the press conference.“As per research in China, it was found that coronavirus might have originated due to mutation in bats. Bats might have transmitted it to pangolins, from pangolins it got transmitted to humans,” Gangakhedkar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/failed-lab-experiment-to-bats-and-pangolins-theories-around-origin-of-covid-19/story-yvf532omjHtlqbeNjdQO0M.html

19-04-2020||India||From a Twitter handle, the story of Pakistan’s new terror group for Kashmir||A freshly-minted terror group, The Resistance Front, set up in Jammu and Kashmir after Parliament scrapped its special status in August last year is funded and backed by Pakistan, a top counter-terror official in Kashmir told Hindustan Times.The group is one of the several efforts, often repeated in the past two decades, to give terrorism in Kashmir an indigenous face and give the Pakistan deep state, blamed for supporting terror, an alibi, the official said.The JK Pir Panjal Peace Forum was another, he said, adding that this was part of a pattern in Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence’s handling pressure over its support to terror groups in J&K.“We have been keeping track, on and off social media, and have spotted efforts to build a base of influencers in the Indian hinterland also,” the official said.Security officials who track terror in the valley and its links across the Line of Control, said the TRF was supported and backed by the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Sometimes, one of them said, the TRF even appears to be a proxy.Also Read: Four terrorists killed in Kashmir gunfightsSecurity agencies had first spotted the group on social media platforms such as Twitter and Telegram.Initially, it appeared to be one of the many handles operated from Pakistan that was sharply focused on Kashmir, abused the armed forces and made provocative claims about the ground situation in the Valley designed to incite others. Or posted photographs of the terrorists “martyred” or the jawans punished, he said.When one of the first grenades was thrown after the scrapping of Article 370 in Srinagar’s Hari Singh High Street on October 12, the TRF had claimed responsibility. Ditto with the next one within a fortnight that killed one civilian.This social media account, according to the internet protocol address, was being operated from Islamabad, the official said. Mostly from an Iphone.It wasn’t rocket science anyways. Kashmir was still under a lockdown and the Internet had been snapped simultaneously.The frequency of the posts increased after Kashmir got back the Internet. These social media accounts now had the target audience within earshot.But it was only last month that security forces came face-to-face with some newly-recruited cadre.Also Read: Terrorist caught in Afghanistan earlier this month was IS recruiter in Jammu and KashmirIn north Kashmir’s border district of Kupwara, the police on March 23 arrested six men who claimed to be part of the new group, The Resistance Front, or TRF. Their interrogation led the cops to their arms dump.Apart from 89 hand grenades, a joint team of the army and state police seized 8 AK rifles, 10 pistols, 20-odd detonator fuses and ammunition, Inspector General of Kashmir Vijay Kumar announced.The assessment about the TRF’s links with the Lashkar-e-Taiba was confirmed early this month when the TRF social media channels operating from Pakistan pushed out photographs of the terrorists killed in the Keran gunfight with the army’s Special Forces in Kupwara’s Keran sector. Five terrorists and an equal number of commandos were killed. It claimed that the five terrorists killed at the border were from the TRF. The route, which this group of infiltrators had taken, is believed to have been in use by Lashkar terrorists.It has, since then, been bombarding its channels with near-live updates of terror attacks and counter-terrorist operations. Or take responsibility.Also, officials point how the threats to people who speak against them or cooperate with the State have become shriller and frequent. Like when a terrorist drew out an AK-47 rifle concealed under his robe to shoot three CRPF jawans, the TRF rushed to claim responsibility, and described the killing of soldiers for the death of their cadre in recent incidents.In many ways, officials said this was the template followed by other social media handles of the group. In one case, the Twitter handle of the so-called administrator of the TRF - his alias sounded American - was also tracked down to Islamabad. One account which was suspended by the platform was again based in Islamabad. Another was named around the so-called resistance in the Valley, also traced through its IP address to Pakistan.“While the world is fighting the coronavirus, Pakistan is using the time to prepare for the next stage of violence in Jammu and Kashmir in the name of resistance against the so-called Indian occupation,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-a-twitter-handle-the-story-of-pakistan-s-new-terror-group-for-kashmir/story-Wgw0Q4ccsL3B8Sg5y3hx2N.html

Senior district police officers rushed to the spot but could not enter the premises as the inmates had blocked the main gate from inside. The crisis ended in the evening after the officials diffused the tension by talking to the inmates.Most of the agitators are undertrial prisoners, officials said. The inmates separated the new and old jail complexes by locking the connecting gates. They took six jail wardens and eight cleaning staff hostage.A police officer, who did not want to be identified, said most of the agitators had been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Such inmates are not entitled to bail although the Supreme Court recently took note of the lockdown in courts and showed leniency towards jail inmates being tried or convicted for some specific offences.In its order, the apex court said those booked for crimes against women and children, waging war against the state and other serious offences cannot be released. Bengal and other states have already released thousands of inmates on bail and parole following that order.“The situation was controlled after the inmates wrote a petition to the district magistrate, demanding bail. The police and jail authorities told them that it would be forwarded to higher authorities,” an officer said on condition of anonymity. In the evening, Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Abhisek Modi, who led the police team, said, “The situation is under control. The unrest will be investigated.”The agitators started the trouble by refusing to have lunch and stopped others from eating it as well. They threw away the food. Branches of trees, iron rods fitted to a football goal post and bricks were allegedly used by the agitators. There were reports that some guards were assaulted but officials did not confirm this. The inmates also ransacked security cameras installed inside the premises.There are around 1,300 inmates at the correctional home, officials said.  Among them, around 200 are undertrial prisoners. This is the biggest correctional home in north Bengal.This is the third incident of its kind in the state since bail hearings stopped because of the coronavirus lockdown. There was violence at Baruipur correctional home in South 24 Parganas district on March 3. The second incident was reported at Dum Dum central correctional home on March 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inmates-of-bengal-jail-hold-staff-hostage-demand-bail-talks-end-crisis/story-ex19PltJHcMag8PWZXAP8M.html

Only a heartless government will stand by and do nothing,” Chidambaram said on Twitter.He then asked two questions: “Why cannot government save them from hunger AND protect their dignity by transferring cash to every poor family? Why can’t government distribute, free of cost, a small part of the 77 million tonnes of grain with FCI to families who need the grain to feed themselves?”And then targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “These two questions are both economic and moral questions. @narendramodi and @nsitharaman have failed to answer both questions, as the nation watches helplessly,” Chidambaram said in his third and final tweet.The tweets come nearly a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced extension of nationwide lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19. The initial 21-day lockdown, which was scheduled to end on April 14, was extended till May 3.The central government then announced a slew of measures, which are aimed at benefiting the poor and restarting the economy stalled due to the lockdown. Many small enterprises have been given permission to resume work an labourer-based service allowed. The relaxations are coming into effect from Monday.The Congress has repeatedly sought the ramping up of Covid-19 testing and personal protection equipment (PPEs) for health workers. It has also urged the government to spell out steps it plans to take to mitigate the woes of migrant labourers and farmers waiting to harvest their crops.On Saturday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi constituted an 11-member consultative group under former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s leadership to deliberate on matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic and to formulate the party’s views on them. Chidambaram is part of that group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-chidambaram-calls-central-govt-heartless-poses-2-questions/story-f2mFCmtZ9iDeSjl5chBTrL.html

Here’s what you need to know||As coronavirus disease Covid-19 spreads rapidly, there is a barrage of information floating along with it on what should be used and what shouldn’t to check the spread of the disease.Among such information is the use of air conditioners (ACs) - many on the internet and social media are claiming that use of ACs can lead to spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. But the government has taken upon itself to dispel all such misinformation.The Press Information Bureau (PIB) has tweeted on is Fact Check handle that use of window AC if all right; the issue is with the central air conditioning system.“As the mercury soars, here’s one more #PIBFactcheck. Claim : ACs should not be used to cool off in the heat, as they spread #Covid_19. Fact : It’s a little complicated. Window ACs are ok, but not central air-conditioning,” the PIB tweet said. As the mercury soars, here's one more #PIBFactcheckClaim : ACs should not be used to cool off in the heat, as they spread #Covid_19 Fact : It's a little complicated. Window ACs are ok, but not central air-conditioning. Let's listen to this segment from @DDNewslive 👇 pic.twitter.com/UkbZsJ4pIsSince the window AC is used at home - basically a confined space - it is still okay to use. But the central air conditioning system has the potential to spread the virus to a much larger area in case a Covid-19 positive case is found.A recent study in China suggested that air conditioning aided the transmission of coronavirus infection between people in a restaurant.The study has been published in peer-reviewed Emerging Infectious Diseases journal published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States.It was conducted on 10 Covid-19 patients from three families who dined at the same restaurant in China’s Guangzhou. The first infected person - who had come from Wuhan - had lunch at the five-floor restaurant without windows on January 24, said the study, and members of other two families sat at neighbouring tables.While the first patient experienced fever and cough the same day, the members of other families became infected by February 5.The study concluded that the most likely cause of this outbreak was droplet transmission. Since droplets remain in the air only for short time and travel short distance, said the study, the strong airflow from the air conditioner could have propagated the droplets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-staying-at-home-and-want-to-use-ac-here-s-what-you-need-to-know/story-ZToEjpKIT5DuT99xw4wz5M.html

19-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Karnataka decides to open up parts of economy to business from April 20||Karnataka has decided to open parts of its economy to business again from Monday amid the coronavirus lockdown. The state government has decided to allow construction activities to resume and technology companies to start their work, besides government departments, industrial townships and SEZ’s according to Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa. The CM was briefing the media after a meeting with his senior advisors.The chief minister stated that the imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) would continue till May 3. Yediyurappa also said that inter-district and interstate travel is still prohibited. All government departments, SEZ’s and industrial townships including technology parks would work at a third of their strength. Earlier on Saturday, Yediyurappa had said that two-wheeler vehicles would be permitted to move around without passes but late in the night, the CMO issued a statement saying that based on public feedback, it had been decided to scrap this move.The CM also said the administration would double down on enhancing measures in Covid-19 containment zones including 32 identified in Bangalore and eight other hotspots across the state, to ensure there was no spread of the virus. The administration has made wearing masks mandatory. Agricultural activities had earlier been exempted from any restrictions across the state. 25 new fresh Covid-19 positive cases were registered in the state bringing the cumulative total till Saturday to 384 which includes 14 deaths and 104 people being discharged. Eight of the 30 districts in the state are completely Covid-19 free and have not reported even a single case till date.Karnataka government’s move to ease lockdown restrictions, however, sparked criticism from the opposition. JD(S) leader and Member of Legislative Council, Basvraj Horatti asked the government to reconsider its decision as Covid-19 cases were increasing in the state. He also said, allowing movement of two-wheeler vehicles without passes would render the lockdown meaningless and coronavirus may spread to rural areas too.Meanwhile, in a controversial statement, Karnataka Health and Family Welfare Minister B Sriramulu claimed that gargling hot water mixed with turmeric and salt, thrice a day, could cure coronavirus. Sriramulu said he is no doctor but claimed that he had read an article on how this was an effective cure and had been successful in China. However, late in the evening, he tweeted out saying that he had merely made a suggestion and did not mean that the remedy could cure coronavirus.The minister had made the original statement in Bellary where, in another faux pas, food kits were distributed by him and local legislator Somashekar Reddy. The leaders were seen violating all social distancing norms as hundreds gathered in queues, jostling and pushing one another to avail of these free food kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-karnataka-decides-to-open-up-parts-of-economy-to-business-from-april-20/story-4y1aolboTjRq2UT8wZnfxH.html
19-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Odisha announces Rs 100 crore employment programme for 4.5 lakh urban poor families||With the Covid-19 lockdown affecting livelihood of millions of poor in urban areas, the Odisha government on Saturday announced an emergency programme ‘Urban Wage Employment Initiative’ worth Rs 100 crore that would start from April 20 and continue till September this year.Announcing the programmme, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said 4.50 lakh families residing in 114 urban local bodies across the state would be benefitted by it. With cooperation of Mission Shakti groups, the programme will be implemented from this month till September this year.The beneficiaries will receive their payment by the end of each week. Under the programme, developmental works such as cleaning of drains, remediation of water bodies, remodelling of playgrounds and parks, construction of public toilets will be undertaken. Local artists will also be employed for wall painting and mural paintings.Last month, Patnaik had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the state to grant unemployment allowance to over 36.10 lakh NREGS workers who are sitting idle due to lockdown. In his letter to PM Modi, the chief minister had demanded that Rs 380.39 crore for Odisha, one fourth of the wage rate as per MGNREGA, as unemployment allowance.Odisha had also announced a package of Rs 2,200 crore for the poorer sections of the state including Rs 1,000 cash assistance to each of the 94 lakh beneficiaries under the Food Supplies & Consumer Welfare Department and Rs 1500 to each of the 22 lakh construction workers. Besides, financial assistance of Rs 3,000 was announced for each of the 65,000 street vendors across 114 urban local bodies to deal with the Covid-19 lockdown.With another 15 days remaining for the lockdown to end, Odisha officials are worried about its impact on the state’s economy. The harvesting of rabi crops has taken a major hit with farmers forced to do distress sale of vegetables. Rabi crops including paddy, maize and millet have not been damaged but procurement has been hit hard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-odisha-announces-rs-100-crore-employment-programme-for-4-5-lakh-urban-poor-families/story-nG0N4uu3NrX6gZ8LcRjghI.html
19-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Most rapid tests negative in Rajasthan and Punjab; other states get ready for the exercise||In the first round of rapid-testing in Rajasthan to detect carriers or super spreaders of the Sars-Cov-2 virus most tests results were negative, officials said on Saturday, as other states started working on conducting tests from Sunday.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also advised antibody tests in Covid-19 hotspots which will ensure faster detection of cases and give more time to authorities to contain community spread. Once a person tests positive after the antibody test, the PCR test has to be done to confirm the result, which takes anywhere between 24 to 48 hours. While antibody test is based on blood samples, the PCR test is based on throat swab.Most state government officials on Saturday said they have received the rapid test kits (RTKs). They, however, said the kits were very less as compared to the demand. India had received 6,50,000 kits from China on Friday, which has been distributed to the states. Most states have set up additional quarantine centres to keep the persons, who test positive in rapid testing.Rajasthan got 10,000 rapid test kits on Friday and 52 samples were tested, all of which were negative. On Saturday, 5,000 tests were conducted in Jaipur’s walled city, from where most number of cases have been reported. Rohit Singh, additional chief secretary, health, said the rapid tests would help the government in the ongoing containment exercise as people tested positive will be quickly isolated to prevent further spread. “This is part of our strategy to use an optimal mix of both types of tests for effective containment in an aggressive manner,” he said.Rajasthan became the first state to conduct the rapid tests on Friday as 52 people in the walled city were tested with these kits. All of them tested negative. The state will get 1 lakh testing kits soon, said health minister Raghu Sharma on Saturday.The Chhattisgarh government would be procuring high-quality Covid-19 rapid testing kits from a South Korean company within the next 10 days, the state’s health minister TS Singh Deo said Saturday.“As per the tender, the kits will arrive in the next seven to ten days. The South Korean company based in India was the lowest bidder. The rate we have been able to close at (Rs 337 per kit) is the lowest in India,” he said.The Chhattisgarh government had earlier cancelled two short tenders for the purchase of rapid testing kits in the last 15 days. The state has reported 36 cases of Covid-19 out of which 24 people have been discharged.Chhattisgarh is the second state after Andhra Pradesh to import kits from South Korea. Andhra Pradesh received one lakh kits from South Korea on Friday, which was dispatched to districts on Saturday. “The rapid antibody tests would commence in a day or two and it would improve the efficiency of the testing significantly,” special chief secretary (health) K S Jawahar Reddy said at a review meeting conducted by the chief minister on Saturday.A Punjab government official said that the state has 10,100 rapid testing kits from ICMR and these are being used for testing in 24 hotspots identified by the government. The state government will collect all the data available after rapid testing exercise on Saturday, said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state health department’s official spokesperson for Covid-19.This is second batch of antibody tests kits received by the state. On Monday, the state received 1,000 kits, which was used to conduct tests in Mohali and Jalandhar. Total seven of the 1,000 tested were found to be positive, another state government official said.In Uttar Pradesh, the first tests from the kits in Meerut and Saharanpur have come negative, officials said, adding that 8,500 kits received would be used in each of the 17 worst Covid affected sub-divisions of the state.The officials in Bihar, Uttarkahand and Himachal Pradesh said that they have received the kits though the number was inadequate considering the demand to conduct the tests. “The number of kits we have received (3,400) so far is very less against our demand,” said National Health Mission Director Nipun Jindal in Himachal Pradesh. Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, said, “This is the first tranche of antibody-based rapid test kits we received. The department is formulating a comprehensive strategy for its prudent usage.” Bihar has received 6,240 rapid test kits.Karnataka’s health and family welfare department secretary, Jawaid Akhter said the 11,400 kits given by the Centre have been sent to NIMHANS for testing to ensure the efficacy of the kits. “Once they are certified by our local authorities, they will be deployed in different districts of the state over the next few days,” he said. Rajasthan also gave 100 kits to SMS medical college in Jaipur for their reliability, after which a go-ahead will be given for their distribution throughout the state, officials said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the 42,000 RTKs received on Sunday will be used to conduct random tests in the 71 containment zones of the city. Jammu and Kashmir health commissioner, Atul Duloo, said that 12,000 kits were received by the government on Saturday and will be used soon in hotspots for testing.In Kerala, 25,000 rapid test kits have arrived, said a senior official of the health department, adding these kits will be used in worst-hit Kasaragode and Kannur districts in a couple of days. Since there is no threat of massive community spread, the use of these kits will be minimum in Kerala, he said. On Saturday four fresh cases were reported taking the total of positive cases to 399. Maharashtra government has not received the kits. “We are yet to receive antibody tests kits. We will have to follow certain protocols before starting to conduct the tests even after receiving them,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department, Maharashtra.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-most-rapid-tests-negative-in-rajasthan-and-punjab-other-states-get-ready-for-the-exercise/story-NjnoIFgKuckzHK2CV1oLzO.html

19-04-2020||India||Manmohan Singh to head Congress’ 11-member Covid-19 panel||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday constituted an 11-member consultative group under former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s leadership to deliberate on matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic and to formulate the party’s views on them.The group also includes Rahul Gandhi, Randeep Singh Surjewala, KC Venugopal, P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari, Jairam Ramesh, Praveen Chakravarty, Gaurav Vallabh, Supriya Shrinate and Rohan Gupta. This is the first time Rahul Gandhi has become a member of a party panel since he stepped down as the Congress chief last year.In a press release, the Congress said the consultative group will meet virtually daily.A member of the group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the panel will give suggestions to the government on both health and economic challenges arising out of the pandemic. “Economic pandemic is even bigger than health pandemic. As Rahul Gandhi has said the Congress, as the opposition and the country’s oldest party, will continue to give its suggestions irrespective of whether the government accepts those or not,” he said.The member said they are duty-bound to put in the public domain the challenges and the solutions. “It is deeply felt by many in the country that the government is doing very little in terms of laying down a roadmap for kick-starting the economy...”He said the panel will hold consultations with chief ministers, former chief ministers, former Union ministers, Congress as well as non-Congress leaders and experts. “Apart from suggestions and solutions, the group will keep coming out with warnings to the government about the forthcoming challenges.”He said Rahul Gandhi, in his press conference on Thursday, gave constructive suggestions and offered positive criticism. “He happens to be the leader, who is a rallying point for the party even though he may not hold any post. That is why he is there with Dr Manmohan Singh, and Chidambaram... this committee will be able to lay down a futuristic road map for the country.”Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been interacting with Congress leaders from across the country through video-conferencing and urging them to play an active role in the fight against Covid-19. They have asked them to reach out to the highest number of people apart from assessing the work of the Centre and state governments in containing the pandemic.The Congress has repeatedly sought the ramping up of Covid-19 testing and personal protection equipment for health workers. It has also urged the government to spell out steps it plans to take to mitigate the woes of migrant labourers and farmers waiting to harvest their crops.Sonia Gandhi has written six letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking relief for different sections and to suggest measures the government can take in dealing with the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manmohan-singh-to-head-congress-11-member-covid-19-panel/story-lBOdpI0rkQYehYfFHLigWM.html

Both the cases are from Haridwar.One of the two to test positive is a migrant labourer - the first such case in the state. The second patient is a close contact of a person who attended the event of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi last month.“A 24-year-old migrant labourer who initially worked in Rishikesh, and a 45-year-old female who is a close contact of a Jamaat attendee tested positive for coronavirus. The migrant labourer had come to Rishikesh from Hathras area in Uttar Pradesh to work, but he was caught by officials on March 30 near Roorkee and sent to a relief camp. He was caught when he along with three others were going back to Hathras by taking lift from a truck driver. We have isolated 24 more people and sent their samples for testing who lived in the same relief camp with the patient,” said Dr Saroj Naithani, chief medical officer (CMO) of Haridwar district.The samples for the migrant labourer were sent for testing on April 16 after he complained of sore throat. Test results of three more people travelling with him are awaited.Dr Naithani added that the second patient is a close contact of a Jamaat attendee who had tested positive earlier from the district.“We have isolated the 45-year-old lady who was staying in a quarantine centre since she was found to be a close contact of another positive Covid-19 patient. On Saturday, her two children were also isolated and their samples sent for testing. Her husband however, has tested negative but is still being monitored by health officials for any symptoms in future,” said the CMO.On Friday, a nine-month-old baby and a doctor from a military hospital in Dehradun tested positive along with another Jamaat attendee from Nainital district. On Tuesday, two Jamaat attendees from Haridwar district had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-labourer-jamaat-attendee-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-uttarakhand-tally-reaches-42/story-8DOdtnzapO0R0LElqxeaqJ.html

The sailors from INS Angre — a logistics and administrative support base under the Western Naval Command — are being monitored at the navy’s premier hospital INHS Asvini. These cases have been traced to a single sailor who tested positive for Covid-19 11 days ago. All the sailors live in the same residential complex. They are all in their 20s, except the oldest who is 47.“The detection of these Covid-19 cases is a result of meticulous contact tracing and aggressive screening/testing carried out by the Western Naval Command after one sailor tested positive on April 7 (he is among the 26). All these sailors continue to remain asymptomatic,” navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.The first Indian sailor to test positive on April 7 contracted the disease from a retired sailor who was infected by his son who came to Mumbai from the US, a naval officer said on condition of anonymity. The navy hasn’t had any Covid-19 case on board any of its warships, submarines or air stations so far. INS Angre is under lockdown to prevent the spread of infection.The spokesperson said stringent quarantine and safety protocols have been enforced for personnel and their families at INS Angre, with door-to-door screening being undertaken for identification of more cases, if any.The navy said it remained fully combat-ready and also prepared to participate in the national mission to fight the pandemic.In a recent address to naval personnel, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh stressed it was vital to ensure that operational assets such as warships remained free of the virus.Meanwhile, the army confirmed that a lady officer posted at the Military Hospital, Dehradun, has tested positive for the disease and the necessary contact tracing was being done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alarm-in-navy-after-26-test-positive-at-mumbai-facility/story-rCrUrjfo2anJdqLsKNTf7H.html

As per a district administration official, the amount from MPLAD fund was released to the administration which deputed the civil surgeon of the district hospital to purchase the machines. However, the BJP workers have complained that the price quoted for the equipment is five times its original cost and that the number of machines supplied is also less than what was ordered.“On receiving the complaint, I ordered payment to the company concerned to be stopped immediately until an inquiry is conducted. I have ordered an inquiry into the matter. Its report is expected in two days,” said Chhindwara collector Srinivas Sharma.On his part, Nath said, “It’s unfortunate. If there has been any irregularity in the purchase of the machines, the guilty should be given stringent punishment.”Meanwhile, an inquiry has also been ordered in Gwalior following complaints that wheat flour bags being distributed among the poor hit hard by the Covid-19 lockdown weighed only 7.5 kg to 8 kg while their packing says they weigh 10 kg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-cost-of-ventilators-in-madhya-pradesh/story-Jl39rplEbtn9JdkEqz63oI.html
19-04-2020||India||India under lockdown: Migrant labourer pedals 1,700 km in 7 days to reach home||On April 1, Mahesh Jena followed his usual pre-dawn routine, but with an unusual plan in mind.At around 4am, after enduring a sleepless night, Jena, a slightly built 20-year-old with a shaven head and a boyish face, put on his blue jeans, his blue-and-gray striped t shirt, and his worn-out rubber slippers. He put his backpack on his shoulders, and happy with its weight, he slipped out of his tiny room and got on to his bicycle — a heavy relic of a bike with a 22-inch frame — and started pedalling. It was dark. Usually, he would head for his factory, a little over 10km away in the industrial zone of Sangli in Maharashtra.This time, he was headed home — to a small village called Bhanra in Odisha’s Jajpur, nearly 1,700km away.His backpack had a blanket, a quilt, a change of clothes, a few packets of biscuits (Parle G, Marie, and cream), a few sachets of soap, a steel tiffin Jena usually carried to work, bottles of water, and just under Rs 3,000 in cash. The bag weighed a little more than 10kg. He had no maps, and no phone. He felt no fear and little doubt. His head was clear — he would keep going till he reached home. If the cycle broke down, he would walk.Anything was better than the uncertainty and dread that had gripped him and his colleagues — all migrant labourers working in the metal and plastic factories in Sangli’s industrial zone, many of them from Odisha — ever since a national lockdown was announced on March 24.“The rumour was that all the factories would close for five months at least,” Jena said. “Everyone was very scared. How we will earn? How will we eat? How will we pay room rent? No one said anything to us about how we will survive, whether we will be paid.”On the news, Jena saw the crowds of migrant labourers leaving on foot. Many of his co-workers were talking of doing the same.“For 4-5 days, we were under great stress, we did not know what to do. I could not sleep. Do I go or not? Will I be able to make it? If I walk, I will cover 50 km a day… that will take me over a month! But then I thought, if I cycle, maybe I can do 100km or more in a day. That’s about 15 days. Not too bad.”Sitting and fretting in his rented room, Jena made his decision. On March 29, he called Manoj Parida, a cousin whose house he had grown up in, now a lineman in the Northern Electricity Supply Company in Jajpur district, and told him the plan.“I told him to stay back,” Parida said. “When he said he had run out of money, I sent Rs 3,000 through Google Pay. No one at home thought that he would cycle his way from Maharashtra. We thought it was almost impossible.”Jena decided not to tell anyone else. His plan was simple; try following the same route he took from Odisha to Sangli, but in the opposite direction.When he was first picked up by a contractor in his village, Jena and a group of men took a bus from Jajpur to Bhubaneshwar, a four-hour ride. From there, they took the Konark Express, which connects the eastern part of India to the western part, a distance of 1,932km from Bhunaneshwar to Mumbai, which it covers in 37 hours, 15 minutes. They got off at Solapur, a city in south-western Maharashtra close to its border with Karnataka, a day-and-a-half later. From Solapur, they took another bus to Sangli, a 12-hour journey.“That was going to be my route,” Jena said. “I did not think of anything more. I did not think about food, or water, or whether the cycle would last.”FIRST-TIME MIGRANTJena was born near a cycle market in Ludhiana. His parents ran a pavement food stall in the city. Struggling with money, they sent Jena back to their village in Odisha when he was 9 years old, to live with his uncle. In school, Jena had ambitions to join the army. Five years ago, his father had tried to kill himself. With less than Rs 500 in his pocket, Jena says, he boarded a train to Delhi and from there made his way to Ludhiana to see his father. Last year, his father was diagnosed with a kidney disease. Then an injury to his spinal cord left him debilitated.“I have two younger brothers, a younger sister,” Jena said. “My turn had come, I needed to earn. We were very badly off, no money, no house to call our own.”Nine months ago, Jena quit school without giving his Class 10 exams, and became one of the approximately 120 million migrant labourers in India.Chinmay Tumbe, an assistant professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad and the author of India Moving: A History of Migration, calls it the “the world’s largest and longest voluntary stream of migration.” Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha are the three main sources of this mass migration.With no particular skills, Jena first found work in a plastics factory, loading and unloading consignments.“I felt like my neck would break,” he said. “I hated it.” He became an apprentice in a metal factory making water pumps, despite many of his friends warning him of the dangers of the job. Early on in his apprenticeship, he says, he followed a commotion to find that a worker had died at a foundry after being buried under huge slabs of iron.“I have seen people working there losing hands and legs,” Jena said. But he soldiered on. He learnt to cut, temper, and weld iron. For five months, he got no money. In January, he found a job that paid him Rs 12,000 a month at Jsons Foundry, which makes metal castings for the oil and gas industry. ON THE ROADBy the time the sun was out, Jena had passed by the densely populated city of Miraj (which forms a single municipality with Sangli) and taken a sharp northward turn on NH 160. On Day 1, he hoped to make it to Solapur, cycling all day, and resting when the sun went down. Soon after Miraj, he left NH 160 and got on to the Maharashtra state highway numbered 161. For hours, he rode at a steady clip past sugarcane fields. The first river he crossed was the modest Agrani, a stream that was successfully revived in 2017 to help alleviate the troubles of this drought prone area.When evening came, Jena found that he was not tired. In fact, he was enjoying the unhurried cadence of his cycling, the solitude of the road. He kept going.When he finally stopped for the night — at a temple — he was barely 40km from Solapur, and had cycled more than 150km. The only problem he faced on Day 1 was a puncture. A group of villagers asked him where he was coming from, and decided to help on hearing his story.“They let me sleep at the temple, got me food, got me milk, I got my puncture repaired,” Jena said. “I went to sleep thinking, I’ve done 150km! I can do this!”By that time, the contractor who brought Jena to Sangli, and a few of Jena’s colleagues had gone to the local police station to report his disappearance.CHECKPOSTSThe first day set a pattern that would repeat itself with a regularity that is extraordinary in itself. In covering the breadth of India alone on a cycle, Jena was barely troubled. He was helped everywhere he asked for it. He cycled all day and well into the night.“Nothing scary happened to me, and I never had a problem with food or water,” he said. “I began to enjoy myself. Especially going downhill in the hilly areas!”On he went on Day 2, from Solapur past the massive medieval fort of Naldurg with its beautiful lake, past shuttered sugar mills, past the corpses of dogs killed in road accidents, crossing into Karnataka somewhere in the middle of the day and realising it only after being stopped at a police check post.“only fear was the police,” Jena said.But even the police did not detain him, helping him on his way with food and water (it is worth noting here that Jena was lucky that he was not carrying the virus, or this story would have taken a very different route, tracing a “superspreader”.)“I was stopped many times at police check posts,” Jena said, “and each time I told them what I was doing, and I said, ‘I can’t possibly go back, you can keep me here if you like, or you can let me keep going’. They always let me go.”THE MAN AND HIS CYCLEIf Jena had a nemesis, it was the rate at which he suffered punctured tires — at least twice every day.“It got me down,” he said. “When I started, I had no idea this was going to happen so many times.On Day 3, as he was approaching Hyderabad, Jena got lost and went nearly a 100km in the wrong direction. At a village, a man told him a short-cut through hilly, forested terrain that would take him back to NH 65, and cut the distance by more than half. As he climbed the hill, the cycle’s rear tire got cut on a sharp rock. He climbed the rest of the way, around 10km, on foot.“At the top of road, I got back on to the cycle, balanced myself, checked my brakes, and then just let go,” Jena said. “It was wonderful, speeding all the way down like that on that empty road.”It was another 30km on foot before he found a village, though there was no one outside. He had to knock on doors before he found someone to fix the puncture.“Less than half hour later, the tire burst completely.”Again, Jena walked. At the next village, the owner of the cycle shop replaced the tube on his rear tear with a new one, but charged only for the cost of the tube itself.Soon after, he was on the highway skirting the mega city of Hyderabad, a third of his way done.“Now it was a straight, straight road to Vijayawada.”On this road, Jena’s path crossed that of a large group of migrant labourers on foot.“They were from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,” Jena said. “They said that they had no money and they had no choice but to try and walk back to their villages. Some of them asked me if I would make it all the way to Odisha on a cycle.“I said, ‘with Bholanath on my side, I surely would.’” Bholanath is another name for Lord Shiva, a popular Indian deity. As he glided past the walkers, Jena congratulated himself on choosing to cycle.“I was not going to let go of the cycle at any cost,” he said. “Even if I had to walk with the cycle, I would walk with it, but I was certain that I wouldn’t let it go. If trains restarted, I would take the cycle on the train. If buses restarted, I would put it on the bus. I had a fear that anything could be stopped any time, and in that fear, my one hope was my cycle.”On Day 4, Jena reached Vijayawada, where it dawned on him that perhaps his family would be worried about his disappearance. He borrowed a phone from a stranger and called his sister.“When he called up, I was so angry for a moment,” said Mitali, his sister. “We were all distressed at home for days, with no news of him. I was angry with his stupidity, but we were also relieved. I told him, reach Jajpur and call again.”Jajpur was still nearly 900 km away, but by now Jena was in a trance. It was him, his cycle, and the road. For the next few days, he even forgot about the one thing that he usually obsessed about — where will money come from? Without a phone, he did not even have the distraction of making or receiving calls, or watching videos, or listening to music, or making photographs.He noticed that his route was becoming particularly beautiful, often densely forested, hilly, the roiling Krishna river on his right. He was going past the reserve forest of Kondapalli.“There was lots of beauty, it was amazing,” he said. “I felt like I could die doing this alone, and if I did die, it would be okay. If I lived, great, I would cycle.”Past the gigantic barrage on the Krishna at Vijayawada, Jena switched to NH 16, curving sharply upwards along the east coast towards his home.He began Day 6 by going past Srikakulam and crossing the bridge over the Nagavali river, which collapsed dramatically two years ago in June after the river flooded.By the end of the day, he crossed into Odisha, near the nondescript village of Gudipadar in Ganjam district. Soon he was going past the gorgeous town of Ganjam, where the Rushikulya river enters the Bay of Bengal, past where the Olive Ridleys nest, though he says he never noticed the sea, just a shimmer of blue too far to his right as he glided past familiar Sal forests. Then the road turned gently inland, and Jena was cycling past the oceanic Chilika lake.But it was only at Bhubaneswar, on Day 7, that he finally felt the relief of being on home turf. There was still a 100km to go.“I never fell ill except the pain that I felt on my feet and thighs due to the long hours of cycling,” Jena said. “I did suffer blackouts a couple of times. When the pain became unbearable, I stopped and rested. I felt very happy when I reached Bhubaneswar.”On the evening of April 7, he reached Jajpur town, just 5km from his village.He is still stuck there.“I called my uncle when I reached Jajpur and he told me to go to the police and tell them that I should be taken to the medical centre for quarantine,” he said , “and that’s what I did.”In quarantine for 14 days, Jena is yearning for home. He gets to see his uncle and his family every day, and they bring him food and talk from afar.The police have taken his cycle into custody too.“The police said, ‘we can’t trust him; someone who can cycle from Maharashtra, can easily escape from here’,” he said.It took him seven days to cover nearly 1,700km, roughly 242 kms a day. Is there something from his road trip that he regrets?“I was sure that I would meet ghosts,” Jena said. “I did not see a single one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-under-lockdown-migrant-labourer-peddles-1-700-km-in-7-days-to-reach-home/story-FTrl4Jlc0K7HOxO63cyonM.html
19-04-2020||India||Govt offices outside Covid hot spots to resume work||Government offices across the country are set to become functional from Monday as states have allowed resumption of work for most departments, especially in the rural areas.The Centre on Wednesday issued guidelines, which allowed activities like the conditional reopening of industries in rural areas and economic enclaves, to restart the economy from Monday outside the Covid-19 containment zones.In states such as Karnataka, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, the entire lower rung staff will return to work. Up to one-third of ministerial and subordinate staff will work on a rotation basis, orders issued by these state said.Thermal scanners and sanitisers have been made mandatory at all government offices and social distancing will have to be practised. Each office will have a nodal officer to ensure hygiene and social distancing, said an order issued by the Uttar Pradesh government. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa said two-wheelers in the state will be allowed to run without any passes even as interstate and interdistrict travel will remain prohibited. Punjab chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora said the state government has issued about 4,000 transit permits to over 120 companies to restart work. Haryana has ordered that no toll tax will be collected along state highways.To ensure a smooth supply of goods, restaurants, fuel stations and motor vehicle repair garages along highways have been allowed to function. The National Highway Authority of India has also announced no collection of toll tax along highways during the lockdown period.All mining activity in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh would resume, officials in these states said. While gatherings remain barred in most states, Uttarakhand has allowed weddings with just five guests. Sweet shops in West Bengal will open till 8 pm daily, whereas only takeaway restaurants have been allowed in other states.Technology companies in Karnataka and Telangana will become fully operational with social distancing norms. Construction works in all states would also resume with a condition of in-situ stay for workers at the construction sites. Contractors have been told to provide stranded migrant workers option to work at construction sites, if there is a shortage of labour.Industry leaders have said to restart factories to ensure pre-lockdown production levels will take a few months, with many saying the full production would start only by June end. Many said that the condition that factory owners would be liable if a worker tests positive for Covid-19 is a hurdle to the resumption of the production.“Small and medium factory owners cannot get the workers tested and without the tests, there is a risk of getting booked. Many of my friends are scared to open factories in such a scenario,” said a Jaipur-based factory owner, who was not willing to be named. Factory owners echoed similar sentiments in Punjab also.Many states have also allowed e-commerce companies to sell non-essential goods from Monday and prompted Congress leader Ajay Maken to demand that retailers in local markets be also allowed to open their shops. States like Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have allowed stationery and electronic repair shops to open during certain days of the week. As a large number of activities will start from Monday, state governments have issued instructions for enforcing the lockdown in the containment zones strictly. “We will double the enhancement measures in the containment areas,” Yediyurappa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-offices-outside-covid-hot-spots-to-resume-work/story-Ee4OefbHaPCahtnaovBulJ.html
19-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What to read during, after a pandemic||For years, I used to write a column on graphic novels (Cult Fiction) for Mint Lounge. I’m also deeply into SFF — just the kind of thing you would expect of a person of my age (indeterminate but I feel as old as Methuselah) and background (engineer who went to college at a time when engineering colleges were more liberal-arts inclined than even top liberal arts colleges). But my real specialty is end-of-the-world books. Given how popular the movie Contagion has become over the past few months, and the huge renewal of interest in the genre after the emergence of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), this Sunday column is dedicated to the huge volume of end-of-the-world fiction that’s out there.You’d be surprised at just how many respected writers (Nevil Shute, Cormac McCarthy, Margaret Atwood, to name a few) have written end-of-the-world books. You’d also be surprised at just how many excellent new writers also have (Emily St Mandel, Peter Heller, Cixin Liu).In many of these books, the end of the world comes from a virus. In Stephen King’s The Stand, for instance, a virus called Captain Trips (also a nickname for Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia) kills 99% of the human race. Reacting to comparisons between Sars-CoV-2 and his fictional virus, King tweeted in early March: “No, coronavirus is not like The Stand. It’s not anywhere near as serious. It’s eminently survivable. Keep calm and take all reasonable precautions.” Michael Crichton’s Andromeda Strain is another book about a virus (and has more science than The Stand); Atwood’s Oryx and Crake is built around a human-created pandemic. In others, the end comes from a nuclear war. In Pat Frank’s underrated 1959 classic Alas, Babylon, Russia launches a full-scale nuclear attack on the US (the US eventually wins the war but at great cost to life and the economy). It’s understandable why a book written in 1959 would expect nuclear Armageddon to cause the end of the world. Nevil Shute’s 1957 novel, On The Beach is again built around the premise that a nuclear war has destroyed most of the world’s population and that the fallout is gradually but surely killing the rest. In still others — I am told these are particularly popular with survivalists in the US — the end of the world comes from a powerful electromagnetic pulse (EMP), which takes out all electric networks (and also all electronics) leading to the end of the world. And in some, a cosmic event results in the end of the world. In Neal Stephenson’s Seveneves, the destruction of the moon causes a hard rain to fall on Earth, although, warned two years in advance, some of humanity is by then safety ensconced in arks in space — waiting for a distant future when return to Earth may be possible. Of course, people who want a more non-fictional narrative of a pandemic could do worse than Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year (which is perhaps among the earliest non-fiction novels). It is set in London in 1665, the year the plague hit what was then one of the world’s greatest cities. The term end-of-the-world books is actually a misnomer, because none of these books really deals with a complete end-of-the-world scenario — either the tragedy is averted or the survivors find hope (at the end). Which is just as it should be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-to-read-during-after-a-pandemic/story-r8mJ2dMuUXtio6CbntOGqM.html
19-04-2020||India||Delhi govt wants curbs to remain after April 20||The Delhi government does not want to ease restrictions in the national capital on April 20 on the grounds that the city-state is a “high-risk zone” with over 1,700 cases and 10 of its 11 revenue districts have reported multiple coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections, according to three senior officials familiar with the matter.In a proposal sent to Delhi’s lieutenant-governor (LG) Anil Baijal’s office for approval, the government has said that while the situation may be reviewed later, it was not in favour of easing curbs at the moment, the officials cited above said. Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev is likely to issue an order Sunday to clarify what curbs will stay after April 20, this person added. The Delhi government decided to move the proposal on Friday evening after the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) apprised the state administration of “large outbreaks” in several parts of he city, said a senior government official who asked not to be named.On April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the national lockdown -- first imposed on March 25 -- will be extended till May 3, but said some of the curbs would be lifted in places outside “containment zones” and areas where the potential of the virus spreading was low, to kick-start economic activity.“The file has not yet been returned from the L-G’s office. The document states that no relaxation in restrictions be allowed as of now. Two reasons have been cited. One is the high population density of Delhi. The second is the pace of spread of Covid-19 infection in the city,”said a senior government official who asked not to be named.A second official said that if no relaxations are done, it would mean that some activities that could start from April 20, as mentioned in the Union home ministry guidelines on April 15 -- e-commerce deliveries, factories in industrial estates such as Narela and Bawana if proper social distancing is maintained, in-situ construction activities in state development projects, allowing self-employed service providers such as plumbers and electricians to get back to work -- may not begin immediately.The L-G, on Saturday, gave approval to the government separately to maintain ‘status quo’ in all Delhi government offices/departments. The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter. Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also did not respond to calls and text messages seeking a comment.The L-G is the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and the government’s proposal can be objected to or dismissed by him. In that case, a fresh proposal will have to be prepared. Senior government officials said given the severity of the situation in Delhi and to prevent any further spread of the infection, it is unlikely that the proposal will be turned down.A third official, however, said that the situation will be reviewed by the government in a few days to see if more activities can begin. At 1,893 cases, Delhi has the second most Covid-19 infections after Maharashtra, which has 3,648. The city has 76 “containment zones”, where the restrictions are stricter, movement is barred, and home delivery of essentials is facilitated by the administration.On Saturday, north-east Delhi, which till now was free of any “containment zones”, also came under the radar with its district magistrate Shashi Kaushal issuing three containment orders -- two for different lanes in Shastri Park, and one for Gautampuri. According to officials, all hospitals and clinics (veterinary clinics) and pharmacies will continue to function as they have through the lockdown, as will all grocery shops for essential supplies outside containment zones. Agricultural markets will continue to operate, but from the new locations where several of them have been moved in the past weeks, and will follow staggered timings. The one service that the government has added to the list of what will be permitted from April 20 is that all state hospitals -- other than the two dedicated for Covid-19 treatment (Lok Nayak and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality) -- will open for general and out-patient examinations.Schools, colleges and coaching centres will remain closed; as will all public transport including buses, auto-rickshaws, taxis, cab aggregator services, e-rickshaws and the Metro. Goods transport and all essential services that were permitted through the lockdown will continue to operate.On Saturday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the number of new Covid-19 cases have reduced “a little bit” over the last three days, “but, we have to reduce it further”. “A lot will depend on how Delhi performs in the next few days. Yesterday (Friday), of 2,274 tests, 68 were found positive. A few days ago, Delhi was reporting as many as 180, going up to over 300, cases in a day,” he said in a digital media address. Experts said not allowing any relaxation at this time is a good move as ideally all containment zones should have tight restrictions and complete lockdown for at least 28 days. “Delhi has a lot of congested area. At least a third of the population lives in unauthorised colonies in close proximity to each other. Now, if you relax the restrictions for the sake of the economy, the purpose would hardly be served as most people will end up being quarantined and won’t be able to work anyway,” said Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department in Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-wants-curbs-to-remain-after-april-20/story-7qDuWjtDx1hKSJlu89BVbJ.html
19-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: With 42,000 kits, rapid tests from today in Delhi||Delhi will begin deploying rapid testing kits (RTKs) across the Capital’s 77 Covid-19 containment zones on Sunday with state health minister Satyendar Jain saying that the administration has received 42,000 antibody kits -- a development that came after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revised its guidelines to allow the diagnosis tool in hot spots.Health care workers will carry out random tests in all containment zones – nine new areas were added to the list on Saturday – simultaneously, Jain said on Saturday. “We have received 42,000 rapid testing kits from the Centre. Today (Saturday), all our technicians are being trained on how to use the kits, the precautions to be taken and other nuances. From tomorrow (Sunday), rapid testing will begin in the containment zones,” the Delhi health minister said.On Thursday, India received a batch of 550,000 RTKs from China after two deadlines for the shipment were missed. ICMR officials have said that RTKs are not meant for diagnosis but should ideally be used for surveillance purposes to establish trends. It initially wanted to use the kits in parts of the country unaffected by Covid-19 or not significantly affected to asess the extent of the disease’s spread. The apex body for biomedical research, however, revised guidelines after states appealed that they be allowed to be use RTKs in hot spots so that containment efforts stepped up accordingly. “I am writing to you with reference to the rapid antibody test kits for Covid-19 testing. It is understood that many states intend to use these kits in affected areas… The National Task Force at ICMR has carefully reviewed the data evolving from various countries on use of such kits. Based on available evidence, the testing strategy for Covid-19 has been revised…,” ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said in a letter to all state chief secretaries and principal health secretaries. ICMR recommended that since the gold standard front-line test for Covid-19 was real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which is aimed at early detection, the rapid antibody test could not be a substitute for it. “The rapid antibody test is a supplementary tool to assess the prevalence of the diseases within a specific area or perimeter. The rapid antibody test will only be of utility after a minimum of seven days of onset of symptoms,” it said.Unlike the RT-PCR, which detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid tests detect antibodies in the blood and indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus. It can show results within 30 minutes. Once a person tests positive after the antibody test, an RT-PCR test is done to confirm the result.Till 8pm on Saturday, five district magistrates in Delhi told HT that they received a communication from the state health department that RTKs would be provided to them. “But we have not been told how many kits we will get,” one of the DMs said on condition of anonymity. A senior health department official, who asked not to be named, said the number of kits allotted to every containment zone will be directly proportional to the Covid-19 cases detected in the area.The nine new containment areas named on Saturday were: North-east A-97,98 and 99 near Buland Masjid; Shastri Park; A Block, Khizrabad, New Friends Colony; Israel Camp, Rang Puri Pahari; Budh Nagar, Inderpuri; Oberoi Apartment; G-1 2nd Floor Mansarovar Garden; E-51 and E-21 street 8, Shastri Park and T-606 street-18 Gautam Puri.Rajasthan has received 10,000 RTKs so far, and on Saturday it tested 5,000 people in Jaipur’s walled city, from where the most number of cases have been reported in the state.In Uttar Pradesh, the first tests from the kits in Meerut and Saharanpur came back negative, an official said, adding that 8,500 kits received will be used in each of the 17 worst-affected subdivisions. The Chhattisgarh government will procure high-quality kits from a South Korean company within 10 days, the state’s health minister TS Singh Deo said. Chhattisgarh will be the second state after Andhra Pradesh to import kits from South Korea. Andhra Pradesh received 100,000 kits from South Korea on Friday and they were dispatched to districts on Saturday. “The rapid antibody tests will improve the efficiency of the testing significantly,” special chief secretary (health) KS Jawahar Reddy said at a review meeting.A Punjab government official said the state received 10,100 RTKs from ICMR and these were being used for testing in 24 hot spots. Officials in Bihar, Uttarkahand and Himachal Pradesh said while they received the kits, the numbers were inadequate. “The number of kits we have received (3,400) so far is too little against our demand,” said National Health Mission director in Himachal Pradesh, Nipun Jindal. Bihar has so far received 6,240 RTKs. Karnataka’s health and family welfare secretary Jawaid Akhter said the 11,400 kits given by the Centre were being checked for efficacy. Kerala received 25,000 kits, a senior official of the health department said, adding that the kits will be used in worst-hit Kasargod and Kannur districts. The Maharashtra government, however, said it did not receive the kits it demanded.ICMR experts say data about these rapid tests is still emerging and the understanding of their utility for diagnosis, evolving. Currently, the rapid tests are mainly useful for epidemiological studies (to know the distribution, patterns and determinants of disease conditions), and surveillance purposes, to get real time data. “Many states want to go in for aggressive testing in containment zones and want to make use of rapid testing in these areas as they have to test almost everyone with influenza-like illness in those areas. We have drafted the new protocol keeping in mind the requests of the states. However, rapid diagnostic test is ideally a surveillance tool,” an ICMR official said. As per the new ICMR protocol, only those showing symptoms of influenza-like illnesses such as fever, cough and cold over the last seven days or more in hot spot areas should be tested. Those who are found positive in the test must be quarantined for at least seven days. Those who test negative should also remain under home quarantine for at least seven days if they are in hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-with-42-000-kits-rapid-tests-from-today-in-delhi/story-NJqgCSYEYMzUDdb4hPoT1M.html

Police have arrested the accused and initiated a murder case against him.“It was around 7 pm that the accused Banshidhar Mallick came to the Shyampukur police station and said that he has killed his son Sirshendu Mallick around 5:30 pm. The son was physically challenged. The accused had strangulated the victim with a piece of cloth,” said a Kolkata Police top officer.Officers from the local police station rushed to the spot and the Kolkata Police’s homicide squad was also informed.According to investigating officers, the accused didn’t share a cordial relation with his son. They used to quarrel almost regularly. While the man is a retired employee of a private firm, his son was unemployed. He was suffering from physical disabilities since childhood.“Over the past few days, the man and his son were having fights regularly because every time the son went out of the house, his father insisted that he should wear a mask and the son refused. On Saturday, a heated altercation broke out for the same reason and the man killed his son in a fit of rage. He strangulated his son with a cloth,” said an officer of the local police station on the condition of anonymity.On March 12, the West Bengal government had made it mandatory for all citizens to wear masks especially in public places.Some areas in north and central Kolkata have been declared as Red Zones after multiple people were found to be infected with Covid-19 disease from those areas.“We have initiated a murder case. Further investigation is on,” said a top official of Kolkata Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-man-kills-48-year-old-physically-challenged-son-after-he-refuses-to-wear-face-mask/story-9TLIu7CufkhOXoMkqPW59L.html
19-04-2020||India||In vaccine race, all eyes on Oxford trial’s deadline||United Kingdom’s top experts believe a trial at University of Oxford could give a crucial indication as early as next month on whether the world is on track for an early vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which,in a best-case scenario, could be developed as soon as this year.The vaccine being developed at Oxford is one of four that has progressed to clinical trials – the first stage of a vaccine being tested on humans – but it accounts for the largest sample size, making it one of the most watched among all efforts. “The crucial thing is you have to do a proper trial because safety is really important for these things. But if we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. And they may well get across the finish line by mid-August,” Oxford University professor of medicine, John Bell, told BBC.Bell is part of a task force UK’s business secretary Alok Sharma announced on Friday while earmarking millions of pounds for vaccine development.Till now, the consensus among researchers is that a vaccine is likely to take 12-18 months before it is approved for public.Bell added that the UK currently does not have the capacity to produce the amount of vaccine it needs to tackle coronavirus, but “is in a really good place” for vaccine development.“One of the reasons that we were rushing is to try and catch this wave of the disease. Because when the disease goes away there will be very, very few incident cases until we get a second wave,” Bell said in his comments to BBC.According to the World Health Organization’s April 11 compilation of vaccine development efforts, there are 70 projects that researchers are working on across the world. In addition to the Oxford University vaccine trial, the others include Moderna, Inovio and CanSino that have begun recruiting members for clinical trials. The Oxford trial will include up to 550 subjects split into several groups, far larger than any of the others. Most of these are in the first phase of trials with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug’s most frequent and serious side effects and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of a vaccine.Researchers and philanthropists have also launched an unprecedented effort to speed up production for when a vaccine is finally developed. Billionaire philanthropist and former Microsoft boss Bill Gates announced his foundation will fund the production of seven vaccine candidates even before they are cleared. “Even though we’ll end up picking at most two of them, we’re going to fund factories for all seven just so we don’t waste time,” he said last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-vaccine-race-all-eyes-on-oxford-trial-s-deadline/story-20IJhSML9zPqOtO7JXeedM.html
19-04-2020||India||Rajasthan begins rapid tests to identify superspreaders||Rajasthan has begun rapid testing for the Covid-19 infection with the help of newly-acquired rapid antibody testing kits which will help speed up the testing time and detect carriers or superspreaders of the Sars-Cov 2 virus who could potentially infect others.Rajasthan acquired 10,000 rapid testing kits on Friday and 52 samples were tested, all of which were negative. On Saturday, 5000 tests were conducted in the walled city and other areas.The health department is going beyond random sampling to detect carriers of the Covid-19 virus who pose a risk to others. The ICMR has also advised antibody tests in hotspots of the coronavirus which will ensure faster detection of cases and give more time to authorities to contain community spread. Once a person tests positive after the antibody test, the PCR test has to be done to confirm the result.The random sampling done in clusters in Ramganj to detect Covid-19 cases has shown that 6 to 10 percent of people are infected, said Ajitabh Sharma, the nodal officer for Covid-19 prevention in Jaipur district.He said to prevent the spread of the virus; the focus is on identifying the asymptomatic carriers who can spread it further. He said the government has identified superspreaders such as provision store owners, dairy booth owners, milk suppliers and health workers and random tests will be carried out on them to find if any of them is a superspreader.Rohit Singh, additional chief secretary, health had said on Friday that 5000 rapid tests would be done in Ramganj on Saturday in addition to the ongoing PCR based tests. “This will help us in the ongoing containment exercise as the people who test positive will be quickly isolated to prevent further spread. This is part of our strategy to use an optimal mix of both types of tests for effective containment in an aggressive manner,” he said.With these kits, more than 500 samples can be taken in a day. Dr KK Sharma, director, public health said the kits will help doctors speed up the process of testing. Since the test results are known in 15-20 minutes, it will save time and more people can be tested, he said.He said the rapid test will detect asymptomatic persons who have developed antibodies against the virus and can become carriers and pose a threat to other vulnerable people.He said in the containment zone in Ramganj, spread in a 1 km radius of a hotspot, random sampling and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing will be continued as it is being done. In the 5 km buffer zone outside Ramganj, the antibody tests will be done to detect carriers who can then be confirmed through a PCR test.Rajasthan became the first state to conduct the rapid tests on Friday as 52 people in the walled city were tested with these kits. All of them tested negative. The state will get 1 lakh testing kits soon, said health minister Raghu Sharma.Meanwhile, 100 kits were handed over to the SMS medical college on Friday for testing their reliability. After the virology department approves the kits, a report will be given to the health department which will give the go-ahead for their distribution throughout the state.Due to a shortage of testing kits, around 5000 of samples have piled up and reports could not be given. Since there are many people in quarantine and some could be in serious condition, it is important the doctors get reports so they can act accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-begins-rapid-tests-to-identify-superspreaders/story-itq3M2ijjbwG4blulXYNhL.html
19-04-2020||India||53 new cases in Rajasthan, tally at 1,282||Fifty-three positive cases of Covid-19 were detected in Rajasthan on Saturday, taking the tally to 1,282, but no deaths were reported.Bhilwara, which had emerged as a hotspot is free of the virus now. The last Covid-19 patient was discharged on Friday. Bhilwara had 28 cases and reported two deaths.Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health said that 27 were reported from Bharatpur, 12 from Nagaur, five from Kota, two each from Jodhpur Ajmer and three from Jaipur. One case each was reported from Banswara and Jaisalmer.Jaipur remains a hot spot with 498 cases, of which 343 are from Ramganj. After Jaipur, Jodhpur has the highest number of 156 cases.Health minister Raghu Sharma said the situation in the state is under control and the state has taken all measures to prevent spread of the virus.“We want to strengthen the health infrastructure and testing facilities in the state permanently so that we are ready for future challenges because diseases will keep coming. But if we have the infrastructure then we can tackle them better,” he said.Sharma said he along with the chief minister held a VC with collectors, CMHOs, principals of medical colleges and other officials and have asked for suggestions to improve the infrastructure. “We want to take this opportunity to improve the CHCs, PHCs, sub-centres, district hospitals and medical colleges. We asked them to tell us what infrastructure is needed such as ventilators, ICU beds, x-ray machines, sonography machines, equipment in pathology labs so we have adequate infrastructure at the district level.”He said the government would provide budget from any means available, from SDRF, MLA LAD or CM relief fund.Rohit Kumar Singh said of the 1282 cases, 53 are evacuees from Iran who are housed in the Army wellness centre in Jodhpur and Jaisalmer. The total tests conducted in the state are 47,197 of which 39,092 have tested negative.He said 183 people have been cured and 93 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/53-new-cases-in-rajasthan-tally-at-1-282/story-ikHG1jnjL9gAdC1zTOd3oO.html
19-04-2020||India||Early measures reason for fewer cases in India: WHO regional director||Fewer cases in India are attributable to early and aggressive action to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organisation, South East Asia Region, of which India is a part.High engagement with people; finding, isolating, testing and treating cases and tracing every contact; readying hospitals; and protecting and training health workers are needed to combat Covid-19, she says. In addition, adequate staffing, clinical rotation and psycho-social support to healthcare workers is a must to prevent burnout.She speaks to Hindustan Time on Covid-19 lockdown and India’ efforts in slowing the spread of Covid-19. Here is the full interview:Q: How should lockdowns be lifted?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: Lockdowns must be lifted slowly, when six criteria are fulfilled -- transmission is controlled; health system capacities are in place to detect, test, isolate, treat cases and trace every contact; outbreak risks in health settings are minimised; preventive measures are implemented in social settings such as workplaces and schools; importation risks can be managed; and communities are fully educated, engaged and empowered to adjust to the “new norm”.Q: How do you rate India’s efforts to slow transmission?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: So far, the numbers in India are far less as compared to other countries, which can be attributed to early and aggressive measures that the country has been taking. The top-most leadership is driving a whole-of-government and whole-of-society response to the global pandemic.Q: How does WHO define community transmission?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: Community transmission is confirmed when the source of infection is not clear. In other words, when transmission in a given area is extensive, in multiple locations, without reported travel history to areas reporting community transmission, and without epidemiological links to known cases. But whatever the stage, the key action points remain -- engage with people; find, isolate, test and treat cases and trace every contact; ready hospitals; and protect and train health workers. That’s the only way to combat Covid-19.Q: Some states in India are adopting pool testing. Is it an effective public health tool?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: WHO is aware the Indian Council of Medical Research is going ahead with pool testing in some states, especially in the non-hotspot areas. While WHO is working on bringing out comprehensive guidelines, we welcome measures to scale up testing.Q: Given the shortage of kits, how can testing be scaled up?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: Good laboratory practices that produce accurate results are key to assure a good public health response. The availability of timely and accurate results can be threatened when testing demands outstrip capacity, such as when there is a backlog for testing and it is no longer possible to turn around results within 24 to 48 hours; the demand for laboratory reagents exceeds the capacity for supply; laboratory staff are exhausted and working hours need to be reduced; the number of incoming samples exceeds the capacity for safe pretesting storage; critical staff become infected or are otherwise unable to perform their duties (for example, being in quarantine); or laboratory instruments can no longer be serviced or properly maintained. Some of these constraints can be overcome by a proper risk assessment in the early phase of an outbreak and preventive solutions put in place in advance.Q: What are the WHO recommendations for testing when resources are limited?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: When resources are limited in areas with community transmission, prioritisation for testing should be given to people who are at risk of developing severe disease and vulnerable populations, who will require hospitalisation and advanced care for Covid-19; health workers (including emergency services and non-clinical staff) regardless of whether they are a contact of a confirmed case (to protect health workers and reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission); the first symptomatic person in a closed setting (for example, schools, long-term living facilities, prisons, hospitals) to quickly identify outbreaks and ensure containment measures. All other individuals with symptoms related to the close settings may be considered probable cases and isolated without additional testing if testing capacity is limited.Q: Does warm and humid weather slow Sars-CoV2 transmission?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: There is no evidence yet that the virus would not survive in high temperature.Q: What steps should India take to protect health workers?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: To prevent infection in healthcare settings, WHO recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions by health care workers caring for patients with Covid-19; and airborne precautions in settings where procedures and support treatments generate aerosols are performed.The correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE) is critical, in particular wearing appropriate PPE for the clinical setting, paying special attention to procedures to put on and remove it correctly, and adhering to hand hygiene and other infection protection and control (IPC) measures. When these precautions are applied correctly and consistently, alongside standard precautions and administrative, engineering and environmental controls, the risk for health care workers’ infections is substantially reduced or avoided altogether.WHO has also developed a risk assessment tool for health care workers exposed in a healthcare facility and a sero-epidemiological protocol to determine risk factors for infection among them, and is finalizing an in-depth epidemiological surveillance tool for health care workers’ infections.Health care workers caring for patients with Covid-19 are subject to long working hours, fatigue, occupational burn-out, stigma, physical and psychological violence, and back injury from patient handling. IPC measures must be complemented by occupational safety and health measures, psycho-social support, adequate staffing levels, and clinical rotation, to reduce the risk of burn-out, for safe and healthy working environment.Q; What is the WHO recommended treatment for Covid-19?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: No pharmaceutical products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of Covid-19. However, a number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the Solidarity trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries.Q: What is the progress on the Solidarity trial of four new therapies? When are results expected?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: WHO is working hard with international researchers to generate the evidence about which medicines are most effective for treating Covid-19. So far, 74 countries have either joined the Solidarity trial or are in the process of joining and more than 200 patients had been randomly assigned to one of the study arms. Each new patient who joins the trial gets us one step closer to knowing which drugs work.Q: Will President Trump’s suspension of funding affect WHO’s work?Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh: Right now, Covid-19 is the WHO priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-measures-reason-for-fewer-cases-in-india-who-regional-director/story-pzo670PRq3OzBFJjSkRQlK.html
19-04-2020||India||Govt injects Rs 36,000 crore of direct cash to farmers since lockdown began||The government has injected nearly Rs 36000 crore of direct cash for farmers in the lockdown period to get the severely affected farm sector back on course again, but transportion, shortage of labour and markets are yet to pick up pace despite relaxations from the ongoing lockdown. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi or PM-KISAN, the income transfer scheme for farmers, the government has transferred Rs 16927 crore to the bank accounts of nearly 84 million farmers since the country went into lockdown on March 24, according to official data. Under PM-KISAN, the government provides income support of Rs 6000 a year to farmers with a valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of Rs 2000 -- one every four months. It was launched on 24 February, 2019, when the first instalment was paid. Cash transfers under the programme take place every four months: for the periods of December to March; April to July; and August to November.Under the state-regulated farm insurance scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), insurance companies have paid Rs 2424 crore in claims in 12 states.Banks have also approved farm loans worth Rs 17,800 crore under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) to 1.82 million farmers out of a total of 8.3 million applications. The payouts are aimed at easing the credit crunch in the farm sector. They will help fund operations for harvesting and sowing in the upcoming kharif or summer-sown season. Shortage of labour and transport facilities remain key hurdles for farmers, as social distancing rules are being enforced on farmers and markets. Transporters said despite the Union home ministry’s guidelines that allow several rural-economy sectors to resume operations from April 20, those employed in these sectors lacked “clarity” on various aspects.“There is still a lot of clarity needed from the government’s side on the guidelines and how and when businesses can resume their operations fully and all of us are still trying to understand this from local authorities,” said Pushkar Singh, the CEO of LetsTransport, a logistics firm. The biggest challenge, Singh said, is that a “lot of migrant workers who work in the logistics sector have left for their homes and it will be a tough task to replace all that workforce in a short period of time”.“The problem is that current harvesting is taking longer because of shortage of labour. This labour shortage could spillover to the summer sowing season as well,” said R Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-injects-rs-36-000-cr-of-direct-cash-to-farmers-since-lockdown-began/story-RXUWWjwDVTwRV5PPIbMxhJ.html
19-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Disease may affect brain, nervous system, say experts||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can, in some instances, lead to disorientation or delirium, say neurologists treating Covid-19 patients. While the focus has so far been on the effect of the disease on the respiratory system, as doctors treat more patients, they are beginning to notice and document new patterns.Neurologists are worried that some patients may be showing only neurological symptoms -- not other common symptoms such as fever and cough. If they are not monitored, diagnosis may be delayed. “Elderly patients with an infection, any infection including urinary tract infection, can develop delirium. The general symptoms with fever could be confusion (delirium, encephalopathy). Loss of taste and smell are likely at the level of receptors in the mucosa,” said Dr Vivek Mathew, professor of neurology at Christian Medical College, Vellore which is treating Covid-19 patients.A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 10 based on data collected from January 16 to February 19 at three Covid-19 care centres in Wuhan -- it included 214 hospitalised patients -- found that 36.4% showed neurological manifestations. Compared to patients with non-severe infection, patients with severe infection were older and had more underlying disorders. These patients showed fewer typical symptoms such as fever and cough but more neurologic symptoms. Global trends seem to bear out the truth of those findings. “In Covid-19, we have so far seen primarily respiratory symptoms or primarily gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms but in the past 10 days, cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (a condition in which a person’s immune system attacks the peripheral nerves) have been documented in other parts of the world ,” Mathew added.Dr Col JD Mukherji, principal director and head of neurology at Max Super Speciality Hospital who is treating some Covid-19 patients says it’s still early days for India . “The general symptoms of the disease are headache, loss of smell and taste, fever, confusion. In China, cases of strokes, seizure and muscle injury have also been documented. We are on a learning curve in India. All of us will start seeing these cases as the numbers rise,” said Dr Mukherji.He listed the four ways in which the virus can affect the brain: direct viral injury, causing symptoms like viral encephalitis; an excessive immune response called cytokine storm which can damage the brain; unintended host-immune response where the immune response damages some other structure altogether “like the five cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome documented in Italy”; and indirectly, “in those whose immune response has been deliberately reduced through medication due to conditions such as myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disease) or multiple sclerosis”.“There are no medicines for these neurological symptoms yet. If the entire body is in a cytokine storm, a monoclonal antibody can be used but they are expensive and may not be made available widely. In an Indian setting, some steroids can be used which needs to be studied and decided,” said Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, chairman, PSRI Institute of Neurosciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disease-may-affect-brain-nervous-system-experts/story-l54qQ2O3ehjtVUT2yEfi7J.html
19-04-2020||India||Bengal to begin pool testing to screen suspected Covid cases||The West Bengal government has decided to start pool testing of samples to detect asymptomatic carriers of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This will bolster the testing record of Bengal, which has been repeatedly drawing flak for its low number of tests for Covid-19.Till April 17 in Bengal only 4212 samples were tested. Compared to this Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh had done 17594, 18029 and 20298 tests respectively. Bengal’s population is around 100 million. To date, 287 persons have been infected and 12 persons have died.  If a negative result turns up, all samples are assumed to be negative. This method reduces the number of test kits used, compared to testing individual samples. This helps to increases the testing capacities and saves time, money and manpower.While pool sampling has already been started by the authorities in Uttar Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a few other states are also planning to start it. UP was the first state to start. Pool testing was used to contain the spread of the virus in Germany and Israel.“In order to increase the capacity of the laboratories to screen more numbers of samples it has been decided to use pooled samples for screening of suspected Covid-19 cases in West Bengal,” said an order issued by the state government on Saturday.A top official of the state health department said that pool sampling will be done for asymptomatic patients in those areas where prevalence of the disease is less than 2% of the population.“Samples will be collected from asymptomatic patients during community survey and surveillance. Those suspects who have come in contact with Covid-19 patients and are living in areas where the disease has spread will not be included,” said the official.Out of the 23 districts in West Bengal, at least 10 districts have not reported any case so far. Officials said that at least 81% of the cases are confined in urban areas with north and central Kolkata with the urban areas of Howrah reporting the maximum cases. There is also a high prevalence of the disease in North 24 Parganas.“We will take samples of five persons in one pool. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already issued some guidelines for pool testing and those will be followed,” the official said.“The more you test, the more you can detect asymptomatic carriers. Random sampling and pool testing are ways through which you can ramp up your testing record. This is a welcome step and the need of the hour,” said Dr Kunal Sarkar, head of the cardiac surgery department at Medica Superspecialty Hospital, one of the doctors who raised the need for pool sampling.“This will help us cover more persons in less time—who are presently not showing any symptom but may be carriers. This is a big step taken by the government,” said Dr Sukumar Mukherjee, a medical expert in the Covid-19 advisory panel set by the state government.Saturday’s order came a day after the division bench of Calcutta high court chief justice T B N Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee heard arguments on a writ petition and asked the government to inform what action was being taken to tackle the outbreak and how it was determining the cause of deaths, containing the spread of the disease and protecting medical staff and doctors by following guidelines of the ICMR and World Health Organization.The main contention of the petition is that the West Bengal government is not following the guidelines of the WHO and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on testing, data sharing and safety precautionsGoverner alleges PDS scamBengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has alleged that there is a scam in the public distribution system (PDS) in the state, an allegation that was echoed by the leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Taking to social media, Dhankhar wrote on Saturday, “Covid-19 has to be unitedly fought on the ground and not in media/public relations. No politics at all. Worried-PDS SCAM getting bigger by the day. PDS system is in virtual political hijack-a crime. Free ration for needy and not coffers. Defaulters be sternly dealt @MamataOfficial.”The BJP’s Darjeeling MP Raju Singh Bista and Alipurduar’s MP John Barla have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging a scam in PDS. Bista has also spoken to Governor Dhankhar in this regard. Dhankhar’s tweet came two days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee acknowledged deficiencies in delivering ration to the needy and also removed the state food and supplies secretary.“There is a problem with ration distribution in only about 10% of cases. We have to look into it and solve the problem,” she had said on Thursday.The state government has said that nearly 7.5 crore people will receive free ration for six months. The state’s population stood at 91.3 million, according to the 2011 census.The BJP, however, has demanded the resignation of the state’s food and supplies minister Jyoti Priya Mallick.“What’s the gain in making the secretary a scapegoat? It’s the minister who needs to be removed if he does not resign on his own,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said on Saturday.Mallick refused to comment, saying that the chief minister had asked every leader and worker of the party to refrain from indulging in trading political barbs in the time of crisis.On Saturday, Left leaders and workers, too, staged demonstrations in various parts of the state, including in the districts of Jalpaiguri, Nadia and Kolkata, alleging poor handling of relief work and PDS distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-begin-pool-testing-to-screen-suspected-covid-cases/story-PwJ6GNetLYiLrx8ysjNE5K.html
19-04-2020||India||Kerala gets ready for 200,000 expat workers||Kerala is preparing for the return of at least two lakh expatriates, mainly blue-collar workers, from West Asia by creating quarantine facilities for them even as the state has reported a slump in the Covid-19 cases while they mount across the country. Officials said it will be a huge challenge given over half of the total Covid-19 cases in Kerala have been traced to those who had returned from the region.Kerala on Saturday reported four cases that took the state’s Covid-19 tally to 399 while at least seven patients were discharged from hospitals. The number of people under observation in the state is now down to 67, the state health department said.The state expects the expatriates to return in batches after the extended lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread ends on May 3. They will be lodged in quarantine homes before they will be allowed to return to their homes only when it is confirmed that they have not contracted the disease, the officials cited above said. Many Covid-19 quarantine centres have come up near international airports in the state. But the officials said they are not sufficient and vacant flats, houses and houseboats were being considered for quarantining them. Work is in progressing in Alapuzha to convert houseboats into quarantine homes and makeshift Covid-19 hospitals.Around half of the two million people from Kerala working in West Asia live in the United Arab Emirates, which has threatened to impose restrictions on workers from the countries that refuse to take back their citizens from the country. “Kerala is really indebted to its expatriate population for its development and progress. We will try our best to bring them back. We know they are going through distressing times. We are with them. Once they return, we will screen and quarantine them,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice seeking his intervention in bringing the expatriates back.Irudaya Rajan, a migration expert at Thiruvananthapuram’s Centre for Development Studies, said the state faces three issues of retaining migrant workers from other parts of India, return of the expatriates from West Asia and the remittances that will go down. “It has to do a fine balancing act. Migration is there in the DNA of Keralites. If not the Gulf, they will find another place. But at least six months, it has to struggle,” said Rajan. In 2018-19 alone, remittances from expatriates amounted to Rs 88,000 crore. Kerala’s Gross State Domestic Product that year was ₹7,72,894 crore. K C Sajith, a Non-Resident Indian from Kerala in Bahrain, said many countries have evacuated their people from West Asia. “We know India’s numbers are large. But at least the country could have airlifted patients and pregnant women who are stranded. Some of us really feel we are in no man’s land. We hope post-lockdown, it [evacuation] will be expedited,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gets-ready-for-200-000-expat-workers/story-g0az74llN4cPw0qwyh5V9M.html
19-04-2020||India||Govt plans hubs to manufacture renewable energy equipment||The Centre has written to the states and port authorities asking them to identify land parcels of 50 to 500 acres for setting up hubs for manufacturing renewable energy equipment to meet domestic demands as well as to attract firms shifting base from China amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “It may be stated that in a time when many companies are planning to shift their manufacturing base from China, it is opportune time for India to bring policy changes for facilitating and catalysing manufacturing in India,” the Union new and renewable energy ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The pandemic originated from China, where it has disrupted supply chains and promoted many companies to think about shifting their manufacturing base to other countries. Japan has allocated a package of $2.2 billion to help its manufacturing firms shift production out of China due to the outbreak. The Tuticorin Port Trust, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have expressed interest in setting up renewable energy parks, according to the ministry. The Centre is separately planning to utilise vacant land belonging to the railways to set up solar power plants of 30 gigawatts (GW) capacity. The railways plans to set up plants to generate 10 GW under the first phase.According to officials aware of the development, renewable energy secretary, chaired a meeting with representatives of manufacturing companies last week to discuss. The ministry is in touch with trade commissioners and representatives of various countries to invite foreign firms to invest in India, they added. India also reached out to the US India Strategic Partnership Forum, a non-profit organisation, earlier this week and sought collaboration to attract investments by American firms, the ministry said. “These hubs will manufacture equipment like silicon ingots and wafers, solar cells and modules, wind equipment and ancillary items like back sheets, glass, steel frames, inverters, batteries etc,” an official said on condition of anonymity. India has around 10 GW of wind equipment manufacturing capacity and imports nearly 85% of solar cells and modules. “To incentivise domestic manufacturing, the government of India has already announced provisions to enable levying of basic customs duty on import of solar cells and modules,” the ministry said. The ministry has also set up a Renewable Energy Facilitation and Promotion Board to facilitate investment in the sector. “The ministry has also strengthened the clauses in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to boost investor confidence. ... Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency have reduced their repayment charges to 2% for enhancing the fund availability for new projects in the sector. IREDA [Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited] has brought out a new scheme for project-specific funding to promote RE [renewable energy] manufacturing in India,” the ministry added. India’s renewable energy sector has also been tasked to meet its power generation target of 175 GW by 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-hubs-to-manufacture-renewable-energy-equipment/story-tBCuSFvfQ3Lba5HiQq1HyN.html
19-04-2020||India||Centre offers apps to help states track Covid-19 quarantine breakers||The Union government’s telecommunications department is offering states the ability to mass track people using mobile network tower data, offering a platform that can let ground-level authorities create virtual geo-fences for those meant to be in quarantine, as well as a second service that can let officials send out SMS messages to people in a specific area for Covid-19 containment efforts.Officials in several states have acknowledged previously that they use mobile network information to monitor those meant to be under quarantine, but the Centre’s pitch to other states that are not using such services at present details how these tools work and the sort of legal authorization behind it. The first service, a mobile device surveillance system called Covid Quarantine Alert System, uses cellphone tower – also called a base transceiver station (BTS) – data to determine the approximate location of a person. If this person has been put on a watch-list, the system throws up an alert if their phone goes out of that geographic area and connects to a different BTS, according to an official who asked not to be named.To put someone on a watch-list, state authorities will need to send the person’s phone number to the department of telecom (DoT). An alert will also be sent if a mobile number if switched off for too long, the official quoted above said, adding that the tracking will not work if people leave their phones behind.“As on April 16, we tracked the movement of 70,422 persons in states including Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. The service is authorised by the home secretary of the respective states and is allowed under the provision of section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph’s act for public emergency,” the person quoted above said.The law invoked, telegraph act’s section 5(2), is used for legal interception of telecommunications that is allowed in the Indian constitution under specific conditions, such as for national security and to prevent a crime. Breaking quarantine is a criminal offence under Section 188 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, which has been invoked since India declared the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) a health emergency.The second service, called Covid-19 Savdhan, too has been deployed by some states. “Covid-19 Savdhan allows messaging in a targeted geographic area, we can send message to targeted groups, narrowing it down to one mobile tower. It is of great use in the hotspots and containment zones. This is again being done in Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Sikkim, Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab and Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” the functionary quoted above said.To get more states to start using these utilities, the Union government first reached out through the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The DoT will now write to the chief secretaries of those that have not adopted it, the person quoted above said, adding that both services are free of charge. The official also said that states will not be passed on the names of the mobile phone users. “It is a non-intrusive way of checking if a person is within the tower area; we don’t monitor the phone usage,” this person added. A second official who occupies a senior post in the telecom department, said the tools have been developed by C-DOT to help health and disaster management authorities. “Covid Savdhan application, in particular, enables authorities to reach out to all mobile subscribers in any particular containment zone up to the level of individual mobile tower and convey targeted messages about health, well-being, water supply etc by means of SMS in local language,” this person added.The messaging service is available in all regional languages, and so far 26 million messages have been sent out through the platform for Covid-19 related communication till now. C-Dot is a government agency that develops computer applications for use in telecommunications.Experts said for the government legally use such surveillance mechanisms,there needs to be an order issued by the Union as well as the state governments. “The systems of mass surveillance which are being deployed are being done without any clear legal authority or limits. While the Telegraph Act does permit the government to place people under surveillance, it also contains safeguards which must be followed. It also remains an open question how the Central government’s cellphone tracking data will integrate with the data gathered by the Aarogya Setu app,” said Apar Gupta from the Internet Freedom Foundation, who was one of the lawyers in a PIL filed by the PUCL that led to the codification of the guidelines under section 5(2). “While there is a concept in health about disaster and epidemic tracking, those are applied only to people who fall sick. These steps are larger in ambit and the fundamental right to privacy is breached. The government should be transparent and issue orders, while letting people know that this is a temporary measure, that a complaint officer will be instated, and talk about how the data will be dealt with once the pandemic is over,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima of the digital rights group Access Now. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apps-to-help-states-track-quarantine-breakers/story-BncME2tvp3zeOoVqtEtDFI.html
19-04-2020||India||Flights, trains unlikely to begin on May 3, GoM looks at May 15||Restrictions on air and train travel may continue beyond May 3, when the 40-day lockdown in India to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic comes to an end, at least three people who attended a Group of Ministers (GoM) meeting on Saturday said on condition of anonymity. One Union minister said that there was a suggestion in the meeting chaired by Defence minister Rajnath Singh at his house that air travel may be started on May 15. These and other suggestions from a free-wheeling discussion attended by ministers including Textile minister Smriti Irani, aviation minister Hardeep Puri and others, will be conveyed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a final decision.“There was a discussion on restarting air operations. The aviation minister also said that the planes being parked were also leading to an expense,’’ said one of the attendees. Puri declined comment.Meanwhile, Air India opened up international bookings from June 1, 2020 and bookings on select domestic routes from May 4, 2020. ``There were no specific dates discussed about when air and rail travel will start,’’ said an official who attended the meeting. “t is perhaps fair to say that it will take time. It will certainly go beyond May 3. In fact, it will be perhaps the last thing that is allowed.’’As PM Modi takes a final call about when to restart travel, another minister told HT that one of the suggestions at the meeting was on special trains to ferry migrants who are stranded. “It could be a non-stop train from Thiruvananthapuram to Bhubaneswar for example,” this person added. “We discussed ways to mitigate the hardships faced by the people and the role ministries can play in providing relief to people,” Singh tweeted after chairing the meeting. He said the guidelines to allow limited activities after April 20 and the measures announced by Reserve Bank of India amid the coronavirus crisis were also appreciated.``We were all glad that the Prime Minister had the foresight to announce the lockdown before any one else,’’ said Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan who attended the meeting. He added that there was no shortage of food or essential supplies in the country.“The GoM appreciated disbursement of Rs 31,000 crore to more than 332.5 million beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana to mitigate the problems of economically weaker sections of population,” said another official who attended the meeting .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gom-discuss-curbs-on-air-travel-special-trains-for-migrants/story-xjsJX05bmaitDJ4SZkLZPJ.html
19-04-2020||India||15 districts across 9 states report over 50% Covid-19 cases: Ministry data||The ministry of health finally updated on Saturday the number of cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across districts, showing that the pandemic has now spread to 56% of India’s districts, but that 15 districts across nine states account for half the cases -- data that will come in useful as India opens up its unaffected (and relatively less affected) areas for business and other activities , albeit with social distancing and other norms, starting Monday. The data also shows that five districts, Mumbai, Indore, Jaipur, Pune and Ahmedabad, account for around a third of all cases. The concentration is similar to that seen in other countries. In the US, New York State, for instance, accounts for 33% of all cases and New York City alone, 19%. In China, Hubei province accounts for 81% of the total cases.To be sure, the data released by the ministry is only for 12863 cases . According to the ministry, on 18 April, there were 14,378 cases. The number of dead stood at 480. The ministry’s dashboard lags HT’s dashboard by a few hundred cases usually. HT’s dashboard is based on data from the Covid19india.org tracker and state health departments. According to the data, 11,783 cases for which districts are known, have been reported from 406 districts, nearly 56% of the 731 districts in the country. All the analysis is based on these numbers -- 11783 cases across 406 districts. There are 1,080 other people who have been found positive from Tablighi Jamaat members who were quarantined in Delhi. They have not been classified into any specific district -- perhaps because they come from all over and the March congregation of the Jamaat has emerged a super-event, infecting thousands directly and indirectly. On Saturday, the ministry said in a briefing that 4,291 Covid-19 cases around India are linked to the Nizamuddin Markaz cluster, and that the event has resulted in around 40,000 people being quarantined.Even though 406 districts have reported cases of coronavirus, the 11,783 cases are not evenly distributed among them. More than 50% of these cases come from just 15 districts across nine states. These 15 districts are either predominantly urban areas or have a significant share of urban population. About one in three cases reported in India come from just five districts – Mumbai, Indore, Jaipur, Pune and Ahmedabad. Together, 4,137 cases have been reported from these five districts alone. Of them, Mumbai has the highest number of cases: 2070, or 17.6%, of all cases in the country. (See map) Of the 406 districts which have reported cases, 226 have reported fewer than 10 cases. This analysis is important because it could decide which districts can partially lift lockdown restrictions after April 20. Of them, 68 districts have reported only one case, 41 have reported two cases, while 64 districts have reported three to five cases each.That most cases are largely confined to big cities is evident with the city-level figures as some cities have more than one district. For instance, none of the 11 districts of Delhi appear in the list of 20 districts with the highest number of cases, but if Delhi is seen as one unit (say a single district), it appears in fifth place. Add to it 1,080 positive Tablighi Jamaat members, and Delhi is second to only Mumbai in terms of number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-districts-report-over-50-covid-cases-data/story-qYdP6zXkNkcPOeRXybRjjK.html
19-04-2020||India||Trying to make e-learning immersive and constructive: Pokhriyal||Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ spoke to Hindustan Times about the CBSE and University exams, fee structures in schools during Covid-19,summer vacations, e-learning, and research linked to the coronavirus disease. Edited excerpts:Covid-19 struck at a time when thousands of students were waiting for their CBSE Class 12 exams to finish. Will it be possible to conduct the remaining exams, or are you considering alternative measures to promote students?The safety of teachers and students is our prime concern. We also need to ensure social distancing in the examination room. Keeping these considerations in mind, and to ease the pressure on the minds of students, I directed CBSE to reschedule the board examinations for Class 10 and 12. In view of these concerns, will now be conducting board examinations of 29 core courses, instead of 83 courses. The decision on the conduction of examinations will be taken by undertaking extensive consultation with various education authorities and by keeping all aspects related to entrance exams, admissions dates, etc, in mind. CBSE will give notice of about 10 days to all stakeholders before starting examinations.Is there a possibility that there won’t be any exams?Our students, their parents and teachers are all prepared for the circumstances that may occur. It cannot be predicted now what the situation will be on May 3. Many of our schools are functioning as quarantine centres. It has to be seen what decision the government takes. I would assure students not to be anxious, we will continue to support them in all possible ways. Is it possible to get the answer sheets evaluated during the lockdown period?Due to present situation and countrywide lockdown, CBSE has not been able to continue its evaluation work. The board will come out with further instructions for evaluating and dates for restart of evaluation work in various evaluation centres after rightfully assessing the situation. The safety and health of our teachers is as important for us that of students.Similarly, universities are also unable to conduct exams. Do you think it is possible to hold online exams?To assess the possibility of conduction of online exams for higher education MHRD has constituted a task force under UGC. We will issue the guidelines on the basis of that report. Does the HRD ministry plan to recommend early declaration of the summer vacations to coincide with the lockdown period?MHRD has not recommended early declaration of the summer vacations to coincide with the lockdown period. We believe that pandemic should not be a reason to stop. We are trying our best to find opportunities to make sure learning continues.MHRD has set up a task force under NCERT to deliberate on the academic calendar. To ensure that learning does not stop, MHRD recommends the use of e- learning platforms -- like Diksha, Swayam, Swayam Prabha, e–patshala, Nreor.You have been focusing on online learning. Can it be an effective substitute to classroom learning?I agree that the pandemic has derailed the classroom process, but at the same time I would encourage all the students to continue learning using e-resources. E-Learning provides wider opportunities for enhanced learning, flexibility of learning at your convenience, uniform quality content delivery, reusability of content, less paper for hand-outs and books, saves time by enabling quick access to information, and the ease of research across subjects.The teachers and students are putting in remarkable efforts to make sure that the learning does not stop. We are putting in our efforts and resources to make e-learning more immersive and constructive, and to nurture the capability of turning this crisis into an opportunity.Questions are being asked about the digital divide when it comes to online learning. Has the HRD ministry made any efforts or conveyed concerns related to this issue to the IT ministry?To address the digital divide, MHRD has tied up with Information & Broadcasting ministry to air Swayam Prabha channels on their DTH platform, Tata Sky, and Airtel DTH. Earlier, Swayam channels were be available on DD-DTH, Dish TV and Jio TV App. Now a student anywhere in India can request the DTH service provider for these channels without any extra cost as these are free-to-air channels. Swayam Prabha is a group of 32 DTH channels providing high quality educational curriculum based course contents covering diverse disciplines.We are also trying to explore the option of All India Radio to transact the curriculum to students so that we can reach the last person in the queue.You have appealed to private schools to not pressure students into paying quarterly fees. You have also asked schools not to lay off teachers. Have you planned any further steps or consultation?Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has urged the citizens to give priority to human values in the time of this pandemic. In line with the same, I have appealed to all the private schools, given the difficult circumstances of the unprecedented health emergency. It is recommended to the private schools to not to charge the increased annual feel from the parents. Also, to not to take the fees for three months together. Further, schools should be disbursing timely salary to their teachers and entire staff.In case schools continue to demand high fees or remove teachers, will there be some action?I feel the state education ministers will handle these issues in appropriate manner.Have you looked at the research carried out by educational institutions under HRD? How satisfied are you?To monitor and coordinate the research and development,we have recently formed a separate and a new research division within the ministry. Earlier, monitoring work was undertaken under the respective bureaus.In respect to Covid-19, IITs are doing remarkable research on technology initiatives to control infections. More than 250 projects have been undertaken in the following areas -- personal protective equipment, testing kits, sanitisation, medical equipment and robots, surveillance, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, and data analytics/AI to model epidemic patterns and disease dynamics.Since the entire focus has shifted to the coronavirus, the biggest educational reform, the New Education Policy (NEP) is held up. What is its status?We are coherently working at a faster pace on the New Education Policy. We will submitting it to the Cabinet soon.Seven IITs issued a statement that they were boycotting the Times Higher Education ranking because of doubtful criteria. How does the ministry view this development? Do you support the IITs?It has come to my notice. They feel the ranking agency has worked in an arbitrary manner. There must be some instances because of which they felt so. I also sometimes feel that there should be an understanding of the Indian context. I will speak to the directors of the IITs and if needed also look at the parameters of the ranking agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trying-to-make-e-learning-immersive-and-constructive-pokhriyal/story-ceSMNPJfyLImilbMoS5hUK.html
19-04-2020||India||328 new cases push Maharashtra tally to 3,648||Maharashtra on Saturday registered a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases as 328 people tested positive for the disease and took the state’s tally to 3,648, the state government said. The number of people tested positive was more than double of those diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday--118. Of the new cases recorded on Saturday, 184 were from Mumbai, which now has a tally of 2,268, followed by Pune with 78. This is the third time this month that the state has reported over 300 cases in a day. Maharashtra also reported 11 Covid-19 related deaths on Saturday, taking the toll from the disease to 211.Officials said the trajectory of the cases needs to plateau by April 21 for it to remain under control. “We expect the cases to dip after the two 14-day incubation cycles, which began on March 22 when over 2.20 lakh people arrived at the Mumbai airport, end. If the containment is good, it would go down,” said T P Lahane, director, directorate of medical education and research.Officials said the mortality rate in Maharashtra has also undergone a gradual decline even as it is still double that of the country. After touching the 7%-mark on April 12, the mortality rate is decreasing primarily due to early admission of Covid-19 patients to hospitals and also due to concentrated efforts to treat patients with underlying illnesses, officials said. The mortality rate on April 14, 15, 16 and 17 was 6.84%, 6.61%, 6.41% and 6.05%. Lahane said the mortality rate is slowly decreasing because of early admissions of patients to hospitals. “Earlier, most patients died between the first day and third day of admission. Now, it happens after six to seven days after admission in critical cases. When they are in the hospital, we can monitor their lungs, blood-pressure etc.”A health department official also attributed the reduction in deaths in the last few days to a more “focused” approach of treating patients with comorbidities. “More attention is being given to patients with underlying illnesses with early admissions. It helps hospitals to treat them well so that they do not become critical cases,” an official said requesting anonymity.The state government on Saturday started 25 more dedicated hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. With this, the number of such facilities has gone up to 55 with a total capacity of 6,660 beds, said Rajesh Tope, state health minister. The state government has also got permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research to start six new laboratories for Covid-19 tests, state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said. The total number of laboratories in the state has now gone up to 42 that with a capacity of 7,600 tests daily. The Maharashtra government also on Saturday issued orders that its employees will start working from Monday with 10% strength. The new order also made attendance of secretaries, joint or deputy secretaries, mandatory. Women officers can be exempted from it by orders of the departmental heads. On March 23, the state government had issued orders that it would operate with only 5% of the staff.The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation or municipal corporation buses will be used to ferry government employees from Monday. With the suburban railway network shut due to the lockdown, the buses will be operational between 7 am to 11 am and 4 pm to 7 pm, a state government order state. The state government has also decided to provide financial assistance of Rs 2,000 to all the registered construction workers for them to tide over hardships caused by the lockdown. An order in this regard came days after hundreds of migrant workers gathered outside the Bandra railway station demanding they be sent back to their homes last week. The one-time monetary help will be credited into the bank accounts of over 1.2 million workers, officials said. The assistance will cost the state government around Rs 250 crore.The state on Friday allowed construction work in cities, including Mumbai and Pune, with a rider that prior permission from civic authorities will be mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/328-new-cases-push-maha-tally-to-3-648/story-WP0uG8kqh05BiyCDIIKOFL.html
19-04-2020||India||Sharjeel Imam charged with sedition in Jamia riots case||The Delhi police on Saturday filed a charge sheet against Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam for his alleged role in instigating riots outside Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) by allegedly delivering a seditious speech during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in December last year. Imam was arrested from Bihar’s Jehanabad on January 28 for the speech on December 13 two days after protesters outside JMI clashed with police during a march against the law. At least 100 people were injured in the violence while at least four buses were torched, over 100 two-wheelers and other vehicles damaged.Delhi police spokesman Anil Mittal said they have filed a supplementary charge sheet against Imam for instigating and abetting the Jamia riots. “During investigation, on the basis of evidence collected, sections 124 A IPC [Indian Penal Code] and 153 A IPC, for sedition and for promoting enmity between classes, were invoked. In this case, the first charge sheet was filed in February against the rioters arrested by a Delhi police’s special investigation team that is probing the violence. A supplementary charge sheet in continuation of the earlier charge sheet has now been filed in the court of the metropolitan magistrate, Saket,” Mittal said.Days before his arrest, a video purportedly showing Imam talking about blocking the Siliguri Corridor, or Chicken’s Neck, in West Bengal to isolate the northeastern states from the rest of India for a month was widely circulated on social media. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. The speech led to registration of cases against Imam, who faces life imprisonment if convicted, in at least five states including Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.Imam’s mother, Agsan Rahim, had then said her son’s speech was misconstrued and taken out of context and that he is innocent. However, she could not be contacted for comments over the latest development.A 20-member group of scholars, filmmakers, advocates and writers released a statement on Saturday calling the recent arrests of scholars a witch-hunt. The group, which includes Manisha Sethi, advocate Yug Mohit Chaudhary and Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar, among others, said that instead of engaging with protesters, the state has chosen to detain and arrest them under harsh penal provisions. It said that while the crime branch is already probing the case of the riots in Northeast Delhi, the Delhi police’s special cell has filed a separate First Information Report (FIR) under which the scholars were being arrested. “This FIR has enabled the stitching together of a political narrative where a direct link is sought to be made between anti-CAA protests and the widespread violence that rocked the Northeast Delhi at the end of February,” the statement said.Earlier this month, Meeran Haider, 35, a PhD student and the president of Rashtriya Janata Dal’s youth wing’s Delhi unit, was arrested for his alleged role in instigating the Northeast Delhi riots. His party leaders have denied the allegations.The CAA’s passage in December to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims, who have entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before December 31, 2014, triggered protests across the country. Opponents of the law insist it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out the Muslims and links faith to citizenship in a secular country. They say it could result in the expulsion or detentions of the Muslims unable to provide the documentation if the law is seen in the context of a pan-India NRC. A process carried out in Assam to detect undocumented immigrants led to the exclusion of around two million people from the NRC in 2018.The Centre has maintained there were no immediate plans for implementing a pan-India NRC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharjeel-imam-charged-with-sedition-in-jamia-riots-case/story-dxoTsW3cNgJbdslxHGu4hI.html
19-04-2020||India||Govt to vet Chinese stakes in India to avert takeovers||All investments from China will now be subjected to scrutiny in India, according to a new government order revising the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy to curb “opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the current Covid-19 pandemic”.The move comes a week after housing finance lender HDFC said in a regulatory filing that China’s central bank had raised its stake to over 1%, a disclosure that prompted political leaders such as Congress MP Rahul Gandhi to urge the government for steps to protect Indian companies.Investments from an entity in a country that shares a land border with India will now require government approval, according to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) notification issued on Friday, which did not name China. The target of this move, however, is clear since the other neighbours with which India shares a land border – Pakistan and Bangladesh – have already been under such scrutiny due to national security reasons. The order also requires government’s approval in transferring ownership of a domestic company to any “existing or future” foreign investor belonging to these countries.“The change in the policy will now make it mandatory for all foreign investment from China, Pakistan and Bangladesh to go through government’s scrutiny. So far, permission was mandatory only for investments coming from Pakistan and Bangladesh,” according to an official who asked not to be named. Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar share borders with India, but there are some exemptions for Nepal- and Bhutan-based entities, this person added.Shortly after the announcement, Congress leader Gandhi said in a tweet: “I thank the government for taking note of my warning and amending the FDI norms to make it mandatory for government approval in some specific cases”.Indian shares, in line with global indices, have tanked since the Covid-19 pandemic began taking hold in early March. The index Sensex has lost over 17% since March 2, the day the first new Covid-19 cases were detected in the country.Experts said the takeover threat is not completely ill-founded. Vikram Doshi, partner, tax and regulatory, at global consultancy firm PwC India said, “Covid-19 will impact several businesses, especially ones that are highly leveraged. It will open up takeover opportunities in many sectors.”“This press note is an attempt to place a check and give the government an opportunity to review such takeovers and investments coming into India from specific jurisdictions,” he added.Atul Pandey, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co said, “The recent notification by the government primarily intends to stem any attempts by Chinese firms to take control of Indian firms which have been affected and weakened by Covid-related lockdowns.” “However it is important to note that this notification will have the force of law once necessary amendments are introduced to the relevant FEMA [Foreign Exchange Management Act] regulations. Similar steps are also being taken by the European Union and other jurisdictions like Australia,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-vet-chinese-stakes-in-india-to-avert-takeovers/story-gWhGXgbOBRWpJIogOzv6LL.html
19-04-2020||India||ICMR study shows side effects of HCQ in health care staff||Some side effects, such as abdominal pain and nausea have been observed in healthcare workers, who are a part of the study being conducted in India, to look at the prophylactic (preventive) effects of the anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday.The ICMR said that it was conducting a two-arm study on the prophylactic (prevention) and therapeutic (treatment) effects of HCQ against Covid-19.“The average age of those who showed side effects against the drug was 35 years. The most common complaint was of abdominal pain that was reported by about 10% of those who took the medicine; 6% reported experiencing nausea, and the other effects were of less proportion such as 1.3% complaining of hypoglycemia [low blood sugar levels],” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology and communicable disease division, ICMR, who is supervising the trials on behalf of ICMR.Of those healthcare workers who reported adverse drug reaction, about 22% suffered from some underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, blood pressure, cardiovascular or respiratory disease.“We observed that despite being healthcare workers themselves, about 14% had not even got their ECGs done to check their heart function before. It seems they were aware of their health condition which made them volunteer to take the medicine so that they would get protection against infection,” said Dr Gangakhedkar.Another observational study is being done to know its treatment benefits among Covid-19 patients,The observational study is being done in a cohort of 480 Covid-19 patients, who will be given a specific doze of HCQ along with the antibiotic, azithromycin, for eight weeks. “It will take about two and a half months to get done with the study and know the results as we are working under restricted research conditions because of the lockdown. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences is the nodal site for both the studies,” said Gangakhedkar. On whether any study was being done in India to check the efficacy of the anti-viral drug, Remdesivir, which has shown promise in stopping the replication mechanism of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, Dr Gangakhedkar said that India was a part of World Health Organization’s (WHO) SOLIDARITY trial, and Remdesivir was one of the trial arms.“It is the Gilead company’s product, and they say in about 68% of the Covid-19 patients, it has been effective in reducing oxygen support. However, this conclusion is not a part of any clinical trial but an observational study for which the drug was given to patients on compassionate grounds. Now it has started a trial on 5,500 patients to check the dosage efficacy of five days vs. 10 days. However, even an interim analysis of it isn’t out yet. There is some time before we get any concrete evidence, and in some time, if we find it’s working, we will act accordingly,” said Gangakhedkar.“Though Gilead company has a patent on this drug molecule, during pandemic situations, company’s charge some royalty from generic manufacturers and allow them to manufacture the drug,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-study-shows-side-effects-of-hcq-in-health-care-staff/story-NNWpm5nlmjuPX3o4V9oNGL.html
19-04-2020||India||Kerala to convert at least 2,000 houseboats into isolation wards||Kerala officials on Wednesday said they would turn the state’s houseboats into isolation wards for Covid-19 patients.State public works department minister G Sudhakaran said work is on to make at least 2,000 wards in houseboats.“Boat owners have agreed to the district administration’s proposal, and these wards will be ready by April-end,” Sudhakaran said. There are 700 licensed houseboats in the district and some of the double-decker boats have over six bedrooms. Many in the film industry, as well as entrepreneurs, own houseboats in Kuttanad, often termed the rice bowl of Kerala owing to its paddy production.The state is expecting an influx of expatriates in the wake of reports that some West Asian nations are planning to impose severe restrictions on countries that refuse to take back their citizens. The United Arab Emirates has announced a warning in this regard. Among three million Indians in UAE, at least one –third are from Kerala ,so the state is in a hurry to prepare two lakh beds by May first week.“We are happy to hand over our boats. Most of the boats are idle as there are no tourism activities in last two months and we don’t see any revival of business in the coming months also. By handing our boats over, we are joining the global fight against the virus. We see it as our duty and we will provide all help,” said Kevin Rozario, general secretary of the All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Association. He said it is easy to covert boats as they have all facilities of a resort. In case of an emergency, like railways compartments, boats can be taken to secluded spots to keep the contagion in check, said health experts. During the 2018 floods, houseboats and fishermen had played a stellar role by saving many marooned. Alapzuha district collector M Anjana said work was in full swing and all boats will be anchored at the finishing point of the Nehru trophy boat race. The Nehru trophy boat race conducted in August is a major tour attraction of the state. The state tourism department is also helping the district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-convert-at-least-2-000-houseboats-into-isolation-wards/story-yeIM6DoBsOxSAxfRigpkVK.html
19-04-2020||India||47 districts in 23 states, UTs have zero Covid cases: Govt||As many as 47 of India’s 731 districts have not reported any Covid-19 cases in the past 28 days, the ministry of health said in its daily briefing on Saturday. These districts are spread across 23 states and union territories. Another 22 districts, across 12 states, have not reported new cases in the past 14 days, the ministry added. The numbers assume significant as India eases lockdown restrictions in some areas (those unaffected by the pandemic) starting Monday. The ministry also gave out the fatality rate thus far (3.3%) and the recovery rate (13.82%). According to its data, 75% of the dead are over the age of 60 years (42% are over the age of 75), numbers that are in keeping with global trends where most of the fatalities are old. According to the health ministry, the total number of fatalities as on Saturday is 480. This number differs from that in HT’s dashboard which is updated on the basis of information from state health departments and the tracker at Covid19india.org. The ministry also said that almost 30% of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India are related to the Tablighi Jammat’s March meeting at its HQ in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area.“Of the 14378 positive cases reported so far in the country, 4291, which is 29.8% of the cases, are linked to this single source -- the Nizamuddin Markaz cluster,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, in a briefing. Epidemiologists refer to events such as this as super-events -- because they cause a significant number of cases across a wide geography. Agarwal added that 23 states and union territories have reported cases caused directly or indirectly by the meeting. “Some of the high disease burden states in India have a majority of cases linked to the congregation -- 84% cases in Tamil Nadu, 63% in Delhi, 79% in Telangana, 61% in Andhra Pradesh and 59% in Uttar Pradesh. Also, some of the low disease burden states have most of their cases linked with this cluster such as Arunchal Pradesh’s sole positive case, 32 of the 35 cases from Assam and 10 of the 12 cases reported from Andaman Islands,” he said, adding that at least 40,000 people in quarantine are directly and indirectly connected to this super event. “That’s why following lockdown and social distancing measures by every single person is important in containing the spread of the disease,” said Agarwal.The experts say lockdown has played its part in keeping the numbers low so far.“Implementing lockdown has been crucial in delaying the infection rate; it obviously cannot be stopped completely. However, a stricter implementation would have resulted in even lower number of cases, which is why we have to be very careful how we lift lockdown,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, community medicine specialist, Safdarjung Hospital.Of the 480 deaths reported so far, 83% involved patients with so-called co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney or heart ailments, the ministry said. Globally too, those with underlying medical conditions are at high risk of developing severe symptoms when infected by the SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and need to be extra careful.Close to 2000 people who were infected have recovered and have been discharged from hospitals, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/47-districts-in-23-states-uts-have-zero-covid-cases-govt/story-vUZX9eivYeaBE8pgCFHgfN.html
19-04-2020||India||Govt readies for spike in MGNREGS demand||The Centre is preparing for a surge in the demand for jobs under the flagship Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) as tens of thousands of migrant workers left jobless by the lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread have returned to their homes.The MGNREGS will restart on Monday with a focus on irrigation and water conservation works. It is among the activities, including the conditional reopening of industries in rural areas, that the Centre has allowed outside the so-called Covid-19 containment zones from April 20. The lockdown was extended until May 3 earlier this week.The government has made an initial provision for 2807.6 million person-days of work—the highest ever—under the flagship scheme for the financial year (FY) 2020-21 with unemployment rising due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The MGNREGS last year generated 2767.6 million person-days of work largely due to drought in parts of India. This year, despite predictions of a normal monsoon, the Centre has arranged for more MGNREGS work.Between FY 2018-19 and FY 2016-17, the world’s largest job guarantee scheme generated 2565.6 million, 2313.1 million and 2209.3 million person-days of work.Officials said the higher person days of work may also push the government to inject more money into the scheme; the government has to pay higher wages due to an upward revision from April 1.The Centre has announced between Rs 13 and Rs 34 increase in wages under the scheme, which is the highest in six years. There was no wage increase last year in 10 states. In one case, the wage rate was lowered. The new wages will help 128 million MGNREGS workers.Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar reviewed his ministry’s flagship schemes on Thursday and cleared the release of Rs 7,300 crore under the MGNREGS to clear pending dues for FY 2019-20 and to meet wages due for the first fortnight of FY 2020-2021.According to officials aware of the matter, Tomar advised his ministry to help four million people, who have received some money under the rural housing scheme or Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana, to quickly complete building their houses. The Centre has so far released Rs 800.63 crore to the states out of Rs 19,500 crore budget under the scheme, they added.The officials said the focus, however, remains sharply on MGNREGS. They indicated that large projects that involve many workers might be avoided for some time to adhere to the social distancing norms in place to beat the pandemic. Work like building farm ponds, cattle sheds or houses under the PMAYG will be pushed, for now, the officials said.Himanshu, an economist at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University who uses only one name, said it is clear that the government will have to pump in more funds as a huge section of Indian workforce will see MGNREGS as its lifeline in this situation.Economist Reetika Khera said the government should consider paying wages even if some people are unwilling to go to work because of the health risks involved. “We also have to bear in mind that like us, the MGNREGS workers will be nervous about joining work that involves gatherings. This will be an impediment to claiming their legal right. In this situation, the government should give 10 days of wages to every MGNREGS worker for three months. Further, the government must fix the issue of failed and diverted payments arising due to the Aadhaar-payment bridge system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-readies-for-spike-in-mgnregs-demand/story-d5eUqvTTmmj3MXzt8KnthP.html

19-04-2020||India||GST waiver will make domestic PPEs costlier than Chinese products, advise tax experts||Government’s tax experts have advised the finance ministry against removing Goods and Services Tax (GST) on personal protective equipment (PPEs) because producers would not be able to avail credit of taxes paid on inputs of PPEs making domestic products costlier than PPEs imported from China, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.The implication of removing GST on PPEs has been considered after the government received several requests on the ground that the exemption would lead to reduction in prices and hence would benefit the masses in fight against Covid-19, they said requesting anonymity.“GST is a value-added tax and collected at each stage of the supply chain on net basis. Exemption would block input tax credit (ITC) as manufacturers of PPEs will pay GST on inputs but cannot claim ITC because the final product is tax-free. Thus, it will increase the cost of manufacturing,” the first person said.The official said a PPE manufacturer pays 5% GST on fabric and 18% on other inputs, including services. The manufacturer gets tax offset from the 12% levy on the final product that makes net GST on the product to zero.“While GST exemption to PPE would make output GST as zero, the ITC ( GST suffered on inputs) would get blocked (not usable) and would get added to the cost,” a second official said.Therefore, while consumer does not gain from GST exemption, the compliance burden would increase for manufacturer, he said. “The manufacturer would be required to maintain separate account of inputs, input services and capital goods used for manufacture of PPE. In case he is not in a position to maintain separate account, he shall be required to reverse the input tax credit on all inputs used in manufacture of PPE,” he said.“While GST exemption to PPE, would lead to blockage of input tax credit for the domestic manufacturer, import would get price advantage over the domestic product. And substandard Chinese products will flood Indian market,” he said.The government on April 9 exempted crucial medical equipment required to fight Covid-19 from basic customs duty and health cess for six months making imports cheaper up to 22%.“Distorting the rate structure at the cost of domestic supplier may not be desirable in a situation where the government is the single largest buyer, which distributes PPEs for free,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-waiver-will-make-domestic-ppes-costlier-than-chinese-products-advise-tax-experts/story-ayq9AqdoWSuNxcIhOnz81O.html

But India isn’t the only one||The Tablighi Jamaat congregation in its central Delhi headquarters, the Markaz, has been linked to over 4,000 Covid-19 cases in the country, the government announced on Saturday. The Jamaat has been linked to 4,291 of the country’s 14,378 coronavirus cases in the country; nearly three out of every ten cases.But India isn’t the only country in the world that has had to suffer due to Tablighi Jamaat workers unwittingly turning their sect into the country’s virus super spreaders.In several countries - mostly in south and south-east Asia - the Tablighi Jamaat has been linked to 3,000 more cases, and counting.Like neighbouring Pakistan where over 500 of the country’s 7,500-plus cases are prima facie linked to the Jamaat workers. One key hotspot in Pakistan was the Raiwind Ijtema, the annual event in March that, according to the police, was attended by about 100,000 people. The Jamaat puts the size of this congregation at twice as much.Also read: As Tablighi Jamaat-linked cases rise, Delhi govt gives them a different nameBut it is in Malaysia where a Tablighi Jamaat congregation at a sprawling mosque complex on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur is seen as the source of hundreds of new coronavirus cases in the country and far beyond. Malaysia has linked over 1,500 of its 3,500 Covid-19 cases to this congregation.In February, the mosque complex hosted its annual congregation attended by over 15,000 people who dispersed before countries started ordering the shutdown. Some of them are presumed to have come to India.It was only when Telangana confirmed that six people who had attended the Delhi event had tested positive that an alarm was sounded.According to data compiled by Hindustan Times, Jamaat workers have been reported to have tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen that causes the coronavirus disease. For example, 79 of the 5.900 Covid-19 cases detected in Indonesia are linked to the Jamaat.Back in India, the Jamaat challenge appears to be finally in grips in national capital Delhi where the government has traced down hundreds of more people with links to the Jamaat and sent them to quarantine centres. The city hasn’t reported a Jamat-linked positive case in two days.Also read: At Delhi’s Covid-19 review, no answers to 2 crucial questions on Tablighi JamaatOn Saturday, the union health ministry said the Tablighi Jamaat workers account for 63 per cent of the city’s 1,700 cases. But it is worse in Tamil Nadu and Telangana where 84 per cent and 79 per cent of the state’s Covid-19 patients, respectively, are linked to the Markaz.The health ministry said Tablighi Jamaat-linked Covid-19 cases had been reported from 23 states and union territories. In Arunachal Pradesh, the congregation has been linked to its only coronavirus case.The headquarters of the religious sect had emerged as the biggest coronavirus disease hotspots last month after authorities discovered nearly 2,300 workers living in the building in circumstances that made social distancing impossible. Initial tests indicated 24 of them were already positive when officials moved them out, sending them to state-run quarantine facilities. A nationwide manhunt was also launched for the thousands of others who had been to the Markaz earlier and had headed back to the states for missionary work.This week, the Home Ministry expanded this search to cover Rohingya as well after reports that some of them had also been associated with the Jamaat workers and attended the congregation.Over the next few days and weeks, the Centre needs to decide how to proceed against the 854 foreigners who were evacuated from the Markaz and other places in Delhi. They have been blacklisted from returning to India for the next few years. But once they complete their quarantine, the government intends to hand them over to their embassy to deport them. It is not clear yet if foreign nationals who have had FIRs registered against them would be allowed to leave at this point.Indian officials had recently prevented some Malaysians from leaving the country after their links with the Tablighi had surfaced.Malaysian deputy foreign minister Datuk Kamaruddin Jaafar this week told reporters that 17 nationals who took part in the Tablighi gathering in Delhi had been detained by authorities in India. He said they had been charged under the penal code, the disaster management law and the Foreigners Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-000-covid-19-cases-linked-to-jamaat-says-govt-but-india-isn-t-the-only-one/story-CGsIbXftyMbfL2AKPoh8PM.html
19-04-2020||India||Lockdowns work better for rich nations: Study||A hard lockdown may benefit developed countries more than developing and low-income countries, a new study has suggested, indicating that policymakers need to keep in mind the human and economic costs of sweeping restrictions in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The study comes at a time when the Indian government has extended the national lockdown till May 3 but partially relaxed curbs in some areas amid reports of high economic distress in agricultural and small sectors, and in rural areas.The study, by two social scientists at Yale University, used modelling and disease projection data by the Imperial College, London, and found that social distancing and other measures can save a large number of lives in high-income countries because practically any economic cost is worth bearing.But in lower-income countries such as Nigeria, India or Bangladesh, the benefits diminish. The value of benefits estimated for each country translates to a savings of 59% of US GDP, 85% of German GDP, but only 14% of Bangladesh’s GDP, or 19% of India’s, the study contended.“Assuming equally effective social distancing policies, the economic value of moving from a policy stance of no mitigation to social distancing is estimated to be 23.5 times more valuable for the United States compared to India,” Zachary Barnett-Howell, one of the authors of the study and a professor at Yale, told HT on email.The authors said the lower estimated benefits of restrictions were driven by the fact that large sections of the population in low-income countries are dependent on daily wages and small-scale work, which get shuttered. Moreover, many such countries have a relatively younger population, which is less vulnerable to Covid-19.“Not only are the epidemiological and economic benefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies may also exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector lack the resources and social protections to isolate themselves …by limiting their ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity in poor countries,” the study said.Experts admit that enforcing a lockdown is a difficult decision in a country like India because policymakers have to weigh public health benefits with costs such as a sudden economic shock to a large section of people who rely on daily wages to make ends meet.A recent paper for the Centre for Economic Policy Research argued for limited relaxation in the lockdown to allow workers under 40, who are at lower risk of infection, along with antibody testing and suitable social distancing safeguards.“The trade-off is not really between public health and the economy so much as it is between lives and lives: lives that could be compromised by the pandemic on the one hand, and lives, on the other, that could be compromised by loss of incomes, employment, security and access to the necessities of life, including nutrition,” said S Subramanian, one of the authors of the paper ‘India’s Lockdown’ by Debraj Ray, S Subramanian and Lore Vandewalle. Ray, first author of the paper and a professor of economics at New York University, said that a complete lockdown minimised Covid-19 deaths, but not total deaths. “It is a question of lives vs lives, and not lives vs GDP. That is the difference between a developing country and an (economically) developed country. In the latter we can think of serious transfers that will compensate for loss of livelihoods. In the government of India relief package, the transfers are better than nothing, but they’re not enough to prevent the widespread hardship that will accompany a lockdown,” he said.“There are deaths one way or the other. The lockdown deaths will be hugely correlated with people’s economic status --- the poor bear the brunt of it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdowns-work-better-for-rich-nations-study/story-mQ0QeQDMpyASgU2fJDKVmJ.html
19-04-2020||Editorials||Irresponsible actions in US, Brazil, Pakistan can undermine global efforts||When nations across the world are pulling out all the stops to flatten the coronavirus curve, it is incumbent upon leaders to refrain from any statement or action which could exacerbate the situation. But, regrettably, not all world leaders have been responsible or circumspect in their utterances and behaviour. United States President Donald Trump’s tweets asking his supporters to liberate the Democratic states of Virginia, Michigan and Minnesota have been taken as licence to indulge in dangerous behaviour, disregarding norms of social distancing and easing lockdowns of businesses. This puts the lives of people at much greater risk. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsanaro has summarily sacked his health minister, Luiz Mandetta, an advocate of social distancing and isolation. Despite a high number of cases, Mr Bolsanaro has dismissed the virulent pandemic as nothing more than a “little flu.” Closer to home, in Pakistan, conditional congregations in mosques have been allowed, violating protocols laid down by the World Health Organization. Muslim countries across the world have not eased restrictions, and rightly so, and have got the full support of their clergies on this. This cannot be merely treated as the policy preference of specific countries, and their internal affair, for its consequences will be global. The spread of the coronavirus disease has shown the intricate ways in which the world is interconnected and interdependent. In a world where borders are still porous, even when one nation slips, it carries the threat of the rapid spread of the virus. The international community needs to collectively insist on the need for scientific advice to be followed. Political considerations, which are clearly motivating the leaders who are advocating dangerous behaviour, have to be put aside for now. This could mean the difference between life and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/irresponsible-actions-in-the-us-brazil-and-pakistan-can-undermine-global-efforts/story-1Nq6H9RTYyZyiUfyVYKfyO.html
