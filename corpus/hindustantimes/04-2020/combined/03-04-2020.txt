03-04-2020||News||Despite Covid-19, why did migrant workers go back? Opinion||We have all seen disturbing images of migrant workers trying to walk back to their villages after the sudden India-wide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19). In response, some state governments arranged buses to ferry them from designated urban depots to their villages. But the subsequent overcrowding in these depots defeated the purpose of social distancing, a prime motive of the lockdown. This Covid-19-induced migrant crisis has prompted several questions.Who are these migrant communities? Why did the lockdown prompt them to flee from the cities, and why did the Centre and states not anticipate this? How can the State’s reactive response be improved, for now, and the future?It is tempting to view this crisis purely as a consequence of the challenges of Covid-19. The virus has flummoxed governments around the world, including those with far more resources than India. The coronavirus poses daunting questions of how to balance public health concerns with the economic fallout. Yet it would be a mistake to view the migrant crisis as an unintentional by-product of the pandemic.My seven-year-long research on internal migrants shows that the government’s missteps were built on deeper, systematic inadequacies in its treatment of these communities. Internal migrants in India are a vast and heterogeneous population. The subset of migrants we are now talking about are marked by three traits. One, they predominantly migrate from villages to cities; second, they are low-income populations who work in the informal sector; and third, they have not permanently relocated their families to the city. Instead, they circulate between villages and cities several times a year.There are three structural inadequacies in public understanding of circular rural-urban migrants.The first is an inability to recognise the size and importance of these communities. For example, the National Sample Survey found the all-India rate of short-term migration to be 1.7% in rural areas, and less than 1% in urban areas. Yet many scholars think these figures are an underestimate and do not match with other data sources. For example, circular migrants dominate employment sectors such as construction labour. At present, 35 million workers are registered under various construction welfare boards, a number which by itself is nearly 3% of the population. While some construction workers may not be migrants, many migrants are not registered with these boards, and this is only one employment sector.Our inability to correctly count short-term migrants is not surprising, given the informal conditions in which they live and work, and their shuttling between their villages and cities. These traits reduce the chances of accessing migrant respondents through standard residence-based surveys. This inability has real costs, rendering governments ill-prepared to anticipate the responses of migrant communities at crucial moments. Policymakers were unprepared for the speed and desperation with which these migrants attempted to return home following the lockdown order.A deeper understanding reveals that this desperation is neither irrational nor surprising.I conducted a survey with 3,018 circular migrant construction workers in Delhi and Lucknow. While this sample was limited to only male migrant construction workers, the survey’s findings are still instructive. They reveal that migrants have few reasons to stay in their destination cities, and many reasons to leave.The majority of those surveyed (63%) had no family members living with them. In the city, they lived in cramped and usually illegally rented rooms (52%); or slept on footpaths (25%). Less than 3% held ration cards registered in the city. Finally, they earn low wages, and remit most of their savings, leaving little to cushion them if work stops. This precariousness is furthered by the hostile treatment they receive from urban authorities, especially the police since they sleep in public streets, squares, and footpaths.Remarkably, 33% of my survey respondents of migrants in Lucknow had experienced violent police action within the past year in the city, while fewer than 5% had ever done so in their home villages. They also live and work near urban elites, who frequently pressure local governments to act against them.The survey also revealed that on average, these migrants made 2.55 trips each year to their home village, but also spent on average upwards of six months a year within the city. Further, over half had been engaging in circular migration for at least eight years.Without addressing these conditions, it will be hard to deal with the current crisis or prevent future ones. While highly transient, a proper response can only begin with the recognition of circular migrants as part of India’s urban population.Recognising migrants as part of our cities might compel authorities to at least consider how proposed policies might impact these communities. At present, such ex-ante awareness would have allowed the government to decide whether to target scarce resources towards enabling safe return or keep migrants in destination cities. Ex-post, we see government actors oscillating between these two strategies, thereby enacting policies at cross-purposes.A policy centred on getting migrants home should prioritise dedicated transport options to prevent overcrowding, especially along high-intensity migration corridors. It will also require a set of protocols within villages for isolating migrants in a manner that is neither unsafe nor stigmatising, particularly as many migrants come from disadvantaged castes or minority faiths. Keeping migrants in cities can include direct cash transfers, as some states are trying through construction welfare boards.Civil society organisations such as the Aajeevika Bureau have called for relaxing the restrictions that prevent migrants from accessing vital benefits such as food rations in their destination cities. Experts, including Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, have called for repurposing available spaces, such as sports stadia and empty hotels, for migrants to stay in safely.We must understand that such short-term measures cannot address old structural problems. For example, construction welfare boards cannot channel benefits to many migrant workers since many are not registered with them. There must be a registration drive to expand this net. Reconfiguring the domicile-centric public distribution system can help migrants. But most important, states must soften their view of migrants as a law and order problem, an attitude that has been all too clear during this crisis.Worryingly, some of the directives from the ministry of home affairs order on the “restriction of movement of migrants” may only entrench repressive enforcement over compassionate accommodation. Unless migrants are afforded their rights, and dignity in the cities they build, these unresolved issues will bedevil us again in the future.Tariq Thachil is associate professor (Political Science), Vanderbilt UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/despite-covid-19-why-did-migrant-workers-go-back/story-NPhLzTd4joLSovjMDxCtaM.html
03-04-2020||News||The MSME sector is critical in times of Covid-19||A large fraction of India’s firms are small, informal and operate in the unorganised sector. Recent annual reports on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) indicate that the sector contributes to around 30% of India’s GDP, and based on conservative estimates, employs around 50% of industrial workers. Over 97% of MSMEs can be classified as micro firms (with an investment in plant and machinery less than ₹25 lakh), and 94% are unregistered with the government. These MSMEs are uniformly spread across rural and urban areas and are equally represented in the manufacturing, trade and services sectors. Two thirds of MSMEs are operated by socially vulnerable groups (Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe/Other Backward Classes) and 20% by women. The current coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) lockdown will substantially disrupt the operations of these MSMEs due to their dependence on the cash-economy that is severely hit by the lockdown, the physical non-availability of workers, and restrictions in the availability of raw materials and transport infrastructure. This will have substantial ramifications throughout the economy and therefore, a robust policy response is essential.How can Indian policy respond to this crisis? A useful place to start would be to examine the policy response of other countries in protecting their industries during the pandemic. From the International Monetary Fund’s policy tracker (that tracks key economic responses to the Covid-19 pandemic across 192 economies), these policy responses can be broadly categorised into: (a) loan guarantees and immediate liquidity provision; (b) loan extensions and penalty waivers on repayment delays and (c) interest rate reductions on future loans. In line with the global response, the Government of India slashed interest rates, increased limits on Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) to prevent triggering insolvency, and offered payments from the government’s share of Employee Provident Fund (EPF) to avoid layoffs. Several leading banks have announced special purpose loans at reduced rates for up to 10-20% of the firms’ working capital limit.While these policy measures are encouraging, they are biased towards the larger, and more formal/organised firms. However, the measures are inadequate for the smaller, informal/unorganised firms, which form an overwhelming majority of India’s industrial landscape. According to the Economic Census data, over 95% of firms (over 55 million firms) employed fewer than five workers, and 94% were not registered with the government. Thus, it is unlikely that these small firms contribute to EPF and may not benefit from the Government’s contribution to EPFO. Additionally, more than 81% MSMEs are self-financed with only around 7% borrowing from formal institutions and government sources (Economic Census, 2013). Credit market interventions (cheaper loans, increased limits on NPAs) therefore may not benefit this sector directly. Since most MSMEs primarily operate on cash, they require immediate liquidity to cope with adverse events. Moreover, many micro enterprises are small, household-run businesses. Given that other sectors of the economy and in particular, seasonal migration and agriculture, are severely hit by the lockdown, allowing these micro enterprises to operate smoothly could substantially help households cope with this economic shock. Hence, more direct measures of liquidity may be the need of the hour, similar to the initiative of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) that sets up a fund targeted directly at easing the liquidity constraints of MSMEs. Lastly, MSMEs are spatially concentrated, with Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal accounting for around 30% of MSMEs and ten states accounting for around 75% of MSMEs. A joint effort from both the state and central government therefore, is critical. Supply-side interventions, in particular strengthening supply chains for MSMEs, can also help them weather the storm. Ensuring that the MSME sector has access to raw materials and robust downstream supply chains would not only help mitigate production shortages in the health and the essential goods sector, but given its size, also potentially slowdown the adverse impact on the Indian economy as a whole. The Government of India has already appealed to MSMEs producing medical and other essential products to register and sell in the Government’s e-marketplace. This should be expanded to other sectors as well with co-ordination across different states to meet local supply and demand requirements.While Indian policymakers face the tough task of containing a public health pandemic as well as formulating swift policies to protect the most vulnerable from its adverse economic effect, a committed response to support the MSMEs is essential, imminent and key to easing the impact of the crisis for these entrepreneurs, their employees and the Indian economy as a whole.Ritam Chaurey is assistant professor, Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

03-04-2020||News||How nasyam can protect you from respiratory tract infection||When I was a child, my parents taught me nasyam, the ayurvedic home remedy for severe cold and sinusitis. The technique is to suck in copious amounts of warm salt water and once it accumulates in your throat, spit it out. No amount of water should be swallowed. This procedure must be repeated a few times through one nostril, and then with the other. Also you can blow your nose once or twice to remove mucus and any residual saline in the nasal passages. Over the years, I have immensely benefitted from this remedy. The same holds true for many others in my family. I have been able to avoid antibiotics on many occasions as my sinusitis settled rapidly with nasyam. Anecdotal evidence is not objective evidence; but now there is objective scientific evidence of its usefulness. On October 11, 2016, the clinical virology department of the Christian Medical College celebrated its golden jubilee with an international symposium on medical virology. One of my old students, Sandeep Ramalingam, a senior faculty member of the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, UK, gave a talk on nasyam and gargling, and presented scientific evidence on antiviral effects of chloride ions in the nasal mucosal cells. In yoga, a similar procedure, nasal douche, with salt water is practiced called jala neti. In the western world, jala neti has become popular for treatment of nasal allergies and infections. They use a neti pot or jar, made in copper or plastic, with a nozzle to fit the nostril. Since neti requires a neti pot, nasyam is what I prefer.The medical use of neti and nasyam has been researched by scientists in Australia, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Unfortunately no such research has happened in its country of origin, India. These researches show that saline therapy in the nose protects against wood dust allergy and reduces the severity and duration of common cold.Ramalingam investigated nasyam and gargling with saline and clinched the pathway – chloride ions do the trick, sodium is irrelevant, but without sodium chloride, in other words sea salt, choride ions cannot be delivered on nasal mucosa easily and without irritation or toxicity. Inside mucosal epithelial cells chlorine in chloride is converted to hypochlorous acid which effectively kills viruses that are already in the cells. This was the take-home lesson from his talk in Vellore in 2016. We are in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), caused by the respiratory tract infection. The immediate question that arises from the above background is the potential of nasyam or neti as prophylactic or therapeutic for Covid-19. On March 29, 2020, the Journal of Global Health carried a paper by Ramalingam and colleagues, suggesting that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for Covid-19.There is no study so far, but here is a simple and harmless procedure that may help protect your nasal mucosa from getting infected by any respiratory virus. I am sure that scientists in various biomedical research institutions will begin research to measure its prophylactic and therapeutic value in this epidemic in India.We promote repeated hand-washing with soap and water; in certain situations, repeated salt-water nasyam may help prevent infection with any virus or even treat infection as it has documented anti-viral property.Now that we are all at home, practice nasyam. If anyone gets symptoms of cold or sore throat, everyone in the household could practice nasyam and gargling, with warm salt water, made with boiled and cooled water, with salt to taste just perceptibly salty, and use for nasal washes and gargling about every 4 hours during waking time.

These employees include the auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and primary and multipurpose health workers. They have been working across villages, some of them sealed, to trace the contact history of positive patients by door-to-door surveys and to monitor persons who have been home quarantined. With SBS Nagar reporting 19 cases so far, they are often racing against time too.COMMITTED TO BREAKING VIRUS CHAINNirmala Devi, ANM, posted at the health centre at Pathlawa village in SBS Nagar, the home of the state’s first coronovirus victim, Baldev Singh, was posted here in 1997. Her local knowledge helped in tracing down all close contacts. “I am committed to breaking down the chain of virus. We are working for the betterment of the society, even as we know of the risks,” she says. On life at home after a 12-hour work day, she says, “I isolate myself at home. I am a single mother and thus have to cook for kids and other family members, which is also a risk.”Her colleague, Parmila Devi, who has conducting door-to-door surveys with another senior staff member Balwinder Kaur, said the work involves preparing 12 types of reports. “We try to extract the maximum information about positive patients and their contacts,” Devi said, adding that she too is isolating herself at home.‘WORKING AS A TEAM CRITICAL’At Bharowal sub-centre in SBS Nagar, Jaswinder Singh, 38, a multipurpose health worker, who had a leg amputated in 2009, has been tasked with monitoring home quarantined people. “We are working as a team and visiting 30 houses a day for follow-up,” said Jaswinder.At Virk village in Phillaur sub-division, Jalandhar, where five positive cases were reported, the entire 4,000-population was surveyed for contacts of the patients.Avtar Chand 54, the multi-purpose supervisor (MPS), part of the four-member door-to-door survey in Virk village says, “I, along with team comprising another MPS, ANM and anganwadi worker traced three relatives of Baldev Singh after conducting a survey with the help of local gram panchayat.”Kuldeep Verma, 48, another MPS, in the village, said, “It is a risky job. Our field survey and awareness campaign starts at 10am. The village is also sanitised daily. The biggest challenge is that most people are unaware and if we identify a suspected patient, they and their family members do not cooperate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-ground-health-workers-in-doaba-march-on-to-conduct-surveys-identify-contacts/story-wwutLY7zhDQiRNciLfe4oM.html

The samples were taken as they completed their 14-day isolation that started after they tested positive for the virus on March 21. These family members of the septuagenarian victim are his three sons, a 36-year-old daughter, a 40-year-old daughter-in-law and a granddaughter aged 17.All of them are under treatment at SBS Nagar civil hospital. Civil surgeon Dr Rajinder Prasad Bhatia confirmed the resampling. They can be discharged if the samples taken today (Friday) and the second lot to be taken on Saturday both test negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-6-of-1st-casualty-s-family-in-punjab-complete-14-day-isolation-samples-taken/story-9vhDK28YGYzD7Xpz6q7iTM.html
03-04-2020||City||2 jamaat attendees among seven new corona cases in Punjab||Seven fresh Covid-19 cases — three from Amritsar, two from Mohali, one from Ludhiana and Rupnagar each — were recorded in Punjab on Friday, taking the tally to 53.Among the three tested positive for the virus in Amritsar are two close contacts of former hazoori ragi of the Golden Temple, Nirmal Singh Khalsa, who was found infected with the virus and died on Thursday. The throat swab samples were tested at the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) of Government Medical College, Amritsar. The patients are Nirmal Singh’s US-returned aunt, one ragi who accompanied him to Chandigarh for a religious congregation and a 67-year-old male.Mohali cases comprises two Tablighi Jamaat attendees, a 42-year-old of Mauli Baidwan in Sector 80 and 62-year-old of Sector 68. In Ludhiana, a 69-year-old woman from Shimlapuri was found carrying the virus and she has no travel history. A 55-year-old man from Chatamli village in Rupnagar was declared positive for the virus, making him the first patient in the district.Rupnagar deputy commssioner Sonali Garg said the patient was admitted to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, Chandigarh, on March 27 and declared positive on Friday. He is a patient of diabetes and hypertension, she said.She said the process to trace his contacts has started and the village is being sanitised. Rupnagar civil surgeon Dr HN Sharma said the family members of the patient will be home quarantined. Meanwhile, the health department has isolated Nirmal Singh’s 11 close contacts at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital (GNDH)—including his wife, two daughters, son, driver, two sewadars, uncle and aunt.“A health department team visited Singh’s house on March 3 after we got the information that uncle and aunt were visiting him. They were found asymptomatic. When the home quarantine period of the guests was over on March 17, they were found asymptomatic again. On Friday, however, his aunt was tested positive of coronavirus,” Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Prabhdeep Kaur Johal said on Friday.5 family members of ragi have been tested negative of the disease while reports of other members are awaited, she further said.A 67 year old man of Krishna Nagar, Amritsar, who was tested ‘positive’ for coronavirus on Friday, could be the first case of community spread in Amritsar, Dr Johal said.“The man complained of chest infection and visited GNDH for treatment on Wednesday and was declared positive for the virus on Friday. He is a shopkeeper and has no recent foreign travel history. He has not even travelled outside Amritsar for long. We have no idea from where did he contact the virus. This is a community spread case,” she said.Dr Johal said his house has been sealed and sanitised. “Man’s wife, two sons, daughter-in-law and a 8-month-old granddaughter have been isolated at GNDH and their throat swab samples sent for testing,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-jamaat-attendees-among-seven-new-corona-cases-in-punjab/story-Xgx8bm1o3aGPgiIMhnLztJ.html

The festival is celebrated on April 13. The decision in this regard was taken in a meeting of the Sikh clergy held through a video conference on Friday.The meeting was attended by Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, who is also jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib; head granthi of Takht Damdama Sahib Giani Gurjant Singh; Takht Patna Sahib jathedar Giani Ranjit Singh; Takht Keshgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh and Takht Sri Hazur Sahib jathedar Giani Kulwant Singh. Thousands of devotees visit Talwandi Sabo every year to pay obeisance at Takht Damdama Sahib on occasion of Baisakhi which is also observed as the foundation day of the Khalsa. The festival is also linked with wheat harvest. The clergy directed all gurdwara management committees and Sikh organisations that instead of holding gatherings to celebrate Baisakhi in gurdwaras, they should hold ‘akhand path’ (non-stop recitation of hymns of Guru Granth Sahib) and ‘sehaj path’ and conclude the ceremony with prayers for the welfare of humanity.The clergy also asked devotees to remain at their homes and recite ‘sehaj path’ to observe the day and listen to kirtan to be telecast live from historical gurdwaras through television channels and internet media. Curfew is in force in Punjab till April 14. The state government has prohibited all types of gatherings, including religious ones. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had recently said that he will talk to jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh in this regard. He had asked the state chief secretary to discuss the matter with Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal had also urged the Akal Takht Jathdear not to allow congregations on occasion of Baisakhi.The meeting also condemned the terrorist attack on Sikhs in Afghanistan saying that it has shamed the humanity. The meeting asked the Sikh organisations across the world to help the Sikhs in Afghanistan in all possible ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-baisakhi-celebrations-at-takht-damdama-sahib/story-mJlbEmQf82XvpV5KNW1TNK.html

It is not possible to commit either way at this juncture, when the situation is dynamically evolving.”He added, “If things improve then there will be no need for such tight restrictions. However, if the situation takes a turn for the worse, there would be no option with the government but to continue with controls, either through curfew or lockdown or any other necessary means.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-decision-yet-on-extending-curfew-in-state-punjab-cm/story-uNZZeCUPagzjmOeuomoX5L.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||Despite state order, private schools asking for fees: Parents||Even as the state education department has asked private schools to not demand fees amidst the lockdown, parents said that many schools are still sending them emails and messages asking them to pay the fees. On Thursday, a school in Navi Mumbai asked parents to pay through an online link. “We were asked to pay the fees and send an email after paying. When some parents tried to reason with the school authorities showing the education department’s guidelines, they said that parents can pay now or later,” said a parent of a student from the school. The school did not respond to calls and messages. On March 30, the education department issued a circular, asking schools to ensure that parents are not forced to pay fees. The department stated that the rule applies to all private schools in the state irrespective of the board they are affiliated to. Another parent of a student at a Malad school said that the authorities had sent an alert on the school application with the payment link. “Why are they even giving us an option to pay when schools are shut anyway?” said the parent. The Malad school also did not respond to calls and messages.Education department officials said that parents can write to them if schools are violating norms. “Action will be taken against the said school,” said a senior official from the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-state-order-private-schools-asking-for-fees-parents/story-iTJgLU0a1YPRS4Kt3P4FnL.html

But, doctors are needed the most now. Our aim is to help those unable to afford private hospitals as even the middle-income groups are affected,” said Dr Thorat.Patients can visit the clinic from 9am to noon. “If we find patients with symptoms of coronavirus, they will be referred to the health department, said Dr Thorat.Volunteers from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and a few NGOs will help expand the clinic by providing them personal protection equipment (PPE). They are looking at areas like Turbhe and Rabale where doctors are needed for the huge slum population. “We have three buses which we plan to use for community health service. Based on the response from the first clinic, we will identify more areas and set up clinics. This will also help us screen patients with coronavirus symptoms,” said Dr Shendge.Doctors have urged more medical associations to help them run the community clinics.The Navi Mumbai based ophthalmologist has also started a free online consultation where patients can seek consultation from a family physician, gynecologist, paediatrician, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/group-of-doctors-gives-free-medical-aid-to-labourers-in-ghansoli/story-8aEpYeyxWLHbCi1GzXBcKJ.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||10 CISF officers posted at airport test positive||Ten officers of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who were posted at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), have tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. Six tested positive on Friday and four had tested positive on March 29. All 10 are asymptomatic. The total number of CISF personnel who have tested positive is now 11, including one who has since tested negative.On March 27, a CISF head constable (HC) tested positive for Covid-19 after reporting a mild fever. Following this, 152 personnel were quarantined at a CISF residential camp at Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai. MA Ganapathy, special director general, CISF, said , “After the first positive case, we decided to test 11 of his close contacts, four of whom tested positive on March 29. As all lived in the same camp, we decided to test all 152 personnel living in the camp. Six more tested positive on Friday, taking the total to 10. All those who tested positive are asymptomatic.” The camp has since been vacated and sanitised.Senior CISF officers said one of the Covid-positive personnel has been admitted to Kasturba Gandhi Hospital and the six who tested positive on Friday have been admitted to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital. In his two most recent tests, the HC has tested negative for the virus. Sources said the CISF officers may have contracted the virus from passengers while discharging duties at the airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-cisf-officers-posted-at-airport-test-positive/story-8aUb5OVcKgfNaLshwrfLFN.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||Wife of 63-year-old man who died of coronavirus discharged||The wife of the second Covid-19 patient who died in Mumbai has been discharged from Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre. This is the same hospital where her husband succumbed to the infection on March 22. The 64-year-old patient contracted the infection from his 63-year-old husband who got admitted at the hospital on March 14 after he developed symptoms. The man had travelled to Surat but had no foreign travel history or contact with any known traveller.After his diagnosis, both his wife and 32-year-old daughter were tested and found positive. The women were not even allowed to take part in the final rites of the patient after he died on March 22, as per the rules of the Union health ministry. Health officials said the man had a history of diabetes, high blood pressure and ischemic heart disease and had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to his death. But as his wife did not have any comorbid issues, she has recovered.“She was admitted with her husband at our hospital. But as we have only two isolation beds, we had to transfer their daughter to another hospital. But thankfully, unlike her husband, she doesn’t have chronic illnesses, which helped in her recovery,” said a doctor from the hospital. According to sources, the deceased’s 32-year-old daughter has also tested negative for the virus in the last test and is likely to be discharged from Nanavati Hospital on Saturday.

All 48 flats and three nursing homes in the 14-storey building have been sealed. While 25 high-risk contacts have been tested for Sars-CoV-2, 300 residents have been quarantined. The remaining residents have been urged to remain in quarantine until the test results of the high-risk contacts are available.In the past two days, a 56-year-old garment shop owner from Dharavi and a 52-year-old sweeper tested positive for Covid-19. The garment shop owner had no travel history, but tested positive on Wednesday after he was admitted to Sion Hospital for chest pain. On Thursday, a BMC sweeper, who worked in Dharavi and lived in Worli, tested positive.The civic authorities are trying to find a link between all three cases. The BMC authorities said that the surgeon had called one of the private laboratories for the test. “We’re preparing a list of senior citizens and those with respiratory issues. We’ll run a check on them individually to find out how they’ve been doing,” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, BMC, said.The BMC is trying to find a link between the patients and the four who returned from the Tabligh Jamaat event in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/35-yr-old-surgeon-from-dharavi-tests-positive-visited-rajasthan/story-725jx8pu55uc7ZMYWHtSBJ.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||BMC has a containment plan for Dharavi||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it has a containment plan in place for Dharavi, India’s largest slum, after concerns grew on Friday following a third Covid-19 case. Dharavi recorded its first death on April 1, with two more positive cases recorded in the next two days, including a surgeon on Friday.The 240-hectare slum pocket has 850,000 residents and a population density of 66,000 per square kilometre, making it one of the more cramped spaces in Mumbai, the world’s fifth most densely populated city. Activists and health workers had expressed concerns over how social distancing is practically impossible in an area where an average of 10-12 people stay in each of 57,000 housing units measuring around 250 sq ft.However, BMC, which runs the city’s nodal health department, said on Friday that its officers had a containment plan in place for Dharavi almost a month ago. “We ran a house-to-house survey to get the actual figure of the slum dwellers to keep our amenities ready,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC. “This helped us list high-risk people living with co-morbid issues such as cardiac ailments, respiratory problems, hypertension and diabetes, among others.”Kakani said municipal workers, armed with this data, have been scouting for vacant places to isolate patients and vulnerable individuals. HT had reported on Thursday that BMC has identified Rajiv Gandhi Sports Club in Dharavi to be turned into a 300-bed quarantine facility. Kakani said they are searching for hotels that could be turned into isolation wards.There is also a group of 800 community health volunteers in place (HT reported this on Friday). The first batch of 200 volunteers was trained by the BMC, and they in turn are training 600 more Dharavi locals to sensitise others in the community about Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “They are not only being trained to counsel, but also to handle suspected or infected patients,” Kakani said.Until Friday evening, over 3,000 people from Dharavi had been home-quarantined, with regular food packets being distributed by the BMC. However, there were complaints that these rations included only wheat, rice and lentils, but not oil and vegetables, making it difficult for the residents to cook.“We are also starting health clinics where medical officers will check slum residents if they develop any symptoms,” another senior health officer told HT. He added, “The BMC is disinfecting areas in Dharavi with sodium hypochlorite. We have collaborated with locals to keep tabs on those who have been home quarantine.”This has led to stigmatisation, many residents alleged. “Ever since the first death was reported on April 1, we have been targeted,” a local resident told HT on Friday. A private hospital allegedly cancelled the dialysis appointment of 47-year-old Amin Mansoori from Dharavi on Friday morning. “I have been visiting this hospital for the last four years. On Friday, they called me and asked me not to visit. I also have a house in neighbouring Mahim, but I couldn’t go there on account of the lockdown,” he said. “I have been trying to get a dialysis appointment at another facility, but have had no luck.”Another resident, 28-year-old taxi driver Sunil Mishra said he lost his job on Friday. “I am not infected nor have I been home quarantined, but my employer has fired me only because I live in Dharavi,” he said. “When I pleaded, I was asked to provide a health certificate, which I could not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-has-a-containment-plan-for-dharavi/story-CvR53ILUL0gAd0huul7p3O.html

The society sees regular visitors and several residents are known to fly in and out of the country. Raheja Vistas’ resident, Sarthak Shah, who is an attorney by profession, said the society has maintained a record of everyone who has travelled internationally in recent times, and checked up on them.“We had one resident who self-quarantined herself in a hotel so that there was no inconvenience caused to other members. A tenant, who is Chinese, was a little apprehensive about how he should step out and interact with others, but the management committee made him feel comfortable,” said Shah.The society has also restricted movement into and out of the complex. Domestic help for only 10-12 families is allowed inside and in the past, a session was held in which domestic help were taught hygiene practices that must be followed during the outbreak in their own homes as well as workplaces.Atul Sharma, chairman of the society, said various online activities are conducted throughout the day for different age groups, to keep everyone occupied. From yoga to e-learning as well as religious sessions, there is a variety of options. “By having these sessions, we have people socialising, their fitness is maintained and there is competitive spirit as they stay engaged in an activity,” he said. Yoga instructor Hemamalini PJ said she has seen more interest in yoga during the lockdown than before. “Now that they have some time on their hand, I have had people inquiring to join the [online] classes and do a trial month to keep themselves engaged,” said Hemamalini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-yoga-sessions-go-online-for-housing-society-in-mumbai/story-Hoxy46ZRhZv3NnLCGD0FWO.html

We are following the government guidelines while monitoring containment zones,” said Pranaya Ashok, DCP (operation), and spokesperson for Mumbai Police.When asked if volunteers and paramilitary forces will be required as the number of containment zones have been increasing each day, deputy commissioner of police Ashok said, “We don’t need their deployment now, but may in future.”Meanwhile, the police, intensifying its action against those violating the lockdown orders in the city, registered 82 offences on Thursday against offenders of which 66 first information reports (FIRs) were lodged against those who did not follow social distancing and gathered at on place in some of the densely-populated areas.

Section 144 authorises the executive magistrate of a state to issue an order to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area.One FIR was registered against a person who violated home quarantine orders.The police are also verifying if the 1,200 people who came from abroad and were traced and home quarantined are following the self-isolation norms. “The police also appealed to citizens with the help of religious and community leaders to not step out of their homes to offer Friday’s prayers. Mosques across the city also made announcements over speakers, appealing to citizens to offer the prayers from home and follow the government orders,” said a DCP rank officer. However, some violations were witnessed despite the appeals. “In Dharavi, the police arrested 10 people for defying the order and offering prayers on streets,” an officer from Dharavi police station said.Slums pose challenge The police are facing problems in their operations owing to the lack of co-operation from slum dwellers. The police said crowds gather near public toilets in the morning hours and similar scenes are also witnessed near ration shops and vegetable markets. In some areas, pan stalls and salons have also remained open. The police have been seeking the help of local community leaders, corporators and political activists in creating awareness at such areas. Along with filing cases against those flouting norms, the police have also been seizing the vehicles of those loitering around unnecessarily.Attack on copsMany dense population areas and slums also witnessed clash between police and public. Saveral videos also went viral where cops were attacked by the lockdown violators. In one incident a policeman was attacked in Dongri. Sandeep Bhagdikar, senior police inspector, Dongri police station said, “We booked a miscreant from Dongri for assaulting an on-duty a policeman who had stopped him on coming out of his home. The man did not give satisfactory answers and instead abused the police and assaulted him.”Four people arrested from the Govandi and Shivaji Nagar areas have been held for attacking and abusing on-duty personnel.66 FIRs in state“A total of 66 FIRs have been registered across the state for spreading misinformation and rumours related to Covid-19. Many cyber fraudsters are also trying to cash in on the lockdown by circulating phishing traps. We have made a list of such frauds and issued an advisory on our Twitter handle. Yesterday [Thursday], the Malegaon police arrested four people for circulating a religiously provocative video related to coronavirus,” said Balsing Rajput, superintendent, Maharashtra Cyber department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/additional-mumbai-police-personnel-six-drones-deployed-at-containment-zones/story-BpLGcCi46nKxc4zVhHvD4L.html

03-04-2020||City||Delhi govt schools take classes to their students’ homes||New Delhi: On Friday, Muskan Singh, a student of class five at a government senior secondary school in Karol Bagh, asked her parents to narrate to her the three best stories of their childhoods. The 10-year-old then spent the rest of the day writing one of her own, as a part of an activity assigned by her teacher.This was the first school activity she was assigned since schools in the city shut, to prevent an outbreak of Covid-19. The school has now begun remotely sending activities to its students on a regular basis. Muskan’s father, Sumit Singh, a tailor, said he and his wife were worried about their daughter’s studies during the lockdown. “Neither of us is educated, and we do not know how to engage her in any learning activity. We ask her to sit with her books everyday, but to no avail. She would spend the entire day watching TV. since she can’t go out to play during the lockdown. We are happy that the school has started sending her this work — she was very excited to do that,” he said.On Monday, Delhi’s education minister Manish Sisodia directed government schools to send daily activities to students enrolled between nursery and class 8 through text messages, WhatsApp or in Interactive Voice Response (IVR) form, in an attempt to engage students in the learning process amid the lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. Students have been asked to maintain a record of these activities in their notebooks. These will later be evaluated by teachers and be considered as part of the students’ internal assessments. According to the Delhi government ‘s education department, around six lakh students from nursery to class 8 in its schools were sent activities through SMS and over IVR on Friday. Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said the school is sending simple tasks to its students on a daily basis. “For students of nursery and kindergarten students, we have asked parents to make them learn the name of the vegetable that has been cooked at home, and make their child draw a picture of that vegetable in their notebook. For students of classes 1 and 2, we have asked parents to make their children think about all possible items at home that they can lock in their fists, and then them to actually check if their guess was right. I think this way, they will indulge in some thinking,” Jha said. Some schools have also started sending videos of science and mathematics-based activities they can perform at home using available resources. Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Tilak Nagar, on Friday shared a video with students of classes 6 to 8 on their class WhatsApp groups. In the video, a teacher demonstrated the hydrophilic nature of coronavirus. When a person uses soap to wash their hands, the virus gets attracted to the water — and does not remain on the body. “The teacher just used black pepper [to represent the virus] and soap in the activity. The students easily do this at home,” Kaur said.Arti Qanungo, who teaches English at a government school in Shakarpur, said she sends 10 new words to her students every day, to help them learn the language at home. “English is a major challenge for many of our students. They tend to forget the language since a majority of them do not have any English-speaking person at home,” Qanungo said.“I have also been sending them practice sheets every day, but not all of our students have access to smartphones. Many of them cannot study online. We are trying to call these students every day and tell them what they can write and read for the day,” she added.Meanwhile, due to logistical challenges, government schools are yet to start online classes for class 12, as announced by Sisodia on Monday. Binay Bhushan, director of the directorate of education (DoE), said the schools are trying to gather the details of students who have smartphones or such devices at home. “We have around 17,000 students who were given tablets by the government. We will start the online classes for them in a day or two. Meanwhile, we have asked teachers and principals to register the students who have their own devices at home for the classes,” he said.The Delhi government had already announced that it will tie-up with a TV channel for online classes in the event the lockdown is extended. “We will need such an intervention, else many of our students will be left behind,” a senior official said.In a statement issued on Friday, Sisodia’s office said that for classes 6 to 8, an exercise to help students understand how the family budget works was also designed. “In this activity, students were required to note down last month’s income and expenditure in their notebooks and analyse it,” it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-schools-take-classes-to-their-students-homes/story-qqT5ES15mTXM1MWX6XZFkI.html

The woman’s works with Ceasefire, but he had tested negative for the disease.“The husband of the patient works with Ceasefire and was negative for Covid-19. Both new patients have been admitted to the isolation ward at the Super Speciality Children’s Hospital in Sector 30,” Sunil Dohre, additional chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.The residential society where they lived has been sealed for two days and officials are going to sanitise the building where the family lives as well as the common areas on the premises. All residents have been asked to remain in home quarantine as per protocol. On Friday, two Covid-19 patients were discharged after treatment from Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida. They include a 67-year-old woman and her 37-year-old son from Noida Extension. In total, eight have been discharged after successful completion of treatment.“The discharged woman had diabetes and blood pressure but she successfully completed the treatment. We are happy that our patients are recovering,” Dr Saurabh Shrivastava, head of the department of medicine, said.According to health officials, until now, none of the patients has required ventilator support and all have been responding well to treatment. Doctors are a little worried about one patient, an 82-year-old woman from Sector 37, who has dementia, blood pressure and a few other complications. Experts say senior citizens with a history of chronic diseases have more trouble recovering from Covid-19.The district administration is also coming up with a call centre to do contact tracing of people testing positive for the virus. “To break the chain, it is important to do contact tracing. We are going to use technology to trace the epicentre of the infection. Until now, a majority of the cases are linked with Ceasefire,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.The Expressway police has lodged an FIR against Ceasefire under section 45 (Punishment of offences committed within India), 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR has been lodged on the orders of the chief medical officer for hiding the foreign travel history of a few employees.The managing director of ceasefire had returned from UK on March 1, another employee had returned on March 7 and they had a visiting auditor from London for three days in the third week of March. All the three persons jumped their quarantine and were attending office which led to the spread among other employees and then to their family members.The MD is undergoing treatment at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences but he is still asymptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-more-test-positive-for-covid-19-two-others-discharged-after-treatment/story-PENs5ixZJ2AatZrVk5q9TK.html

Meanwhile, the police continued patrolling the streets and also used drone surveillance to ensure there was no public gathering.The Prime Minister on March 24 had announced a 21-day lockdown in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Mosques in the district had remained shut on March 27, the first Friday of the three-week lockdown, while people avoided venturing outside.“We had urged the people to offer their prayers from the safety of their homes. Today (Friday) also the mosque remained closed and only those who stay inside it offered prayers. We have put a notice outside the mosque requesting clergy members to stay at home till the lockdown is in place, and several other mosques also made similar announcements on loudspeaker yesterday,” said Shahid, the cleric at Nithari mosque.Places of worship in Gautam Budh Nagar had closed even before the national lockdown was announced. Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which bans the gathering of more than four people. has also been enforced in the district.Clerics had made announcements on Thursday requesting people to stay indoors and not gather with relatives or neighbours for prayers at any private or public place.In order to ensure that there were no violations of the lockdown, the district police remained on high alert.“ The police teams continued patrolling and we also used drones to monitor the situation. We wanted to be on the lookout for any gatherings on terraces in the city. However, no such incident was reported,” deputy commissioner of police (zone 1), Sankalp Sharma, said.On April 1, a video showing a dozen men offering namaz on the terrace of a house in Sector 16’s JJ colony cluster did the rounds on social media after which the police filed an FIR in the matter. The police had said that all of the men did not live in the house but had gathered from the nearby areas.“All of the 12 men have been arrested. The two men, who remained at large till now, were arrested Thursday from Sector 16,” Sharma said.On Thursday, the Gautam Budh Nagar commissioner of police had instructed all police personnel to keep an eye out for any gatherings by continuing patrolling and appealing to religious leaders to avoid offering prayers publicly. “We patrolled the streets today and based on the instructions given, drones were flown at several places in Dadri to ensure there was no public gathering by people from any religion,” DCP (zone 3), Rajesh Kumar Singh, said.Police personnel also carried out flag marches in the city with units of the Rapid Action Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/people-offer-friday-prayers-at-home-amid-lockdown/story-chilGAZphSISP9NI2ITDFL.html
03-04-2020||City||Misbehaviour with nurses: CM orders offenders be booked under NSA||The Uttar Pradesh government has taken a serious note of the alleged misbehaviour by some patients with nurses in Ghaziabad and has ordered that the offenders be booked under the National Security Act (NSA). On April 1, nurses from MMG District Hospital in Ghaziabad, in a written complaint, had alleged that six patients admitted to the isolation ward had misbehaved with them.“They (suspects) will not obey the law, neither will they accept the system as they are the enemies of humanity. Whatever they have done to the women health workers in Ghaziabad is a heinous crime. They will be booked under NSA. We will not spare them,” CM Yogi Adityanath said in a statement.“An incident like the one in Indore, where doctors were attacked, should not happen anywhere in the state. We will take whatever action is required by law,” Yogi added.The incident came to fore on Thursday evening after MMG Hospital’s chief medical superintendent Dr Ravinder Rana forwarded the nurses’ complaint to chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta.“After the incident, police security has been strengthened at health facilities and the district magistrate has also told us to put up CCTV cameras inside quarantine centres. Five of the six patients were later shifted to isolation facility as one of them tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday,” Gupta said.Late Thursday, the police and the administration officials reached the MMG Hospital and conducted an initial inquiry. The officials later directed for the registration of an FIR against the patients who allegedly misbehaved with nurses.The FIR at Kotwali police station was registered against the suspects under the IPC sections 354 (outraging modesty of woman), 294 (obscene act), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and other sections related to conduct, and negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life.“After the medical superintendent gave a complaint to the SHO, we registered an FIR against the offenders. An investigation is on in the case,” Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city), said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls seeking his comment on the matter.Dr Rana said nurses have approached him time and again during the past two days with verbal complaints and he finally told them to give a written one.“Based on that, I sent a written complaint to the CMO and also marked copies to the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police. The nurses are continuing with their duties. The tests of five of the six patients shifted to isolation facility will be taken up as they spent time together instead of confining themselves to their respective beds,” Dr Rana said.According to officials, the six were picked up by the health department after they attended different religious congregations, including one at Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month.“They did not take medicines and kept listening to objectionable songs in the ward. They also dressed inappropriately and kept roaming around. They also demanded cigarettes from our staff,” a woman nurse said Friday.(With inputs from Lucknow bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/misbehaviour-with-nurses-cm-orders-offenders-be-booked-under-nsa/story-eKmnlFuRSKj1jg8oiUzFZK.html

These employees were deployed for the sanitisation and disinfection of Nizamuddin, which has evolved into a Covid-19 hot spot accounting for 259 cases, and areas adjoining it.According to municipal officials, 95 public health workers, field workers and sanitation employees were screened on Friday. The screening was done by a panel of specialised doctors.The south civic body in a statement said personal protective equipment such as hazmat suits, masks, and gloves are being provided to sanitation and field workers deployed in high-risk areas. Sanitation employees had been demanding screening of those engaged in sweeping, disinfectant spraying, collection and transportation of garbage in areas such as Nizamuddin in south Delhi and Dilshad Garden, another hot spot that falls under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation.“Of the 95 people screened, 59 are sanitation workers and the rest are from the health department. All are healthy and showed no symptoms of coronavirus. They have also been briefed by doctors to keep a watch on their health and in case of any symptom such as cold or cough or fever, they are to immediately consult a doctor,” a senior SDMC official said. Special sanitization drives are being conducted in densely populated areas.SDMC has also started ground-level monitoring of all Covid-19 hot spots in its four zones. Other than Nizamuddin, the SDMC Friday conducted intensive sanitisation drive in Kasturba Niketan, Lajpat Nagar, Bakkarwala quarantine centre, Kapashera Extension and Kalkaji by deploying tankers for spraying 1% sodium hypochlorite solution to curb the spread of the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, the civic body said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sdmc-screens-sanitation-staff-for-covid-19-symptoms/story-U3xsPjhqQci4eVc7P05fbP.html

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who is staying at Silver Oak, his residence in Mumbai, is strictly adhering to the lockdown rules and is not conducting any meetings at his house. “ I have been getting phone calls from outside India from students and workers who are stranded in other countries. Then I talk to the foreign affairs ministry and concerned authorities [in other countries]. I’m getting these phone calls from Kazakhstan, from Tashkent, Philippines, and several other countries,” he said.Pawar has also been contacted for domestic emergencies from people across Maharashtra. “There are many problems with industrial workers and labourers, and they call me, so I try to find a solution and coordinate with the authorities concerned. There are no visitors but my telephone is continuously busy. Leaders from the state and district are giving me updates,” he said. For MLA and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, this is the first time in years that he can spend days at a time in his constituency in Karad. “At other times, I am travelling between Mumbai and Karad, and even Delhi, for work. I do not get so many days together in my constituency. This is the first time in so many years,” he said. Chavan said he is connected with the Satara district administration and village panchayats in his constituency, over the phone. He has also made suggestions to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, about allowing certain services to remain open during the lockdown in the state’s circular, such as wheat flour mills. Chandrakant Patil, BJP state president said, “As a party, we are doing a lot of work. All day, we have audio bridges lined up. Around 450 BJP municipal corporators excluding those in Mumbai, were lined up on the audio brief today, from morning till 4pm. We took stock of work done so far, and work that is planned. For example, BJP has decided to aid 52 lakh people and distribute grains. There are 1.2 lakh BJP workers active through 650 mandals. Each Assembly constituency is divided into three mandals. Devendra Fadnavis and I are constantly in touch with them and coordinating all day,” Patil is presently in his constituency of Kothrud in Pune, for better coordination with party workers in his constituency. His family is in Kolhapur. A senior member of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) told HT that party chief Raj Thackeray has been closely monitoring relief material distribution at the hands of his party workers across Maharashtra, and reviewing what needs to be done to aid the state to get through these tough times. These leaders are also using this time to unwind and catch up on their reading, and exercise. “I am reading this book named Gandhi in Bombay: Towards Swaraj. Mahatma Gandhi had so many connections with Mumbai. The book is about the first time he came to Mumbai from South Africa. I was unaware that certain areas of Malad and Bandra have a connection with him and he stayed there,” said Pawar. The NCP chief has also been taking walks in his home twice a day to keep up his stamina. Similarly, Pratibha Patil, former President of India, who is living in Pune, said, “I read other books and follow the news.” Patil is in the middle of reading two books. “One of them is called Man’s Search For Meaning, by Viktor E Frankl, which is a 1946 non-fiction book set during World War II. The second book is called Yashwant, about Yashwant Rao Kelkar, a Mumbai-based professor from National College who was instrumental in forming ABVP,” Patil said. “I had no time to read earlier and I had held onto both these books for a long time. Finally, I began reading them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-politicos-catch-up-on-reading-workouts-family-time/story-H4fzpjZ6HfaeI6gUBpO2rO.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus lockdown: 30 Chinese nationals may come to city to help with Coastal Road work||mehul.thakkar@htlive.comAmid the lockdown owing to the coronavirus outbreak, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is likely to give a recommendation letter to allow 30 Chinese nationals to visit the city after one month, terming it a special case for tunnelling work of the ambitious coastal road. The civic body, however, will give the letter only if the situation improves, and the spread is brought under control in the coming days, said officials.A 12.9-m wide tunnel boring machine (TBM), which will be used for the coastal road work, has left from China’s Shanghai port earlier this week to reach the Jawaharlal Nehru Port near Mumbai by the end of April. The recommendation letter will be to help the 30 Chinese nationals, who will provide crucial help in assembling these machines, get visas. The BMC, which is implementing the project, has been in touch with the Central government authorities to find a solution.Vijay Nighot, chief engineer of the BMC’s coastal road project, said: “We will require around 30 representatives from the TBM manufacturing unit in China to visit Mumbai, and guide us during the tunnelling and assembling the machine. We will help them get visa by giving a recommendation letter, but only in case the situation improves in the coming days. It all depends on how things take shape in the coming days.”Currently, all international, domestic flights and Indian Railways are shut. HT had reported on February 20 that the tunnelling work on the western seafront, from Girgaum Chowpatty to Malabar Hill, was tentatively scheduled to start from May, but got delayed owing to the outbreak. The TBM was to leave from China on March 1 and reach Mumbai by March-end, however, it left for Mumbai only five days ago.According to BMC officials, the representatives from China will be screened following all necessary protocol to determine any symptoms or signs of the coronavirus. “We can also ask the Chinese nationals coming to Mumbai to get quarantined for 14 days. For now, we will have to wait and watch,” said a BMC official.Meanwhile, the construction of the coastal road along with Metro and road projects has also taken a hit in the past two weeks owing to the lockdown, as contractors are finding it tough to get labourers who have headed back to their hometowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-lockdown-30-chinese-nationals-may-come-to-city-to-help-with-coastal-road-work/story-HwJWv1aqDTuUiFpxeC2F9M.html

Only 3% calls pertained to queries about medicines, while the remaining 10% were regarding ration supplies.”Rana, who is also the state nodal officer for COVID-19 outbreak, said the call centres are equipped with over three dozen computers, mobile phones, landlines and satellite phones to attend emergency calls. Besides this, the staffers generate a database of callers which is shared with the districts administrations. In the first two days, the call centre received nearly 400 calls.“We are using special software to generate data,” said Rana, who monitors the call centre at the secretariat for over 12 hours every day.The call centre is headed by principal secretary (revenue) Onkar Chand Sharma, who is assisted by five teams of state services officers.“At times it is quite distressing to hear callers explain their pain and plight,” said Garima Sharma one of the staff members at the call centre. “Recently there were two calls of medical emergency. We immediately got in touch with the administration in Tamil Nadu and Chandigarh to facilitate the respective callers,” she said.The helpline numbers are 0177- 2626076, 2626077, 2622204, 2629688, 2629939 and 2621154.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-helpline-87-calls-seeking-evacuation-most-from-punjab/story-edXEx3UTSC9iHaR5M4c0zN.html

03-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus outbreak: Thackeray’s election to House may get delayed||swapnil.rawal@hindustantimes.comThe coronavirus outbreak in the state could delay chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s election to the legislature. Thackeray, who took oath as the chief minister in November last year, has to get elected to either House of the state legislature by the end of May to remain in office. The Shiv Sena was planning to get Thackeray elected to the legislative Council, when nine MLC seats were due to be vacated on April 24. But the Election Commission of India (ECI) has not announced the date for the legislative Council polls in the state, which can put Maharashtra in a tricky situation.According to Article 164 (4) of the Constitution, “a minister, who for any period of six consecutive months, is not a member of the legislature shall at the expiration of that period cease to be a minister”. The six-month period in Thackeray’s case will end on May 28.With Thackeray spearheading the state’s measures to combat the outbreak, Sena insiders said the party has not yet strategised for the Sena chief to fulfill the constitutional requirement. Thackeray has earlier hinted that he would take the MLC route to fulfil the requirement. If Thackeray is not elected to either house, he would have to resign as the chief minister amid the public health crisis in the state. Due to the ongoing public health crisis, political activities in the state have come to a halt. The state has already pushed back local body elections and the ECI has deferred the Rajya Sabha polls that were scheduled in March.Rajya Sabha MP and Shiv Sena party secretary Anil Desai said that there is “status quo” on all elections by the ECI. “Now all elections are deferred by the Election Commission so it is status quo,” Desai said. When asked what is Sena’s strategy as Thackeray may have to resign if he does not fulfil the requirement, Desai said, “Technically it is true (about resigning), but the deferment was announced by the EC. It must have taken into account all such cases. If the requirements are to be fulfilled, the EC would have to take appropriate steps. Internal discussions are yet to happen, as dealing with Covid-19 situation is a priority.”Anant Kalse, former principal secretary of the state legislature, said this is an unprecedented situation. “As per the Constitution, if he fails to become a member of either of the House, he will have to resign. He can take the oath again. Of course, it is not permissible in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court may allow him as these are exceptional circumstances,” Kalse said. He added that Thackeray can get elected through Governor’s nomination, but “it is not a convention”.In the past, two Congress leaders, Sushilkumar Shinde and Prithviraj Chavan, became chief ministers while not being a member of either house of the state legislature. However, both were elected within six months to continue in office.Considering the bitter political fight between the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the state polls in October 2019, the latter would grab every opportunity to pull down the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. “There would not be any political crisis in Maharashtra, we are certain of that a foolproof solution would be found,” said a Sena leader requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-outbreak-thackeray-s-election-to-house-may-get-delayed/story-7UagJNEDiWUrydQvSQA9ZI.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||Innovations in Covid-19 diagnosis reach pilot test stage||The ball has started rolling for five innovations in areas of rapid diagnostic kits, assisted respiratory devices and preventives to combat the Covid-19 outbreak. Five manufacturers – CoSara Diagnostics Pvt. Ltd., Amligene Diagnostics Pvt. Ltd., Coeo Labs, Avyantra and Anabio Technologies Pvt. Ltd. – will now be connected to industry partners and government agencies for scaling up and deployment. Based on individual needs, deployment of each innovation will be preceded by pilot tests, fast-track regulatory clearances, corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding, investment and finally, industry scale-up.“These are times that remind us that India needs indigenously-developed innovations, given traditionally we have been working with global innovations. Supporting and investing in an innovative temperament over the last 10 years has led to this interesting churn in innovations for India,” said Dr Taslimarif Saiyed, chief executive officer and director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms (C-CAMP), Bengaluru, an innovation hub for biosciences supported by various arms of the Indian government.On March 26, a C-CAMP led initiative launched Covid-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (CIDA), to accelerate deployment of near-ready innovations to help control the pandemic. Till date, CIDA has received more than 450 ideas that are being reviewed for market readiness, scientific validity, feasibility and impact.Of the five chosen innovations, CoSara Diagnostics and Ampligene Diagnostics, through the manufacture of their rapid test kits, will help ramp up mass-testing of suspected patients infected with Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19. The CoSara kit – approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) – based on RT-PCR laboratory technique claims to produce results in two and a half hours. Ampligene’s kit, using loop-mediated isothermal amplification, needs to be qualified by the Drug Control General of India and promises results in 30 minutes.With preventive protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks and sanitised hospital linen in short supply, Anabio Technologies, with Swiss collaboration, will manufacture a spray with anti-viral properties that can turn a mask or any normal piece of cotton into an effective virus-blocker, and therefore can be reused. The spray has the potential to be a consumer product that may be bought off-the-shelf.“This anti-viral liquid to be sprayed on masks or soaked with cloth is important especially for those in the first line of defence to contain the spread of the virus. There is vigorous data on its efficiency from its use in Switzerland, and therefore will not need pilot tests in India,” said Saiyed. “This spray, heavily loaded with anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties, has been used for sportswear over the last six to eight years to prevent infections among players.”To address the shortage of ventilators at hospitals, Coeo Labs and Avyantra will manufacture continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines, which have been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients with acute respiratory dysfunction. Current estimates suggest India has 57,000 ventilators. “At present, there is a worldwide rush for ventilators. Therefore CPAP machines can be used for those in the pre-ventilator stage for respiratory support. Additionally, CPAP machines can also be handled by any clinician and don’t need someone specially trained to put a patient on intubated support,” said Saiyed, adding that Coeo Labs, which has been manufacturing CPAP machines for premature babies over the last five years, will upgrade them to combat Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/innovations-in-covid-19-diagnosis-reach-pilot-test-stage/story-N1AbqWGfEGBocnWlwyiGNK.html

03-04-2020||Delhi||How children with special needs and their parents are navigating the lockdown||These days, Ravinder Kumar Srivastav is having a tough time explaining to his 14-year-old son, a student of Class 9 at a municipality school in Jahangirpuri, why his school is not opening, why the streets are empty, and why he is forced to stay at home.“I have tried hard to tell him about the coronavirus, but my son is hearing impaired and since I do not know the sign language, I cannot communicate properly,” says Srivastav. “He is getting restless and frustrated. He always felt better at school, where he communicated well with his special educator. I wish I had learnt sign language, it would have helped me calm him during these tense times.”While parents and children across the country prepare for a mass experiment in homeschooling and online learning, these are challenging times for parents of children with special needs. The closure of schools means their children are missing not just their studies, but also therapies.“Lockdown is a difficult period for deaf children as most of them cannot communicate even with their parents, leading to strife within the family. I get 20 calls a day from the parents of hearing-impaired children who find it hard to it deal with them. Most parents do not know the sign language, and they are now regretting not having learnt it,” says Ruma Roka, founder Noida Deaf Society, who runs a primary school for the hearing impaired in Noida. “While we are trying to send them video lessons in Indian sign language, the problem is most children at our school are from economically weaker sections and do not have access to good smartphones, computers or broadband connection at home.”“The lockdown and the prolonged disruption of education would leave a negative effect on the education and emotional growth of deaf children,” says A S Narayanan, President, National Association of the Deaf. “The government should involve Indian sign language experts in its awareness programme and official communication about coronavirus”.Many parents of children with neuro-developmental disorders — attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy — that require continuous therapies are now having to play both teacher and therapist while they work from home.Take for example Rashmi Singh and Puneet Kumar whose nine-year old-son suffers from ADHD.Children with ADHD need to be engaged in various activities, and require supportive therapies.Rashmi and Punnet are doing the best they can. “It is not easy. He is hyperenergetic and we have to channelise his energy into something creative,” says Rashmi, a nutritionist. “I have never danced in my life, but now I have regular exercise and dance sessions with him,” says Puneet.Expert says every special child has individual needs—while some need extra time and assignments, others need adaptive special education, special subjects and a range of therapies: occupational, behavioural, speech, among others.Dr Ranjit R Anand, director, Maxwell Institute, a school for special children in Rohini, says isolation could be a problem if the child isn’t used to it.“An autistic child can have severe mood swings and they need special attention. While parents can help with physical exercises and some therapies, other therapies require trained professionals,” says Anand.“I help my son with speech therapy, but it is not possible to have the necessary infrastructure at home for other therapies,” says Manoj Chaudhary, who lives in Ghaziabad. His three-year-old son is autistic and requires occupational and speech therapy, among others. “He had shown considerable improvement, but these days he remains very upset.”The Owl House, a community support centre for families and individuals with special needs on Monday started a helpline to advise families during the coranavirus lockdown. “Most calls so far have been about behavioural issues; the children on the autism spectrum are prone to bursts of anger and self–harm,” says Priya Kataria, instruction and learning design manager, who supervises the helpline. “At times, it becomes difficult for parents to handle the situation. We try to understand the issue, offer advice and tools for dealing with the challenge.”Dr Shailendra Kumar, a certified Consultant Occupational Therapist and the founder of Child Neuro Rehabilitation (CNR) Clinic, says that effects of social distancing and lockdown on children with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) are as various and broad as the spectrum itself, and missing therapies will delay their next developmental milestone.The lockdown, he says, is a tricky time for parents of children with special needs, juggling as they are with various responsibilities while working from home. “They should try and involve their kids in various daily tasks which are easy to do and kids can easily understand them through visual prompts, like dusting, vegetable washing, filling water bottles, vegetable segregation, and various small role-playing games,” says Kumar.Parents should ensure that children with special needs, add Kumar, should avoid excess screen time, i.e. the phone and television. “Increased screen time is associated with a decrease in a neurotransmitter (GABA) which leads to aberrant behaviour. Parents, however, can use video calls with children for short consultations with their special educators and therapists,” says Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/how-children-with-special-needs-and-their-parents-are-navigating-the-lockdown/story-AxTqYsR7NnNnqIqH5CEkZN.html

The deferred 40% is likely to be credited by April 20; PSPCL has a monthly salary and pension bill of Rs 250 crore. The decision impacts 60% of its 32,865 employees; the corporation has 71,000 pensioners who have got full payout. For the time being, the chief managing director (CMD) and all other directors will not get salary. They are retired power engineers from other entities and get pension. “The Punjab government had to pay Rs 14,718 crore to the PSPCL in 2019-20, but it gave us Rs 9,200 crore only. The shortage of Rs 5,500 crore of subsidy hit us financially. The curfew means a loss of Rs 450 crore. PSPCL has no option. It is not a cut, but deferring of salary,” said a PSPCL top functionary. “The pandemic of Covid-19 has affected the world economy. PSPCL’s revenue has also been hit due to the lockdown and the imposition of curfew. Under the current distress situation, and in view of the financial crunch of the PSPCL, it has been decided to defer or make part payments of salaries for month of March 2020,” the orders from PSPCL read. There is no deferment for all category D employees; probationers, those who work only on a basic pay scale and don’t get any other allowance; all employees of C category having grade pay up to Rs 3,400, and employees with net salary less than Rs 30,000.“We are strongly resentful. Employees brought PSPCL into profit. The government’s non-payment of Rs 5,500 crore subsidy led to the cash crunch. We have met the CMD, who has assured balance payment by April 20,” said Jasvir Singh Dhiman, president, PSEB Engineers Association. CMD Baldev Singh Sran could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Strap/Blurb40% of amount has been held back and is likely to be paid by April 20; officials claim financial mess also due to non-payment of Rs 5,500 crore in subsidy from the state govt||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pspcl-imposes-40-pay-cut-no-salary-to-cmd-directors/story-tdqYVE2pCLG72FJ3TNVdLK.html

The Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) comprising of Boeing fleet pilots and Indian Commercial Pilots Association (IPCA) in a letter to its chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal on Friday said that the pay cut on allowance is unequal and not acceptable to them. This comes after the airline announced 10% cut of the cabin crew and pilots flying allowance, few days after the lockdown was announced. The letter read, “By effecting a 10% cut on allowances for all employees, the category that has been affected the most are pilots.”The airline pilots requested Bansal to advise the senior executive management to draw up fair cost-cutting measures and not to manipulate the system to safeguard their salaries by burdening the frontline soldiers of the national carrier. “We are open to discussion on an alternative. We hereby seek your urgent intervention,” the pilots said.The pilots said that they are supporting operations of flights for essential services and ensuring the delivery of services is not affected and also rescue Indians stuck in various parts of the world, yet the flying allowance is not paid on time.“While all the other employees are paid in full, flying crew alone are made to bear the brunt with the delayed flying allowance. Implementation of sham austerity measures to cut the flying allowances on top of all this would be adding insult to injury,” the pilots complained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-pilots-oppose-pay-cut-amid-lockdown/story-m30N3Gm8lP7XXuJVJ9bX1L.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||Poultry industry suffers Rs 13,000 crore loss due to Covid-19 pandemic||The Union animal husbandry ministry recently said the poultry industry had suffered ₹13,000 crore losses over the past month and the number was rising due to misconceptions that Sars-Cov-2 virus was being transmitted through consumption of eggs and chicken. A letter from OP Choudhary, joint secretary, Union animal husbandry ministry urged states to start a vigorous campaign to stop misinformation and save poultry farmers during the crisis.On Friday Union minister Maneka Gandhi said, “I have checked with concerned ministers of these departments, and they have denied giving any such orders. This is a suo moto letter written by the joint secretary and does not convey the government’s intent,” said Gandhi.Choudhary, who is also the chairman of the Animal Welfare Board of India, said he had received verified videos from north India, Maharashtra and Telangana of farmers burying live birds. “No scientific body has found any evidence of the virus transmitted through poultry products. They are immunity boosters. This negative perception is dangerous. Relief measures are being planned to revive the industry,” he said. A member of the Poultry Federation of India claimed losses stood at ₹22,500 crore for the entire lockdown period.Meanwhile, animal welfare groups said they challenged contents of the letter before the Prime Ministers’ Office, and will be approaching the Supreme Court. “The secretary cannot dictate what people should eat. Such directions, if needed, are issued by the Food Safety Standards Authority of India,” said Gauri Maulekhi from People for Animals.“In India, there are filthy and dirty meat markets with slaughter practices that do not comply with food safety standards. Such areas are hotbeds for the emergence of infections,” Maulekhi added.The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India said globally and in India people were beginning to value other forms of food and changing eating habits.“Different types of animal farming are linked to the emergence and spread of novel zoonotic diseases. To avoid a future pandemic, we need to act on scientific facts about how new viruses come from factory farming and live markets. The science is clear. Unless we act now on intensive confinement in the rearing of animals for food, no future pandemic could be ruled out and more are likely,” said Dr Manilal Valliyate, veterinarian and PETA India’s chief executive officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/poultry-industry-suffers-13k-crore-losses-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-yftzsYId8CbWMF1VkdYH0H.html
03-04-2020||Lucknow||We need to live first then rest follows: Gaurav Chopra||Actor Gaurav Chopra, best known for his Hollywood film ‘Blood Diamond’ and shows like ‘Uttaran,’ ‘Gulmohar Grand’ and many more, feels glad that his last venture, daily soap ‘Sanjivani’, just got wrapped on time before Covid-19 crisis halted the work everywhere in the country.“No one thought that this kind of cataclysm will engulf the world in just few weeks. We shot the last episode of our show on March 9 and not in the slightest thought did we knew that this will put an end to all work for weeks to come. It’s really disheartening to see where world has come to,” he tells over phone. Chopra is known as one of the fittest actors in the industry. “Fitness has always been my priority but that should be for everyone. Whether I am working or not, I always spend time doing things I love — keeping fit, music, reading or taking care of my family and home. I believe there are multiple ways to acquire a fit body, it’s as simple as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and loving oneself. Doing gym for hours is of no use till you have a fit mind and treat your body like a temple of goodness,” he said. The actor is making most of the quarantine days. “This is a tough time for the country and to support the cause we just have to stay home. We have umpteen time to do things we always wanted to do. I am a private homely person and most of time I love listening to music watching movies and reading.”Chopra hails the lockdown call by the government, “Seeing what is happening around the world, I think this was such a right step to take. As a responsible citizen we should understand the gravity of the situation. Let’s adhere to the lockdown protocols as we need to live first then rest follows.”On work front his hands are full. “I enjoy my job and I don’t do things to get attention! So whatever work I do is to satisfy that actor in me — be it my play ‘Devdas,’ web shows ‘Fourplay,’ or ‘Love, Lust & Confusion.’ I was about to start shoot for the second season of ‘Hello Mini’ series. After wrapping ‘Sanjivani’, I will start taking up more shows but with meaty content and roles,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/we-need-to-live-first-then-rest-follows-gaurav-chopra/story-49tHq4Sw2tGwmPpMTjR1SL.html
03-04-2020||Lucknow||This phase will show us right direction for a better future: Nitish Bharadwaj||What’s keeping us busy in times of lockdown are numerous inspirational videos doing round on social media. One such clip is of Nitish Bharadwaj, who is best remembered as Lord Krishna of the epic Mahabharata.In the clip, Bharadwaj plays Lord Vishnu and talks about how testing these times are and how they could be designed by god for a better tomorrow. HT City talk to the actor to get the context, and how is life in the times of Corona.How are you spending time in the lockdown period?Yoga, meditation (introspection), reading literature, listening to good music by masters, polishing my cinema skills with online masterclasses and cooking.What are the thoughts that are occupying your mind?This lockdown period is a momentary pause, like a momentary recoil of a gun before it fires the bullet. This is an opportunity to go deep within, both as an individual and as a society/nation, and introspect as to which walks of life, we are going wrong in. And, I am not saying ‘going wrong’ only from Covid-19 point of view, but overall. We must also accept our faults, if they spring from this ‘manthan (introspection), and correct them after this period, so that we (while we are live) and our children have a better, safer, healthier and peaceful environment to live in.One of the ancient scriptures, ‘Shikshavalli’, refers to this as ‘Swaadhyaay’ or introspection. This ‘churning’ will show us the right direction for a better future.A very thoughtful and relevant video from a mythological TV show is doing round on social media. Your take.The particular video is from ‘Vishnu Puran’. I remember how Ravi Chopra and I had marathon sessions with the writer Ram Govind about using Lord Vishnu as the narrator, who is above board and comments on everything that we do as humans on earth. Both of us wanted to make the serial relevant for all times. That’s why the dialogues were written like that. I am doing the same thing with my Hindi play ‘Chakravyuh’, which is moving to its 100th show soon.When u look back to your days of doing mythological shows and see them in today’s context how do you relate?Man has not learnt his/her lessons. We are going more and more towards materialism at the cost of ignoring spirituality. We are forgetting the cosmic laws and that the only superpower is Nature. Even a small ‘karvat’ (small turn) by nature can destroy us. There was a time when Dinosaurs went extinct; if man doesn’t learn to respect nature, we don’t have a long enough existence. Catastrophes like COVID-19 should be seen as alarm for the mankind to correct its mistakes of the past and to build a better tomorrow.From you understanding of ‘Gita’ and other scriptures what inferences you draw in today’s context?I would answer this question with Covid-19 perspective. I would quote the very last shloka of the ‘Gita’ “Yatra Yogeshvar: Krishno ….” And say that there are a lot of honest, committed and knowledgeable environmentalists in the world who are warning us to correct ourselves. They are our guides, just like Krishna. All we need to do is to submit to their guidance like Arjun and act positively for a better future. If we do so, man’s existence will be ‘shashvat’ (permanent) and in ‘neeti sangat’ morality. We need to stop ravaging Mother Earth and respect her.After ‘Kedarnath’, what’s happening on acting and theatre front?As an actor I have some scripts for films and web series. Will utilise the lockdown period to read and choose something worthwhile. As a director after the success of my award-winning debut directorial Marathi film with Tanuja ji, titled ‘Pitruroon’, I have locked a screenplay for my Hindi debut. I am in talks with two producers, which will resume soon. I hope to release the said film next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/this-phase-will-show-us-right-direction-for-a-better-future-nitish-bharadwaj/story-a3KsuKYrfyaojU059TSgOJ.html
03-04-2020||Lucknow||I am hardly getting free time: Amit Mishra||Ten years after singer Amit Mishra left Lucknow for greener pastures, has he got an opportunity to stay for such a long time in his hometown. “More than staying home with my parents and cousin, I am happy that my family is relieved that I am in front of them. Else, they would have been very worried,” said the ‘Bulleya’ singer.On the last day of Navratri, they had ‘havan’ at home where his mother recited mantras. “I am here without my workstation so doing whatever is best possible with the given resources. I have my guitar here and repaired our old tabla myself and have started playing it again. So, with the software on my laptop I am making music and songs besides my regular riyaz,” he said.He is using technology to the maximum. “I am learning music production software online. My vocal coaches Jaime Vendera, Marianne D’Cruz and Vinod Prasadji have sent me a session which I am preparing at home. There are assignments from my dance coach Binaisha Deshmukh that I was preparing for my stage shows. My fitness coach too has sent workouts that I am following. So, riyaz, preparing music and my dance-music-fitness training is taking my entire time. I am hardly getting free time,” he said.And there is a new itinerary. “I am doing yog-sadhna with my mother. In such tough times, meditation does wonders. I am really enjoying and doing it with family adds another level to it,” he said.The singer is looking forward to doing a live session on social media. He is also part of digital show ‘Desi Kalakaar’ which he is mentoring with Meet Bros and Akasa Singh.The singer also prepared social awareness videos and audios to contribute his bit to fight coronavirus. “After talks with my friends in New York, Europe and other places, I feel we are better off and safe in India. Hope things get better soon everywhere. It will surely take some time to get back on track. But, till then, we need to be safe and follow government orders and advisories. I am missing the action but right now, I am making the most of what can be done staying at home. And, trust me…there is lots to do!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/i-am-hardly-getting-free-time-amit-mishra/story-99eSGpJVTzi2gzGUlbJ1mO.html
03-04-2020||Lucknow||Video-streaming the stress-buster!||Video chats on Zoom, WhatsApp, Instagram and other live-streaming applications are doing wonders in connecting near and dear ones during the lockdown, even as it fights loneliness and disconnect.“We are connecting with each other on Zoom. I am talking and reconnecting with some of my friends I have not spoken to for over two years. I am connecting with relatives like never before. We are playing online tambola, Quarantine Ludo and Monopoly. It’s back to childhood games that is a great stress-buster,” says Lucknowite Vani Juneja, who’s into surgical items’ and textile trade.She was chatting with contacts in Jaipur, Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai and another in Lucknow. “Due to the surgical trade, days are usually hectic as it’s an essential commodity. But once at home, these video chats are great means to relax and talk to so many people at a go,” she added. Sheeri Siddiqui said that she last connected with her sister, Farhana, in Agra and brother in Kannauj. “I am connecting with my siblings and friends while most of them reside in different parts of the country. So, even though we are away from each other we are connecting through WhatsApp video chats. Our family can see each other during these tough times and know about our well being.”Besides video chats reading books is also a great stress-buster for her. “To combat stress, we talk about childhood memories and try new recipes. I write poems and share them during our chats. We also play online games, which keeps us engaged,” she adds.Amity University psychology professor Manju Agarwal said, “Technology is playing a great part in these tough times. Had it been the 80s or 90s, it would have been very tough. We celebrated our grandson, Rohan’s 7th birthday online. They are in Mumbai, and we, around 25 people, from not just India but abroad too, celebrated his birthday on Zoom application. We had a grand party, we danced, clapped, sang and had a lot of fun.“Those who are positive will look for options. Meeting through video chats, talking on the phone, refreshing memories by looking at old photos, playing with family members, there are so many things one can do. The problem is people with a negative mindset. Depression comes to them as they don’t look for options,” the psychologist said.Agarwal had a suggestion. “Everything is good that makes you feel good. I am a workaholic and never imagined spending so much time at home, but trust me, there is so much to do that I am not finding any free time. I am doing meditation, watching movies, trying new dishes, connecting with relatives more than I ever have. I was hardly on social media but now I am finding time for it and I see it’s also turning very positive.”A US-based journal has also given a similar suggestion. It recommends people reconnect with family members or friends via phone or video-chat during these stressful times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/video-streaming-the-stress-buster/story-97DX14RB19I0bx7gUt6woN.html

The state was also asked to inform the HC about the steps it had taken to provide accommodation and medical facilities to those migrants who have been rendered jobless and lost their shelters owing to the ongoing crisis. The petition filed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) sought directions to the state towards providing temporary accommodation and medical facilities for migrants who have been stranded due to the lockdown as well as ensure minimum wages for them, as they have no source of income currently.The bench of justice AA Sayyed, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a non-governmental organization (NGO) Sarvahara Jan Andolan through advocate Kranti LC, was informed that following the lockdown imposed owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Centre had announced various relief measures, such as providing free ration under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana for three months, for migrants and the marginalised sections. However, the state through two government resolutions (GRs) dated March 29 and 30 had said that the beneficiaries would have to pay a nominal amount for the ration. The petitioners argued that as the GRs were against the provisions under the scheme announced by the Centre, they should be quashed.The PIL also sought directions to the state to set up task forces, which would include government officials and members of the civil society, for overseeing the implementation of both central and state government schemes for migrants and the marginalised sections. These task forces should be set up in all corporations, talukas, zilla parishads and panchayats across the state, the petition said.Additional government pleader informed the court that steps were being taken to take care of migrants and the marginalised sections of the society by providing them free ration and basic medical equipment such as masks and sanitisers to safe guard them from getting infected by the dreaded Covid-19 virus.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as the Supreme Court was seized of a similar petition, it was not passing any orders but directed the state to provide information of the measures the latter had initiated for the welfare and well-being of the migrants and marginalised sections of the society and posted the PIL for compliance on April 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/submit-details-of-relief-measures-for-migrants-during-covid-19-outbreak-bombay-high-court-tells-maharashtra-government/story-fABzeKXut6DGxZ0ENt99PP.html

Chief executive officer (CEO), Noida, has facilitated what all the UP government needs to do.”“Ventilators are vital towards saving the lives of such coronavirus patients, whose illness attains severity. Making 10,000 ventilators, a highly specialised and complicated lifesaving machine, in a month is no mean task. It will be a record of sorts, but more than the record, it will be a swift response to the epidemic,” said a state government official involved in removing hurdles for the company.Infrastructure and industrial development commissioner (IIDC), Uttar Pradesh, Alok Tandon said: “AgVa, a ventilator manufacturer, will supply 10,000 ventilators within one month by staggering supplies in batches through the month.

Chief minister Hemant Soren had also appealed to the Hindpiri residents to go through the screening, terming it for their safety. “A woman was found infected with corona. In such a situation, screening of the people is important. There will be a massive screening of the area. I would request all the residents to cooperate with the administration in the task,” said Soren.The CM added that camps would be set up in the locality so that the health workers do not need to go every home. A Malaysian woman, who was part of a 22-member Muslim group of 17 foreigners and five Indian guides, was tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. The group had been picked by Ranchi police on intervening night of Sunday and Monday from two mosques in Hindipiri.A total of 100 teams — each team comprising a medical staffer, a police and a community volunteer — were sent by district administration on Thursday morning for a massive drive to screen around 8,000 households. However, the teams had to return without doing their assigned tasks due to the protest of a section of the residents in the locality.“There were two major rumours behind the protest by some residents. There was confusion in some people that their details would be taken in the name of screening and would be used in the NPR. Besides, a viral video, which says that people in quarantine are in poor condition. However, confusions and doubts of the people were cleared and they have later agreed to the screening,” said Ibrar Ahmad, president of Anjuman Islamia, Hindpiri.He said on Wednesday night it was said that screening of entire locality would be done. “So, we did not get enough time to convince the people about the importance of the screening,” he said.“There were some issues, including the issue of NPR. We convinced the people with community leaders that NPR has nothing to do with this screening. This initiative is for their safety. Besides, issues related to quarantine was also addressed,” said Lokesh Mishra, Ranchi subdivisional officer.Finally, they agreed to go through the screening. On Thursday evening, 15 static teams were deputed in different areas of the locality, where people would come and their test would be done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/screening-team-for-covid-19-face-resistance-over-npr-rumour-in-ranchi/story-KV0uXT2MnhW7lFYE6Mi8wN.html

Police said the three were identified as Bhavesh Kumar Bhartiya, Subodh Kumar and Om Prakash Razak. The FIR has been lodged under Section188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that provides for a month’s imprisonment or ₹1,000 fine or both.The union ministry of health had earlier issued a directive to maintain strict confidentiality on the identity confirmed and suspected cases. As revealing identity violates the right to privacy of the people, an FIR can be lodged against people violating the government order. “The accused had revealed the identity of the patient in separate WhatsApp groups,” the Begusarai SP said. Meanwhile, the district administration also sealed the Noorpur panchayat, with a population of 855, falling under Barauni block, after a youth tested positive. The youth had returned from Dubai via Goa on March 22 and was referred to Patna on Tuesday. The borders of the nearby villages were sealed and movement of the residents within the 3-km radius was banned. The decision to seal off the area came after two suspects died last week. Begusarai district magistrate (DM) Arvind Kumar Verma said as many as 18 family members of the infected person had been put in quarantine at the Begusarai Sadar Hospital. The village was sealed with the support of social workers and surveillance teams have also been sent to identify the infected youth’s close contacts in the village, said the DM.A health department official said 18 samples of the close contacts of the patient had been collected and sent for testing. The department has also started a survey in the village to detect patients, if any.Meanwhile, reports from Siwan said the administration had sealed over 40 villages of Barharia, Darauli and Hasanpur blocks after five residents of the locality tested positive. Barricades have been erected on all entry points of the villages concerned.

Besides, his machine has microprocessor-based electronic controls, while ours has a motor and ball screw mechanism, with PLC-based electronic controls. All our parts are standard, off-the-shelf ones, used in the engineering industry, while Dr Chauhan claims to have incorporated 3D printed parts in his concept,” said the official spokesperson of Mahindra and Mahindra.The statement added that they were ready and willing for an examination by relevant authorities to establish the independence of their design and technology, and to withdraw the product, if it was established that the firm infringed any intellectual property owned by the claimants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ventilator-row-our-design-is-different-from-pgi-s-prototype-mahindra/story-CR2Vc4OFpGrBAYd00csYoO.html
03-04-2020||Chandigarh||Working in the times of coronavirus pandemic: Safely receiving payments is a challenge, say newspaper vendors||45-year-old Joginder Singh has been working as a newspaper vendor since 1988. However, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and subsequent lockdown have brought forth unprecedented challenges before him.Joginder is responsible for distributing newspapers in the 40-50 colonies on Barewal Road. His workday begins at 4am when he and his brother collect the stock of a variety of newspapers from different drop points.Typically, the two of them would have brought the newspapers to their shop where they would bundle them up for hawkers. However, as they can no longer open their shop, the newspapers are sorted on the verandah of their house.His team, involved in the distribution of papers, then rushes to deliver them before 7am. Not a mean task amid the lockdown. “After the outbreak, many people have refused to take newspapers out of fear of getting infected. However, the newspapers are sanitised before distribution. Nonetheless, there has been a 50% drop in business,” he said, adding,”Earlier, we would distribute 4,500 copies daily. Now, the number has reduced to 2,250.”Ask him what propels him to continue deliveries in these challenging times, he says, “If we do not deliver newspapers, people will switch to online reading and the habit of starting the day with a cup of tea and newspaper will become a thing of the past.”“It, certainly, is risky to get out of our homes but we are taking precautionary measures such as wearing masks and gloves, and carrying a sanitiser. The same equipment has been provided to hawkers,” he says.“Our primary challenge is collecting payments from customers. We don’t have the phone numbers of many people and are brainstorming ways of conducting safe transactions,” he said.“We conduct the collection of payments on the first Sunday of every month, but this time people are asking vendors to collect payment and coupons next month. The curfew pass is also only valid from 5 am to 8 am, in which vendors and hawkers distribute the newspapers. However, we do not have time to collect payments,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/working-in-the-times-of-coronavirus-pandemic-safely-receiving-payments-is-a-challenge-say-newspaper-vendors/story-mHiCY4l6tYWDyAOg1Hs9FJ.html

Some even offer me breakfast and tea,” he says. “I’m not associated with any organisation but I always try helping others as much as I can. I put humanity above anything else,” he said.Singh’s family, especially his children, Ekam and Muskaan, are supportive of him. “My wife, Jaswinder, just asks me to be cautious when I step outside the house, which is why I always wear full sleeve clothes, gloves and cover my face with a handkerchief,” he says adding that his younger brothers, Gurvinder Singh and Arvinder Singh, were also serving society by volunteering Langar Sewa at the gurdwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/life-in-the-times-of-lockdown-i-put-humanity-above-all-else-says-do-gooder-satinder-pal-singh/story-8EVR3JJrMwBUlNBpgqxbEO.html

Further, they have been seeking that the fixed charges be waived off and the bills be generated by the PSPCL on the basis of actual consumption, as the factories are closed.FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular and senior vice-president Vipan Mittal said the state government has used Force Majeure clause in making payments to the power generators and has asked the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) to specify a reduced rate of late payment surcharge.“Similarly, the PSPCL should not charge penalty from the state industry as it is closed and reeling under losses due to the lockdown,” Kular said, adding that the state government can stop payment of interest, which is paid to the industry for the security amount, which is then submitted with the PSPCL.“However, nothing in this regard has been announced and so we are considering filing a petition against the PSPCL in court,” Kular added.Mittal said while the states including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat have already announced relief for the residents, the state government is still in a deep slumber.CICU PRESIDENT SEEKS MAKING PAYMENTS IN INSTALMENTSBesides, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) president Upkar Singh Ahuja has also demanded that the state government may allow the industry to make payments in instalments during the financial crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/industrialists-consider-filing-petition-against-pspcl/story-ynzcuHm0WYPYR3YYm9cfwM.html

03-04-2020||City||Coronavirus outbreak: Villagers in Mohali use logs, tractors to barricade themselves||As the count of cases testing positive for coronavirus in Mohali reached 10 in the last two weeks, a majority of villages in the district have taken it upon themselves to prevent the spread of infection in their areas.From barricading entry points to restricting the entry of outsiders, including vendors, the village elders have deputed youngsters in shifts to keep vigil. Large boards at the entry points, sealed using ropes, carts, even tractor-trolleys, announce entry prohibition.Nobody from the village is allowed to go out either.Sarpanch of Manauli village, Zora Singh, says, “We have fixed the timings of vegetable and milk vendors. For the migrant workers and tenants, we are providing them dry ration, but entry and exit points are completely sealed.”Ajmer Singh, sarpanch of Daun village, says, “We have even banned the entry of vegetable vendors till April 5. But we are facing problems with migrant workers, who do not stay inside despite warnings.”“Besides ration, milk and other essentials, tenants and labourers in the village are also given cooked food arranged by the local gurdwara,” adds Ajmer Singh.The Chilla village, too, has closed its doors to the outside world. Sarpanch Karamjeet Singh Chilla says, “We are taking special care of our village elders. And every third day, the entire village is sanitised.”When contacted, Mohali’s sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Jagdeep Sehgal said, “Most of the villages have banned entry and exit.

More and more panchayats are coming forward to do so. And we are allowing them,” said Himashu Jain, SDM, Kharar.“So far, the requests we have received are from the panchayats of those villages with higher numbers of people under quarantine. This initiative of the panchayats will help check the spread, especially in villages, but we have given clear instructions that essential services must not be stopped,” said Kuldeep Bawa, SDM Dera Bassi.The residents of Landran village in Mohali, too, have self-quarantined by sealing the entry and exit of the village from all the sides using logs and cars. Gurpreet Singh Gill, a social worker of the village, says, “Residents are not allowed to come out of their houses and they have been advised to remain indoors till April 15. Village volunteers have constituted teams to supply household items at doorstep when required.”NEED TO KEEP FAMILIES SAFE“We have even sealed the internal roads leading to different mohallas to check movement of the residents. If we are to save our families, we have to do this,” said Kulwinder Saini, an engineering graduate of Chhat village.A man from his village, suspected of attending the religious congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin West locality between March 13 to 15, has been kept in an isolation ward, and his family of 15 has been home-quarantined in Chhat.

03-04-2020||City||Coronavirus in Mohali, Panchkula: Vegetable vendors give masks, gloves a go-by||/Despite officers of the district administration and police repeatedly asking shopkeepers and vegetable vendors to wear masks and gloves, and ensure social distancing, these directions are not being adhered to.In Mohali, on checking Sectors 76 to 80, it was found that most vegetable vendors are not taking necessary precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Even buyers are not maintaining distance.A vegetable vendor in Sector 79, Rakesh Kumar, who was not taking requisite precautions, said gloves and masks are not available in chemist shops.Kumar said he always ask people to maintain distance while shopping.On March 27, the district administration allowed 100 vendors to carry essential supplies from Phases 1 to 11 and Sectors 68, 69, and 70 in Mohali. Six teams were deployed for effective supervision.Area councilor of Sector 80, Surinder Singh said, they are instructing vendors to take necessary precautions time and again. But, they will not adhere to directions till strict action is taken, he said.Additional deputy commissioner (ADC), Mohali - Aashika Jain said, “Our teams are already supervising them, but, it is also the duty of residents to take precautions. Teams cannot be present everywhere.”SIMILAR STATE OF AFFAIRS IN PANCHKULAIn Panchkula, the district administration has authorised around 480 vendors for supplying fruits and vegetables. However, there is no check on if precautionary measures are being followed by them.Almost none of the vendors were wearing gloves, blatantly ignoring the administration’s instructions.Markets wore a deserted look, with only chemists and departmental shops being open.Some vendors who setup their stalls near the markets were found without masks or gloves. Most visiting sectors for door-to-door supply did not follow necessary precautionary measures either.Rakesh Aggarwal, a resident of Sector 12 and member, Panchkula Vikas Manch, said, “Vendors on streets are not wearing gloves and masks, and not maintaining distance from buyers. Moreover, people surround them as if everything is normal. There is no check by the administration on if precautionary measures are being followed.”Payal Gupta, a resident of Sector 4 said, “Vendors visiting the locality are not wearing masks or gloves. They don’t use sanitisers either, which increases risk of contracting infection. Authorities should provide them with basic kits.”The Panchkula Marketing Board has issued identity cards to authorised vendors, permitting them to move their tractor-trailers and carts carrying vegetables in the city till April 15.The board’s secretary, Dharamender Pal said, “Instructions were issued to vendors to use sanitisers, gloves and masks. We are receiving several complaints related to them overcharging and not following precautionary measures. We are taking action on basis of complaints. So far, we have cancelled permits of four vendors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-in-mohali-panchkula-vegetable-vendors-give-masks-gloves-a-go-by/story-ZN5tjqfzrQNtlbJGmj0FmL.html

Admitted to the isolation ward on March 20, she was discharged after two consecutive negative reports.The Sector-19 resident, however, had shown maturity when she decided to go straight to the hospital from the airport. She recognised the symptoms, as she had been treating people with the disease at the London hospital, where she worked; she had also lost a colleague to the virus.“I had never felt so unwell in my life. It started with high fever, breathlessness and ultimately led to sensory loss of smell and taste,” she says, adding that it was her passion to serve patients that gave her the strength to endure the suffering.“I decided to isolate for me, my family and all others more vulnerable. The disease can hit anyone and we must follow advisories religiously. My family was quarantined at home,” she adds.On the course of treatment, she says, “The schedule was taking a paracetamol and sleeping; after a time, it got exhausting, even as I had my laptop with me. Most days, I slept 18 hours a day.”She adds, “The disease is different from other flus. I had diarrhoea, severe abdomen pain, chest congestion, breathlessness and even headache. At one point of time, I felt I was about to die. However, I sailed through with courage.”She is all praise for health workers, saying that they were making huge sacrifices. “The PGIMER staff was cooperative and always available for help,” she said, adding that the large majority of persons who do contract the disease were not going to die.“One needs to consult and believe verified sources of information. Venture out, only if important. Our parents and grandparents can suffer due to our mistake,” she says, adding that even in her sector there was some panic after she tested positive, but she put it down to people not knowing much about the virus. “There is nothing to panic, but one must be aware that anyone can be impacted.” Even now, at home, she is maintaining some distance from family members and says this is a change that most households must inculcate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/26-year-old-chandigarh-woman-first-to-be-discharged-in-tricity/story-ZbWcDNHFzvqHxJZDZVqsdM.html
03-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus in Chandigarh: PGIMER awaits 10,000 PPE||Even as the UT administration has decided to use the extension block of Nehru Hospital of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) as a dedicated facility for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, the institute has been struggling to procure good quality personal protection equipment (PPE) amid the country-wide shortage.PPE refers to protective clothing, helmets, gloves, face shields, goggles, face masks and/or respirators or other equipment designed to protect the wearer from injury or the spread of infection or illness.The institute has placed the order for more than 10,000 PPEs in order to deal with the increase in cases. The UT administration on Wednesday had decided that those who test positive will be shifted from the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, to the PGIMER.Senior UT officials have said that the decision was taken keeping in view the shortage of PPEs and also for judicious use of other equipment.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said that they have placed orders for the good quality PPEs, however due to country wide shortage they have not been able to procure them in large quantity. “Procuring good quality PPEs which are used in the clinical settings, and act as a barrier between infectious materials and skin, mouth, nose, or eyes, is a challenge. We have roped in many suppliers which are approved by the government of India, but so far they haven’t been able to deliver. We have enough budget to buy the equipment but the problem is that there is a country-wide shortage,” he said.FACILITIES AT INSTITUTEThe institute has created a facility of 60 beds in the Nehru Hospital extension block where Covid positive patients from all city hospitals will be shifted and kept under observation.“The third floor of the hospital in which 60 beds have been kept for Covid-19 patients in the initial phase, whereas on the fourth floor, 15 ventilators will be there in the intensive care area. Similarly in the second phase, if the patient number increases, other wards on the second and fourth floors will be opened,” Dr Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson said.DOCTORS WARY OF SHIFTING PATIENTSMeanwhile, Association of Resident Doctors, PGIMER, has said that the transferring of all the stable Covid positive patients at this stage poses the risk of bringing them out of effective isolation with great risk of infection to all those involved in transport, their families and neighbours. To carry out this exercise on a daily basis with the diagnosis of fresh cases increases this risk manifold, they said.Association president Uttam Thakur said, “Once the limited number of beds in the Nehru Extension block are occupied by stable, non-oxygen requiring patients on account of mass transfers, there will be a paucity of beds and manpower for the management of the sick COVID positive patients.”“Feasibility of vacant and almost ready hospitals of UT, like the one in Sector 48, to convert it into a Covid hospital should be considered. The entire medical fraternity with nursing staff can be included for rotational postings,” said Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-in-chandigarh-pgimer-awaits-10-000-ppe/story-FJst9drvFTS64Oz0s1d7bM.html
03-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus in Chandigarh: Doctors log online to check up on chronically ill patients needing care||They too are suffering from life-threatening diseases, but people with cancer and heart and kidney disorders have been unable to connect easily with the tricity lockdown restricting movement and hospitals focusing solely on combating the Covid-19 pandemic. Many doctors, most of them in private hospitals, are doing their best to offer online consultations or relying on WhatsApp to check up on follow-up cases.The curfew imposed by the UT administration from March 24 was relaxed later, allowing one member of a family to walk to shops close by to buy groceries, vegetables and medicines. For chronically ill patients, however, no such window other than emergency cases was given to visit a doctor or hospital.“I have multiple health issues, with heart, knee and neurological problems. Some of my tests for heart ailments are pending and I was due for a hospital visit, but it has been put off because of the curfew. Some doctors like my cardiologist are kind enough to offer advice on the phone, but others aren’t,” says Madhukar Verma, a Panchkula resident. REGULAR MEDICAL ATTENTION NECESSARY“Stopping the spread of the Covid-19 is top priority, but patients who are already sick and need medical attention on a regular basis have to consult doctors even though they do not have to be admitted in emergency. A large number of such patients were visiting hospitals before the curfew was imposed. The government has to work out a way for them too,” said Dr Ramneek Singh Bedi, director, Bedi Hospital and advisor, World Medical Association.Many patients had problems reaching hospitals even though they required treatment urgently. One-on-one consultation was necessary for them with doctors, who then decided if immediate treatment was required. “For instance, if a patient has been unable to pass urine, then a doctor has to decide whether emergency treatment is required or not,” said Sandeepan Beri, general manager, Indus Hospitals. “For this, a patient’s medical checkup is necessary. But many of them are not able to reach hospitals because of curfew restrictions,” said Beri.When asked to comment on the matter, Manoj Kumar Parida, UT adviser, said, “Our doctors have been told to go for medical consultation and advice to patients through video calls in non- serious cases during curfew. List of doctors and timing is being finalised.”Bedi, however, insists on physical examinations as “only preliminary advice can be given on phone, but doctors can miss many symptoms.”TELE-MEDICINE, ONLINE CHECKUP AND VIDEO CONSULTATIONSDoctors in the meantime were doing everything possible to stay connected with patients through telephone and online mediums.“I am in touch on phone with follow-up patients and others and giving them advice. Our emergency services are open round the clock,” said Dr Rohit Parti, cardiologist, Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, Panchkula.Many medicos were relying on WhatsApp to assess the condition of patients. Dr Pradeep Aggarwal, director, orthopedics and joint replacement, Paras Hospitals, Panchkula, said, “Patients can call and share their reports, and older prescriptions on WhatsApp. They are free to call me at a time of their choosing.”Ivy Hospital, Mohali, and Ojas Hospital, Panchkula, were also offering tele-OPD facilities. “We are available online for consultation and only calling patients to hospital in case investigations were absolutely necessary,” said a Fortis spokesperson.“Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, dialysis and obstetric services cannot be stopped and, therefore, are continuing as before. The number of emergency cases such as surgeries, angioplasties, trauma cases, etc has gone up as many hospitals are shut,” he added.A new start-up, Ayu Health, is offering video consultation with its doctors across all medical specialties in the tricity. “Patients can talk to their doctors through a video link without stepping out of their homes,” said, Arjit Gupta, co-founder at Ayu Health.Max Hospital has also started video-consultations with doctors with appointments and payments made online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coronavirus-in-chandigarh-doctors-log-online-to-check-up-on-chronically-ill-patients-needing-care/story-bWBfDQRKfvv8MrRX8Dr1RP.html
03-04-2020||Chandigarh||For Chandigarh students, online classes off to a wobbly start||Vineet Sharma, a student in a private school in the city, just began his online non-medical classes for class 11 on Monday. The new experience for him is replete with uncertainty and disorder amid jumping from one online tutorial to another for three main subjects—Physics, Maths and Chemistry. A discouraged Sharma said he was unable to grasp anything.“Today was the fourth day of my online class, but I am unable to understand the concepts they teach. Many times, my teacher has connectivity issues while my network is not great either. It’s chaotic and confusing,” he said. Educational institutions as well as students are still in the process finding their way around the new platform of teaching. Online classes in the tricity are facing snags due to lack of preparedness and proper infrastructure. Almost all city colleges, Panjab University and Chandigarh’s private schools have started online classrooms, but students say the teaching needs to be more methodical and systematic. In the absence of curriculum and methodology, these virtual classrooms are not up to the mark, with insubstantial infrastructure and poor internet connectivity further contribute to its inefficacy.“It is treated as just a stop-gap mechanism, which may be why it isn’t giving the desired result. In our school, not every teacher has to take a class. We have just asked them to revise difficult subjects so students don’t waste this time they have on their hands,” said a principal of a private school in UT. These online classes are being conducted via audio-visual mode through mobile apps like Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, YouTube, Google Classroom and WhatsApp. Many teachers who are unable to use these means are sharing self-created study material in the form of PDFs, documents and PowerPoint presentations, e-mail and digital platforms such as Swayam NPTEl, e-PG Pathshala, eGyankosh and MOOC.org.Sunita Kumari, a student at Post Graduate Government College, Sector 46, said, “When I left for home, I forgot to take my books in the PG facility. Now, I am worried that if we have to take exams when college reopens, what will I do?” “The only hope is online classes, but the study matter is insufficient”, she added.Elaborating on the issues that students are facing, Priya Chadda of Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma College, said, “Some students staying in the hostel had to leave the city in a hurry, and so left behind many of their books. While others living in remote areas are finding it difficult to use the online (LX) module due to slow internet connection.”ATTENDANCE NOT MANDATORYAjay Kumar, a teacher at PGGC for Girls in Sector 11, said, “Currently, we can’t have a categorical check on attendance because of the digital divide as well as the strength of the internet connection for e-learning.”Pooja Garg, a teacher at PGGC Sector 46, said attendance was not compulsory as not all students had access to the internet. “And yet, the response is pretty good. The only problem is that all students don’t have a connection,” she said.Meanwhile, there are no online classes for government school students, said Alka Mehta, district education officer (DEO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/for-chandigarh-students-online-classes-off-to-a-wobbly-start/story-UztLP3ngVD1FrjzyvO3XvN.html
03-04-2020||Chandigarh||PU to train 60 teachers from 9 varsities in online teaching techniques from April 4||Panjab University (PU) is all set conduct a seven-day training programme for teachers on online teaching techniques from Saturday amid the coronavirus lockdown.More than 60 teachers from nine universities across the country, including Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Punjabi University, Patiala, and Pune University will take part in the programme.It will be organised through Zoom cloud and teachers will be oriented about the usage of Google Classroom and teaching interactions through Zoom cloud and other related software.PU dean education professor Jatinder Grover, said, “As educational institutes across the country are shut due to the coronavirus outbreak, it is the need of an hour to apprise teachers of the procedures of online teaching. Since majority of the teachers are not fully aware about using online platforms, this online programme is being conducted.”A PU senator said, “Both students and teachers are finding it difficult to switch from classrooms to online mode. Some teachers do not have their teaching materials with them and they are not even familiar with online teaching modes.”During the course, experts from National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration, Ambedkar University, Delhi, Dr BR Ambedkar University, Delhi, and Panjab University, Chandigarh, will speak on usage of online platforms in an effective manner. An expert from the McGill University, Canada, will deliver a special lecture. PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar said, “The online teaching procedures will be shared during this faculty development programme and it will enhance the professional abilities of the teachers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-to-train-60-teachers-from-9-varsities-in-online-teaching-techniques-from-april-4/story-LiP7wGStwnmjHROlZG4ozL.html
03-04-2020||Chandigarh||93 FIRs in 11 days, Ludhiana gives two hoots to curfew||With curfew in Punjab entering the 11th day on Thursday, the Ludhiana police had remained on its toes taking action against those violating the orders. As many as 93 FIR’s were registered against such violators in the last few days. Another 250 violators were locked in open jails and were later let off with a warning on Thursday.From loitering around to standing in groups for no reason or simply sauntering the streets at a time when the novel coronavirus pandemic has claimed one life, the violators, mostly youth, were nabbed for giving two hoots to police’s warning. Only uniformed police personnel, paramilitary forces, health services, government officers, officials on duty, delivery staff and vendors are exempted to move around during the curfew for discharge of their official duties.To deal with the violators of the orders related to the lockdown, four open jails have been set up temporarily in Ludhiana, including New SD School, 33 feet Bahadurke Road, Indoor Stadium on Pakhowal Road, Guru Nanak Stadium and Valmiki Bhawan in Moti Nagar Ludhiana. Agrawal added that four open jails have been set up in Ludhiana city for the violators, and similarly such open jails would also be set up at Khanna and Jagraon.A police official on curfew duty narrated the experience and said that whenever police rounds these youth up, they start making excuses that they are out to buy groceries, vegetables etc.“After it is verified that the person is telling a lie, we lodge them in open jails. Everyone is advised to stay at home and only those who have a purpose to go out, or are on duty can venture out,” said the cop.Agrawal informed that the work related to distribution of essential commodities is going on smoothly in the entire district. He assured that the district administration would assure the supply of essential commodities to everyone at doorstep so that no one suffers.Appeal to doctors denying treatmentTaking serious note of reports that some private hospitals are denying admission to the patients, the deputy commissioner appealed to the doctors to help the patients by offering them treatment. He said that it is not necessary that every sick patient is suffering from COVID 19. So that is why, no private hospital should deny admission to sick patients.Migrants have stopped from going to parent stateAgrawal stated the migration by labourers to their parent state has now stopped now as they have come to know that not only Punjab, but even Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have sealed their borders. He informed that shelter homes have been set up by the district administration, where such persons are provided shelter, food and medical aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/93-firs-in-11-days-ludhiana-gives-two-hoots-to-curfew/story-WKAnHnXijJWQWo04dBP8SI.html
03-04-2020||Chandigarh||12 lakh farmers in Haryana to get loan moratorium benefit||About 12 lakh farmers from Haryana will benefit from the three-month deferment of the date to pay farm loan interest or instalments. This would be applicable to farmers who took loans from co-operative or commercial banks.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday announced to extend the date for repayment of crop loans by farmers to June 30. The decision was taken in accordance with the directions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of coronavirus crisis.Haryana agriculture department officials said there were about 25 lakh beneficiaries of the farm loans availed from the co-operative and commercial bank in the state.About 12.37 lakh farmers who took a loan from primary agricultural societies (PACS) will not get the benefit of deferred loan payment as February 29 was the last date of payment, officials said.Those who would qualify for the benefit include about 11 lakh farmers who took loans from commercial banks under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme. They would get an extension till June and can avail three% interest subvention if they repay within the stipulated period of three months from the due date, officials said.In addition, there are 85,000 farmers who had taken loans of about ₹2,900 crore from the district central co-operative banks. They would get an extension until September.Officials said the matter of deferring loan payment for about 7,000 farmers who have taken loans worth ₹45 crore from Land Development Bank is also being considered by the state government.The RBI on March 27 had communicated to the banks and financial institutions that in respect of all term loans (including agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans), all commercial banks including regional rural banks, small finance banks and local area banks, co-operative banks, all-India financial institutions, and NBFCs including housing finance companies are permitted to grant a three-month moratorium on payment of all installments due between March 1 and May 31.The RBI also said that the repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor (the length of time until the loan is due), will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period. However, interest will continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period, the RBI communication said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/12-lakh-farmers-in-haryana-to-get-loan-moratorium-benefit/story-hhnCwKAvzNifKau6pUWULL.html
03-04-2020||City||Covid effect: Up to 50% dip in veggie prices worries Haryana farmers||Within a week, the lockdown has hit the business of Haryana vegetable growers and dairy farmers by almost snapping the supply chain. Though the government has made it clear that there will be no restriction on the supply of essential items, especially vegetables, ration and milk, while fixing the time for vegetable markets to operate — 4.30am to 9.30am — daily, farmers are alleging that due to the lockdown, wholesale prices of most of the vegetables have crashed up to 50%. As per farmers, people are unable to buy directly from them and they have to sell their produce to limited number of vendors, which they say has led to fall in prices. Sushil Kumar, a farmer from Radaur in Yamunanagar, said, “Nowadays, price of cauliflower is Rs 10/kg and it is being sold at Rs 18/kg against Rs 24-27 per kg before the lockdown.”Another farmer Jasvinder Singh from Kheri Dabdlan in Kurukshetra said, “Due to restrictions in vegetable markets, prices have crashed. We had to sell cucumber at Rs 14/kg on Thursday, which fetched up to Rs 30/kg before the lockdown.” Meanwhile, officials of the state agriculture marketing board said there was no impact of the lockdown on the wholesale prices of vegetables as farmers were allowed to sell their produce through commission agents.“The produce of local farmers is procured in open auction and the prices of vegetables depend on the quantity and quality,” said Jasbir Singh, mandi secretary of Kurukshetra district. DAIRY FARMERS STARE AT LOSSESAs procurement agencies have also reduced the prices of milk, dairy farmers are staring at losses with the wholesale rate of milk dropping up to Rs 10 per litre. “The government procurement agency, Vita, has reduced its prices for the third time since March 21 and now it has come down to Rs 63/l for 100% fat milk from Rs 70, besides Rs 5 bonus per litre,” said a dairy farmer in Yamunanagar, Prem Chand. Ranjit Singh, a procurement manager at Haryana dairy development cooperative federation (Vita), said, “The demand has dropped as we are able to sell only 5,000 litre per day against 20,000 litre before the lockdown. We don’t even have enough containers to keep the remaining 95,000 liters of milk we procure daily as there is almost no demand of milk products like khoya, cheese, curd and kheer.”POTATO GROWERS’ GAINHowever, potato growers are happy as they claimed that the lockdown did not cast any major impact on the prices, but increased the demand of potatoes. “Traders bought our produce even from the field at Rs 12/kg against the previous Rs 15/kg. But this deal cut our transportation cost and the payment was made on the spot,” said Darsan Lal, a potato grower from Ladwa in Kurukshetra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-effect-up-to-50-dip-in-veggie-prices-worries-haryana-farmers/story-LgaN6c0gHbGvCBeqXX4rJK.html

03-04-2020||Delhi||Shortage at some of Delhi’s food camps, excess at others||The free lunch and dinner programme that is being run by the Delhi government for nearly a week now, has grown to 2800 centres across the city. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on (Wednesday), that the Delhi government served lunch to 5,85,386 and dinner to 5,79,162 people at around 1,423 centres.“We are feeding 3.5 lakh-4 lakh people daily until now, and we will start feeding 10-12 lakh people from tomorrow. We found out that people were crowding at the food centres. So we decided to create more centres,” he added in a videoconference. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOn Thursday, Hindustan Times reporters visited about a dozen of the centres set up by the Delhi government and found that a few facilities were out of food. And that some remain crowded. Some of the centres are in shelters run by the state. Others are in schools. According to Sujit Kumar, caretaker of one of the bigger shelters run by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) in Sarai Kale Khan, lunch and dinner are prepared for around 500 persons twice a day, but on Thursday 600-700 people turned up for lunch. “There are two more centres in the nearby colonies, both of which are within walking distance and have fewer takers. But because this centre falls along the main road, a lot of people turn up.We have asked for an increase in our supplies, “ he added.Similarly, the Kalindi Kunj centre, which again doubles up as a shelter cooks for around 50 people a day, but in the last 3-4 days, 60-70 persons have started turning up for each meal. “Some have to return hungry,” said Afzal Khan, caretaker.But, at other centres in Ghazipur, Patparganj and Mayur Vihar Phase 2, there was excess food. “We do not use the same meal for dinner since it is getting warm . So we ask our civil defence volunteers to go and distribute the left over food in the nearby colonies. Today also we have a lot of Rajma and rice left,” said Ravi Chandran, an official from the Delhi government’s education department who is overseeing the arrangements in a school in Ghazipur which has been turned into a centre. The hunger relief centre in Vasant Vihar’s C block is in a school in a quiet residential lane inside a colony were most gates have been closed because there are no guards to man them, although the school itself is in a part of the block that doesn’t have access gates. Like in some of the other hunger camps, there have been complaints of social distancing norms not being maintained in this camp. A park in front of the school has also become a place for those who come to the camp to hang out, before or after meals. The government has set up two more centres at Kusum Pahari and Bhawar Singh Camp to cater to the poor in Vasant Vihar. In Mayur Vihar Phase 1, the food centre at Janki Devi SKV school in the area no longer serves as one because it is located in a gated residential area. School authorities said the food was transferred to another government school in the nearby Chilla village.At the centres at AIIMS, and the one at Yamna Pushta, there was no shortage. Both are in shelters and at the latter, close to 1,000 people are served two meals a day. Vinay K Stephen, chief functionary, Sadik Masih Medical Social Servant Society (SMMSSS), which manages some of the shelters said, “After the government has opened new centres to provide food too migrant and poor people, there is not much pressure on the shelter homes now. We are providing food to close to 3000 people daily. We are just hoping that the government will release the payment soon, as we are running out of funds.” Nearly 2,500 schools and 250-night shelters have started distributing food to 500 people a day, each bringing the total number of distribution centres to nearly 2,800. In central Delhi’s Rajendra Nagar, Ramesh Yadav, 43 who was brought to a shelter by the police four days ago, said that he doesn’t mind staying there as long as he gets more to eat. “We are labourers and are used to eating three meals a day. Here there is nothing in the morning. The first meal comes around mid-day a small bowl of khichdi or dal-rice. The quantity is too less. Another meal comes at 7 pm, which again is not enough,” said Yadav, who is one of the 41people staying in this Delhi government school that has been converted into a shelter.He added that the policemen picked him up when he was walking back to his rented accommodation in Paharganj from the Anand Vihar ISBT, after failing to catch a bus to go back to his village in Uttar Pradesh. “There are eight of us here from the same area. I just want to request the authorities to let us go back to the room where we can cook and feed ourselves or give us enough to eat,” said Yadav, who stitches bags at a workshop in Paharganj for a living.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shortage-at-some-of-delhi-s-food-camps-excess-at-others/story-3q2Q3GIff9vxeAkpbheC2K.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||Seven deaths, 88 more cases in Maha; count rises to 423||Maharashtra recorded 88 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Thursday and seven deaths, the highest in a day, as the state revved up its machinery to combat the pandemic, including sealing off high-risk areas and aggressively applying the 3-T formula (trace, test and treat) for suspected cases.As of Thursday, Maharashtra’s coronavirus case tally stood at 423, the highest in the country. Of the new cases, 54 are in Mumbai, 11 in Pune, 9 in Ahmednagar, 9 in MMR (excluding Mumbai), two in Aurangabad, one each in Satara, Osmanabad and Buldhana. The state health department, however, said the number includes cases diagnosed by private laboratories over the past few days and which were confirmed by the state on Thursday. Of the state’s 20 deaths, 17 are in Mumbai, while Pune, Buldhana and MMR (excluding Mumbai) reported a death each. “The total new cases in Mumbai today are 17, while the remaining were from the past few days. Most of them are from private aboratories. State authorities have confirmed them today,” said an official from the state health department.Of the deaths, one was of a 61-year-old male at Nair hospital with underlying illness of blood cancer. Another 58-year-old male patient, who died in Sion hospital, had high blood pressure and was admitted to the hospital on March 29. Another 58-year male patient died in a private hospital. A 63-year male patient died in Kasturba hospital.The spike in cases, which has been attributed majorly to the Tablighi Jamaat programme, has forced the state government to press the alarm button. The state government has asked local authorities — district collectors and municipal commissioners — to identify areas where there is a high risk for Covid-19 spread and contain them. Tope said the state government has identified 1,300 of the 1,400 people linked to the programme and they have been kept in isolation. “We have traced them to their respective districts after we received a list from the Centre. We have all details about them and the people who came in contact with them,” he said.During a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray apprised him about the major decisions being taken by the state government. Modi hinted at not extending the 21-day lockdown period beyond April 14. When Thackeray asked about how the states should maintain the situation after the 21-day lockdown, Modi said that the state government should not lift the lockdown immediately from April 15, but it should happen in phases and depending on the severity of the outbreak in the state.The Prime Minister also advised states to desist from announcing relief packages to gain publicity. “Don’t announce the packages to gain publicity. This is a serious fight and there should be co-ordination among all states. It may be given publicity in newspapers for few days, but the corona crisis is much bigger in reality,” said the PM. Apart from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the video conference was attended by Tope, home minister Anil Deshmukh, environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray and state government officials.Tope added that the Prime Minister has also asked the state to focus more on tracing, tracking, testing, and treatment. “The PM has asked us to use drones, GPS or any other technology to track the movement of quarantined people to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” said Tope, adding that the PM has asked the state to observe strict curfew in containment areas without any lapse.Thursday saw 648 more people admitted with the coronvirus symptoms. Until Thursday, 10,873 tests have been conducted in various laboratories, of which, 10,280 have tested negative, while 423 are positive. 42 patients have been discharged from the hospitals, while 38,244 are home quarantined. 2,138 are in institutional quarantine.Of the 1,062 people who had links with the Tablighi Jamaat programme organised in a masjid in Nizamuddin in Delhi, 890 have been identified and 576 from them have been admitted in isolation wards. Four of them — two each from Pimpri-Chinchwad and Ahmednagar — have tested positive. Meanwhile, Maharashtra has set up 30 new hospitals dedicated to treating Covid-19 patients, with a total bed capacity of 2,305. Tope said the total capacity of the sample tests for coronavirus has increased to 5,000 a day. The Central government has also been requested for an adequate supply of equipment required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. According to officials from the health department, the Central government is not supplying Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, N-95 masks in adequate numbers. Against the demand of one lakh masks and PPEs, the Maharashtra got only about 2,000, a couple of days ago.The minister said, “We have sought availability of PPE kits, N-95 masks, ventilators as quality equipment were not available in the market. We will not play with the safety of our healthcare workers, therefore, we will need to augment the capacity of the manufacturing of these machines and devices or give encouragement to the manufacturer to set up [units] at a new place,” Tope said.Despite repeated appeals, people are flocking to vegetable markets and grocery shops, for which the state government is expected to take drastic steps. After shutting down vegetable markets that saw crowding in the past few days, the state government is expected to tweak its policy for grocery shops and departmental stores. State health minister Tope hinted that the state is considering keeping the markets and shops open on alternate days, so as to reduce the crowds at these places.The state government has once again appealed to migrant workers to not attempt to travel to their respective states and assured to take care of their stay, meals and health services. There are about 3.25 lakh migrants, including workers, employees and students, put up in 3,000 shelters that have been set up across the state.On Thursday, five new cases of Covid-19 were reported from Kalyan and Dombivli, taking the total number of positive cases to 19 in the twin cities.Of the five, three attended the wedding in Dombivli on March 19. One from Dombivli (East) was infected after coming in contact with them. Kalyan has reported one case.The four people from Dombivli are at Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai and the one from Kalyan has been admitted to a private hospital.Out of the 19 cases, seven have been traced to the wedding in Dombivli, which was attended by a 25-year-old infected man who had come from Turkey.Kalyan has three positive cases till now and one has recovered after treatment, said civic officials.The Dombivli police have prepared a list of those who attended the wedding and have asked the civic body to trace them.“Most parts of Dombivli (East) have been sealed. We have also stopped the entry and exit of private vehicles. We are continuously surveying all buildings in which people tested positive were found and also sending those suspected for testing,” said a civic official.Thane reported two Covid-19 positive cases on Thursday.The 48-year-old general practitioner who tested positive does not have any travel history and Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) suspects he might have contracted it from a patient. The civic body is tracing all patients he has come in contact with.The doctor has been admitted to Thane civil hospital, which has a separate isolation ward. An official from TMC said, “The doctor has a clinic in Kajuvadi and must have come in contact with more than 100 patients in the past four days. His wife and son are home quarantined.”A total of 13 people from Thane have tested positive for coronavirus till now.The official added, “We were trying to shift the doctor to Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai or any big hospital in Mumbai but, there was no bed available.”The other case, 59-year-old man, is from Kalwa. TMC said he does not have any travel history.As many as 40 medical staffers from Shatabdi hospital, Kandivli, have been quarantined at ESIC hospital after they unknowingly came in a direct contact with a COVID-19 patient. “The patient was admitted for some other ailment but later, after getting discharged, got diagnosed with coronavirus. So, we have quarantined the people who were in direct contact with him,” said Dr Pramod Nagarkar, medical superintendent of the hospital.Currently, four coronavirus patients are undergoing treatment at the hospital where BMC has constructed a 90 bed Covid-19 isolation facility. The non-emergency and OPD at the hospital has been closed down for 14 days.Also, a 57-year-old head constable from Worli has tested positive for COVID-19. A senior IPS officer from city police confirmed with HT that on Thursday the police were informed by the civic authority about the head constable testing positive. The policeman along with his wife and two kids have now been kept in isolation. On March 19, the head constable’s brother admitted at the Sion hospital for some ailment. “The policeman had been visiting his brother at this hospital, where most of the COVID-19 suspects from Dharavi area are rushing to,” an officer said.(with inputs from Sajana Nambiar, Megha Pol and Vijay Kumar Yadav)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seven-deaths-88-more-cases-in-maha-count-rises-to-423/story-cQ7PKwOJYd3OZUBHQhbMSK.html
03-04-2020||Gurugram||9-month pregnant wife of AIIMS doctor also tests positive for Covid-19||Hours after a doctor from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, his nine-month pregnant wife, too tested positive for the infection.The AIIMS doctor’s wife is the first pregnant woman in the city to have tested positive for the virus.So far, the health ministry has no guidelines for managing Covid-19 during pregnancy. The World Health Organisation says that there is limited data on the impact of Covid-19 on pregnant woman, but so far there is no evidence of higher risk of severe illness.The 28-year-old doctor from AIIMS worked in the physiology department of the hospital and had not come in direct contact with any Covid-19 patient being treated there. He has been admitted to an isolation facility with his wife. Their three year old daughter has also been admitted to the hospital as a suspected Covid-19 case. They did not have a history of foreign travel.“We have not been able to establish where he got the virus from as he has no history of international travel and he was not involved in treating patients with Covid-19. The only history that we have come to know is that he had gone to a mosque, but we are not sure whether he got the infection there,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of AIIMS.It is unclear which mosque the doctor had visited in the city.At least five other doctors have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past one week, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/9-month-pregnant-wife-of-aiims-doctor-also-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-6pWMNRzT2hwWP8Vsv8pHWJ.html
03-04-2020||Delhi||Capital catching up to handle inevitable spike of coronavirus cases||Across ministries in the Delhi government, in hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, and among health experts closely tracking the pandemic and its spread, there is a degree of unanimity — Delhi is about to see a rise in cases. But if this is the hypothesis, is Delhi ready? Interviews with five key officials across the city government and in hospitals presents a mixed picture. Delhi is not testing enough people to have a full sense of the spread of the disease. It is also suffering from a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPEs), which has directly put health care workers in the line of danger. But it is ramping up with its hospital infrastructure to treat Covid-19 patients, putting in place isolation facilities, and maintaining a reserve of ventilators for severe cases. This means, experts advising the government suggest, that if there are 100 new cases every day, Delhi will be able to handle it. The numbers As of Thursday evening, 219 people have tested positive in the city and four have died — a 68-year-old woman from Janakpuri and a 62-year-old Yemeni man. A 73-year-old resident of Nizamuddin and another 30-year-old man from the Markaz complex have also died. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicOf the 219, 108 cases are among people from the Nizamuddin Markaz. The numbers are likely to rise further, with reports of most of the 536 people in hospital isolation yet to come back. The number of infected cases could also rise because all those who have flown in from international destinations are not yet out of the danger zone. It could rise because of the huge congregations of migrant workers Delhi saw in the aftermath of the announcement of the lockdown. It could rise because those who are at the forefront of battling the disease — the health workers — themselves are getting infected. It could rise because one person — any one person — may emerge as a “super spreader”. Or it could rise just because India may be at the stage of community transmission — where the source of the infection cannot be located — despite the government emphasising that this is not yet the case. The government believes it is ready to deal with this spike — but up to a point.S K Sarin, director of the Institute of Liberty and Biliary Science, is the head of a medical committee which is advising chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Covid-19. In its report, the committee has said that Delhi is prepared to deal with 100 cases daily. Also Read: In 4 years, India put 4,200 foreigners on visa blacklist for Tablighi activities“The committee will reassess the needs again and prepare a blueprint of what we have and what is needed in the next three to four days. The committee is working closely with government in preparing for an increase in the number of cases,” said Sarin. The PPE challengeAt the moment, Delhi’s biggest challenge is a shortage of PPEs, which are essential to prevent infection among the medical staff who interact with Covid-19 patients. Eight doctors in the city have already got infected with the virus, and there are reports of medical staff in hospitals contemplating resignations. When cases surge, the shortage will create a deeper crisis. “We are ensuring that the PPE get used rationally — everybody who enters the ward, including the sanitation staff, has to put on the protective gear. We have enough at the moment, but there can be a scarcity in the future as we are expecting the number of Covid-19 cases to rise,” said a doctor from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).The Delhi CM on Wednesday appealed to the Centre to ensure the availability of more PPEs, which are in short supply across the country.“I want to assure the doctors that the government is with you. I am personally pursuing the supply of sufficient PPE for the doctors. I am in touch with suppliers, manufacturers. I have also requested industrialists to donate PPEs for the doctors, instead of the donation in the CM relief fund,” Kejriwal said.Sarin — the head of the medical committee — suggested that people with businesses overseas should donate PPE kits to manage the disease. “Many people are donating food to the poor, but the government is already making arrangements for that. What we really need are PPE kits and I would suggest all those who have businesses overseas buy the kits there and ship it to government here as a goodwill gesture,” said Sarin.Hospital infrastructure On the positive side of planning, however, the Delhi government has ramped up its health infrastructure dedicated to Covid-19 cases.It has declared five of its tertiary care hospitals — Lok Nayak hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital, and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital — as dedicated Covid-19 facilities. This will earmark at least 5,850 beds for the management of Covid-19 patients in Delhi, officials said. These hospitals are working on moving their non-Covid-19 patients to secluded building or other facilities. The AIIMS trauma centre, with 250 beds and around 100 ventilators, has also been dedicated for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. All the trauma cases are now being redirected to the main AIIMS campus.The Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur already has 400 beds for Covid-19 patients and is adding another 100 in the next few days. There are 25 ventilators in the hospital. “We had stopped our elective procedure and started discharging people who were getting better. Now, we have very few non-Covid-19 cases in the hospital and they will be discharged soon too,” said an official from the hospital administration.The Lok Nayak hospital has shifted its out-patient clinics to a separate orthopaedics block, the medical emergency facilities to a separate new emergency block, and surgical emergency facilities to its Sushruta Trauma Centre in Civil Lines. “The hospital has dedicated 35 ventilators for Covid-19 patients currently; we need ventilators for our emergency cases too. There are about 88 ventilators at GB Pant hospital that can also be used later on when the numbers go up,” said Dr JC Passey, medical director of the Lok Nayak campus.Countries across the world, where cases have spiked, have struggled with providing ventilators for those with severe symptoms. But the medical committee advising the government believes that there are enough ventilators in the city for now.“We had estimated that around 32 ventilators will be needed when Delhi starts getting 100 cases a day. Right now, Delhi has over 100 cases but only two people are on ventilators. There are 306 ventilators in government facilities and 800 in private facilities, even if some are reserved for routine and emergency procedures, we have enough,” said Sarin.In terms of personnel, hospitals have made arrangements for the stay of their Covid-19 staff, with healthcare workers from Lok Nayak getting accommodation at Lalit hotel and staff of GTB hospital at Leela hotel. For effective utilisation of staff and PPEs, the government has started a 14-day shift system — healthcare staff will work for 10 and 14-hour shifts for 14 days before quarantining in the hospital allocated isolation facilities.Testing capabilityBut even if the infrastructure for a limited number of cases is slowly being put in place, there remains uncertainty over how many people in the city actually have the infection — and that is because of the low rates of testing. Kejriwal has requested the central government for more test kits. The Centre, for its part, has maintained that only 36% of its testing capabilities are being used currently.There is also a lag of two to three days in receiving reports. In Delhi, where authorities began screening people from Nizamuddin Markaz around March 26, the first six cases were officially reported on March 29. The next 18 tested positive a day later. According to Delhi government’s health bulletin, the reports of 441 samples were pending on March 28, 369 on March 29, and 332 on March 30. On Thursday, reports of 375 samples were awaited, many of which were from the symptomatic people taken out of the Markaz.“Right now we are testing about 4,000 to 5,000 people a day across the country. This is a very small number. My feeling is that Delhi alone should test about 3,000 people a day. Now that we have kits that can be manufactured indigenously, we should be more liberal with testing,” said S K Sarin.He added, somewhat ominously, “I think, by nature’s design, community transmission must have started — I would be very surprised if it hasn’t. The number of cases are likely to surge by next week.” Delhi and its citizens will be on test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capital-catching-up-to-handle-inevitable-spike/story-RLQo7uhY1rSj24s6DByyZJ.html
03-04-2020||Delhi||At Delhi coronavirus tracking hub, Markaz takes centre stage||“No entry from this gate due to Covid-19”. This note is stuck on the door of the four-room office in a Delhi government building in Laxmi Nagar. The door opens to the hub from where all coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city are tracked and containment plans are charted for the infected.So far, Covid-19 has infected 293 people in Delhi, of which four have died. An alarming 182 of these cases, including two deaths, are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters at the Markaz building in Nizamuddin Basti, which has emerged as the biggest coronavirus hot spot in the country over the past three days.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWith staff from other offices assisting the Covid-19 team as numbers swell, there are around 20 people here at any given time. They type out letters, official orders, and guidelines to be sent to health authorities; they call nodal officers in Covid-19 hospitals and quarantine facilities for an update on the number of vacant beds; and they make arrangements for resources that may be needed in the wake of a possible rise in cases.This is also where the lists of positive cases and the people they might have come in contact is generated. These lists are then sent to teams in all the 11 districts of Delhi over e-mail and WhatsApp to arrange home visits and calls or what is referred to as “community surveillance”. If the contacts have developed symptoms, they are transported to isolation facilities in dedicated Covid-19 ambulances for testing. There are five computers in the office, several files and lists are arranged in piles, and geospatial maps of all cases are pinned up on walls to aid the officers.The biggest task the authorities have at the moment is finding the people who might have left the Nizamuddin Markaz building before they started testing people there on March 25. “We did not get a list of all those who had been in the Markaz but left before the operations to vacate the premises started. However, our teams are going to mosques around the city to check whether they have anyone who had been at the Markaz living with them,” said an official from Delhi’s health department who asked not to be named.The surveillance teams also keep an eye on the amount of food being prepared at these establishment to see whether there may be several people living in the same compound.The district surveillance officer takes down a detailed travel history of anyone infected, trying to figure out if the source was someone they came in contact with, or if they passed on the infection to someone else. The teams – comprising of staff from dispensaries -- then visit houses in the vicinity of the patients to see if any of their contacts are showing symptoms. All the contacts are asked to self-quarantine at home, and are placed on community surveillance.Officials from the district magistrate’s office have now been roped in for surveillance. “If we find that the address provided is wrong or the people no longer live there, then we send the list of the people to the district magistrate’s office. They take the help of the police to find these people and bring them to quarantine facilities if need be,” said a second official from Delhi’s health department. The officials also keep in touch with their counterparts from other states for tip-offs on Delhi residents who might have come in contact with positive patients from other states. Alerts from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu & Kashmir and Andoman & Nicobar are what prompted the state authorities to first inspect the Markaz building last week.All the hospitals in the city with isolation facilities for Covid-19 patients also have a nodal officer who sends updates to the office in Laxmi Nagar as soon as someone tests positive. The Delhi government has declared five of its hospitals -- Lok Nayak, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Guru Teg Bahadur, and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality – as designated Covid-19 centres. The five hospitals, when fully converted to Covid-19 centres, will have at least 5,850 beds for the patients.There are also 75 isolation beds in Safdarjung Hospital, at least 32 beds at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, and over 100 beds in the AIl India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Jhajjar campus for Covid-19 cases. The AIIMS trauma centre, with 250 beds and 100 ventilators, has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility. Another key area the Laxmi Nagar office tracks is testing. It receives real-time updates from government centres and, most importantly, eight private labs across the city authorised to test Covid-19 patients. “Since these are patients who are not under our surveillance, our team is immediately sent to their home to take history and start contact tracing,” according to a third official. The data is shared with the state health minister and the chief minister every day. The officials from the hospitals, the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP), and other government departments, also have regular meetings with the ministers to track the number of infections and preparedness measures.The ministers and health secretary, in turn, are in touch with the central government for requirements such as PPE kits, testing kits, and viral transport medium needed to collect samples.As of now, the health department, and by extension the Laxmi Nagar anti-Covid hub, is on high alert to track people people across the city who might have come in contact with those from the Nizamuddin Markaz building. “Many more will test positive,” says a fourth official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-delhi-virus-tracking-hub-markaz-takes-centre-stage/story-V5yOx7oW2uHJ0dLIc1MkSI.html
03-04-2020||Noida||Covid-19: Greater Noida authority intensifies sanitisation drives in villages||The Greater Noida authority on Thursday said it has intensified sanitisation drives in villages after a woman tested positive for Covid-19 in Patwari village on Wednesday. The authority has been disinfecting public places such as markets, government offices including its administrative building (in Sector Knowledge Park 4), hotels, footpaths and other common areas in group housings and urban areas since March 17. It had earlier disinfected some villages adjoining urban areas but has now intensified sanitisation drives in all public spaces in villages after a woman was detected positive for the infection in Patwari village in Greater Noida West. “We are disinfecting all public spaces such as banks, markets, and other spaces. The motive is to ensure that Covid-19 does not spread further is and contained properly,” Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority said.A 30-year-old woman who worked as a domestic help in Greater Noida’s Sector 2 group housing tested positive for Covid-19. She contracted the infection from a Covid-19 positive patient whose house she worked at. This is the first case detected in a village, officials said. As of Thursday evening, Gautam Budh Nagar district has 48 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) out of which 6 persons have recovered and discharged. The officials fear that if Covid -19 spreads in rural areas then containing it will not be easy in comparison to urban areas, where people live in nuclear families, said officials. In villages, people live in joint families and every village is densely populated and an outbreak will throw a lot of challenges before the authorities, they added.The authority has so far disinfected villages such as Patwari, Kanarsi, Bal Ki Madiyan, Visayach, Patla, Haibatpur, Gharbara, Kulipura, Malakpur, Chhachula, Shahberi, Sadopur, Manikpur, Jaitpur, and Milak. There are a total 124 villages in Greater Noida’s jurisdiction and the authority wants to disinfect all of them at the earliest, said officials.“We are mixing sodium hypochlorite in water, filling it in fire tenders, and then sprinkling it at public spaces. Earlier we were using only water tankers. But now we have started using fire tenders to finish the job in less time,” a Greater Noida authority official said.The Greater Noida authority has also appealed to people to come together to distribute essential services to those lost access to food and essential supplies amid the lockdown and are living at construction sites, slums.To provide food to daily-wage labourers and construction workers, the authority has already started a “hunger line” at 8595567809. Any construction labourer or dependent who is living in the city and does not have access to food can call the helpline and seek help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-authority-intensifies-sanitisation-drives-in-villages/story-vqCB3X69nqqLyua9WXzvDI.html
03-04-2020||Delhi||Firefighters sanitise Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, nearby areas in Nizamuddin||Firefighters on Thursday sprayed thousands of gallons of disinfectant in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin and adjoining areas, which has emerged as the single-largest source of the Covid-19 across India. A six-storey building — the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters — has emerged as the biggest Covid-19 hot spot in India so far, with at least 182 people from there testing positive for Covid-19 in the Capital alone, and more than 500 in hospital for showing Covid-like symptoms. More than 1,800 people who attended the congregation have been placed in quarantine in the city.Senior officers from the fire department said that Nizamuddin is the first hotspot that they were tasked to sanitise and the exercise will be carried out in other parts of the city as well, if required.Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service (DFS), said on Thursday that his team had sanitised the building (markaz) in Nizamuddin, the lanes surrounding the building and other adjoining residential areas. “We sprayed at least two fire trucks full of disinfectants. One fire tender usually carries around 10,000 litres of water mixed with sodium hypochlorite. On Thursday, we sprayed at least 5,000 gallons of disinfectants,” he said.Garg added that they even sprayed disinfectant on the shutters of shut shops, footpaths, walls, parked vehicles and other buildings in the vicinity. On Wednesday, in a meeting with the chief secretary and top bureaucrats in Delhi, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had directed that the fire department be used in carrying out a disinfection drive in Covid-19 hotspot clusters, quarantine centres and vulnerable public places in the city.Garg said that even though their department is handling such a situation for the first time, they are fully prepared. “We were tasked with disinfecting large localities as we are better equipped to do so. We have never faced such a situation before, but we are prepared to deal with it. Everyday, we will be tasked with sanitising such hotspots until the situation is brought under control. At present we have four dedicated teams, each having one fire tender. If need be, more teams will be pressed into action. Also, since we use heavy pressure to sprinkle disinfectants, we can do it while maintaining a safe distance,” Garg said, adding that his men have been provided with adequate safety gears.The Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area, and two lanes leading to it, had been sealed earlier, after 2,346 people were evacuated from there in India’s biggest coronavirus (Covid-19)-related rescue operation that lasted 36 hours.The evacuees were sent to quarantine centres and hospitals, even as officials across the country scrambled to identify, trace and isolate people who attended a congregation at the headquarters, which was held last month.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that more than 500 symptomatic persons evacuated from the building have been admitted to hospitals. Besides, 1,810 asymptomatic people have been put in quarantine facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/firefighters-sanitise-tablighi-jamaat-headquarters-nearby-areas-in-nizamuddin/story-Xe0StaFlZvUSdYDdp8FOJM.html
03-04-2020||Delhi||Sanitation workers raise concern over safety, demand screenings||With Nizamuddin and Dilshad Garden emerging as the Covid-19 hot spots in Delhi, and more quarantine facilities being developed across the city, sanitation workers have raised concerns about their safety.The Akhil Bhartiya Safai Majdoor Sangh, an association of sanitation workers, has demanded they be provided more effective protective gear, along with regular screenings of sanitation workers and their families.On Thursday, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said it will start screening staff deployed in Nizamuddin, home to the Tablighi Jammat’s headquarters. As many as 182 who had attended an event in the Muslim missionary organisations headquarters or visited the markaz, have tested positive in Delhi.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWith close around 40-50 sanitation workers deployed in Nizamuddin and a similar number in Dilshad Garden, Sanjay Gehlot, president Akhil Bhartiya Safai Majdoor Sangh, said sanitation employees work at the forefront and, as a result, are prone to be infected with the highly contagious virus.“The civic bodies should check the roster and identify those who have worked in hot spot zones. Such employees and their families should immediately be screened for the coronavirus to prevent it spreading. Though no symptoms of coronavirus have been seen in sanitation employees or other ground staff working in hot spots, we should not wait for a disaster to take preventive measures,” Gehlot said.A senior SDMC official said the civic body was “concerned” about its workers and all necessary steps would be taken.“So far, no symptoms of Covid-19 have been observed in sanitation workers. We will screen these workers in two or three days,” the official said.Also Read: 17 companies asked to help meet 38mn unit PPE shortfallWith the markaz evacuated, the SDMC on Thursday started an extensive drive to sanitise neighbouring areas. It used drones to spray disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite solution) in Nizamuddin East, Nizamuddin Basti and surrounding areas. The drones conducted 18 rounds, of 20 minutes each, of disinfecting operations, an official said. Apart from this, 40 teams of public health workers deployed for cleaning and sprinkling disinfectants to sanitise the whole area. Nearly 10,000 litre disinfectant was used in the drive on Thursday.With the Delhi government setting up more quarantine facilities in the city to cater to the increasing number of suspected and confirmed cases, the three civic agencies are deploying their staff at these centres.But sanitation workers said they are not being provided proper protective gear. Gehlot said everyday 25 sanitation employees are sent to work in quarantine facility developed at Mandoli Jail Complex in Nand Nagri but many of them were discharging their duties in the absence of personal protective equipments (PPE). “In the name of protective gears the sanitation employees have been given substandard quality of masks and gloves and many of the worker lack even these materials. I have convened several meetings with the authorities of the three municipalities but to no avail,” he said.There are around 71,345 sanitation workers engaged with three municipal corporations — North Delhi Municipal Corporation, EDMC and SDMC. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has 31,332 sanitation workers, EDMC has 15,023 sanitation employees while there are 25,00 sanitation employees working with the SDMC.Lokesh Kumar, a sanitation employee working in Dilshad Garden hotspot area, which comes under East Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that the authorities have not yet provided him with PPE kit. “In the name of protective gears we have been given low quality masks and gloves. These masks become useless only after two hours of work. So I is like working without any protection amid the pandemic,” Kumar said.The EDMC spokesperson said that as per standard guidelines testing for COVID-19 would be done only when the symptoms are seen in any person. “None of our sanitation staff has shown symptoms so till now there is no need to conduct COVID-19 tests. Forceful screening for COVID-19 will only create extra burden on already scarce system,” he said. The official added that PPE kits were primarily meant for the doctors, paramedic staff other workers engaged in hospitals treating COVID- 19. The sanitation staff has already been provided with essential items such as gloves and masks along with special training to perform their duties in affected areas without getting infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sanitation-workers-raise-concern-over-safety-demand-screenings/story-h3sr4jiXjTNl7ytyMXRWgK.html
03-04-2020||Noida||Uber ties up with Big Basket for deliveries in Noida, Greater Noida||Private cab aggregator, Uber, has tied up with e-tailer Big Basket to provide a last-mile delivery option of essential services to residents of Noida and Greater Noida, among other Indian cities.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration had allowed several online service providers to continue working during the ongoing nationwide lockdown.Uber will now provide several of its vehicles to help Big Basket make deliveries of essential items to consumers.“This last-mile delivery service provides multiple wins. It supports authorities in containing Covid-19, delivers essential supplies in a timely manner and creates an earning opportunity for drivers.

03-04-2020||Mumbai||Is your body fighting Covid-19 symptoms? Blood test to tell in 5 mins||With Covid-19 positive cases continuing to soar in Maharashtra, the state government plans to start “rapid” blood tests to ascertain in less than five minutes if you have the antibodies that are fighting the Sars-Cov-2, even if you are asymptomatic. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said they will soon start random “mass testing” to ascertain the number of people infected with the virus. It is not officially a test for Covid-19, which detects the virus based on its genetic material, as a person who tests positive will have to undergo the swab test and be quarantined.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Besides the government testing facilities in Maharashtra, seven private laboratories are allowed to test for Covid-19. Now with the antibody test, the state government aims to get an indicative figure of the number of people attacked by the virus, even if they are not showing symptoms.Tope said the state got a go-ahead from the Centre to start the “rapid” antibody tests on Thursday and agencies will be given the task to carry out the tests. “Rapid test is an important decision taken today. Through the test, we will get a primary report or will be able to screen a person in less than five minutes. It is an important step for mass screening. If we get to know the total number through these rapid tests, we will quarantine or keep the people in isolation and start further treatment,” Tope said.The immune system fights a virus by making antibodies also known as immunoglobulins. It combats the infection by preventing the virus from entering the cells. They remain in the bloodstream even if a particular virus is cleared. This is to protect the person to encounter the same virus again. As antibodies are specific to a particular virus, the antibody test will help the state identify such people, said a senior health official.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said, “The antibody test will be conducted to see IgG and IgM levels in the body. We will start it from those being quarantined and exposed to coronavirus patients.” It has become necessary as more than 80% of the positive patients were found asymptomatic, which means they were showing no symptoms despite being infected, officials pointed out.A senior Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation official, however, said they could take up the testing on a “pilot” level with a group of around 100 to 200 people.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  “We will not use the test with patients or high-risk contacts of the positive. This is just to check the resistance power of the person against the infection,” the official said.“Once the antibody test is positive, the person is corona positive. Swab test, which is precise and a confirmatory test, will be done simultaneously along with the treatment,” said Dr Anup Kumar Yadav, director of National Health Mission (NHM).Tope said the cost of the test could be around ₹300-₹400. He further said that the rapid tests can be conducted by the government and private agencies who have the permission of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “We can also partner with some companies that conduct rapid testing. The government may also appoint some agencies, which has the permission of ICMR, for conducting rapid tests,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/is-your-body-fighting-sars-cov-2-sans-symptoms-blood-test-to-tell-in-5-mins/story-La5GwhObiW75EZ2hsgsUSL.html
03-04-2020||Mumbai||There was shortage of safety gear, says doctor who tested positive; recovers||Of the 10 confirmed cases of Sars-Cov-2 in Gurugram city, nine have recovered. One among them is 35-year-old Dr Sheenam, a resident of Sector 9 who is also the nodal officer at the Covid-19 sample collection lab at Sector 10 Civil Hospital, who tested positive on March 20 after she began handling a series of suspected cases from the first week of March.“I had to be admitted to a private hospital on March 21 after testing positive for Covid-19. Leaving my eight-month-old son and husband behind was not easy,” said Sheenam, who was disheartened to see her family disturbed. “They were tested too. Thankfully, they were found negative and are under home quarantine,” she said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSheenam’s role was to ensure proper collection of samples, sealing them and sending them to the lab for testing. According to her, she ensured she maintained social distancing while coordinating with the suspected cases and the physicians who took samples. She is, however, believed to have contracted the virus while interacting with a Covid-19 patient in the isolation ward of the civil hospital, in the absence of protective gear. “I had to meet a Covid-19 positive patient who was admitted to the isolation ward of the civil hospital. The patient was a bit disturbed. At that time, I was wearing a mask, gloves, and an apron. We did not have sufficient stock of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). There was an inadequate supply of safety kits. It was a risk and my bad luck that I too got the virus,” she said, adding that the issue of safety kits for the health staff has been resolved now.Also Read:17 companies asked to help meet 38mn unit PPE shortfallIt was two days after addressing the patient that Sheenam started showing symptoms such as fever and diarrhea. She thought it was due to the food she had eaten at a meeting some time back. “Knowing the symptoms of Covid-19, I consulted another doctor who asked me to get tested for coronavirus,” she said.On March 19, Sheenam gave her samples and on the night of March 20, the test result declared her Covid-19 positive.She says she shifted to a different room of the house the moment she got to know of the result. Her husband changed the bed sheet, wiped the floor and took every precautionary step, keeping in mind the safety of their infant son.Also Read: Sanitation workers raise concern over safety, demand screenings“The next morning, I left for the hospital to get admitted in the isolation ward,” she said. Meanwhile, the health department took samples of the 12-15 staff members who had worked with her, all of whom tested negative.For Sheenam and her husband, a bigger challenge – taking care of the baby who was still breastfeeding – awaited. Most of Sheenam’s time was spent talking to her husband who was single-handedly taking care of the toddler.“For my husband, it was difficult to understand why the baby was cranky. During the video calls with him, I told him how to prepare the baby food, prepared a daily routine as to when the baby had to be fed and his sleeping hours,” said Sheenam, praising her husband for doing a commendable job during his home quarantine.Her neighbours too stood for support by providing her husband with meals every day. “My husband does not know how to cook. So, my neighbours used to provide meals,” she said.However, the attitude of many in her locality was discouraging, too. “Society people were writing to our neighbours asking them not to help us lest they contract the virus. People started harassing my husband who was under home quarantine,” she said. The family had to call the police to counsel people in the society after facing ill-treatment.“It is surprising to see that these people, who were once negative, are appreciating us now that I am discharged from the hospital. I don’t know how honest their reactions are,” said Dr Sheenam, who was discharged on Wednesday and is under 14-day home quarantine before she takes over the charge of the lab again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/risks-in-absence-of-safety-kits-gurugram-doc-who-recovered-recalls-experience/story-JHKLMRV1tKduf5GtlMNH5H.html
03-04-2020||Delhi||Management of gurdwara in Majnu Ka Tila booked||Police on Thursday registered a case against the management of the gurdwara in Majnu Ka Tila for violating prohibitory orders and the 21-day lockdown norms, after 227 persons from Punjab were evacuated from there on Wednesday to prevent the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19. They were later shifted to two quarantine centres in the city.On Tuesday night, the police had received information regarding a gathering of around 300 people at the gurdwara in Majnu ka Tila. Upon confirming the information, the Delhi government was intimated and 227 migrants, who were from Punjab, but working in Delhi-NCR, were evacuated on Wednesday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicPolice said the first information report (FIR) has been registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.“The FIR was registered following the instructions of the Delhi government since the gurdwara committee did not inform the police or the concerned subdivisional magistrate about the mass gathering of people at the gurdwara. The management officials violated the government orders that banned the gathering of five or more people in any place to avoid the spread of the coronavirus,” a senior police officer, on condition of anonymity, said.The officer said none of the 227 rescued persons showed symptoms of the Covid-19 infection when tested by doctors at the gurdwara. A Delhi government official said all evacuees are being made to undergo a screening and their samples are being collected for coronavirus testing.“There were chances of people getting infected, as maintaining social distancing was not possible at the religious place. The management committee should have informed the police or government authorities and got the migrants staying at the gurdwara isolated,” the officer added.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said, “This is a desperate attempt to malign the services done by Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committe and the Sikhs across India and the world. What was our fault? We did not organise any religious gathering or congregation at the gurdwara. Those staying there were all stranded migrants.” “Through tweets and videos I had requested the Punjab and Delhi government to help those migrants. Blame us if we were doing anything illegal. Moreover, it is the same gurdwara, which we had offered to the Delhi goverment a fortnight ago to use it as a quarantine centre to fight coronavirus outbreak. Instead of shifting 200 plus migrants to schools, they should have been isolated in the bigger halls at the gurdwara itself,” Sirsa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fir-against-majnu-ka-tila-gurdwara-mgmt-for-housing-227-persons-in-violation-of-prohibitory-order/story-9VKCAud4OdU6eg5YkmOBkI.html

03-04-2020||Pune||At least 15,800 construction labourers provided with food in Pune at work sites||Additional labour commissioner, Pune division, Shailendra B Pol, has said that mid-day meals were being delivered by the government to about 15,850 workers at 95 construction sites in the city. At many work sites, dinner was being taken care of by the member builders of Confederation of Real Estate Developers of India (Credai, Pune chapter). For almost a week, the workers were being provided with their meals and asked not to rush back to their villages, Credai, Pune said. Badri Alam Khan 23, a native of Jharkhand who is working as a fitter at the Kohinooor Sapphire site, said, “I could not go back to my village because of this lockdown but it’s OK. We get food from the builder and the ‘thekedaar’ has given me Rs 1,000 per week for small expenses and essentials that I may need.” Sangita Dhruv from Chhattisgarh who waters the slabs with her husband Krishna and 18-year-old daughter Choti, said, “I have two younger daughters back home and I worry about them. We get food here and our needs are looked after. But what about my girls? I asked the contractor for some money to send home to my other two children. He gave me Rs 3,000 and I have sent it home.”Suhas Merchant, president, Credai Pune said, “When the 21-day lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, many migrant workers started fleeing the city, overcrowding the railway stations and bus stops. But we made an attempt to stop that.”While he estimated that about 50,000 workers had stayed back in the city, Pol said, the labour commissionerate’s estimate was about 15,800. Satish Magar, former president, Credai and managing director, Magarpatta, said while it was good that the government was providing mid-day meals to labourers, no provision had been made for dinner.“We have been supplying food from day 1 to all our workers and their family members. Which is why none of them have left for their villages,” he said. JP Shroff who heads Credai’s labour committee said, “The government used to provide mid-day meals to about 10,000 workers before the lockdown was announced. However soon after the lockdown was announced it was temporarily shut down. We decided that our people could not be left to starve.”Over the eight days of the lockdown, Credai managed to procure rice, dal (lentils), atta (flour), oil, masalas (spices) from the wholesale market and delivered it to about 20,000 workers and their families at 100 sites. “The task of delivery was a huge challenge since there was no transport available. No trucks to carry food to our labourers on these sites,” Merchant said. Member-builders of Credai were roped in to provide their on-site trucks, tempos and drivers. “We also asked some transporters to assist us with drivers. Only then were we able to deliver food packets to the 100 odd sites,” he said. To manage the logistics of this initiative, some of the builders sent their staffers to certain central points like Hinjewadi and Ahmednagar road from where the food packets could be collected and delivered to individual member sites. “Over seven days, Credai spent approximately Rs 25 lakh on food,” Merchant said. A week later, the government announced that it would provide mid-day meals to construction workers. Additional labour commissioner Pol said Credai was asked to provide the number of labourers at various sites. “They gave us a number of 50,000 workers in Pune. But on day 1 when we went with the food packets, we saw that where they said there were 150 workers, there were only 40 to 50. I appeal to all builders to please report the correct numbers to us so that food does not get wasted,” he said.On Thursday, the labour commissionerate delivered 15,836 packets at 95 sites. Atul Goel of Goel Ganga Group, said his estimate was that there were about 470 workers on his project sites along with family members, which meant, additional 250 to 300 more. “We have been supplying them with food and sanitation material on a weekly basis. We already have brought stock for 25 days and will continue to do so,” he said. At builder Vineet Goyal’s sites, (Kohinoor Group) about 1,200 of the 2,000 workers had left for their villages before the lockdown. “Another 200 moved in with their relatives in-and-around the city. As a result, we now have 600 workers, which includes family members at our three live sites. We are providing them food grains on a weekly basis and making their payments every fortnight. In fact, the contractor told me not to pay them monthly as they would probably spend the money given the time they have on their hands. However, given the situation, we have released payment to the contractor in advance for them to take care of his labour.” Raj Bhansali of Clover Builders said he has tied up with a local grocery store near his projects at Kharadi and Undri. “These stores deliver to the labourers what they need to them and we pay for it. Their salaries are paid on the fifth of every month and they will be paid on the fifth,” he said. Credai appeals for police pass to visit labour campsCredai has appealed to the police commissioner to give each member a pass to visit their sites where the workers are living. Suhas Merchant, president, Credai, said, “Our workers are going through a trying time. It is important that someone from our office is there to look after their needs, besides counsel them on safety and hygiene. Currently, it is very difficult for our supervisors to visit various sites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/about-15-800-construction-labour-provided-with-food-in-pune-at-work-sites/story-EInWNtQ8EcbbzowVrTzX8K.html

The stretch on the Pune-Satara highway has turned into garbage dumping zone since the last few days. With the country under lockdown, people are spending time at home, but residents of Katraj are dumping garbage near the road. “Since the last one week, most of the ghat section has been stinking due to the garbage thrown on both sides of the road. I have seen people from nearby areas and Katraj throw garbage while passing through the ghat. As the ghat section doesn’t comes under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) jurisdiction, many people go and throw their garbage there,” said Rakesh Pangare, a resident of Katraj.When HT visited the ghat section it was found that the space was littered with not only household garbage, but also construction debris, thermocol waste, plastic materials, liquor bottles, among others. When contacted Dnyaneshwar Molak, Pune Municipal Corporation, solid waste management department head, said, “Though the Katraj ghat section doesn’t comes under our jurisdiction, residents living in PMC limits should not throw garbage while passing the ghat section. Our PMC cleanliness workers are working round the clock to keep the city clean, and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) under whose jurisdiction the ghat section comes, have the responsibility of cleaning the garbage. They have plans to start a garbage processing plant for villages in that area which needs to be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/residents-turn-katraj-ghat-road-into-garbage-dumping-ground/story-yDjfh8c04445UrkutcFLAJ.html

Souriio Hilter, advisor to the North East Community Organisation of Pune, said,“Most of the people are stranded in their hostels. They need essential supplies as they are running out of money. Most banks in the North East have closed and their parents are finding it difficult to send money. Some students may have to vacate their premises.

Seeing their plight, Sarhaad Foundation had opened up a dedicated helpline with the help of NGO Vande Mataram Sanghtana.“Most of the students relied on their dining mess for food. However, after those got closed, it has become difficult for them to get food. A few students said that even some of the colleges where they were studying were unable to help them with food,” Nahar said. The students were being provided with food and other esseintials, said Sachin Jamge of Vande Mataram Sanghtana.The social organisations plan to open 15 to 20 centres in the city to provide assistance, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-helpline-for-people-from-northeast-set-up-in-pune/story-6PZov70NmSsOLxDXI4DhZK.html

03-04-2020||Pune||Families of 300 construction workers wait for food at Undri, Kondwa||Almost 250 families at Shivnerinagar in Kondhwa and 50 families at a construction site in Undri were found to be facing severe food shortage and paucity of other essentials due to the lockdown. A visit to the spot revealed that the construction workers were living in near penury without any rations. Najmul Hasan who hails from Uttar Pradesh and worked at the Undri construction site said, “We are not getting food and our families are hungry. We need rations for at least a month if we are to survive in these dangerous times. We got food from the contractor only once and the rest is the minimum ration that we have bought on our own,” he said .Navnath Kamble, another worker said, “We have neither money nor work. There is very less to eat and none of the government servants have bothered to visit us.” The labour camp of 250 families in Shivnerinagar in Kondhwa gave an impression of neglect and apathy. Social worker Saleem Mulla said, “The people here don’t have anything to eat so we have approached the public and social organisations to donate. For the past four days, nearly 750 persons are being fed per day and our rations won’t last long.

The police have identified one suspect in the case, said officials.According to police, the man tried to break into multiple medical stores in Chinchwad.

03-04-2020||Pune||Covid-19: 10 lakh metric tonnes standing cane crop hit by shortage of workers||The 21-day nation-wide lockdown has hit the sugar industry adversely in Maharashtra with an inordinate delay in the harvesting of almost 10 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane. This has jeopardised the production of more than one lakh metric tonnes of sugar, state sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao said. According to the commissionerate, Maharashtra has a total of 173 sugar factories with the annual crushing of 518 lakh metric tonnes of cane and sugar production of 8 lakh tonnes.At village Avasari Budruk, cane farmers from Manchar in Pune have been unable to send their harvest to the Bhimashankar Co-operative sugar factory due to the absence of farm labour.Farmer Baban Hinge said in a telephonic interview, “Our sugarcane usually goes to factory in 14 or 15 months, but this time, the crop has not been harvested even after almost 16 months. The factory said they are unable to send to send farm labour for harvesting.”Another farmer, Sambhaji Hinge said the delay in harvesting would adversely affect the sugar recovery by almost 30 to 40 percent. “This is a direct loss to us,” he said, adding that the crop had begun to deteriorate.Ambegaon (Pune district)-based , Bhimashankar Co-operative sugar factory’s chairman Balasaheb Bende said, “Almost 35,000 metric tonnes of sugarcane was waiting to be cut. We have announced incentives to the labourers to cut the sugarcane under this panic situation. A section of the labourers went home just before the lockdown was announced.” Maharashtra Sugar Commissioner Saurabh Rao said that 10 lakh metric tonnes sugarcane was standing in the fields and 18 sugar factories were yet to complete their cane crushing operations for the season. “We are putting in all efforts to ensure that this sugarcane would get cut as soon as possible and sent to the sugar factories.”He said that a sizeable section of the cane harvesting labour fled to their villages due to the panic caused by the Covid-19 pandemic affecting cane harvesting. In view of the lockdown, factories have been advised not to allow labourers to leave their locations and make the necessary arrangements for food and shelter. “If this 10 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane is crushed, more 1 lakh metric tonnes sugar would be produced,” he said. Action against sugar factories for not taking care of farm labourMaharashtra sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao said that all sugar factories in the state have been asked to take care of the cane harvesting labour and not allow them to return to their villages during the lockdown period.“Only 18 factories are working as of now. The labourers are trying to return to their homes but the police and local authorities are requesting them to stay at the factory where they would be provided with food and shelter. Rao said that police complaints are in the process of being filed against two factories in Karad and Kolhapur for allowing their labour to return home and not making arrangements for their extended stay during the lockdown period. “The labourers themselves want to leave as they feel that home is safer,” he said. Bhimashankar Co-operative sugar factory’s chairman Balasabheb Bende said that although they have made all the necessary arrangements for their labour, “we are helpless if they try and run away at night.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-crushing-of-10-lakh-tonnes-of-cane-hit-due-to-absence-of-farm-labour/story-cxS5YJLWadnLZb3CVz9j9O.html

During the lockdown, Dhuri is making sure that her fitness does not suffer and is devoting much of her time to studies. Dhuri who stays at Nanded City on Sinhgad road describes her daily routine.Morning session I maintain my habit of waking up early in the morning at 6am, then, I have milk and exercise for 1 hour and 30 minutes. It starts with warm-up exercises then squats, lunges, burpees, push-ups, pull-ups, jumping jacks and even suryanamaskar at home. Usually after this, my action shifts to the pool at Harmony Health Club, Kothrud, but due to the lockdown, pools are shut, so, I prefer to help my mother with household chores – cleaning and sweeping. I miss my swimming sessions and teammates a lot.Afternoon sessionOnce the lunch is done, I take a nap for 30 minutes and then, it is study time. I am currently a second year Bachelor of commerce student at the Marathwada Mitramandal College of Commerce and as my exams have been postponed, I am devoting a lot of time for studies. What I have planned is that swimming practice is off, my focus is on studies and once, my normal routine starts, I can focus more on swimming, rather than been stressed about the exams.Evening sessionIn the evening, I train and do exercises on the elastic bands. Once all the exercises are done, I sketch, paint or spend my time watching something on Netflix. Once dinner is done, we play ludo or cards as everyone is at home. Usually we don’t get to spend time together and play games, so we are using this lockdown time for our daily get together. I am enjoying the family time a lot. Workout at home As the gyms are closed I workout at home. I focus on core strengthening exercises and some stretching exercises. Hobby:I love to sketch and paint and daily, I spare a little time for my hobbies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-swimming-sessions-on-hold-due-to-lockdown-this-khelo-india-star-and-sppu-student-has-a-watertight-plan-for-studies/story-yf9dxcHYTytDTCUm2CTlJI.html

He is the sixth Indian to die of the respiratory disease in the country so far and the youngest as well.“The deceased was a patient of kidney disease and died on Saturday morning before his report came positive for coronavirus late in the evening,” Sanjay Kumar, Bihar’s principal secretary (health), said.The senior official said that the man had flown from Qatar to Kolkata and travelled by train to Bihar 15 days ago. He added that he had developed some kidney problem and was admitted to a private hospital in Munger. He came to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and was admitted to AIIMS-P later.Kumar confirmed that another woman, a 45-year-old resident of Patna whose son had travelled to Italy, has also tested positive for Sar-Cov-2, as the new coronavirus has been named.“There was some misinformation in the morning. The woman who has tested positive has no travel history but her son had returned from Italy earlier this month,” said Kumar.“He was put in quarantine and his sample had tested negative. We will test his sample again since his mother has tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.Kumar said the woman had been admitted to the AIIMS, Patna and was put in isolation. “We expect to get by evening the test report of another Covid-19 suspect, who returned from Scotland, and has been put in isolation at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH),” added Kumar.These are the first positive cases from Bihar, which had not reported a single patient so far.“We have so far received 129 samples and tested 88 of which two have turned positive of Covid-19,” Dr Pradeep Das, director of the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), said.RMRIMS is the only institute approved by the Centre for testing samples for Sar-Cov-2 in Bihar.India has reported that 341 people have been infected with the virus so far.The first victim to die of coronavirus was a 76-year-old man from Karnataka’s Kalburgi who succumbed on March 11 while being transported from one hospital to another. His samples tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 on March 13.It was followed by the death of a 68-year-old woman from Delhi. She had contracted the infection from her son who had returned from abroad and the third death was reported from Mumbai on March 17, when a 64-year old succumbed to the disease at Kasturba Hospital in the city.The fourth victim was a 70-year-old man who had arrived from Germany via Italy at Delhi airport on March 7 before heading to Punjab on the same day. He was a patient of diabetes and hypertension and was confirmed as Sars-Cov-2 positive just a day before his death on March 19.The fifth Indian to die due to Covid-19 was a 63-year-old man in Mumbai, who also had diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-death-due-to-covid-19-in-bihar-two-test-positive/story-K3qI8Ya84BA9YxEhMUxd1K.html
03-04-2020||Ranchi||Two months on, Ranchi’s ‘Shaheen Bagh’ stir suspended till April 5||The two-month long Ranchi’s Shaheen Bagh-like protest at Kadru area was suspended on Saturday till April 5 in view of the spreading coronavirus scare across the country. The women protesters took the decision following a meeting with three Jharkhand ministers on Friday evening.Parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam, finance minister Ramehswar Oraon and agriculture minister Badal Patralekh had called a delegation of protesting women on Friday evening at Alam’s office.Saheen Parween, a member of the delegation, said, “We have decided to suspend the ongoing dharna at Kadru till April 5 on request of the ministers.”“The ministers said Corona virus is spreading in India. In coming days, it might be declared as national or state disaster. They urged us to postpone the movement in interest of country as well as state so that people do not gather in large number in one place and coronavirus could be prevented from growing,” she said.Parween said they placed their demand before the Jharkhand ministers to pass a resolution in the ongoing assembly session against the National Population Register (NPR). “The ministers assured that the draft of the resolution is ready and it will be passed soon,” Parween said.She further said, “We will hold a meeting on April 5 to decide future course of action of our agitation. The protest will continue till it goes on in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh.”The women-led indefinite sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and NPR had started at Ranchi’s Kadru area, near Haj House, from January 20. The sit-in is inspired by the protest spearheaded by women at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, a Muslim neighbourhood near Jamia Millia Islamia, which has been continuing since December 15, 2019. In another development, all church related gatherings and liturgical services have been suspended by the Ranchi Catholic Archdiocese in view of the Corona virus threat.Auxiliary bishop of Ranchi Theodore Mascarenhas said that Holy Mass would continue to be celebrated in churches but the faithful were exempted from Sunday obligation during this period.He said that the temporary measures would come into effect from March 22 and would be in force till March 31.Meanwhile, Ranchi administration on Saturday has put an embargo on visit to Pahadi Temple, city’s one of the most visited religious place, for visitors with immediate effect. Pahadi temple is located on the 250-foot-high Pahadi Hill in the heart of Ranchi and was earlier known as Phansi Tongri, a place where freedom fighters were hung by the British.Ranchi deputy commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray, who is also the president of Ranchi Pahadi Mandir Vikas Samiti, has issued an order in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-months-on-ranchi-s-saheen-bagh-stir-suspended-till-april-5/story-iySb1fqguqmnKCgE4dUtgJ.html

The SDM has directed to kick start the centres with the available stock.“Besides, a doctor would be also available at each centre to advise a buyer whether his health condition requires a mask or not,” said the SDM, adding, these doctors at the centres would also inform the people how much a mask is essential, when one should wear it and for how long.Earlier in the day, the SDM held a marathon meeting with druggists association office bearers and stockists of districts to ensure availability of masks at the selected centres. Dhanbad civil surgeon Dr Gopal Das, superintendent of Patliputra Medical College Hospital (PMCH) Dr Arun Kumar Chaudhary and senior medical officer Dr Alok Viswakarma also attended the meeting.Dr Viswakarma said without mask it “does not mean we are exposed to the virus”. In fact, a mask is essential only for a coronavirus-positive patient and the doctor who treats him. However, it is also essential for people who live at crowded places.“Hand sanitiser is the major protection from coronavirus than a mask. Washing hands six times a day is the most common way to prevent a person from getting infected and stay safe,” said Dr Viswakarma.Sources said the plan earlier was to open a similar centre at PMCH also but due to heavy presence of patients, it has been cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/health-dept-opens-three-masks-sale-centres-in-dhanbad/story-OLZXc1It2AlG4sVi5o3ayH.html

All have been detained for three months under the Maintenance of Public Order ordinance.A press statement issued by the Pakistan government on Friday stated that it was“well aware of the facts of the judgement issued by the Honorable Sindh High Court in Daniel Pearl case, dated 2nd April 2020.”The statement added: “the Federal Government is concerned about the decision however, as per constitutional scheme of things prosecution in criminal matters is a provincial subject, therefore similar concern has been shared with the Government of Sindh.”It added “With reference to this, the Government of Sindh has decided to file an appeal next week against the said judgement in the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan in order to ensure that the ends of justice are met. Government of Pakistan has asked Government of Sindh to dedicate its best resources in the pursuance of appeal before the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan.”The statement said that the Government of Sindh “has been advised to consult the Attorney General for Pakistan in the matter as well. In the meantime, all the accused in the said case have been arrested and detained under Section 3(1) of the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960 for a period of 3 months pending filing of the appeal in the apex court. Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan reiterates its commitment to follow due process under the laws of the country to bring terrorists to task.”The move comes a day after the Sindh High Court on Thursday overturned the murder conviction of Ahmed Omer Saeed Sheikh and instead found Sheikh guilty of the lesser charge of kidnapping and sentenced him to seven years in prison.Saeed has already spent 18 years in prison on death row. The seven-year sentence was expected to be counted as time served, said Khawaja Naveed, his lawyer.A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha, announced the verdict on the appeals filed by the convicts 18 years ago after hearing arguments and examining the record and proceedings of the case.The SHC further dismissed an appeal of the state seeking enhancement of life term of three co-accused.While arguing the case, the lawyers for the appellants, Rai Bashir and Khawaja Naveed Ahmed, had submitted that the prosecution had miserably failed to prove its case against their clients beyond any reasonable doubt and prosecution witnesses were mostly policemen, whose testimonies could not be relied upon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-challenge-murder-conviction-overturned-in-daniel-pearl-case/story-w8Mtl2iRSiW47EaFk4cVTP.html

03-04-2020||World||Singapore to close schools, most workplaces with rising Covid-19 cases||Singapore will shutter schools and most workplaces as the city-state unveiled a raft of stricter measures intended as a “circuit breaker” to slow the spread of coronavirus.Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close starting on Tuesday, while the city-state will move to full home-based learning in its schools from Wednesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an address to the nation Friday afternoon. The government will also unveil additional stimulus measures to boost the economy early next week.The action comes as confirmed cases of local transmission and unlinked infections in the country have risen in recent weeks. “We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to preempt escalating infections,” said Lee.Here are other details of the stricter measures:The government also plans on Monday to announce more support aimed at businesses and households. Singapore delivered a second stimulus package worth S$48 billion ($33.5 billion) last week to fight the outbreak, drawing on national reserves for the first time since the global financial crisis to support an economy heading for recession.“Even if more assistance measures are announced on Monday, they are unlikely to offset the economic ramifications of what is akin to an economic immobilization,” Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, said in an email. Retail sales plunged 8.6% in February from the same time last year, marking the worst decrease since June and the 13th consecutive decline.‘Very Worrying’ TrendsLee said the spirit of these measures is to get people to minimize physical contact. “If we don’t go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus won’t be able to spread. It is as simple as that,” he said.Lawrence Wong, minister for national development who co-chairs a task force to fight the virus, said in a press conference the increase in the number of local and unlinked coronavirus cases are “very, very worrying trends.”The latest set of moves will continue for at least a month, Wong said, adding there’s a chance the government can roll back the measures by the end of the month if the guidelines are upheld. He said the key objective is to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly cutting the number of unlinked cases.“If there’s poor compliance, poor implementation, then we have to be prepared for these measures to continue,” Wong said. “Let’s hunker down and beat the virus together.”Singapore announced Friday a fifth person has died due to complications from the coronavirus. Cases have risen more sharply in March compared to earlier months, and now total more than 1,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-close-schools-most-workplaces-with-rising-covid-19-cases/story-8emP7OAfrZO5UBhIIoSy6K.html
03-04-2020||World||US unemployment rises to 4.4% in March amid coronavirus||The US economy shed 701,000 jobs in March amid the damage inflicted by the coronavirus shutdowns, while the unemployment rate surged to 4.4 percent, the Labor Department reported Friday.That was the worst job loss since March 2009 during the depths of the global financial crisis, and the biggest single-month jump in the jobless rate in more than 45 years, the report said.The leisure and hospitality sectors -- among the first to feel the impact of the travel restrictions -- lost 459,000 jobs, the report said.But notable losses also were recorded in healthcare, retail and businesses services.However, the Labor Department acknowledged it “cannot precisely quantify the effects of the pandemic on the job market in March.”The two surveys that make up the closely-watched government jobs report are taken during the week that includes the 12th of the month, which in March was before the worst of the lockdowns were imposed that closed businesses nationwide.“It is important to keep in mind that the March survey reference periods for both surveys predated many coronavirus-related business and school closures in the second half of the month,” the report said.In fact the Labor Department’s own weekly data on workers who file for unemployment benefits for the first time showed 10 million people lost their jobs in the last two weeks of the month.Even if it underestimates the true job losses, the payroll drop was far larger than economists had forecast, likely because government economists, in an effort to capture the virus impact on the labor market, changed how it classified individuals.The report said they counted workers as unemployed if they were “absent from work due to coronavirus-related business closures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unemployment-rises-to-4-4-in-march-amid-coronavirus/story-ESC11S5MnBPcuEb1C6ZacO.html

Worldwide, the number of cases has topped 1 million, with at least 52,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volunteer-disinfectant-sprayers-help-wuhan-prepare-for-a-return-to-work/story-Zl5VE3xGFQssLxCBZjvQpJ.html
03-04-2020||World||US Navy fires captain who sought help for coronavirus-stricken ship||The captain of a US Navy aircraft carrier facing a growing outbreak of the coronavirus on his ship was fired Thursday by Navy leaders who said he created a panic by sending his memo pleading for help to too many people.Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the ship’s commander, Capt. Brett Crozier “demonstrated extremely poor judgment” in the middle of a crisis. He said the captain copied too many people on the memo, which was leaked to a California newspaper and quickly spread to many news outlets.Modly’s decision to remove Crozier as ship commander was immediately condemned by members of the House Armed Services Committee, who called it a “destabilizing move” that will “likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet’s readiness.”Modly told Pentagon reporters during an abruptly called press conference Thursday that Crozier should have gone directly to his immediate commanders, who were already moving to help the ship. And he said Crozier created a panic by suggesting 50 sailors could die.The USS Theodore Roosevelt, with a crew of nearly 5,000, is docked in Guam, and the Navy has said as many as 3,000 will be taken off the ship and quarantined by Friday. More than 100 sailors on the ship have tested positive for the virus, but none are hospitalized at this point.“What it does, it undermines our efforts and the chain of command’s efforts to address this problem and creates a panic and creates the perception that the Navy is not on the job, the government is not on the job, and it’s just not true,” Modly said.He complained that Crozier sent the memo to people outside his chain of command and in a non-secure, unclassified email. And, he said he concluded that the captain’s ability to react professionally was overwhelmed by the virus challenge, “when acting professionally was what was needed most. We do, and we should, expect more from the commanding officers of our aircraft carriers.”Earlier this week, Modly told reporters that Crozier would not be relieved of duty for trying to protect his sailors, but left the door open for punishment if the captain leaked the memo to the press. On Thursday, Modly said he has no information to suggest that Crozier leaked the memo to the press.He said that if Crozier had communicated only with his leadership and not widely distributed the memo, he would likely still have a job. He took sole responsibility for the decision to fire Crozier, and said he got no pressure from the White House to do so.Democrats on the House committee issued a joint statement in support of Crozier. They said that while the captain went outside his chain of command, the pandemic presents a new set of challenges.“Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately,” the lawmakers said. “However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction.”Sen. Jack Reed, top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he told Modly that Navy leaders must make it clear that the decision to fire Crozier doesn’t inhibit others from taking steps to protect their sailors and Marines.And he said the incident “raised critical questions” about the Navy’s strategy to combat the virus across the fleet.Crozier, in his memo, raised warnings the ship was facing a growing outbreak of the coronavirus and asked permission to isolate the bulk of his crew members on shore, an extraordinary move to take a carrier out of duty in an effort to save lives.He said that removing all but 10% of the crew would be a “necessary risk” in order to stop the spread of the virus.“We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset, our sailors,” said Crozier.As of Thursday, the Navy said 31% of the USS Theodore Roosevelt crew have been tested for the virus, and 114 tested positive. The 180 Sailors that tested negative so far will move into Guam hotels for quarantine. As testing continues, the ship will keep enough sailors on board to sustain essential services and sanitize the ship in port.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-fires-captain-who-sought-help-for-coronavirus-stricken-ship/story-naCcrTkOTbo9R4ZRpQ88XN.html
03-04-2020||World||World Bank to roll out USD 160 billion emergency aid to help nations deal with Covid-19||The World Bank on Thursday approved a plan to roll out USD 160 billion in emergency aid over 15 months to help countries deal with the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic. The board of the Washington-based development lender announced the first set of fast-track crisis funding, with an initial $1.9 billion going to projects in 25 countries, and operations moving forward in another 40 nations, the bank said in a statement. “We are working to strengthen developing nations’ ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and shorten the time to economic and social recovery,” said World Bank President David Malpass. “The poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest, and our teams around the world remain focused on country-level and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis.” The bank also is working to redeploy USD 1.7 billion of existing funding, including the use of “catastrophic drawdowns,” a type of emergency credit line. India will be the largest beneficiary of the first wave of programs with a facility for USD 1 billion, followed by Pakistan with USD 200 million and Afghanistan with a little over USD 100 million, but funding is going to countries on nearly every continent, the bank said. In addition, the World Bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, is providing $8 billion in financing “to help private companies affected by the pandemic and preserve jobs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-to-roll-out-usd-160-billion-emergency-aid-to-help-nations-deal-with-covid-19/story-p99DQT81k6APYihfgQaoCP.html

This has led to a volley of criticism even as the country’s most populous province Ontario will release its modelling data, which its leader has warned will make for a “sobering discussion.” Ontario premier Doug Ford’s statement was stark, as he said, “It will be a real wake-up call. I don’t believe in holding back figures in this crisis. We have to be fully transparent with the people of Ontario, no matter how hard it is.”Also read: Canada to organise 6 flights out of India for its citizens stranded due to Covid-19 lockdownTrudeau promised transparency as the country dealt with the crisis but his government has held back on making its projections public. He said, “There is a range out there, and just highlighting that range is not as useful or important as being able to get clearer numbers and clearer analysis of what we are likely to face.”That lack of information has not gone down well in the country. Don Davies, health critic for the opposition New Democratic Party, underscored this point saying, “We can’t fight this virus blindly. Without access to federal data, Canadians are being left in the dark on the potential duration of physical distancing measures and our health care system’s capacity to respond to the outbreak.” Former Health Minister Jane Philpott tweeted, “This is not the time to hide bad news. This includes real-time updates, open-source data, best/worse case projections - in short, we’d like radical transparency.”Provinces like British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta have either already released relevant data or are expected to do so soon.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-rules-out-nationwide-lockdown-says-not-quite-yet-at-that-point/story-g7GVwkhGbfXKEcbVbojjyH.html
03-04-2020||World||UK health minister back at work after COVID-19 recovery, pledges more tests||The UK’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who had been self-isolating after his COVID-19 diagnosis last week, returned to the frontline to address the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday, during which he set out the government’s strategy to boost testing for the deadly virus. Under a new step-by-step plan, the minister said the government’s new goal is to have 100,000 COVID-19 tests a day by the end of April. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who continues to be in self-isolation after he tested positive for coronavirus last Friday, had posted a video message on Twitter pledging the government would “massively ramp up” testing because that would “unlock the coronavirus puzzle”. During the daily briefing, Hancock also revealed another massive leap in the UK’s death toll, which rose by a further 569 to hit a total of 2,921 -- the second day in a row when the country registered a spike in deaths of over 500 in a single day. “The rate of infection is currently believed to be doubling every three-four days,” said the minister, adding that he was back “redoubled” in his determination to fight this virus. “During the last week we have completed a whole new hospital, the NHS Nightingale Hospital in London, built in nine days. This has been an incredible achievement,” he said. He went on to lay out a point-by-point plan to enhance the testing capabilities to ensure National Health Service (NHS) staff are prioritised for the process in order to be able to carry on their work to fight against the disease. Amid criticism of the UK not having taken the decisive testing steps as neighbouring Germany where the death toll from COVID-19 is much lower, Hancock said the UK had not gone into this crisis with a huge diagnostics industry, as Germany had. He admitted a lack of materials such as swabs and reagents, which is a global challenge. “Our ultimate goal is that anyone who needs a test shall have one,” he said. In what he categorised as a “landmark” move, the minister also announced that more than GBP 13-billion of debt accrued by the NHS will be wiped by the government to enable the health service to respond better to the pandemic and ensure it is better prepared in the long-term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-minister-back-at-work-after-covid-19-recovery-pledges-more-tests/story-6j7cPzhRiiltc6GWtchtWN.html
03-04-2020||World||US sees deadliest day so far||The death toll in the US from the coronavirus pandemic has topped 5,300, while the country witnessed a stunning single-day record of 884 people killed in just 24 hours. The US death toll is lower than those of Italy and Spain but above the 3,318 recorded in China, where the pandemic first emerged in December. The US leads the world in the number of cases, with at least 227,000.And in a sign of the devastating economic impact of the epidemic, a record 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as businesses were forced to shut down as part of the mitigation efforts and layoffs in manufacturing, transportation and other sectors, according to numbers released on Thursday. More people had applied for jobless benefits in the last two week - 3.3 million had filed the week before - than in the six months of the Great Recession, The Washington Post reported.Also, in line with White House experts’ earlier warning that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die in the epidemic even if mitigation efforts were implemented fully, the Pentagon is reported to be preparing to provide 100,000 body bags for civilian use. US President Donald Trump, who earlier had downplayed the pandemic’s impact on the US, said on Wednesday that “we’re going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific”.As the number of coronavirus cases and fatalities continued to climb, health services across America, especially in areas with high incidence of the illness, have complained of crippling shortages of protective gear for health care workers such as masks, gloves, gowns and face shields. There is an additional urgency to the crisis as the health services brace themselves for a peak in cases and deaths, which is feared in two weeks. The number of confirmed cases in the country increased by about 29,000. New York state remained the worst impacted, with at least 84,000 cases and over 2,220 deaths. New York City accounted for a large number of them with 1,374 at one stage, almost a fourth of all deaths in the country.With NYC’s hospitals under severe pressure, Samaritan Purse, a charity from North Carolina, set up a 68-bed field hospital in Central Park, the city’s hub of major concerts, rallies and other public events. It took in its first patient on Wednesday. “We are here to stand with New Yorkers and meet the needs of people stricken with the coronavirus,” the charity said in a statement.A six-week-old baby girl has died from Covid-19 in the state of Connecticut, governor Ned Lamont said on Thursday, stressing that the death is a reminder that “nobody is safe with this virus”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-deadliest-day-so-far/story-Vxiqwao0SP2d2t5erlLcoJ.html

Sean Conley, Trump’s physician, did not provide any context for the second test. The doctor, however, said the president had been tested by a new rapid-point-of-care test that delivered results in 15 minutes. “The President tested negative for Covid-19,” Conley, said on Thursday in a memorandum to the White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham. “This morning, the President was tested again for Covid-19, utilising a new, rapid-point-of-care test capability. He is healthy and without symptoms. Sample collection took just one minute and results were reported back in 15 minutes,” Conley said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  President Trump flashed a copy of his physician’s memorandum to his press secretary during his daily White House news conference. “I did take a test. It just came out, this is from the White House physician,” Trump said at the briefing while holding up the memo. “You may have it, just came out. I just took it this morning. And I took it, it took me literally a minute to take it and it took me - I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes (for results). I went to work, I didn’t wait for it, but it said it took 14 minutes or something with a conclusion and it said the President tested negative for Covid-19,” he was quoted as saying by the US media.Also read: US records 1,169 coronavirus fatalities, new global daily high, says report Trump added that he had taken the test “really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked, how fast it worked.” “It’s a lot easier. I’ve done them both and the second one is much more pleasant,” he said of his second test. The president previously tested negative for the virus in mid-March after coming into contact with two persons who had tested positive. Trump’s second test comes as more than a million coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide and States across the US continue to hand down strict measures to slow down the spread of the Covid-19. America wrestles with the coronavirus pandemic that the White House has warned could kill up to two lakh people during the next fortnight. A total of 1,002,159 Covid-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with51,485 deaths reported so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The US has reported 236,339 Covid-19 cases, the highest in the world, and over 5,000 people have died due to the disease. President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the US was headed for a “very tough two weeks”, advising people to be prepared for the “hard days” ahead. Deborah Bix, a member of White House Task Force on coronavirus, based on a model from actual data from the ground, said the death toll in the US could be between 100,000 to 200,000, with the strict implementation of the existing mitigation measures including social distancing till April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-donald-trump-is-healthy-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-for-a-second-time/story-OkX3NbzeDOAlzTUq6LMrhM.html

We are exploring options with the parliamentary authorities in readiness for parliament’s return.”Hoyle insisted in a letter to Rees-Mogg that MPs should be able to take part in Prime Minister’s questions, oral questions to government departments, to ask urgent questions and to hear statements being made – especially if it is ‘not appropriate’ for them to be present.Several select committee meetings have already been held virtually, which encouraged Hoyle and others to push to expanding technology’s use to cover the main chamber.“Once the House returns, if we are still in the grip of the crisis where the physical presence of Members, or too many Members, in the Palace is not appropriate, I am keen that they should be able to participate in key parliamentary proceedings virtually, for example, oral questions, urgent questions, statements,” Hoyle wrote to Rees-Mogg.“The House Service has already trialled some virtual select committee evidence sessions with witnesses – and I have asked officials to investigate how they would apply similar technology to the types of business listed above.”Hoyle also asked if it would be possible for the Government to set up a forum of MPs during this recess, possibly via select committee chairs, who could quiz senior Government representatives at set times on different days.“MPs are being swamped right now with questions and case work from distressed constituents who need answers. Responses cannot wait for the House to sit again”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-have-virtual-parliament-to-question-govt-response/story-mnKSkvikKQptUO2GIsMj2O.html

They’re in big trouble.”A total of 1,243 passengers and 1,247 crew members are stranded at sea on the Zaandam and the Rotterdam, which came to its sister ship’s aid last week, loaded with supplies.About 1,200 passengers who are not ill would be sent home on charter planes. They will be “transported in coaches that will be sanitized, with limited person-to-person contact and while wearing masks,” Holland America said Wednesday.Some 45 people with mild symptoms will remain aboard in isolation until they recover and the “estimated less than 10” people requiring critical care will be taken ashore for treatment locally, the company said.The desperate situation aboard the Zaandam attracted worldwide publicity, but it is just one of several cruise liners seeking permission to dock at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale.The Zaandam, which left Buenos Aires on March 7, was originally meant to finish the trip in Chile on March 21, but changed course due to the virus and was originally scheduled to arrive in Fort Lauderdale on April 7.Four people have died on board, for reasons not yet disclosed.Rick De Pinho, a 53-year-old attorney, and his wife were transferred from the Zaandam to the Rotterdam because so far, they are healthy.“You can’t have these ships floating around.

03-04-2020||India||AI stops advance bookings till April 30||With the government yet to announce its lockdown exit strategy, India’s national carrier Air India on Friday decided to stop advance bookings for all its domestic and international flights till April 30. The 21-day lockdown is scheduled to end on April 14 and the Centre had earlier dismissed reports of it being extended.Private airlines, however, continue to take advance bookings beyond April 15. “Air India bookings are now closed till April 30. We are awaiting a decision post-April 14,” an Air India official said on condition of anonymity. The airline continues to accept bookings for flight from May 1. The country is currently under a 21-day lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Air India is a commercial organisation and needs to consider scenarios with regard to advance bookings and cancellations in case the lockdown in extended. Right now, we don’t know if the lockdown will be lifted phase-wise or not. For now, we are going to wait till April 14 and in case the lockdown is not extended, bookings can begin the same day,” a senior official with the civil aviation ministry, requesting anonymity, said. He added that in case another lockdown is announced, refunds will be offered according to company policy. All modes of conveyance, including rail traffic, road and air transport, were suspended when the lockdown came into effect. Initially, international flights were suspended for a week from March 22 but later extended until April 15 coinciding with the lockdown. Domestic flights were suspended from the day the lockdown started on March 25. Cargo flight, however, still ply.The Centre had earlier dismissed the reports of the lockdown being extended. “There are rumours and media reports, claiming that the government will extend the lockdown when it expires. These reports are baseless,” Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba had said. The Air India move comes a day after Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said India will consider resuming international flight operations on a case-by-case basis after the lockdown ends. Airlines are open to start advance bookings as per their own discretion and contingency plan, the minister had said.At present, advance booking for trains from April 15 onward are also open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-stops-advance-bookings-till-april-30/story-YNh5mItaGZPh3RMsitCkNJ.html

The grid is already reeling under the stress of an unprecedented dip in demand during the lockdown period.The meeting was chaired by union power minister RK Singh and senior officials from Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) and grid operator POSOCO National Load Despatch Centre, according to two officials aware of the proceedings of the meeting.“ The minister discussed the issue with PGCIL and load dispatcher in the meeting. Since we are in an unprecedented situation with low demand during the lockdown, we are closely monitoring the health of the grid. They have said they are confident of managing the grid stability for the event and have been told to ensure blackout doesn’t occur.,” a senior official said requesting anonymity.With a dip of 30% in demand for power due to the absence of commercial activity in the wake of the lockdown, a sudden change in grid frequency could lead to a potential power blackout. According to power ministry data available for April 2, peak demand stood at 125.8 GW which is 25% lower than 168.3 GW for the same day last year.Experts too warned about the possibly adverse impact of millions of households switching off, and then switching on, lights on Sunday night almost simultaneously. “This is absolutely unprecedented. If this is effectively implemented, then we are looking at an impact of 10-15GW of load going down and coming back again which will have a very severe impact on the grid. I am not aware of any event before leading to such a sharp fluctuation before,” said Vinay Rustagi, managing director at renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India Energy Private Limited. This, Rustagi emphasised, will need careful management and preplanning. “They will have to judicially use hydro and gas power plants to come back and curtail risk.”But power ministry officials said they were confident of managing the situation on Sunday night. “We are making arrangements since the event is known to us in advance. The current peak load of the country stands at around 120GW; of this domestic household lighting comprises of 12-15 GW and we will need to manage and monitor this 15GW of fluctuation,” a second government official said.With the sudden dip in demand the Centre last week had announced a slew of measures to aid the power sector during the lockdown period. These measures include a three-month moratorium on the payment of already financially squeezed distribution companies (Discoms) to Generating Companies (Gencos) and no penalty on late payment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-ministry-to-assess-impact-of-modi-s-call-to-switch-off-lights/story-JB75ou53G56a7f4mnZhpWK.html

The NSA allows detention of people considered security risks without charges or trial for up to one year. “They will not obey the law. Neither will they accept the system as they are the enemies of humanity. Whatever they have done to women health workers in Ghaziabad is a heinous crime. They are being slapped with the NSA. We will not spare them,” said Adityanath in a statement.The Jamaat members, who have been accused of “moving without their pants, singing indecent songs and demanding bidi and cigarettes”, were shifted from the hospital to a temporary isolation ward at an educational institute for the alleged misbehaviour with nurses.   The men were identified and quarantined as part of a nationwide manhunt launched this week for thousands of people who had attended the gathering at the Jamaat’s headquarters in New Delhi.Officials said the government will not deploy women health workers and policewomen at hospitals where patients linked to Jamaat are admitted to across Uttar Pradesh. As many as 897 Jamaat members have been quarantined at different facilities across the state.Ghaziabad district hospital’s chief medical superintendent on Thursday wrote a letter to police complaining about the Jamaat members’ behaviour. Staff nurses of this hospital have informed vide their letter dated April 1 that coronavirus infected patients linked to the Jamaat were moving without their pants and singing indecent songs. They are demanding ‘bidi’ and cigarettes from the hospital employees and staff nurses,’’ said the letter, (a copy of which HT has seen?). “Under such a situation, their treatment is not possible in this hospital. You are requested to take effective action at your level to restrain them to ensure their medical treatment.” Ghaziabad’s senior police superintendent Kalanidhi Naithani said stringent action will be initiated against the Jamaat members and a case has been registered against them. He said an investigation is in progress.Officials said the NSA will also be slapped on people who attack police enforcing the 21-day lockdown imposed last week to prevent the spread of coronavirus pandemic.Adityanath cited an attack on doctors involved in Covid-19 contact tracing in Indore and directed authorities that such incidents should not happen in Uttar Pradesh.There have been reports of several attacks on police enforcing the lockdown in Uttar Pradesh. “The police are doing their duty by preventing people from coming out during the lockdown. There have been incidents in the state in which policemen were attacked by people. To deter such persons, it has been decided to invoke the NSA against such persons,” an Uttar Pradesh home department official told news agency Press Trust of India.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-slaps-nsa-on-jamaat-members-for-misbehaviour/story-JX6hnIy1p4Q2uLPL1H48iJ.html

The lockdown has also left tens of thousands of migrant workers jobless and forced many of them to leave big cities for their homes on foot.“The urban street vendors are facing the risk of losing their livelihoods during the period of lockdown. They play an important role in the supply of essential items like groceries, fruits and vegetables to the citizens at affordable prices,”  the Centre said in a letter to chief secretaries. The letter, (a copy of which HT has seen?) said authorities have been encouraged to facilitate home delivery of the essentials and minimize movement of individuals outside their homes.The Centre said the street vendors carrying valid identity cards or certificates of vending may be allowed to carry on their businesses subject to restrictions imposed. The urban local bodies have already identified the vendors as per provisions of the Street Vendor’s Act, 2014, and issued certificates of vending and ID Cards, it added.Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri said the street vendors need to ensure the cleanliness of carts, personal hygiene, regular use of sanitisers and social distancing norms. “These operations will be subject to restrictions imposed by district authorities. However, restrictions will continue on street food vendors, as they may result in the congregation of persons and violations of lockdown.”The Union home ministry on March 29 asked the states to allow transportation of all goods, without distinction of essential and non-essential during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-street-vendors-to-sell-essentials-centre/story-MLzNMy6RAeYOcZ4esVuRRP.html
03-04-2020||India||One hot spot less in Kerala, thanks to this IAS officer||Pathanamthitta, a hilly district in central Travancore region in Kerala and home to the Sabarimala shrine was among the first sites in the country where coronavirus spread after a family that returned from Italy tested positive for Covid-19 in early March. However, the district now has only 13 of the 286 positive cases in the state. By comparison, Kasargod has 121. According to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, while Kasargod remains in the hotspot list of the union health ministry, Pathanamthitta has been removed from it.One of the people responsible for this containment is a 2012 batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer, PB Nooh, who serves as the district collector of Pathanamthitta. He raised an alarm with the state government after thousands of devotees congregated at Sabarimala to attend the monthly prayers that began March 13.This wasn’t received well by devotees and he faced much abuse on social media. “When Sabarimala temple was opened for monthly pooja in March, despite the Travancore Devaswom Board’s warning, at least 13,000 pilgrims came in four days. Milling pilgrims was not a good sign. In fact it was a recipe for tragedy. So I sent an SOS to the government to announce the closure of the temple,” Nooh told the Hindustan Times.On March 20, the state government disallowed pilgrims’ entry to the Sabarimala shrine following Nooh’s report suggesting restriction of entry in light of rising Covid-19 cases. The shrine will not reopen on March 28 as previously planned.The state saw a steady rise in the number of positive infections starting March 18, according to data provided by the state government: from 28 confirmed Covid-19 to the current 286.On March 10, the Travancore Devaswom Board president N Vasu asked the public to not attend the monthly prayers at the temple; the state cabinet too called upon people to not hold large public gatherings, including weddings or festivals. This was barely days after local cases of Covid-19 began emerging from the state, and nearly a month after three imported cases — students who had contracted the virus at Wuhan and returned to the state — were detected.Pathanamthitta was the first district in the state to use flow charts to help trace the contacts of infected persons. The idea was to track where the family, which returned from Italy on February 29 and tested positive for Covid-19 on March 6, travelled to and whom they met.On March 11, the administration released a flowchart titled Patient Flowchart Covid-19: P1 Cluster. It showed where the family, comprising a middle-aged couple and their 24 year old son, travelled to after landing at Kochi airport. By then, many relatives and friends of the family had tested positive too, prompting the administration to release the flowchart to the public. The family visited a church, a post office, a jewellery shop and a hypermarket: many members of the public were at risk. The administration wanted to reach out to everyone whom the family had come in contact with — in all, 1300 were placed under observation. “Making the flow chart was a cumbersome process. Police, health workers, NGOs and political leaders all helped us in the process. This also raised the awareness level of the people,” Nooh said. All three members of the family and eight of their contacts, including a 95-year-old great grandfather, have recovered from Covid-19 and have been discharged from the hospital.Pathanamthitta was first to introduce a so-called geo-fencing application to locate quarantine violators. This application is now being used across all the districts’ control rooms to monitor the spread of coronavirus. Once installed on a person’s phone, it alerts authorities if they step out of their house, and even tags the location they are at. “It is teamwork and many of us have spent sleepless nights. We have received full support from the government. We literally chased contacts and enforced norms ruthlessly. In such a situation we can’t be soft and now this has started showing some results,” said Nooh, who is the seventh of eight children of a couple that owned a small grocery shop in Perumbavoor in Ernakulam. One of Nooh’s older brothers, PB Salim, is an IAS officer from the West Bengal cadre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-hot-spot-less-in-kerala-thanks-to-this-ias-officer/story-22KD4yMkJuhCZV0z8oFW9J.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19 facilities being readied at 51 Army hospitals||New Delhi: Dedicated facilities are being readied for treating Covid-19 patients at 51 hospitals operated by the armed forces across the country, including in Kolkata, Visakhapatnam, Kochi, Dundigal (near Hyderabad), Bengaluru, Kanpur, Jaisalmer, Jorhat and Gorakhpur, the defence ministry said in a statement on Friday. They will have intensive care unit (ICU) beds and high dependency units (HDUs) among other things. HDUs are a scaled down versions of ICUs. The ministry said the Indian Air Force’s transport fleet has been deployed to airlift essential supplies, medicines and medical equipment. It has so far transported 60 tonnes of stores, it added. Thirty transport planes and 28 helicopters are on standby at various bases across the country to support the fight against the pandemic.The ministry said the military is running quarantine facilities at Mumbai, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Hindon, Manesar and Chennai where 1,737 cases have been handled. Of them, 403 people have been released. “Fifteen other facilities are on standby,” the ministry said. The 15 facilities, with a combined capacity for 7,000 people, are in cities like Babina, Jhansi, Barmer, Bhopal, Kolkata, Bhatinda, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Gorakhpur and Kochi. Over 8,500 military doctors and support staff are ready to help the government in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. As many as 9,000 hospital beds have been prepared to meet emergency requirements. Five hospitals run by the armed forces are equipped to carry out Covid-19 tests and six more would be added to the list soon, the ministry said.Six warships and five medical teams are on standby to provide assistance to neighbouring countries, the ministry said. The Defence Research and Development Organisation has also come up with solutions for sanitising metro stations, railway stations, hospitals, malls, airports, isolation areas, quarantine centres and high-risk residential areas. It said its Delhi-based Centre for Fire Explosive & Environment Safety has developed two configurations of sanitising equipment (portable and trolley mounted) that are spin-offs from technologies developed for fire suppression. “Two of these systems are being provided to the Delhi Police for immediate use. These can be made available to other agencies with the help of industry partners,” the agency said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-facilities-being-readied-at-51-army-hospitals/story-De9E9WHycjj0ZTMpoVcpTL.html
03-04-2020||India||647 cases in 14 states linked to Nizamuddin conference||New Delhi/Chennai/LucknowIndia recorded 647 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across 14 states and Union Territories linked to a religious congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin that has emerged as the infection’s biggest hot spot in the country, the Union health ministry said on Friday.The March congregation of Islamic missionary group Tablighi Jamaat at its six-storey headquarters has pushed up the infection count in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Assam, Delhi, Himachal, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, the government said.“There are a total 2,301 coronavirus cases reported so far in India and 56 deaths have been reported from the country, of which 12 deaths have been reported since yesterday. As many as 157 patients have recovered,” said Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary of the Union health ministry, but refused to specify the number of fatalities linked to the Jamaat event.The home ministry has already blacklisted 960 Jamaat members from abroad who attended the congregation. When asked if the government is planning to deport then, Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary in the Union home ministry, said, “The government is probing them under provisions of foreigners act and disaster management act. There is no deliberation of deportation at this stage.”The cluster of infections that have spread across the country have forced authorities to call in the police and anti-terror squads to search for people who attended the meeting. A number of religious organisations – the latest being the Imarat Shariah in Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand -- appealed to all delegates to come forward for health screening.Among the worst affected is Tamil Nadu, where at least 100 of the 102 new cases on Friday were linked to the Nizamuddin event, state health minister C Vijayabaskar said. Of the 3684 samples sent for testing so far, 411 have tested positive for the virus, while 2789 were negative, he added. In Uttar Pradesh, 47 of the 51 fresh cases on Friday were Jamaat members, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi and principal secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said in Lucknow. The police sealed the Sadar Bazaar locality in the state capital to carry out house-to house searches, Awasthi added.At the home ministry briefing, Manoj Murhekar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said guidelines for rapid antibody diagnostics are likely to be released by on Saturday. “The modalities on which we are working on include how to deploy the test in high risk areas, low risk areas, hotspots, etc.” he said.Currently, India permits faster and cheaper antibody tests to check for Covid-19 in hot spots.The test used now -- PCR (polymerase chain reaction) -- identifies the Sars-CoV-2 virus from throat or nasal swab samples of people with symptoms or high-risk individuals who might have come in contact with a Covid-19 patient. The antibody tests are meant to identify people who have been previously infected but have developed immunity. While the PCR test results can take up to five hours, the antibody results can be available in 30 minutes.Murhekar said around 66,000 individuals had so far been tested, of which 8,000 were tested on Thursday – the highest in a single day so far.When asked if the ministry is deliberating on increasing tests, Agarwal said, “Testing has process and guidelines. Unnecessary testing for the sake of confidence building, especially when kits are limited, is not the right strategy. However, if we feel it’s needed, testing criteria can be revised. But, so far, no decision has been taken on that.”Agarwal said about three million people downloaded the AarogyaSetu app, developed as a public-private partnership project to help people assess their risk catching the coronavirus infection, within 24 hours of launch.He also called for a stop to attacks on doctors. “The Union health minister (Harsh Vardhan) has conveyed that he is concerned over attacks on health workers. Even the Prime Minister has appreciated health workers. Under such challenging circumstances, we should support them in every way possible,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/647-cases-in-14-states-linked-to-nizamuddin-conference/story-hzanIuqA3QeyKFlsr3Qx5N.html
03-04-2020||India||Mumbai lockdown unlikely to be lifted on April 14, says Maharashtra health minister||Maharashtra government may not end the lockdown on April 14, when the nationwide restrictions announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to be lifted. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the government is likely to extend the lockdown by a couple of more weeks, especially in Mumbai and other urban areas of the state.“We are expecting a fall in positive Covid-19 cases by April 15, after an initial spike. We will have to extend the lockdown period by a few more weeks… Lifting it fully in a city like Mumbai is unlikely,” said Tope, adding that imposing restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus is a decision the state government can take. “We had imposed a complete lockdown in Maharashtra two days before it was in announced across the country. Before that, too, we had imposed restriction in urban areas and shut down public places. Containing the spread [of coronavirus] in a city like Mumbai is a herculean task, and the decision to end the lockdown will have to be taken cautiously and after due deliberation. I personally feel it will have to be extended in Mumbai,” Tope said.Modi, during his video conference with chief ministers of all states on Thursday, had hinted at lifting the lockdown in a staggered manner. He reportedly asked the state government to prepare their plan and submit suggestions to the Centre on withdrawal of the lockdown. Seniors leaders in the state government, however, feel lifting restrictions immediately after completion of 21 days would jeopardise their efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus.Tope, meanwhile, said containment of the virus in Mumbai is a “big task”, but they are not leaving any stone unturned. “Our health workers, police and municipal corporation workers have been working on the cluster containment action plan, with 292 teams working on it in Mumbai. We have more than 800 employees working as part of these teams to trace suspected cases. The number of suspected cases has increased owing to the Tablighi Jamaat programme organised in Nizamuddin last month. But we are sure that we will be able to contain it,” he said. The state government was mulling exempting auxiliary sectors, which support essential sectors in production, from the lockdown. A state government official, who did not want to be named, said manufacturing units engaged in the production of polythene or chemicals required for packaging of essential commodities are likely to be exempted from the lockdown. “The stock of material manufactured in these auxiliary sectors will last for the next eight days or so. As per the representation made to us by these sectors, they need to be exempted from the lockdown,” the official said.Tope said the exemption of such sectors was necessary to ensure the smooth supply of essential goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-lockdown-unlikely-to-be-lifted-on-april-14-says-maharashtra-health-minister/story-B3eQkHjRCmKBcMLTJFAnIK.html

Plus we the civic administrations along with the hotel staff are carrying out the necessary checks to carefully monitor and sanitize rooms and prioritize health and safety for all.”An IHC spokesperson added that “during these trying times, the company was keenly aware of its responsibility to its community and to the medical fraternity combating the spread of the virus.”“We deeply value the contributions of the medical community and will continue to work with them and local authorities as we navigate this crisis,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-hotels-company-opens-up-luxury-hotels-for-doctors-battling-covid-19-crisis/story-ZJfzwyqLmQKOSjIG7d6nEM.html

03-04-2020||India||Bookings closed for domestic, international travel till Apr 30: Air India||National carrier Air India on Friday stopped advance bookings for all flights till April 30 even as the lockdown is in effect till April 14. “Air India bookings are now closed till April 30. We are awaiting a decision post April 14, “ an Air India official said. To be sure, bookings for both domestic and international flights of only Air India have been stopped while private airlines continue to take advance bookings from April 15 onward. “Air India is a commercial organisation and needs to consider scenarios in case of advance books and cancellations in case the lockdown is extended. We don’t even know right now if the lockdown will be lifted phase wise or not. For now we are going to wait till April 14 and in case the lockdown is not extended bookings can begin the same day,” a senior government official said requesting anonymity. All modes of conveyance, including rail traffic, road and air transport, have been suspended after the lockdown came into effect. Initially, international flights were suspended for a week from March 22 but later extended until April 15 coinciding with the lockdown. Domestic flights were suspended from the day the lockdown started on March 25.Centre had dismissed the reports that claimed that the lockdown will be extended. This also comes a day after union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri had said India will consider resuming international flight operations on a case-by-case basis from April 15. Airlines are open to start advance bookings as per their own discretion and contingency plan, the minister had said.“The ministry is proceeding on the understanding that the lockdown is in place till April 15. There is no directive from the ministry about the contingency planning of airlines. But, as an eternal optimist, I am hoping that on April 15, flights can at least start, if not all, then in a calibrated manner. But that is a decision that we still need to take,” Puri had said Thursday.At present advance booking for trains from April 15 onward are also open. “Certain media reports have claimed that Railways has started reservation for post-lockdown period. It is to clarify that reservation for journeys post April 14 was never stopped and is not related to any new announcement,” the ministry of railways said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bookings-closed-for-domestic-international-travel-till-apr-30-air-india/story-E8pciL23w1tphD0mqqYIiN.html
03-04-2020||India||SC seeks response from Centre on plea by activists for payment of wages to migrant workers||The Supreme Court Friday sought response from the Centre on a plea filed by two civil rights activists seeking enforcement of fundamental right to life for migrant workers and payment of wages to them as they have been left without work or food following the 21-day nationwide lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic.“A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta had issued notice to Centre and posted the matter for further hearing on April 7,” advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for petitioners Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj through video conferencing said.The plea said that fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution needs to be enforced for migrant workers who are severely affected by the lockdown ordered by the government on March 24.“The order for which no prior intimation was given, created a panic across the country and led to the instantaneous loss of jobs and wages of millions of migrant workers employed in establishments across India or self-employed as street vendors, rickshaw pullers, domestic house helps, petty job workers, etc. This led to the large scale exodus of these migrant workers to their home towns,” the plea said.The petition, filed through Bhushan, said that the sudden announcement of lockdown led to migrant workers crowding in large numbers of many thousands at bus terminals, railway stations and inter-state borders to find their way home, potentially exposing them to the virus and escalating the risk of its spread.It said that as news started emerging of this large scale exodus of migrant workers and the threat it posed by disrupting public health measures of social distancing to curb the spread of the virus, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an order dated March 29, for ‘restriction of movement of migrants’.“This order asks employer of the migrant workers to pay their wages during the lockdown and their landlords not to charge them rent for this period. It also asks the State Governments to make arrangements for food and shelter for these workers,” it said.However, the petitioner submitted: “This order is not the correct or adequate response to the large scale exodus of migrant workers.” It added that as directed in the order of MHA, it is also unrealistic to expect the small establishments employing migrant workers to pay them their wages at their place of work.“Due to the lockdown the workers cannot travel to their place of work and many of these establishments are small businesses that have been forced to shut down and hence employers will not be able to pay these wages. Besides majority of these migrant workers are self-employed. “The order ignores the harsh realities that workers have to persistently face in cities that is further compounded when a lockdown order deprives them of their job, daily wages and hence means of survival, thus violating their Article 21 rights,” the plea said.The activists said the lockdown has precipitated an unprecedented humanitarian crisis especially among the class of migrant workers and it is the central and state governments that have to take adequate measures in accordance with National and State plans drawn out under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, under the guidance of the advisory committees they are mandated to constitute, to deal with this epidemic.“The current lockdown has cast an unprecedented economic hardship on daily wage earners. It is submitted that the Central and State Authorities have the necessary power and consequential duty to direct that all daily wage earners be provided with their wages at the place where they are currently present under the lockdown. The government is mandated under various statutes to keep a record of migrant workers whether employed in establishments or self-employed,” the petition said.It added that if in violation of the necessary statutes, the governments have not maintained records of such workers, it would be necessary to immediately put in place a mechanism for workers to self-identify and self-attest based on which the government can release wages.The petition sought direction to the central and state governments to jointly and severally ensure payments of wages/ minimum wages to all the migrant workers within a week, whether employed by other establishments, contractors or self-employed, as they are unable to work and earn wages, during the period of the lockdown.It also sought direction to them to immediately activate National and State Advisory Committees of experts in the field of disaster management and public health and prepare national and state disaster management plans for dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic, taking into account all relevant aspects, mitigation measure, their possible costs and consequences as required under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-response-from-centre-on-plea-by-activists-for-payment-of-wages-to-migrant-workers/story-uPoiphvlflcAv6bGGoYHpM.html
03-04-2020||India||Indore’s 80% Covid-19 cases have no travel history, say officials||Around 80% of the Covid-19 positive people in Indore do not have a known travel history, the health officials said, pointing at the possible local transmission of the virus in Madhya Pradesh’s business capital. Indore recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 25, five days after the first four cases in the state were reported from Jabalpur. Four cases were reported that day, which included one each from Ranipura, Chandan Nagar and Khajrana localities in Indore, which emerged as Covid-19 clusters within a week.Till March 29, Indore reported a marginal increase in cases every day: four on the 25th, five on the 26th, four each on the 27th and the 28th and three on the 29th. The spurt began on March 30, when 19 new cases were reported, and since then 61 new positive cases have been reported from the city, taking the total figure to 82 till Thursday night. Madhya Pradesh has 107 total cases.A health department official, who was not willing to be named, said when the initial cases were reported there was not much screening of people in these densely populated localities and the complete lockdown was also not strictly enforced. “This may have caused some community spread,” the official said.Sensing trouble, the MP government on March 30, replaced then collector, Lokesh Kumar Jatav, and the then DIG police, Ruchivardhan Mishra, with Manish Singh, as the new collector, and Harinarayan Chari Mishra, as the new DIG of police. Jatav refused to comment on the alleged lapses during initial stages saying the new collector should brief the media about the Indore situation.As the days passed, the Covid-19 pandemic spread to newer localities such as Daulatganj and Azad Nagar, neighbouring the ones from where the first four cases were reported, clearly showing that lockdown was not enforced.The localities cited by the administration are Muslim-dominated localities, having a combined population of 3.5 lakh to 4 lakh, according to Muslim community leaders. A sizeable section of the population comes from the middle and lower classes.What has shocked the health officials is that there’s no travel history of 80% of the Covid-19 cases till Thursday night. Chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Indore, Dr Praveen Jadia said, “Most of the cases don’t have a travel history. We suspect that the first four cases may have got the disease from one source and may have unknowingly spread it to others.” Anwar Qadri, Muslim community leader and corporator in Indore, agreed with him and said that except a couple of them none has any travel history to the best of his knowledge. “We are also baffled as to how the virus spread so fast in these localities,” he said, that unlike other places Indore Muslims were not associated with Tablighi Jamaat, except an insignificant number. A government official, who didn’t want to be named, said direct flights between Indore and Dubai were introduced last year, they have been suspended now. “There is a possibility that people from Indore who travelled to Dubai contracted the virus there,” he said.Even three days after the spurt happened, the district administration is yet to complete contact tracking of all Covid patients. Commissioner, Indore division Akash Tripathi said, “We are trying to know as to how many persons came in contact with Covid-19 positive cases to identify and screen such people. But we are yet to know as to from whom it all started.”He admitted that social media had added to their problems as people in these localities were resisting screening because of rumours related to the disease on different platforms, including WhatsApp.A section of people believing in the rumour that persons being picked for quarantine in Indore will be injected with a ‘Corona injection’ led to attack on four health workers, after which chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had asked officials to book the miscreants under stringent National Security Act (NSA). “Rumours were one of the reasons behind the attack,” said deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Indore, Harinarayan Chari Mishra. Indore Shahar Qazi, Mohammed Ishrat Ali, has appealed to Muslim community not to believe rumours and cooperate with the health department team in identifying and treating coronavirus affected people.The state government health bulletin said only 9% of people affected by coronavirus in Madhya Pradesh have travel history in comparison to 25% at the national level while 40% got it through contact transmission in comparison to 46% at the national level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-s-80-covid-19-cases-have-no-travel-history-say-officials/story-WMFlHITBi9LbZKSn27XaSN.html

This couple was not screened at the airport as Dubai, then, was not in the list of high-risk countries.Pune, with 71 positive cases, has recorded the second-highest number of cases in Maharashtra after Mumbai’s 278.Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said the containment plan is in place in almost all the areas of the city.“Since the first case was recorded in the city on March 9, we put in place the containment plan as prescribed by the government. Currently, almost the entire city is covered. We started containment within a one to three km radius in areas where a positive patient is found,” he said.A notification from the ministry of health & family welfare said, “The cluster containment strategy would be to contain the disease within a defined geographic area by early detection, breaking the chain of transmission and thus preventing its spread to new areas. This would include geographic quarantine, social distancing measures, enhanced active surveillance, testing all suspected cases, isolation of cases, home quarantine of contacts, social mobilization to follow preventive public health measures.”As of now, a few areas where multiple cases have been identified include, Sinhgad road where the Dubai returned couple reside, Kondhwa, where people had returned from the Tablighi event in Delhi and Ambegaon where a woman who was admitted to Bharati Hospital lives. The woman who was critical eventually recovered.Pune also saw a few possible cases of community transmission with no foreign travel history or direct contact with a positive Covid-19 case.The city recorded two deaths, the first on March 30 of a 52-year-old businessman from Thane with multiple ailments, and the second of a 50-year-old woman on Thursday at the Sassoon Government Hospital. The city also saw the miraculous recovery of a 41-year-old aanganwadi worker who was admitted to Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital on March 16. She twice tested negative on March 31 after being on the ventilator for almost 11 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-71-positive-cases-pune-is-maharashtra-s-2nd-covid-19-hotspot/story-s6gLVfzpDN64cObfuCE8PP.html
03-04-2020||India||SC seeks govt response over payment of minimum wages to migrant workers||The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday sought the response of the Central government in a plea to ensure payments of minimum wages to all migrant workers, who are either employed by companies or contractors or self-employed, within a week.The petition filed by activists Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj pointed out that migrant workers are unable to earn their wages because of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced by the government since March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta posted the case for next hearing on April 7.The petitioners submitted that the lockdown order issued on March 24, for which no prior intimation was given, created a panic across the country and led to the instantaneous loss of jobs and wages of millions of migrant workers employed in establishments across the country or self-employed as street vendors, rickshaw-pullers, domestic helps, petty job workers, etc.“The (lockdown) order ignores the harsh realities that workers have to persistently face in cities that is further compounded when the order deprives them of their jobs, daily wages and as a result, means of survival, thus violating their Article 21 (Right to Life) rights,” the petition stated.Petition seeking free Covid 19 testingThe SC on Friday asked the Centre for its response a petition praying that Covid-19 test should be provided free of cost to all citizens at all private and government-run testing laboratories.At present, private laboratories are allowed to charge up to Rs 4,500 to conduct Covid-19 test.“It is urgently required that the respondents have to provide free of cost Covid-19 test to all citizens,” the petition stated.Advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, who filed the plea, submitted that government hospitals are packed to capacity and it has become difficult for a common man to get tested in government laboratories.The public is forced to fork out up to Rs 4,500 to get Covid-19 test done at private laboratories because of lack of options. Saddling ordinary citizens with such a financial burden effectively deprive them of their accessibility to medical facilities and is violative of Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner submitted.Sudhi also pointed out that there are only 114 designated centres to conduct Covid-19 test in a country that has over 1.3-billion population. He claimed that the lack of an adequate number of testing centres has prevented conducting Covid-19 test in an aggressive manner and could pose a major health hazard for the country in the coming days.He urged that testing facilities should be ramped up and pathological laboratories accredited with National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) must conduct all Covid-19 tests.SC wants strict action on price gouging of masks and sanitisersThe SC on Friday asked the Centre to publicise measures taken by it to deal with price gouging of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and hand sanitisers.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta said the government to take strict action against those flouting the price control notification issued by the authorities concerned. The apex court disposed of the case after the government told the SC on Friday that it would publicise helpline numbers for customers to reach out if they come across any violation of the price control notification.The plea by the non-governmental organization (NGO), Justice for Rights Foundation, had claimed that there was a growing rise in demand for masks and sanitisers due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Consequently, chemists and medical shops are taking advantage of the situation and selling such commodities at a price much higher than the maximum retail price (MRP) as well as the price prescribed by the government.The petitioner had alleged that several chemists and medicine shops, in an attempt to defraud and profit from the unprecedented outbreak, were striking out the MRP of masks and sanitisers and applying their own exorbitant price tags.The government had come out with notifications and orders declaring facemasks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities and capping their prices.“The Department of Consumer Affairs, in wake of the need and the urgency of the present condition published a notification dated March 21, fixing the prices of the mask i.e. 2 ply masks to be priced at Rs 8 and 3 ply masks to priced at Rs 10 and that a 200-millilitre bottle of sanitiser to be sold at a price of Rs 100,” the petition pointed out.The petitioner claimed that despite the notification, medicine shops were still selling masks and sanitisers at higher prices in brazen defiance of the notification.Kerala –Karnataka border: SC bats for amicable resolutionThe SC on Friday issued notice to the Centre and Kerala governments in an appeal filed by Karnataka challenging an April 1 order of Kerala high court (HC) directing the Central government to remove the road blockades erected by Karnataka on the Kerala-Karnataka border.The apex court did not stay the Kerala HC order but asked the chief secretaries of both the states and the Union health secretary to hold a meeting to arrive at an amicable solution in a bid to ensure movement of vehicles in case of medical emergencies.The case will be heard next on April 7.The Karnataka government had blocked the roads, including National Highway 66 connecting the state with Kerala’s northern districts, in its bid to tackle the spread of Covid-19 outbreak. It had erected mud mounds on the roads, preventing all vehicular traffic between the neighbouring states.Kerala has reported 286 Covid-19 positive cases in the country, and ranks third after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Out of the 286 cases, 129 cases are from the state’s northern-most district, Kasaragod, which shares its borders with Karnataka.The Kerala High Court Advocates Association had moved Kerala HC against the blockades. On April 1, the HC noted that the national highway network comes under the Central government and had ordered it to remove the blockades.“We direct the Central government to intervene in the matter and ensure that the blockades erected by Karnataka on the national highways connecting the said state to Kerala, are removed forthwith, and without any further delay, so as to facilitate the free movement of vehicles carrying persons for urgent medical treatment, across the border between the two states,” the HC had directed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-govt-response-over-payment-of-minimum-wages-to-migrant-workers/story-A7q7aTTN4ZI03LaQdOITpO.html

The man, in a Facebook post, said those who are currently harassing the attendees should contract the disease.The accused identified as Mohsin Shaikh, in a Facebook post which he has since deleted, said if the Tablighi Jamaat organisers were wrong they should not be forgiven, but those who are currently harassing them should contract the disease. Shaikh was booked and arrested under Sections 269 (spreading an infectious disease) and 188 (disobedience to a government order) of the Indian Penal Code. A total of 46 people who attended the Jamaat meet in Delhi in March have been identified in Goa. However, only nine of them are believed to have participated in the convention which contributed to the spike of Covid-19 cases in the country. All those identified had entered Goa before March 15. Their test results are awaited. So far, Goa had six confirmed cases of the coronavirus with yet another patient testing positive on Thursday night. Another patient who passed away on Thursday night while under isolation at the Goa Medical College and Hospital was found to have tested negative for coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-man-who-wished-covid-19-on-those-dealing-with-jamaat-attendees-in-fb-post-held/story-hTgoBZAQy4Tnf36UO28QjL.html
03-04-2020||India||‘Public Interest Litigation shops should be shut down’: Centre to SC||The Centre Friday strongly opposed the petitions filed by activists for payment of wages to migrant workers who have been left without work due to the 21-day nationwide lockdown in view of coronavirus pandemic saying till the country comes out of this unprecedented tragedy such “professional PIL shops” must be locked down.Preparing PILs without any ground level information or knowledge while sitting in an air-conditioned office is not ‘public service’ entitling any of them (activists) to argue public interest litigations particularly in the present global crisis, the government said.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta, which took PILs filed by activists Harsh Mander, Anjali Bhardwaj and Swami Agnivesh on the issue of plight of migrant workers for hearing through video conferencing, was told by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the government has done an exemplary work in containing the spread of COVID-19 to the minimum number possible.The bench, which sought response from the Centre on the PILs, was told by Mehta that the government has taken several pro-active and timely steps at various levels to mitigate the problems faced by the citizens.Vehemently opposing the PILs, Mehta pointed out that the country is going through unprecedented crisis of fighting an unknown deadly virus and all officers are working day and night through several control rooms.He said none of the petitioners have even bothered to serve the poor and needy or the persons suffering from the virus and, therefore, can never be treated as ‘public spirited citizens’. He said that till the country and the world comes out of this unprecedented tragedy such “professional PIL shops” must be locked down as none of them have any concern about the poor and needy or thousands of patients fighting this deadly disease. Mehta asserted that genuine NGOs and bona fide public spirited citizens are tirelessly working at a grass-root level with government officials and helping the needy as also assisting the patients and doctors in whichever way they can. Filing of PILs in the midst of the government’s fight with this deadly disease is proving to be detrimental in the entire country, he added. He said he has been approached by many Advocate Generals of the States sharing their anxiety that the government officers who are working day and night are losing their precious working hours in these trying times by sitting in lawyers’ chambers and preparing replies to frivolous PILs. He emphasised that officers should better be left to discharge their duties and expressed the hope that all constitutional courts in the country would be circumspect in entertaining such petitions in these unprecedented circumstances so as not to create any hindrance in the efforts of the central state governments which are working on a war footing.

Of them, 38 were described as “active cases”, as 12 have recovered and seven died. The government, however, suspects that four of the seven Covid-19 deaths were due to “co-morbidity”. “The Covid-19 infection spreads among family members. We’ve come across one case in which 10 people in a family have tested Covid-19 positive. There are other cases, including the one in which five members of a family have tested Covid-19 positive. I’m urging everybody to protect yourself in a bid to save your family members and loved ones,” Banerjee said while addressing the media on Friday.The CM also expressed concerns over incidents that some people were objecting to setting up of Covid-19 hospitals in their localities.“We’re not mixing Covid-19 cases with other patients. We’re setting up hospitals in every district exclusively for novel coronavirus. But some people are objecting to our move. Some are even objecting to the cremation of the dead. I urge you not to do this. I remind you that under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the government is the final authority to decide on such matters,” Banerjee said.She urged people not to panic, assuring that most patients recover. “Except for those who are suffering from other bronchial or kidney ailments, most of those who test positive for Covid-19 recover,” she said.Of the total 5,110 people who have been quarantined in government-run centres, 3,218 have been released, the government said. Of the 54,965 people asked to be quarantined at home, 2,936 are released, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-spreads-mamata-asks-bengal-residents-to-follow-social-distancing/story-cTP7GVPOmXKU6rqGfvzBcJ.html

The three-week, nationwide lockdown began on March 25.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy urged officials to make adequate arrangements for the migrants’ basic essential needs such as accommodation and food.“We’ve provided them shelter and other facilities in community halls and other relief centres, including educational institutions and even hotels. In all, 218 such relief centres have been set up to accommodate 9,695 migrant workers, including 3,819 belonging to Andhra and another 5,876 from 28 states across the country,” said an official from the chief minister’s office, requesting anonymity.On Thursday, the state government issued orders to the district officials to ensure all those who are staying at relief centres be provided with food on a par with mid-day meals in government-run schools under the “Jagananna Gorumuddha” scheme. The “Jaganna Gorumudda” menu comprises nutritious food to ensure that students stay healthy and fit. “The same menu is now being extended to migrant workers,” the official said.Migrant workers are being treated to boiled eggs, egg curry, chickpeas, tomato dal, asparagus, vegetable pulao, aloo kurma, and kichidi, depending on the day of the week, apart from staples such as rice, sambar and buttermilk.The government is also taking care of their other daily needs such as safe drinking water, clothes, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, blanket, and oil. “We are ensuring that their stay at the relief centres is as comfortable as possible under the difficult circumstances as the country is facing a challenging situation because of the Covid-19 outbreak,” the official said.In Telangana, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is distributing free lunch and dinner to 45,000 and 15,000 people, respectively, under the Annapurna meal scheme.GHMC official spokesman Y Venkateshwarlu said each meal contains 450 grams of rice, 100 grams dal, sambar and pickle. “Annapurna meal is being provided to thousands of students, employees and migrant labourers belonging to other states, who got stranded because of the ongoing lockdown,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-eggs-dal-rice-potato-dish-for-migrants-at-andhra-relief-camps/story-A1V4PENLpXZum6RvUZQKiO.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Centre asks states to allow vendors to sell essentials||The Centre on Friday has issued an advisory to states to allow authorised urban street vendors to sell essential items during the ongoing 21-day nationwide period, which has been enforced to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, in a bid to ensure their livelihood and encourage home delivery of basic commodities of daily needs. The advisory comes at a time when a massive supply crunch of consumer items has escalated across states, as buyers of all hues are scouring markets for daily needs, during the lockdown, which started on March 25 and is likely to end to April 15.“The urban street vendors are facing the risk of losing their livelihoods during the lockdown. They play an important role in the supply of essential items such as groceries, fruits and vegetables to people at affordable prices,” according to a letter written by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to the chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories. The letter said district authorities have been encouraged to facilitate home delivery and minimise movement of people outside their homes during the lockdown.It is advised that the street vendors carry valid identity cards or certificates of vending may be allowed to carry on their business subject to restrictions imposed by the district authorities in a bid to encourage home delivery of essential items such as groceries, fruits and vegetables, the advisory noted. Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) have identified street vendors as per provisions of the Street Vendor’s Act, 2014, and issued certificates of vending and identity cards, the ministry said. “These street vendors need to ensure cleanliness of their carts, personal hygiene, regular use of sanitiser and follow other social distancing norms. These operations will be subject to restrictions imposed by district authorities. However, restrictions will continue on street food vendors, as they may result in the congregation of people and violations of lockdown,” Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Puri said.The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on March 29 ordered states to allow transportation of all goods during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-asks-states-to-allow-vendors-to-sell-essentials/story-8DXlRpEzwIrudyhH4a7ePO.html
03-04-2020||India||IIT Roorkee thanks corona warriors with special face shields to block Covid-19||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee has developed a low-cost 3D printed face shield to protect medical practitioners from coronavirus infection while they are busy treating patients. The face shield has been developed by a group of three professors and staffers of the institute at its technical facility named ‘The Tinkering Laboratory’, which encourages innovations and experiments by the students, said IIT officials.Professor Akshay Dvivedi, co-ordinator, The Tinkering Laboratory, said the face shield is “based on the design of spectacles with a 3D printed frame. This protective gear could be used by the frontline health staffers who are involved in treating the patients.”“The 3D printed frame consists of a transparent sheet attached to it to protect the face which could be replaced,” said Dvivedi.He added that the gear was a “token of thanks” to the health professionals for their services in these times of crisis.The professor said the cost of developing the face shield was close to Rs 45.“Of the total cost, the transparent sheet costs Rs 5. If mass-produced, the cost of the whole product could come down to Rs 25,” he said.He added that doctors at AIIMS Dehradun were also consulted and modifications were made to the shield according to their suggestions and needs.“We will soon be sending the first batch of 100 such face shields to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh. We have also received demand for the face shields from another state-based medical university and we will make some for them also,” he said.Lauding the effort of IIT for the face shield, AIIMS Rishikesh director, Dr Ravi Kant said, “IIT Roorkee’s product would be of great use for not only the health workers of AIIMS Rishikesh but for the whole country. It is a valuable innovation in this hour of need.”Click Here for Latest Reports on Coronavirus||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-roorkee-thanks-corona-warriors-with-special-face-shields-to-block-covid-19/story-4QwxUqFVPbUEBfBCiwSiuK.html
03-04-2020||India||Air India pilot unions oppose 10% cut in employees’ allowances||State-owned Air India’s pilot unions on Friday opposed the 10 per cent cut in employees’ allowances, terming the decision as “unequal” and that goes against the spirit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to the companies to ensure that the salaries of the employees are not slashed amid the coronavirus pandemic.In a joint letter to Air India chief Rajiv Bansal on Friday, the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) and Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) said the reduction in allowance was against the labour and employment ministry’s advisory to all employers of public or private establishments not to terminate their employees or reduce their wages.The letter read: ‘By effecting a 10% cut on allowances for all employees, the category that has been affected the most are pilots. Flying related allowances of pilots’ wages, the directors and senior management executives have deviously exempted themselves from any meaningful austerity cut as their allowances are extremely small while pilots and cabin crew who are the front-line warriors flying and risking their lives, are forced to bear the maximum cut.’The airline pilots requested Bansal to advise the senior executive management to draw up fair cost cutting measures and not to manipulate the system to safeguard their salaries by burdening the front-line soldiers of the national carrier. “We are open to discussion on alternative. We hereby seek your urgent intervention,” the pilots said.“While all the other employees are paid in full, flying crew alone are made to bear the brunt with delayed flying allowance. Implementation of sham austerity measures to cut the flying allowances on top of all this would be adding insult to injury,” the pilots complained. Two days after Modi’s appeal during his televised address to the nation on imposition of a 21-day lockdown to curb spread of the coranvirus infection, Air India decided to reduce 10% of allowances paid to all employees, except cabin crew, for a period of three months to tide over the economic fallout of Covid-19. The reduction, however, did not impact the basic pay, house rent allowance and variable dearness allowance.With inputs from agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-pilot-unions-oppose-10-cut-in-employees-allowances/story-EcDP3CW8rYpmpLV7UF8n7K.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Govt updates online farm trading platform for easier harvest sale||The Union government has updated the electronic national agriculture markets or the E-Nam, an online trading platform, with two new software updates so that farmers don’t have to travel long distance to sell their harvests, the agriculture ministry has said. Two software modules – warehouse-based trading module to facilitate trade from warehouses and farmer producer organisations’ module – are aimed at reducing the need physically move entire harvests to aggregators to contract a sale. The move has been initiated in the wake of the 21-day nationwide lockdown imposed to stop the spread of Covid-19. This essentially means farmers will be able to access buyers through the mobile software from nearest warehouses. The second update aims to allow farmer collectives to connect to the E-NAM network from their own collection centres.A chain of electronic national agricultural markets, called e-NAM, serves an online trading system. Farmers only have to bring a small sample of their produce, which is then evaluated by agricultural “assayists”. Once graded by assayists, the sample report can be accessed by any buyer in any state. Many southern states have scaled up the system. “FPO trading module in e-NAM whereby FPOs can trade their produce from their collection centre without bringing the produce to APMC,” a statement from the ministry said.An enhanced version of logistic module has been incorporated into the online trading module. Aggregators of transport logistic platform have been “on boarded” on it, which helps users to avail trackable transport facilities for transporting their produce, the ministry said.The e-NAM facility was launched on 14 April 2016 as an all-India electronic trade portal linking markets across She States. There are 585 mandis in 16 States and two Union territories that have been integrated on the e-NAM portal. Farmer collectives can upload a picture of their produce and quality parameters from their premises to help distant bidders to visualise the produce before bidding. They have the option for delivery of produce either from their premises or by bringing to mandi premise after successful bidding. This will not only decongest the mandis but also reduce the logistics cost for the farmer producer organization, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-govt-updates-online-farm-trading-platform-for-easier-harvest-sale/story-4YyUQpK79qt5Zuf0dPsglJ.html
03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus rapid testing: All you need to know including testing criteria||India has allowed faster and cheaper antibody tests which are also being referred to as rapid tests to detect coronavirus disease in hot spots--about 20 clusters of infections in the country currently and 22 others with the potential to turn into one. This will not only increase the overall testing capacity and cut costs but will also lead to quicker response to aid containment efforts. The antibody tests or rapid tests do not require testing a throat or a nasal swab from a suspected patient and are done by testing a patients’ blood sample, serum or plasma using simpler testing kits. Here are some important facts about rapid testing. 1. The test process in use till now is called PCR or polymerase chain reaction which identifies the Sars-CoV-2 virus from the throat or nasal swab samples of suspected patients. The PCR test results can take up to five hours while the antibody test results will be available in 15-30 minutes.2. The antibody test will test blood samples of people in the hotspots to see how many have been infected including those with mild or no symptoms. This is crucial to assess the percentage of infected people who have managed to defeat the virus without significant medical intervention. Such people could also be referred to as “corona-blockers”.3. Those who test positive in rapid test or antibody test will be tested for confirmation through RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) using throat or nasal swab. This means positive results will be reconfirmed using the PCR test.4. Now let’s understand how the rapid test works- The antibody test uses a blood sample to detect antibodies against coronavirus in a person’s immune system. Presence of coronavirus antibodies would establish that the person was either infected in the near past or is infected currently.5. Antibody test or the rapid tests are part of the standard testing protocol for several infections including dengue and chikungunya and the Indian testing laboratories have sufficient understanding and experience of carrying out these tests. On top of it, these testing kits can be produced on a mass scale in a relatively shorter span of time.Click Here for Latest Reports on Coronavirus6. Rapid testing kits to be used are being approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). These rapid tests are relatively simple to perform and interpret and therefore require limited test operator training. They may be intended either for use in hospital laboratories or near the point-of-care.7. There are two types of Covid-19 rapid tests currently in use globally or in development- direct SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection and indirect antibody detection tests. Antigen detection tests detect viral components present during the infection in samples like nasopharyngeal secretions but results from these tests have sometimes taken up to two days to reach the point of care, therefore, the antibody test, which detects the antibodies that later appear in serum/blood/plasma as part of the immune response against the virus, are being added to the testing mix for quicker detection and response.8. It must be noted that SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection tests have a limitation and are unable to detect Covid-19 in cases of recent infections as it can take up to 10 days or more after symptoms emerge for a detectable level of antibodies to build up in the patient. The rapid test can often be positive in a patient who has no symptoms of the disease since the antibodies stay in the blood long after the infection has cleared.9. Rapid tests are also considered to be less accurate and less sensitive than laboratory-performed diagnostic tests such as PCR, therefore, clinical validation is recommended.10. The rapid test detects IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole blood, serum or plasma samples that bind to the virus antigen present in the testing kit.Coronavirus live updates||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-rapid-testing-all-you-need-to-know-including-testing-criteria/story-CPFfLtx4cWMBxSPgjJa6MI.html

03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus: Andhra reports first Covid-19 death, finds Jamaat event link||The samples of a 55-year-old man, who died four days ago at the government hospital in Vijayawada, tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, making him the first fatality of the infection in the state.The deceased was the father of a person who attended the Tablighi Jamaat’s international congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi held between March 13 and 15 and returned home two days later, according to an official bulletin released by the state medical and health department on Friday afternoon.“The deceased was brought to the hospital in Vijayawada at around 11.30 am on March 30. He was suffering from hypertension, diabetes and a heart condition. He died within an hour after being admitted to the hospital,” the bulletin said. The delay in identifying the reason for the death due to Covid-19 was because of the deceased’s multiple health complications, it added.The state government authorities said that it was revealed after the man’s death that his son had attended the Jamaat event. “We took his swab samples after we came to know of his son’s travel history. On Friday, it was confirmed that he had died of Covid-19,” the bulletin said.The son, who was also undergoing treatment at the hospital, tested Covid-19 positive on Tuesday. “Altogether, 29 people who got in touch with the son, have been quarantined. All of them have been tested,” it added.The flight details of the son have also been shared with the Central government, while further details about his travel history are being ascertained, the bulletin said.In a separate bulletin, the department said 12 new Covid-19 positive cases were reported in Andhra since Thursday night, taking the total tally to 161, of which three have been discharged after they fully recovered. Nellore district has recorded the highest number of cases at 32, followed by Krishna (23), Guntur (20), West Godavari (15) and Visakhapatnam (14).Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting with officials on Friday afternoon. At least 140 fresh Covid-19 positive cases have come to light that are all linked to the Jamaat meet, the officials said.Altogether 1,085 people from Andhra Pradesh had attended the event, but officials have identified 946 to date. Tests had been conducted on 881 people so far. While 108 of them tested Covid-19 positive, the results of 65 were still awaited and the remaining had tested negative.Besides the 946 people, who attended the Jamaat meet, another 616 were found to have got in touch with them. Among them, 32 people tested Covid-19 positive and results of another 335 were still awaited, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-reports-first-covid-19-death-links-it-to-jamaat-event/story-G78WcOmgcwMlBJRr6vtZxH.html
03-04-2020||India||PM’s address: Congress says critical questions weren’t answered||The Congress expressed disappointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Friday morning on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, saying he had dashed the hopes of the people who were expecting answers from him on critical questions such as concrete steps being taken to contain the spread of the pandemic.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the PM also did not specify steps that have been taken to revive the economy and on helping all those affected due to the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown that started on March 25.He questioned the low testing count in the country, saying it is the first step to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.Khera said the country was expecting answers from the PM on key issues such as an acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) like N95 masks and on helping the poor and migrant labourers, who are staring at an uncertain future because of the loss of their livelihood, lack of food and money.“Respected prime minister, today when you addressed the nation, we expected you to make some announcements and share some information with the country,” he told a press conference via video-conferencing.“The country was dejected today, people did not get any information they were expecting from you on critical questions,” Khera said.People will support the PM in switching off lights and lighting candles, just as they did while clapping for doctors and paramedics on March 22, but some questions need to be asked and answered, he added.“It is the responsibility of the government to provide that equipment and fixed responsibility for the delay in doing so. The poor, migrant labourers and farmers for whom you want us to light a candle also deserve to have fire in their stove. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure this,” the Congress spokesperson said.Khera said the nation expected Modi to announce that PPE have been made available for hundreds and thousands of doctors and medical staff, who are the frontline workers in this grim battle against the pandemic while risking their own lives.“Today the country expected you to declare that Rs7,500 will be deposited in Jan Dhan accounts, in PM Kisan scheme accounts and pension accounts. Job cardholders of MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) were expecting you to announce an advance payment of three months. State governments were hoping that you would announce the payment of GST (Goods and Services Tax) dues,” he said.“In a country with a population of over 130 crores we have tested less than 50,000 people. As the PM it becomes your duty to inform the country of steps being taken to increase the number of tests. Testing is the first critical step towards containing coronavirus.”Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel also tweeted, “Our ppl are making immense sacrifices & showing tremendous resilience. However, relief measures put in place by govt aren’t reaching them. Govt must focus on last-mile delivery. Repeatedly asking ppl to engage in dramatics w/o concrete efforts will be futile in the current situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-s-address-congress-says-critical-questions-weren-t-answered/story-ORPrMA1oxvc7Q0cemZExyL.html
03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus in Kerala: How a young IAS officer helped Pathanamthitta fight Covid-19||Pathanamthitta, a hilly district in central Travancore region in Kerala and home to the Sabarimala shrine was among the first sites in the country where coronavirus spread after a family that had returned from Italy tested positive for Covid-19 in early March. However, the district now has only 13 of the 286 positive cases in the state. By comparison, Kasargod has 121. According to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, while Kasargod remains in the hotspot list of the union health ministry, Pathanamthitta has been removed from it.One of the main persons responsible for this containment is a 2012 batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer, PB Nooh, who serves as the district collector of Pathanamthitta. He raised an alarm with the state government after thousands of devotees congregated at Sabarimala to attend the monthly prayers that began March 13.This wasn’t received well by devotees and he faced much abuse on social media. “When Sabarimala temple was opened for monthly pooja in March, despite the Travancore Devaswom Board’s warning, at least 13,000 pilgrims came in four days. Milling pilgrims was not a good sign. In fact it was a recipe for tragedy. So I sent an SOS to the government to announce the closure of the temple,” Nooh told the Hindustan Times.On March 20, the state government disallowed pilgrims’ entry to the Sabarimala shrine following Nooh’s report suggesting restriction of entry in light of rising Covid-19 cases. The shrine will not reopen on March 28 as previously planned.The state saw a steady rise in the number of positive infections starting March 18, according to data provided by the state government: from 28 confirmed Covid-19 to the current 286.On March 10, the Travancore Devaswom Board president N Vasu had asked the public to not attend the monthly prayers at the temple; the state cabinet too called upon people to not hold large public gatherings, including weddings or festivals. This was barely days after local cases of Covid-19 began emerging from the state, and nearly a month after three imported cases — students who had contracted the virus at Wuhan and returned to the state — were detected.Pathanamthitta was the first district in the state to use flow charts to help trace the contacts of infected persons. The idea was to track where all the family, which had returned from Italy on February 29 and tested positive for Covid-19 on March 6, had travelled to and whom all they had met.On March 11, the administration released a flowchart titled Patient Flowchart Covid-19: P1 Cluster. It showed where all the family, comprising a middle-aged couple and their 24 year old son, had travelled to after landing at Kochi airport. By then, many relatives and friends of the family had tested positive too, prompting the administration to release the flowchart to the public. The family had visited a church, a post office, a jewellery shop and a hypermarket: many members of the public were at risk. The administration wanted to reach out to everyone whom the family had come in contact with — in all, 1300 were placed under observation. “Making the flow chart was a cumbersome process. Police, health workers, NGOs and political leaders all helped us in the process. This also raised the awareness level of the people,” Nooh said. All three members of the family and eight of their contacts, including a 95-year-old great grandfather, have recovered from Covid-19 and have been discharged from the hospital.Pathanamthitta was first to introduce a geofencing application to locate quarantine violators. This application is now being used across all the districts’ control rooms to monitor the spread of coronavirus. Once installed on a person’s phone, it alerts authorities if they step out of their house, and even tags the location they are at. “It is teamwork and many of us have spent sleepless nights. We have received full support from the government. We literally chased contacts and enforced norms ruthlessly. In such a situation we can’t go soft and now this has started showing some results,” said Nooh, who is the seventh of eight children of a couple that owned a small grocery shop in Perumbavoor in Ernakulam. One of Nooh’s older brothers, PB Salim, is an IAS officer from the West Bengal cadre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-young-ias-officer-helped-pathanamthitta-fight-covid-19/story-QIYoZ7TqbsU7r0jmYpbQrL.html
03-04-2020||India||Nearly one-third of Covid-19 cases in India from Jamaat cluster, says govt||The Central government on Friday pointed out that nearly one third of India’s coronavirus positive cases were from the Tablighi Jamaat cluster of individuals comprising of Nizamuddin congregation attendees and their contacts. A senior health ministry official added that the lockdown measures had otherwise ensured that there was no dramatic rise in infections.“From yesterday till today, 336 additional cases of Covid-19 have come before us. Total confirmed cases are 2301, 56 deaths have been reported,” said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary Health Ministry.He went on to say that close to six hundred and fifty of these positive cases were reported in the last two days from the Tablighi Jamaat cluster.“647 confirmed positive cases found in the last two days are linked to Tablighi Jamaat from 14 states. These states are Andaman & Nicobar, Assam, Delhi, Himachal, Haryana, J&K, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand and UP,” Agarwal added.Agarwal added that it was evident that the number of positive cases in the country was not rising (by much) due to positive results from the lockdown measures until these recent cases came up. He said now, there was a need for a renewed effort and additional care to ensure that the cases don’t spike dramatically.The home ministry official present at the daily briefing on the status of the spread of the disease and government’s containment efforts said that around 360 foreigners who had returned to their countries after attending the Jamaat at Nizamuddin will also be blacklisted.“960 foreigners have been blacklisted, the process to blacklist around 360 foreigners who attended the Jamaat meet but have now returned to their countries, has also begun,” said Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary, ministry of home affairs.Action against these foreign nationals was being taken under the Disaster Management Act and the Foreign Management Act. She added that any steps for deporting the blacklisted foreign nationals will be done in accordance with the necessary health protocols that are in effect due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak.A home ministry document had earlier indicated that foreigners from at least 41 countries had attended the Nizamuddin meet in violation of their visa conditions. Most of these attendees had arrived on a Tourist visa but yet utilized their stay to attend a religious meet.In other important announcements, the home ministry official said that states have been instructed by the Centre to take strict action to ensure the safety of the medical fraternity involved in fighting coronavirus. The instruction is a fallout of incidents of attack and ill-treatment of health professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-one-third-of-covid-19-cases-in-india-from-jamaat-cluster-says-govt/story-GFzdtf2FtRhjnhWzRj83yM.html
03-04-2020||India||‘With full weight of law’: MHA orders FIRs against 960 foreign Jamaat workers, sponsors||The Union Home Ministry has told Delhi Police Commissioner and state DGPs to start filing FIRs against the 960 Tablighi Jamaat’s foreign workers who endangered lives in the ongoing Covid-19 public health emergency.The Home Ministry communication was sent to states on Thursday evening after revoking visas of the 960 foreigners and blacklisting them from getting an Indian visa again.According to the home ministry, these foreigners had entered the country on the strength of tourist visas but engaged in Tablighi activities at its Nizamuddin headquarters that are feared to drive the outbreak despite an unprecedented lockdown.The Tablighi Jamaat’s gathering in March has been found to be responsible for hundreds of Covid-19 infections across India. In Delhi, it has been linked to 60 per cent of Delhi’s 293 Covid-19 cases confirmed till Thursday evening.Their activities, the letter noted, “have endangered many lives in the ongoing Covid-19 public health emergency” and violated India’s visa rules and the Foreigners Act.“In view of the above, it is advised that legal action against all these foreigners and Indian nationals involved in the matter must be taken under the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 as well as for violation of statutory orders issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and for offences committed under relevant sections of IPC (Indian Penal Code) as applicable in this matter,” the letter by the home ministry’s Pratap Singh Rawat said.A senior Home Ministry official told HT that the decision to file FIRs reflected the determination of the government to come down on the Jamaat “with the full weight of law” to penalise them for their callous approach.“The government took unprecedented decisions, shut down industries, offices, grounded planes and trains. But this group’s actions have threatened to jeopardise the entire lockdown,” the official said.He clarified that the government did not intend to file cases against ordinary Tablighi workers if they stayed on the right side of the law.The idea, he explained, was to proceed against Tablighi functionaries who facilitated the visas and stay of the foreign nationals. He declined to elaborate.But a senior police officer interpreted this to imply the leadership of the Tablighi Jamaat. The Delhi Police has already registered one case against the Tablighi leadership after a large number of coronavirus cases were detected at the Markaz and evacuated.This advice to register criminal cases would not apply to another 360 Tablighi Jamaat’s workers have already left the country. But they will be blacklisted from entering the country again.A home ministry official explained the police could invoke Section 269 and 270 of the penal code that prescribes upto six months imprisonment for negligence likely to spread infection of a dangerous disease and two years jail for a malignant act that spreads a dangerous disease.Besides, the home ministry letter said the foreign nationals were also liable to face action under the Foreigners Act and Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-with-full-weight-of-law-mha-orders-firs-against-960-foreign-jamaat-workers-sponsors/story-IoYJSlbehSUxV84d8Zj5tJ.html

We can’t think about what should be done after the lockdown is removed,” Deb said in a video message on Twitter.The lockdown will end on April 14.As he made the request, the chief minister gave an analogy of about parents think before choosing a school for their children. People take into account the number of teachers and facilities the school and also think about whether they can afford the fee before zeroing in, he said.“That’s why you have to suggest what should the first 100 steps that the state government must take… because we have faced losses and pushed back due to the lockdown,” he said.Also read: Tripura gives Ratan Tata a wish list to fight coronavirusThese ideas, he said, can be sent to the CM dashboard, email ID of the chief minister’s office and on WhatsApp numbers of government officials“We may receive hundred and thousands and lakhs of ideas but we will choose only the 100 best ideas,” Deb said. Deb also said the 26 people, who have returned from the Tablighi Jamaat’s event at Delhi’s Nizamuddin Markaz, have been sent to quarantine and no one has been found to be Covid-19 positive. “Though their reports came negative, we will conduct a re-test to confirm,” said Deb. The state government has quarantined 72 people, including the family members of Tablighi Jamaat.Deb has also ordered the sealing of the state’s borders with Assam to prevent the inter-state entry of anyone or transport barring those carrying essential goods. These vehicles would be screened properly before their entry into the state, he said.He also requested all religious leaders or gurus to share awareness about staying indoors in a video clip through social media for their followers. He hoped that if they do the same, many would respond to their appeal.After meeting health officials, including medical superintendent of government-run GBP Hospital, on Thursday, the chief minister said the number of patients in the hospital has come down from 1500 to 500 every day on an average amidst the lockdown.Also read:With fewer cases so far, North-east stays on maximum alert“As I asked the reason, the doctors said that people are learning to cope up with minor health-related problems from their own places,” he said. Deb added that his government has already started preparations to ensure the availability of medicines for blood pressure, dialysis, cancer, tuberculosis etc, both in shops and hospitals for the next one to two months.Officials said 165 people have been arrested and a fine of Rs 350,000 has been imposed on others for violating restrictions put in place by the state government from March 24 to March 31.The northeastern state has not reported any Covid-19 case till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-tripura-cm-seeks-ideas-from-people-to-recover-loss-after-covid-19-lockdown/story-0YNTzIvptJrSuUr64xmFfJ.html

03-04-2020||India||Covid-19 Impact: Radio sector reels under crisis; AROI seeks support from govt||The radio industry, one of the key industries to have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, on Friday appealed to the government to step in to help the sector that is staring at a huge financial crisis.In a letter to Union Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, the industry body of private FM channels Association of Radio Operators for India, or AROI, sought ‘a support package’ to help the sector “survive this crisis in the short term till the economy stabilises itself”.The association said the radio industry was already going through a tough phase with advertising revenue shrinking over the past year with a de-growth of 20%. “Further, post the lockdown the ad revenues have crashed 80%,” the AROI said.Harshad Jain, CEO – Radio and Entertainment, HT Media Ltd and Next Mediaworks. acknowledged that the government must be hard-pressed to deal with the public health emergency at hand. “But revenues are down by 80 per cent post Covid-19. Now the sector is under pressure to keep the kitchen fire burning,” he said.In a four-point SOS message to the government, the AROI asked the government for a one-year waiver on all licence fees and charges by the government and Prasar Bharti, restoration of government advertising on radio, besides clearing the long-pending payments from the Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity”. It also asked the government deferment of the advance regulatory payments for financial year 2021.Nisha Narayanan, Director and chief operating officer, Red FM and Magic FM said the industry was looking at government help to restore normalcy.“The radio industry is already seeing a financial slowdown that seems like it will grow quite exponentially in the months to come,” she said.Nisha Narayanan said the industry is “conscious that the government is dealing with multiple emergencies at the same time while facing this crisis”, these are “desperate times” for the industry that need support from the government.The AROI also underlined the many occasions the radio industry had risen to the occasion in times of crisis including the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Recently, it recalled, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, during an interaction with prominent radio jockeys, acknowledged radio as a critical media for educating the listeners, spreading awareness about Covid-19 and building positivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-crisis-hit-radio-industry-seeks-waiver-on-licence-fees-govt-support/story-mOQ6gXqanQrpSgsxWNnhRI.html
03-04-2020||India||IMA puts riders on govt order for OPD, emergency services at private hospitals||The Bihar chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has asked the state government to ensure availability of protective equipment and security of doctors before requesting the management of private hospitals and nursing homes to keep their outdoor patient department (OPD) and emergency services functional during the lockdown. The response comes in the wake of an order by Patna civil surgeon, Dr Raj Kishore Chaudhary, asking them to keep both the services functional in public interest.In his letter, dated April 1, a copy of which is available with the Hindustan Times, Dr Chaudhary mentioned about the formation of special teams under the district magistrate and the civil surgeon to check it. This has not gone down well among doctors.“The mention of special teams in the civil surgeon’s letter was unwarranted,” IMA-Bihar secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said in an e-mailed response to the civil surgeon Thursday.Dr Kumar said compelling doctors for extending medical consultation through OPD and emergency services, without ensuring availability of protective equipment for doctors, was fraught with risk, as it could lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases. It was for this reason, he said, the state health authorities had shut OPD services at hospitals till block level.The IMA, however, said Dr Kumar, had appealed to its members to continue with limited OPD and emergency services, after keeping their safety in mind.While urging the civil surgeon to provide protective equipment, which they were willing to procure, he said the government should deploy security guards for crowd management and ensuring safety of doctors and health workers if the mob became aggressive. The IMA secretary said the government should also constitute an expert committee at the state and district level, having representation of the IMA, before issuing any such advisory in future.Patna civil surgeon Dr Choudhary said he was yet to receive any such letter. However, IMA-Bihar senior vice-president, Dr Ajay Kumar, had shared with this reporter the screenshot of e-mail the IMA had sent to the civil surgeon.“Why do they (the IMA office-bearers) not talk to me directly? I am also a life member of the IMA, and will never want to harm the interest of doctors,” the civil surgeon said.“In the absence of public transport, not many patients will visit their clinics, unless absolutely essential. So, there is no question of crowding at their respective establishments. Since there are many private hospitals and nursing homes, all we want is to facilitate medical facility to the public in their respective area so that they do not have to travel on foot or other means of transport during the lockdown,” Dr Chaudhary said.“After all, doctors are meant to serve humanity, and this is an opportunity, they should rise to the occasion,” he signed off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-puts-riders-on-govt-order-for-opd-emergency-services-at-private-hospitals/story-QXGqlZiHRj36wEiJ0s9p4I.html
03-04-2020||India||Just talking and breathing can spread Covid-19, says US science panel||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can spread through just breathing and talking, said a high-level US scientific panel on Wednesday, suggesting that the virus that causes the disease is airborne and is spreading more easily and sustainably between people than previously believed.The scientists said the virus can be stay suspended in air in the ultrafine mist that is produced when people exhale. “While the current specific research is limited, the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolisation of virus from normal breathing,” said the letter, written by Dr Harvey Fineberg, who is the chair of National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s standing committee of experts to inform the US federal government on critical science and policy issues related to emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats. “This could explain why the virus is spreading so quickly, and with evidence of asymptomatic spread of the disease, complete social isolation and lockdowns become critical to contain the disease,” said a virologist, requesting anonymity.Airborne viruses and bacteria, particularly, are more contagious and worrying for highly populated countries like India, where cluster outbreaks have started in congested neighbourhoods, like Dharavi in Mumbai. Around Covid-19, 2,600 cases and 70 deaths have been reported in India so far.“From what is known, the virus that causes Covid-19 is not as infectious as measles or the tuberculosis bacterium, but more infectious than the seasonal flu,” said Dr Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Scientists have so far maintained that Sars-Cov2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spreads when infected people cough or sneeze and expel virus in large respiratory droplets that are about 1 mm in diameter. The viral released depends on how infective the person is.The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, cough and fatigue, which progresses to difficulty in breathing.The infection spreads when these droplets are inhaled by people in a radius of two metres, or contaminated surfaces and objects, which people may touch and then infect themselves by touching their mouth, nose, or eyes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).But a study in the New England Journal of Medicine forced a rethink when it reported the virus stay suspended and infective in aerosol droplets that are below 5 microns across for up to 3 hours.A scientific brief last week from the WHO said aerosol transmission “may be possible in specific circumstances and settings that generate aerosols,” such as when severely ill patients are intubated with a breathing tube for ventilator support, but added that an analysis of more than 75,000 coronavirus cases in China revealed no cases of airborne transmission.Another recent study from the University of Nebraska Medical Center found viral RNA on hard-to-reach surfaces and air samples more than 2 meters from the patients in isolation rooms, which indicates the virus can spread through aerosols.“Finding RNA in the environment using PCR-based tests is not a scientific way of measuring transmission as finding nucleic acid (genetic material, which includes DNA and RNA) is not indicative of virus viability. RNA by itself is not transmissible and infective. The outer wall of the virus, which is what it uses to enter human cells, gets destroyed pretty quickly,” said Dr Jacob John.If not used properly, personal protective equipment (PPE) could also be a source of airborne contamination, with a pre-print study from China showing the virus can be re-suspended in air when health workers remove their PPE or move around in infected areas.Several countries are reviewing whether everyone should wear masks in public to reduce transmission. “Of course you need protection, but basic precautions are enough. Everyone is wearing masks, but I still think social distancing and handwashing is what’s needed, unless you are around a person with Covid-19,” said Dr John.“I’m not going to wear a surgical mask, because clinicians need those. But I have a nice western-style bandana I might wear. Or I have a balaclava. I have some pretty nice options,” Dr Fineberg, former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-talking-and-breathing-can-spread-covid-19-says-us-panel/story-wE8v7EZiCDF1AhQ5BQBdsN.html
03-04-2020||India||Mobile disinfection station installed in Jaipur to help sanitise staff fighting Covid-19||A mobile disinfection station has been launched in Rajasthan’s capital Jaipur for quick sanitization of essential services professionals. It has been commissioned by the Jaipur city police in collaboration with homeopathic doctors and other medical experts.The first of its kind station modeled after automobile washing stations has been put up at the Bagru Bus stand in the city, officials said.Bagru police station’s station house officer (SHO) Brijbhushan Agarwal said the chamber is an important component among the array of measures implemented for containment of infectious diseases like coronavirus.“After doing a lot of research online, I was stuck with the disinfection station idea. Initially, my colleagues dismissed my idea and said that such facilities could only be tested in foreign countries. This made it a challenge for me to create a model chamber so that NGOs, local bodies, mechanics and others can also follow this,” said Agarwal.The Bagru police station called a meeting of the community liaison group (CLG) and the friends of police and shared the idea. The CLG and the friends of police group comprise of fabricators, doctors, teachers, painters, iron smith and other professionals.“All the CLG members gave a nod to implement the idea, and the chamber was created within three-days,” added Bagru SHO.The chamber is designed for easy installation and can be transported to any location after it is uninstalled. Its main component is a 360-degree fog mist sprayer that uses an anolyte solution, a powerful disinfectant against bacteria and viruses.“After consulting with doctors and medical experts, the solution to be used for the chamber/station was decided. A 100 ml solution comprises of five ml Azadirachta Indica, five ml Ocimum Tenuiflorum, five ml Calendula, 15 ml spirit and rest pure water. One needs to push the pedestal inside the chamber for activating the spraying of disinfectant,” Agarwal said.It only takes 30 seconds to complete a round of disinfection in each chamber. The cost of creating one chamber was around Rs 16,000. Due to the lockdown, at present only essential services personnel are using the station.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), West, Kavendra Sagar lauded the disinfection chamber idea as unique and innovative. He said it would definitely help.“In future, we would try to replicate this model at multiple places in Jaipur which would be helpful for common man,” Sagar said.In March, a university in Vietnam had successfully created such a chamber for use in Covid-19 affected areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mobile-disinfection-station-installed-in-jaipur-to-help-sanitise-staff-fighting-covid-19/story-Sj3fQjgMNe6f4hWHxzpKIK.html
03-04-2020||India||How Indian missions and groups in Europe are helping stranded citizens||India’s missions across Europe have taken several steps to help thousands of citizens affected by Covid-19-related restrictions, organising medical consultations, facilitating visa extensions and conducting webinars to address the issues of students and professionals.The external affairs ministry was one of the first ministries to put in place a Covid-19 cell that works round the clock and is manned by some 75 officers, with smaller groups dedicated to specific geographical regions. At the same time, the foreign missions have taken steps to evacuate and assist stranded Indian nationals.The high commission in London has had to assist thousands of Indians, including students, professionals on short-term visas and tourists, and the main challenges were addressing concerns related to accommodation, food, health care, and visa extension, said people familiar with developments.The high commission worked with NGOs, student bodies and community support groups to assist stranded Indians with subsidised accommodation and food. Indian citizens needing medical help were given three options - telephonic consultations through local voluntary associations, consultations with the mission’s empanelled doctors or consultation with private hospitals through an app, the people said on condition of anonymity.In Germany, which is among the countries hit hardest by the pandemic with more than 67,000 infections as of March 31, the mission in Berlin and consulates in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich have been addressing the concerns of stranded Indians, including 22,000 students.As part of efforts to counter unverified information and rumours, the mission and consulates’ helplines have attended to more than 5,000 phone calls and 2,500 emails. “Phone calls were received from people, mostly young students, who were just feeling lonely and were wanting to talk to someone,” said a person who declined to be named.The embassy and consulates have issued regular video messages on the latest developments and instructions of the governments of India and Germany, and interactive weekly webinars hosted by the mission, with separate sessions for students and the larger Indian community, have got a good response.Around 60 Indian associations, including 30 student bodies, across Germany are supporting stranded Indians, including caring for the elderly and those requiring medical assistance.​In Switzerland, the Indian mission created a database of stranded tourists, other travellers and students so that they could be updated on health advisories and other information. Indian associations in different parts of Switzerland were activated and a network of volunteers in all major cities was created.The mission also contacted city mayors and university teachers across Switzerland to help students and others with food, accommodation and extension of visas and residence permits.The embassy in the Netherlands too has assisted stranded citizens, especially students and a group of 115 Indians that was stranded at Amsterdam airport for several days. This group was flown to India on March 22 in a special KLM flight. A woman official of the mission accompanied a pregnant woman who was part of the group for emergency medical assistance.Thirty-four Indians are currently stranded in the Netherlands, including 20 visitors on short stay visas and transiting passengers, and 14 skilled workers hired by a shipyard in Groningen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-indian-missions-and-groups-in-europe-are-helping-stranded-citizens/story-KByIEi354ZmAADKS2J3MQL.html
03-04-2020||India||Cong-NCP slam PM Modi for appeal to light lamps, say ‘event management’ not needed||Two of the ruling parties which make up the coalition government in Maharashtra—the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have taken a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his appeal to light diyas and candles on Sunday to show solidarity for health workers. The political parties have said that when the prime minister was expected to speak about the measures being taken by the central government to fight Covid-19 effectively, he has resorted to ‘event management’. Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said that the Bharatiya Janata Party is addicted to making an event out of any major issue that the country comes across. “We had expected that the prime minister will stand firm by the doctors, medical staff and police force fighting against the pandemic from the frontline. He should have unveiled a plan of providing additional testing labs, ventilators and financial assistance to states in their fight against the coronavirus. Instead of this, the PM has been engaged in event managements like clapping, banging utensils and lighting lamps,” he said.Thorat said that Modi’s appeal is unfortunately unbecoming of a leader who is the prime minister of the country. “The BJP has failed to show strong leadership which is needed during these challenging times,” he added.NCP’s spokesperson and state minorities minister Nawab Malik said that the nation expected the PM to speak about how to keep the home fires burning, but he spoke about lighting lamps. “The 9-am address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has disappointed citizens in the country, ” he said.State housing minister and senior NCP leader Jitendra Awhad has called it ‘stupidity’. “Is this some kind of a joke? The PM is not saying a word on where the country stands in this war against coronavirus, what are the preparations, what financial aides are being given to states, what are the facilities being created to combat the virus. He should have spoken about the diagnostic centres added and the problems being faced by migrants. When other countries are engaged in production of necessary medical equipment and inventing vaccines, our prime minister is busy giving people ‘sedatives’ like lighting lamps and banging thalis,” he said. But, NCP MLA and party chief Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar has expressed contrary views to that of his party colleagues. “Prime Minister @narendramodi ji is aiming to bring the country together through lights and if so, we should welcome this thought. Likewise, as a citizen of this country I urge you to place the flag of our country as a DP of your social media accounts for a message of solidarity(sic),” Rohit has tweeted.Reacting to the allegations, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Madhu Chavan said, “It is a gesture to create a feeling of unity among the people of the country. During the 1965 war, then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri had appealed to people to observe a fast for one day in solidarity with the people who couldn’t get food to eat. The entire nation stood by him. Congress and NCP leaders are criticising the PM for not talking about the preparations by the central government. I want to ask you, what contribution has the state government made in this fight against Covid-19?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-ncp-slam-pm-modi-for-appeal-to-light-lamps-say-event-management-not-needed/story-aY65V8pPBmXtxjZO8u1C2H.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on March 19 asked people to follow the Janta Curfew’ from 7am till 9pm on March 22 to show individual ‘determination’ to fight the global pandemic.2. Narendra Modi has asked people to keep the ‘Covid warriors’ in mind who have been fighting the coronavirus pandemic without thinking about their own families. “While staying at home, remember and pray for people who are working while putting their lives at risk. Remember the doctors, nurses, paramedics and pathologists who are working day and night to save lives and hospital administration, ambulance drivers, ward boys, serving others in these tough times.”3. Prime Minister has stressed on the need to put off elective surgeries and non-emergency visits to hospitals to ensure the medical personnel busy fighting the coronavirus pandemic do not have to share the extra burden.4. Modi has also called upon industry leaders to continue following the work-from-home order as much as possible.5. The PM has also emphasised that “testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine” should remain the focus areas of the local administrations.6. Prime Minister Modi has time and again urged people to follow social distancing. “Experts are saying that social distancing is the only way to deal with the coronavirus crisis across the globe. There is no other way to deal with coronavirus and we need to save ourselves. And we have to break the cycle of its infection,” the Prime Minister has said.7. He has asked people to be cautious against rumours and not to fall to superstition at a time when he said hundreds of people are working to fight the coronavirus outbreak. “Friends, at such a time you should be cautious, as knowingly or unknowingly rumours spread fast. They have a tendency to travel fast. I appeal to you, do not believe in such rumours and superstitions,” he said.8. The Prime Minister has said it is very important for people to follow the instructions and advice of the medical fraternity. “Please do not take any medicine with consulting any doctor. Any such carelessness can put your life in more danger. I am sure that every citizen will follow the directions of the government and local administration,” he said.9. He has stressed on following the Lakshman Rekha as he announced the complete lockdown. “If you put even one foot out, coronavirus will enter your homes,” he has said.10. Modi has asked media owners and editors of mainstream print media to “act as a link between government and people and provide continuous feedback” on the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. The Prime Minister has emphasised “it was important to tackle the spread of pessimism, negativity and rumour. Citizens need to be assured the government is committed to countering the impact of Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-10-appeals-pm-modi-has-made-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-u1hbkf4So9SxLNOgnuw3fJ.html

03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Women to get Rs 500 per month from today under PM Jan Dhan Yojana||At least 200 million poor women account holders under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) can start withdrawing Rs 500 from Friday for the next three months as part of the government’s measures for those worst hit by the 21-day lockdown to break the chain of coronavirus infection.The first instalment of Rs 500 was deposited in accounts of these women beneficiaries on Wednesday under the recently announced Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.The department of financial services, under the Union finance ministry, has issued guidelines to all banks to ensure the beneficiaries do not start lining up at the bank branches against the norms of social distancing.“In order to maintain social distancing and orderly withdrawal of money by beneficiaries, the Department of Financial Services (DFS) has directed the banks to stagger the arrival of account-holders at branches, BCs (business correspondent) and ATMs for withdrawal of money,” it said in a release.So, these women will get the remittance under the scheme between April 3 and April 9. The money will be put into their bank accounts according to the last digit of their Jan Dhan account numbers.Account numbers that end with 0 or 1 will receive money on April 3, while those with 2 or 3 as last digits will get the amount on April 4. Similarly, account holders with 4 or 5 as the last digits will get the remittance on April 7. The money will be deposited in account numbers ending with 6 or 7 on April 8. Account numbers with 8 or 9 as their last digit will receive the remittance on April 9.“After April 9, the beneficiaries may go to the branch or BC on any date as per normal banking hours. Banks may accordingly phase out the credit to beneficiary accounts,” the release said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also told chief ministers in a video conference on Thursday to “ensure the staggered release of funds to the beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana to avoid crowding at banks.”The banks have been asked to publicise the dates through text messages, local channels, print media, cable operators, local radio and other channels that the beneficiaries can withdraw the money any time when required and not just when it is credited.“… may also be carried out making clear that the money credited to the accounts is available for withdraw when required and if the beneficiary needs to draw the money immediately, she may approach the bank branch or BC as per the schedule mentioned…” it said. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had assured the payment while announcing the financial relief package of Rs 1,70,000 crore package of direct cash transfers and food for the poor to tide over the nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-women-to-get-rs-500-per-month-from-today-under-pm-jan-dhan-yojana/story-KxAb6jZRrPqUUvA2uNSwxI.html
03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus in India: Experts welcome Modi’s call for staggered lifting of Covid-19 lockdown||Public health experts have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion of a staggered lifting of the lockdown — but only if it is accompanied with a set of safety measures.In his interaction with chief ministers on Thursday, the PM had said that the Centre and states must work together to formulate an exit plan from the lockdown, with the staggered re-emergence of citizens. The three week national lockdown ends on April 14. “Since it is not possible to keep a country as huge as India under perpetual lockdown, and blanket withdrawal is not advisable at this stage of transmission, the next best option is to consider lifting it in a staggered manner,” says Pradip Chakraborty, senior advisor, Centre for Public Health and Food Safety.Chakraborty said that the areas which have reported a high number of cases — or the high-risk clusters — should remain under lockdown. “These are vulnerable pockets and need special government focus, or it can defeat the whole purpose of implementing the lockdown.” Earlier this week, the government had identified ten such high-risk clusters in the country. Experts say that the other factors in decision making must be an analysis of how the move will affect the transmission curve, and an analysis of whether India is better prepared to deal with a likely surge in cases. While the lockdown has reduced human interactions, and thus has opened the possibility of India “flattening the curve” of infections, it has come at an economic cost. The government’s challenge is in finding the right balance. CS Pandav, former president, India Public Health Association, said that the lockdown serves the important objective of breaking the chain of transmission. “If people do not travel, then chances of those infected infecting others will be cut down. Now that we have taken this brave decision, we must ensure the gains made aren’t reversed, and for that withdrawal in a measured way is the solution,”But he also points to the other side of the debate. “The reverse migration that we seen in past few weeks is unprecedented. This is one of the major side-effects of the move. This is also an important time in the agricultural cycle. Staggered lockdown is needed — otherwise the country will have super shortage of grains in months to come,” he says.The solution, according to him, lies in letting movement of workers only clusters, that too after thorough screening.“Movement should be in select groups after they have been approved by the authorities. Let clusters move, like army convoys move, especially agriculture workers. It will also help contain the risk of infection. Priortise who should be allowed to move, and those should be screened before movement, even if it requires aggressive testing to know the extent of infection,” added Pandav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-welcome-modi-s-call-for-staggered-lifting-of-covid-19-lockdown/story-UANPUc4zIepfEywzQgZhIL.html
03-04-2020||India||‘Cremating, burying bodies of Covid-19 patients is safe’: Bengal govt||There is no chance of transmission of coronavirus in crematorium or burial area, Mamata Banerjee’s Bengal government has said in an advisory to state officials and the public.The advisory came after instances of protests and chaos by residents living in the vicinity of cremation grounds. In one case, residents had put up road blockade to stop government officials from cremating an elderly man, Bengal’s first casualty. There had been similar protests elsewhere too.Three people have been confirmed to have died in Bengal due to coronavirus, according to data released by the Union health ministry.Follow latest updates on coronavirus hereThe Bengal health department advisory quoted from the World Health Organisation guidance and the Union health ministry guidelines to underline that there was no evidence of people becoming infected from exposure to bodies of persons who die from Covid-19.The advisory noted that the main driver of transmission of Covid-19 is through droplets. There is no risk of Covid-19 infection from a dead body to health workers, family members or in the locality who follow standard precautions while handling body“Temperature generated during burning of bodies is 800-1,000 degree celsius, under which, in no condition, can the virus remain viable,” it said. It also emphasised that there was no evidence either that the smoke generated from the pyre can cause Covid-19.“Hence, it is clarified that if the protocol prescribed for transportation and disposal of dead bodies of Covid-19 positive persons is followed, there is no risk of any coronavirus infection spreading from the dead body as result of cremation,” the notice said.But Bengal isn’t the only state that has had protests, fueled by the health scare around coronavirus and rumours.

This is the third case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) linked to the densely populated area.State government officials are trying to ascertain the travel history of a 35-year-old doctor, who tested positive a day ago. All 25 high-risk contacts of the surgeon are being tested for Covid-19. The rest of the residents of the building where he lives have been asked to remain in quarantine until the test results of the high-risk contacts are available. All 48 flats and three nursing homes in the building have been sealed in a santisation drive by the authorities. Dharavi reported two other Covid-19 positive cases in the last two days, involving a 56-year-old garment shop owner and a 52-year-old BMC sweeper.The garment shop owner, a resident of Dharavi’s Dr Baliga Nagar, had no foreign travel history but tested Covid-19 positive on Wednesday after he was admitted to Sion Hospital because of chest pain. And on Thursday, the sweeper, who worked in Dharavi and lives in Worli, tested Covid-19 positive. Civic authorities are trying to find a link between all three Covid-19 positive cases linked to Dharavi, considered to be one of the largest slums in Asia. The BMC authorities said the surgeon had called one of the private laboratories to get himself tested for Covid-19.“One of the private laboratories on the suburbs had tested the patient after he called. We’re preparing a list of senior citizens and those with respiratory issues. We’ll run a check on them individually to figure out how they’ve been doing,” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, BMC, said.On Wednesday, around 2,500 residents of Dr Baliga Nagar were also put under home quarantine after the garment shop owner tested Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-covid-19-case-linked-to-dharavi-sets-off-alarm-bells-in-mumbai/story-yRiv9bZuifHX77d1eMo1aK.html

The total number of Covid-19 cases in India has climbed to 2301 with 235 fresh cases being detected. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageHere is the full text of PM Modi’s video address:My dear fellow citizens,Today marks 9 days of the nationwide lockdown against the Corona pandemic. The discipline and spirit of service you have displayed during this period is unprecedented, and embodies the true meaning of both.Government, administration and the public at large, have together made great efforts to manage the situation as best as possible.The manner in which you had expressed gratitude to all those fighting against the Coronavirus on Sunday 22nd March, has today become an example for all countries. Many are replicating it now.Whether it is people’s curfew, ringing bells, clapping hands or clanging plates;they have all made the nation realize its collective strength in these testing times. It has led to the deepening of the belief that the nation can unite as one in the battle against Corona. This collective spirit of yours, of the nation, can be seen manifesting itself during these times of lockdown.Friends, today, when crores of people of this country are confined to their homes, it will be natural for anyone to question what they can do just by themselves.Some people may also be worried about how they are going to fight such a big battle on their own. Many will be concerned about how many more days they will have to spend like this.Friends, this is certainly the time of a lockdown, and we most certainly are confined to our own homes, but none of us is alone.The collective strength of 130 crore Indians is with each one of us, it is the strength of each one of us.It is required for our countrymen, to from time to time,experience the greatness, majesty and divinity of this collective strength.Friends, in our country the citizenry is considered a manifestation of God itself. Therefore, when the nation is fighting such a huge battle, one should from time to time keep experiencing this collective superpower manifesting itself in the form of the people.This experience boosts our morale, gives us direction and clarity, a common aim as well as the energy to pursue the same.Friends, amidst the darkness spread by the Corona pandemic, we must continuously progress towards light and hope. We must continuously strive to take those of us most affected, our poor brothers and sisters, from disappointment to hope. We must end the darkness and uncertainty emanating from the crisis, by progressing towards lightand certainty. We must defeat the deep darkness of the crisis, by spreading the glory of light in all four directions.And that is why, this Sunday, on the 5th of April, we must all together, challenge the darkness spread by the corona crisis, introducing it to the power of light.On this 5th of April, we must awaken the superpower of 130 crore Indians. We must take the super resolve of 130 crore Indians to even greater heights.On the 5th of April, on Sunday, I want 9 minutes from all you, at 9PM.Listen carefully, on the 5thof April, at 9 PM, turn off all the lights in your homes, stand at your doors or in you balconies, and light candles or diyas, torches or mobile flashlights for 9 minutes.I repeat, light candles or diyas, torches or mobile flashlights, for 9 minutes at 9 PM on the 5thof April.At that time, if you have turned off all the lights of your homes, and each one of us in all directions has lit a diya; we will experience the superpower of light, clearly illuminating the common purpose we are all fighting for.In that light, in that lustre, in that radiance, let us resolve in our minds that we are not alone, that no one is alone!130 crore Indians are committed,through a common resolve!Friends, I have one more prayer in this regard, that no one must assemble or gather anywhere while participating in this program. Please do not go out on to the roads, lanes or your localities, do it at the doorstep or balconies of your own homes. One must never cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ of Social Distancing. Social Distancing should not be breached under any circumstances.This is the only panacea to break the chain of Corona virus.So, on the 5th of April at 9 PM.Sit in solitude for some time and reminisce about Maa Bharati, picture the faces of 130 crore Indians.Experience the collective resolve, the collective superpower of 130 crore Indians.This will give us the strength to fight, as well as the confidence to win, in this hour of crisis.It has been said here that –Utsaho Balwaan Arya,Na Asti Utsaah Param Balam |Sah Utsahasaya Lokeshu,Na Kinchit Api Durlabham ||”Meaning, there is no greater force in the world than our passion and our spirit.That there is nothing in the world that we cannot achieve on the basis of this strength.Come, let us come together and jointly defeat this Corona virus, and make India victorious.Thank you very much!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-full-text-of-pm-modi-s-address-to-the-nation/story-uHmLh3XoIgvx2txawrMlkM.html
03-04-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi asks Congress-ruled states to increase testing for Covid-19||Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi has asked all party-ruled states, especially Rajasthan, to stress on increased testing for COVID-19 and added that apart from testing of suspects it should also be done on a random basis.According to sources, during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meet over the Coronavirus pandemic, Rahul in his remarks said that the Central government has adopted the technique of low testing, but the testing of people should be increased.He gave the example of two other countries fighting a battle with COVID-19 which had emphasised on mass testing and told Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot that random testing should be done in the state as it has a high influx of tourists. He also specifically mentioned the Ajmer District, which has a huge footfall of foreigners.A senior leader present in the meeting stated, “Rahul Gandhi has emphasised on more testing because the early the virus is detected, the easier it is to curb the chances of its transmission and provide timely treatment.”The CWC had attacked the Centre through a statement which said that the government has erred in adopting a strategy of limited testing.“A lockdown or any other kind of restrictions is futile unless it is accompanied by extensive testing. It is extensive testing that has yielded results in some countries. Inexplicably, we have not put to full use even our limited testing capacity. The flawed strategy must be revised and testing must be scaled up urgently,” the statement read.The CWC said the government must simultaneously undertake massive production and procurement of personal protection equipment, Hazmat suits, body overalls, goggles, gloves, N-95 masks, ventilators, etc., and make them widely available to doctors, nurses, health workers as also hospitals and all other personnel.It said medical infrastructure should be expanded on a war-footing with more isolation wards, hospital beds, testing labs, and quarantine facilities.Chief Ministers of several Congress-ruled states were present in the CWC meeting held via video-conferencing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-asks-congress-ruled-states-to-increase-testing-for-covid-19/story-JHevTOnONuc2HmYqg8PSnK.html
03-04-2020||India||‘Inhuman’: Shiv Sena slams Nizamuddin gathering in times of coronavirus||The Shiv Sena has criticized the Nizamuddin congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat members held in violation of the restrictions imposed on mass gatherings in view of the threat of Covid-19 community transmissions. The party which rules Maharasthra in coalition with the Congress and NCP, on Friday described the congregation, which has become a major source of infections across the country as “inhuman” act and added that no religious or national purpose was solved by holding of such an event, said news agency PTI.“What religious and national service have these people done by such a congregation in the name of Islam. In fact, it is inhuman and great disservice,” an excerpt quoted by the agency from editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana said.It also referred to the two conflicting accounts of the violation by Jamaat members and added that it was difficult to ascertain who between the Delhi police and the Jamaat officials was right in this matter.“What is truth only these two will know. But just like the police cleared the Shaheen Bagh protest area after the Delhi assembly polls, this event also could have been stopped using force,” the editorial said.Delhi police said they had warned the Jamaat members in Nizamuddin against mass prayers and gatherings but the organisers claim they had been denied permission by the police to move out, forcing them to stay inside. “This was a matter of national health and not religion. The Muslim community, too, would have supported such a move. Violating the lockdown is playing with other people’s lives,” the Saamna editorial quoted by PTI added.Central government yesterday said that over 9,000 people including the Jamaat members and other individual who they came in contact with have been identified across states and quarantined. The government said that 334 of Jamaat members had been found positive and admitted to hospitals.Sena mouthpiece highlighted the risk of transmission posed by such a huge religious gathering.“The programme saw congregation of over 5,000 people from 22 states in the country and eight foreign countries. Out of the 5,000 participants, 2,000 were foreigners, it said.Centre has begun action against the Jamaat and its leader Maulana Mohammad Saad, who has been booked under sections that punish offences that could lead to the worsening of an epidemic and for criminal conspiracy. Home minister Amit Shah said on Thursday the government has blacklisted 960 foreigners for their involvement in activities with the group while they were in India on tourist visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inhuman-shiv-sena-slams-nizamuddin-gathering-in-times-of-coronavirus/story-anxckzF55EkoMDdhysoFPK.html

But because it’s Federer at Wimbledon and that occurrence has often defied logic, his fans will still expect him to win it.Read more. Peacock displays impressive plumage, dances around in Mumbai.

03-04-2020||India||Covid-19 Update: Scientists bat for clinical trials in poor and middle-income countries||A team of scientists, physicians, funders and policymakers from over 70 organisations globally have called for an acceleration of research on Covid-19 in poor and middle-income countries where the disease can wreak havoc.The Covid-19 Clinical Research Coalition will work on accelerating clinical trials of vaccine and drugs in these countries among other interventions. The team which published a comment in The Lancet journal on Thursday, said the response of the research and science community to the pandemic has been vigorous but no so in poor countries.A review of clinical trial registries as of March 24 showed 536 relevant registered clinical trials. Of the 332 Covid-19 related clinical trials, 188 are open for recruitment and 146 trials are preparing to recruit. The distribution of these clinical trials is mostly in China and South Korea, with high-income countries in Europe and North America planning most of the forthcoming trials.The members of the coalition said research collaboration and coordination is urgently needed in African, Latin American, Eastern European, and certain Asian countries to respond to Covid-19.They also said that open science and data sharing principles need to be applied at all stages of Covid-19 including research by the private sector.“The FAIR guiding principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) for data should be implemented, and mechanisms put in place to enable equitable use and reuse of data,” they have said.The scientists have warned that certain healthcare systems could collapse due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, as there is very low availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) in these countries.“Disruption or complete breakdown of those health-care systems would result in high direct and indirect mortality since care of all illness would be affected,” they said.The coalition added that interventions being introduced in these countries will have to be affordable and regulatory clearance for importing products for drug and vaccine trials and ethical review needs to be expedited.“The Indian Council of Medical Research is conducting trials on drugs that can be re-purposed. They have also published the protocol in Indian Journal of Medical Research. In WHO’s solidarity trial more than 80 countries are participating. Our public health research infrastructure and capacity need to expand. The West already has such research facilities. I think India will be ahead of many in terms of vaccine development because some organisations are already looking at vaccine strains and suitable candidates for trials,” said Dr Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.The idea for the coalition came from Professor Nick White from Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit at The University of Oxford, Professor Philippe Guerin, from Infectious Diseases Data Observatory at The University of Oxford, and Dr Nathalie Strub Wourgaft, Director of Neglected Tropical Diseases at the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) according to the coalition’s website.Coronavirus live updates||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-scientists-bat-for-clinical-trials-in-poor-and-middle-income-countries/story-48k4aNqeZWdVQ7QaALzgpO.html

By last evening, the Union home ministry counted 9,000 Tablighi Jamaat workers and their contacts who had been located and quarantined.Top government officials who are closely associated with the mammoth exercise told Hindustan Times that they may just be looking at the tip of the iceberg.“It is a nightmare… a logistical nightmare and one that stares India right in the face,” one official said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here It started from a seven-storeyed building in central Delhi’s Nizamuddin, the Markaz. This has been the first stop for the Jamaat’s foreign workers who arrive in India before they set out into the hinterland for their preaching tours. Some of them from countries that had been exposed to Covid-19 and had picked up the infection.And then it spread. In the Markaz and later, across the country.Officials said the first priority for the establishment had been to trace nearly 960 foreign workers.The Tablighi Jamaat did maintain a register of all the foreigners who arrived, just as they had been told. “But there were far too many cases where the names and passport numbers were wrong, or misspelt,” a senior home ministry official said.Also read: In 4 years, India put 4,200 foreigners on visa blacklist for Tablighi activitiesIn the absence of proper documentation, officials had to touch base with the Jamaat coordinators in the country’s 700-plus districts to try to track down the foreigners.But the bigger challenge, the official said, lies in tracking down the Jamaat’s Indian followers.The Jamaat, which has grown into a religious movement across continents, has no proper records.“We are still in the process of reaching out to as many people as possible, as we can,” said a top official in the security establishment.But there were lakhs of people who attended the Jamaat’s congregations that have been held in parts of the country.Also read: Markaz leadership resisted, then NSA Ajit Doval dropped by at 2 am“How do you trace them, figure out who came in contact with the suspected or confirmed cases,” the official said, hoping that the nationwide lockdown would have helped minimise any further spread of infection from the Jamaat’s followers.India isn’t the only country that is seeing a surge of cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat. In neighbouring Pakistan, a gathering of 250,000 people at the Tablighi Jamaat’s meeting in early March has been linked to infections as far afield as Palestine and Kyrgyzstan.The Jamaat’s gatherings in Malaysia in February have been directly linked to over 600 of the country’s 3,000 odd cases.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-it-is-a-nightmare-why-tablighi-jamaat-linked-infections-have-the-centre-worried/story-43CFr0QeaPvTbCdoJsv8VI.html

We have named themCovid (boy) and Corona (girl) for now,” Preeti Verma, the 27-old mother of the newborns, told PTI.“The delivery happened after facing several difficulties and therefore, me and my husband wanted to make the day memorable.“Indeed the virus is dangerous and life-threatening but its outbreak made people focus on sanitation, hygiene and inculcate other good habits. Thus, we thought about these names,” she said, giving reasons for their unusual decision.“When the hospital staff also started calling the babies as Corona and Covid, we finally decided to name them after the pandemic,” she said.The couple, originally from Uttar Pradesh, resides in a rented house in the Purani Basti area of the state capital.“On late night of March 26, I suddenly experienced severe labour pain and somehow my husband arranged an ambulance operated under 102 Mahtari Express service.“As no vehicular movement was allowed on roads due to the lockdown, we were stopped by police at various places but they let us go after noticing my condition,” Verma said.I was wondering what would happen in the hospital as it was midnight, but fortunately doctors and other staff were very cooperative,” she said.“Our relatives, who wanted to reach the hospital, could not make it as bus and train services were stopped due to the lockdown,” said Verma, who already has a two-year-old daughter.The twins were born in Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital.Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the hospital, Shubhra Singh said, the mother and the newborns were discharged recently and they were in good health.As soon as Verma reached the hospital with her husband, arrangements were made to perform a caesarean section on her as it was a complicated case, Singh said.“Within 45 minutes of their arrival, the delivery was done successfully,” the PRO said.The twins had become a centre of attraction in the hospital after the couple named them as Covid and Corona, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/born-during-coronavirus-lockdown-raipur-twins-named-corona-and-covid/story-Rv8vyFY5jOQKcI5o6B2f6O.html

03-04-2020||India||Heroes then, heroes now||A decade ago, they made India proud with their sporting achievements. Now, they are making the country proud once again, this time, with their heroics in the crusade against the Covid-19 pandemic.Joginder Sharma, who made his name in history, after he bowled the twentieth over in the final of the ICC T20 game against Pakistan in 2007, is now a DSP, with Haryana Police. He has been on duty for over two weeks, which meant he couldn’t see his family. “It’s been 15 days, and I have come home today. The place where I’m posted is about an-hour-and-a-half drive away from my house. I am out for duty by 6am,” he says.“The stress of how we will manage this is more than the tension I had when I was bowling that final over. The government and the authorities are taking every possible step to make sure that this disease stays away from the entire country. It is my duty, to help them, and make my country safer,” he says, adding that he is “happy to see” the photos of him, on duty in the uniform, on social media which have gone viral, and feels that the popularity, will only “ spread the message” further.Just like Joginder, Akhil Kumar, who represented India in the Olympics in 2008, is now an ACP with the Haryana Traffic Police, and is posted in Gurugram. Apart from doing his duty, the 38-year-old boxer is also making sure that those, “who’ve been walking on foot to get to their homes” are given food and water. Akhil, ever since the lockdown’s announcement, has also been delivering food to those “who don’t have money and have been stuck inside” their homes. “Instead of getting them packed food, we give them ration. Not only is that cheaper, but is more in quantity, as well. Every day we are able to give some 70-80 packets. Each packet contains, atta, rice and dal,” he says.Both of them insist on not being called heroes. “What’s important is that people take this seriously. Our Prime Minister has requested everyone to practise social distancing. I, as a police officer and as a citizen of this country will make sure that this country is safe,” says Joginder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heroes-then-heroes-now/story-IeLPharNSsNqIdvRFZ0jCN.html

03-04-2020||India||With lakhs under home quarantine, Kerala employs counsellors to help quell anxiety||Kerala, one of the coronavirus pandemic hotspots in the country, has employed 950 counsellors to talk to more than 150,000 people under quarantine and 700-odd patients in hospitals to provide the much-needed support to cope with mental health issues.The counsellors work 24x7 in shifts answering to a number of calls from people with stress and anxieties and say a few of them may not need counselling but others need them desperately. The calls sometimes have patients shouting or crying and counsellors say fear is the key in most cases blended with stigma, outrage, anxiety and deprivation.They say the most frequently asked question is about safety and survival—whether they will be able to weather out the coronavirus pandemic—in the state which has reported 286 Covid-19 cases and two deaths till Tuesday. Patients and those under observation are allowed to use their mobile phones and most of them browse to know what is happening around on Covid-19 front and get nervous after reading about the situation. Also read: Over 500 new Covid-19 cases in a day in India; total number crosses 2,500So, counsellors often advise them not to read up about the respiratory illness and its after-effects and concentrate more on entertainment, sports and other sections.One of the counsellors in Kottayam answered a call by a man, who is more than 70-years-old, about a legal issue.“I have a property with crores of rupees. But I didn’t prepare a will. If I die there will chaos in my family. Will you help me prepare a will?” he asked.The counsellor said they tried their best to convince that he will come out in the best of his health. “But, initially he was not ready to buy my advice but later came around,” the counsellor said.They are not supposed to divulge the details of individual patient names or their locations.Also read: High court stops Kerala from liquor sales amid lockdown, says recipe for disaster“Some of them really need psychological counselling and some also show suicidal tendencies. People who repeatedly test positive often break down fearing they will never come out of the mess,” a psychologist, who is a part of the counselling team, said.“Our only solace is most of them have seen life and they have seen the world. So most of them understand things and come around quickly,” the psychologist said.Another psychologist said they engage them by slowly talking about general things and gradually come to their mental health. “At times some of them curse, shout, abuse or break down. But we slowly bring them back to reality and tell them it is just a passing phase they have to undergo. And some of them talk feverishly about their future plans,” the psychologist said.India’s first Covid-19 patient, a medical student who returned from the Chinese epicentre of Wuhan in China and tested positive three days later on January 30, also experienced similar emotions. “Once I broke down and showed some tantrums and health authorities soon brought my mother and lodged her in the next room. When I heard my mother’s voice after two weeks I cried a lot. Later, I recovered,” the medical student said. But she admits the number of Covid-19 patients could be counted on fingers, but not now.As the number of people under quarantine has gone up, the government is now planning to approach film stars and others to devote some time for them and many including some superstars have agreed to it.“It is an extraordinary situation. We need the help of all. We have approached many known personalities and they all pledged their help. We have to make patients and quarantined believe there is no stigma or taboo, it is a disease and anyone can get it,” KK Shailaja, the state’s health minister, said.Actor Mohanlal and Mammooty have appeared on a video stressing the need for social isolation and care. The government recently roped in former Indian football team captain IM Vijayan to talk to migrant workers.“Since I was there in West Bengal many years playing for some clubs I know Bengali and Hindi well. I know their anxiety and concern. So, when the government approached me I readily agreed to it,” said Vijayan, now an inspector with the Kerala Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-lakhs-under-home-quarantine-kerala-employs-counsellors-to-help-quell-anxiety/story-7kWuREW4v1Spzw9PcRDqoN.html
03-04-2020||India||Two nursing officers at Delhi State Cancer Institution test positive for Covid-19||Two nurses from the Delhi State Cancer Institute (DSCI) in Dilshad Garden tested positive for Covid-19 late Thursday night, just two days after a doctor from the preventive oncology department of the hospital tested positive for the infection.The report of the two nurses—one male and one female, both in their 40s—came back positive among the samples of around 19 staff members that were sent for testing on suspicion of coming in direct contact with the doctor.The out-patient clinic, that had been shut to sanitise the premises, will remain closed to ensure patients coming in do not get the disease.“Most of the patients coming in for their check-up right now are the emergent cancer patients whose immune system is weak as it is. We cannot open the OPD even if there is a chance that they might get the infection,” said Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of the hospital.Since the lockdown started only about 100 to 150 patients visited the clinics at the hospital. Usually, the OPD attendance is between 1,000 and 1,500.After the two nurses tested positive, the hospital is looking at testing all its symptomatic staff members. “Now that two others have tested positive, we are looking at getting all other staff members who might be symptomatic tested,” said Dr Sherwal.The hospital is also monitoring the 48 patients admitted to its wards for any symptoms of Covid-19.A 35-year-old doctor from DSCI had tested positive on Tuesday and was admitted to Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital, near his house. His wife and child were admitted to Lok Nayak hospital on suspicion of having the infection.It is, however, unclear where he got the infection from.“He has no history of foreign travel or treating any Covid-19 patients. So, the source of the infection is still a question mark. His brother and sister-in-law did travel to UK in February, but they haven’t tested positive for the infection,” said an official from Delhi government health department.This takes the number of healthcare workers affected in the city to at least ten. A doctor from the physiology department of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and his wife, who is none-months pregnant, tested positive for the disease on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-nursing-officers-at-delhi-state-cancer-institution-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-g84zq04kZd1eJeCwsz290J.html
03-04-2020||India||Maharashtra: No fresh Covid-19 cases recorded this morning, overall tally at 423||Maharashtra did not record any fresh coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive case on Friday morning, as the overall tally of the infected people stood at 423, including 20 deaths.On Thursday, 88 new Covid-19 positive cases were recorded of which 54 were in Mumbai and 11 in Pune.The state health department authorities said that the latest tally included cases that were diagnosed by private laboratories over the past few days.The spike in cases, which has been largely attributed to the Tablighi Jamaat’s international congregation at Nizamuddin in Delhi between March 13 and 15, has forced the state government to ramp up its preventive measures. The government has urged all districts and civic authorities to identify hotspots and containment areas across the state and proactively search for the Jamaat attendees.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that up to 1,400 people have been traced, who had links to the Jamaat meet. “We have traced the Jamaat attendees in their respective districts after we received a comprehensive list from the central government. We’ve all their details, and also all those people who came in contact with them,” the minister said. In Mumbai, the civic administration has traced 105 of the 127 people, who attended the Nizamuddin event, and quarantined them. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have circulated a ward-wise list to all its ward officers to track the 127 people. A search operation is on trace the remaining 22 missing people, said a senior BMC official. The civic body has sealed 212 containment zones and put them under closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, as Mumbai has emerged as the epicentre of Covid-19 outbreak in Maharashtra. In a video-conference meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi held on Thursday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray apprised him about the decisions being taken by the state government. Modi has hinted at not extending the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, which started on March 25. The PM also suggested that the lockdown can be lifted in a phased manner.Maharashtra has set up 30 new hospitals dedicated to Covid-19 patients that have a total bed capacity of 2,305 to prevent the viral outbreak.The state government also plans to start random antibody tests to ascertain the number of Covid-19 positive cases. Tope said the Centre has approved the proposal to entrust both state government and private agencies to carry out random antibody tests under the watch of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Each antibody test could cost up to Rs 400. On Friday morning, there was a surge of consumers at vegetable markets and grocery shops. Tope hinted that the government is planning to keep the markets and shops open on alternate days in a bid to reduce crowds at these places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-no-fresh-covid-19-cases-recorded-this-morning-overall-tally-at-423/story-Cnj2IumjCjH0VXzumZoU3N.html
03-04-2020||India||‘Incorrect info’: Spokesperson of Prince Charles on ayurveda treatment||Shripad Naik, the minister of state for AYUSH and Goa Lok Sabha MP, has said he has been informed that ayurvedic medicine has helped Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, recover from Covid-19 even as a spokesperson for the British royal in London denied the claim.Prince Charles, who tested positive for the disease last month, is reported to have recovered from the illness caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus and has since tested negative.“I got a call from Dr. Isaac Mathai, who runs the Soukya Ayurveda Resort in Bengaluru. He told me that his treatment of Prince Charles through ayurveda and homeopathy has been successful,” Naik told a press conference in Goa on Thursday. In a telephone call from Bengaluru, Isaac Mathai confirmed that the British royal and his wife are his “patients”. The website of his ayurveda resort, too, carries a video message from Prince Charles prominently on its landing page. But Mathai refused to “confirm or deny” Naik’s remarks, citing “patient confidentiality”.“Since Prince Charles is a patient of mine, I won’t be able to talk about him in any public forum. He stayed here some months ago; I met him in London last month, but I cannot disclose what I prescribed to him,” Mathai said, adding that he has been prescribing the same medicine against “any viral condition with flu-like symptoms” to thousands of patients, but that he had “not treated a Covid-19 patient as of now”.Asked by HT to comment on whether Prince Charles’s recovery from Covid-19 was aided by advice from an ayurveda practitioner in Bengaluru, a spokesperson for the Prince of Wales in London said: “This information is incorrect. The Prince of Wales followed the medical advice of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK and nothing more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incorrect-info-spokesperson-of-prince-charles-on-ayurveda-treatment/story-ituGiZuqhoke46HNFttWbM.html

03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Imran Khan govt faces brickbats in Pak over Covid-19 response. Here is why||The Pakistan government is facing mounting criticism within the country and abroad for its delayed reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, with the virus spreading quickly due to failures in screening and quarantining.Pakistan currently has more than 2,400 confirmed cases and Covid-19 has caused 34 deaths across the country.Most of the initial cases were Shia pilgrims returning from Iran, one of the countries worst affected by the pandemic, and the virus spread rapidly after hundreds of people were kept in camps along the border with Balochistan without any screening. The camps also had no medical facilities, and this exacerbated the situation.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The Pakistan government also failed to take effective action to shut down mosques, with thousands joining Friday prayers on March 20 and March 27. Commentators within the country have criticised the government’s lack of action, pointing out that Saudi Arabia had suspended the Umrah pilgrimage and shut even the Grand Mosque in Mecca.Early in March, some 250,000 men from Pakistan and abroad gathered at Raiwind near Lahore for a five-day meeting of the Tablighi Jamaat, after the country had already reported confirmed Covid-19 cases and there were public demands for the gathering to be called off.The Tablighi Jamaat members were asked to disperse on March 12, a day after the meeting began, but the gathering has since been identified as the source of infections as far afield as Palestine and Kyrgyzstan. Some 550 Jamaat members, including nationals of Indonesia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and China, have been quarantined in Sindh after a Chinese citizen tested positive after attending the meeting in Raiwind, according to media reports.Reports suggest the Pakistan government has failed to act on such gatherings or to shut mosques because of fears of a backlash from powerful Islamic organisations. In the face of the government’s dilly-dallying approach to the pandemic, the military has taken on a greater role in controlling the spread of the Coronavirus.Pakistan’s planning minister Asad Umar, addressing a news conference on April 1, said the current lockdown in the country will continue till April 14.Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, planning minister Asad Umar and President Arif Ali went into self-quarantine after a recent visit to China, which was apparently aimed at obtaining financial and other support for Pakistan due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage While in isolation at his home, Qureshi was critical of those blaming China for the spread of the Coronavirus. “The world is blaming China [for the outbreak] whereas it is an international issue…Pakistan had expressed confidence in not repatriating students from China,” he was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune.A medical team sent by China to Pakistan has been sitting idle because of a lack of interpreters, according to media reports. The team of eight medical experts arrived in Islamabad last week and visited several health centres and quarantine facilities for Covid-19 patients.“But when the Chinese medical experts started conversing, some local medical staff appeared lost, unable to understand what was being said in Chinese,” The Express Tribune reported.Opposition PML-N lawmaker Abdul Qayyum criticised the government’s handling of the visit by the Chinese medical team, saying it should have arranged for interpreters so that their knowledge could be transferred to Pakistani doctors. “People do not know in which direction are we heading and they are asking where is the government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-imran-khan-govt-faces-brickbats-in-pak-over-covid-19-response-here-is-why/story-qQM2bL72JFpshGlwsKASaJ.html

But what we saw yesterday, we had not seen it earlier. We sustained injuries but we have to do our job and will not be scared,” Dr Zakiya Sayed said, according to news agency ANI.Dr Zakiya Sayed was a part of the team of healthcare workers who were pelted with stones by local residents on Wednesday. She was one of the woman doctors who reportedly sustained injuries in the incident.“We have been visiting the locality for the past three days for the screening of residents. We had information about a person coming in contact with a Covid-19 patient…We were talking to the person (the elderly woman) when, all of a sudden, residents got agitated and attacked us,” one of the doctors had said after the attack on Wednesday.Seven people were arrested on Thursday for the attack on the team as several such incidents were reported from different parts of the country. The Centre has asked the state police to ensure the security of health workers after these attacks.“Violent attacks being committed against doctors and paramedical staff providing healthcare by risking their lives is condemned and anyone resorting to violence against them will be liable to strict legal action,” Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said.Reddy also directed “all DGPs to take immediate action against culprits”.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has assured healthcare workers their safety is his government’s responsibility.Chouhan said those involved in pelting stones at medical staff in Indore will be given strict punishment and that the accused will be booked under the National Security Act (NSA).Fourteen new Covid-19 cases were reported in Indore on Thursday, taking the number of cases to 89 in the city.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-be-scared-doctor-pelted-with-stones-in-indore-back-to-screen-covid-19-patients/story-PIlpq4w2xDZcjZ1t3vJUWP.html

He also hailed the efforts put in by the people and authorities to make the 21-day lockdown to fight coronavirus disease Covid-19 a success.“The discipline and sense of service you showed, is unprecedented. The people and administration have tried to make this routine a success. The way you thanked those at the forefront of fight against coronavirus March 22 has set an example for the world,” PM Modi said in a video message.“Many of you think what a single person can do? How will he/she be able to fight this battle? And how long will you spend your time under lockdown? We are at home, but not alone. We have the strength of 130 crore countrymen with us,” the prime minister said in his 11-minute video message. Watch | ‘Switch off lights, light candles at 9 pm on Sunday’: PM Modi amid lockdown l Full speechHe then again called for showing unity in fight against Covid-19. “I request you to switch off the lights of your home for nine minutes, at 9 pm on Sunday, April 5. Light a candle, diya (lamp) or mobile flashlight for those nine minutes to show your participation in this fight against the disease,” said the Prime Minister.“When a lamp is lit by 130 crore Indians, we will see the power of that light which is leading us in this fight,” he said, adding that the everyone should follow the practice of social distancing while doing this - that they should not gather at one place.PM Modi held a meeting with chief ministers on the Covid-19 outbreak via video-conferencing on Thursday where he indicated that once the lockdown ends, the Centre and the states will together ensure a staggered re-emergence of the citizenry.In his interaction with chief ministers, the PM emphasised that in the next few weeks, “testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine” should remain the focus areas of the local administrations.He also thanked the states for supporting the decision of lockdown due to which India has achieved some success in limiting the spread of Covid-19.In his address to the nation on March 24, the Prime Minister had announced a 21-day lockdown in the country to contain the spread of novel coronavirus, which has infected over 2,000 people in the country.During the last “Mann Ki Baat”, the Prime Minister had apologised to the countrymen for taking the tough decision of complete lockdown. “My conscience says you will forgive me,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/april-5-9-pm-pm-modi-urges-people-to-fight-covid-19-darkness-with-light/story-ZFxloM4MB9jnM9IKSberiN.html

On an average, the prisoners are producing around 10,000 bottles of hand sanitisers alone, apart from hand washes, face masks and even sanitary cleaners,” Cherlapally jail superintendent M Sampath told Hindustan Times.The prison has a chemical unit within the premises, where prisoners are regularly given training for preparation of hand washes, floor cleaners, disinfectants etc. “We have been selling these products under ‘My Nation’ brand every year. Now that there is a huge demand for hand sanitisers and hand washes, we thought we can make the best use of the opportunity,” Sampath said.The demand is huge. “We are being flooded with orders mostly from the government departments - from state-level to the district-level - apart from hospitals, nursing homes and other such establishments. They procure directly from the prison stalls,” the jail superintendent said.Apart from these customers, the prisons department is now offering the products even to the common households, in the wake of coronavirus scare. “We are making anti-coronavirus kits, each kit costing Rs 900 and supplying the same to the consumers by order,” he said.Each kit comprises two bottles of sanitisers, each of 320 ml, 12 face masks, two bottles of hand wash, three soaps and two bottles of sanitary cleaners. The prisoners are also being trained to prepare the face masks within the jail premises.“At present, we are taking orders from customers of only Hyderabad and Secunderabad, as we cannot cope up with huge demand. We are making the door delivery of the products only for a minimum order of 15 kits,” Sampath said.He said the cost of each kit is very less compared to the market price. “For instance, a 100 ml sanitiser bottle in the market costs not less than Rs 250 to Rs 300. But we are selling the same at Rs 180 for a 320 ml bottle,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-jail-joins-covid-19-fight-sells-kits-made-by-prisoners/story-opZmnhogVsKvGVwQ58iOEN.html

The latest figures posted by the Union health ministry today morning said the number of Covid-19 cases stand at 2301.HighlightsHealth ministry says total number of Covid-19 cases in the country are 230120 existing, 22 potential coronavirus hotspots identified by governmentPM Modi said lockdown working, urged people to keep the momentum goingThe country is in the middle of a three-week long nationwide shutdown to ensure the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak does not assume the proportions it has in countries such as Italy and the United States.Several states including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala reported significant rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. In Maharashtra, at least 81 more tested positive on Thursday, taking its tally to 416, while two more patients succumbed to the infection, increasing the toll to 19.More on Covid-19:• Covid-19: Your guide to staying safe• Covid-19: What you need to know today• Can Covid-19 spread after symptoms end?• How coronavirus is different from seasonal flu and common coldIn Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said there are 208 Covid-19 patients in the national capital, of which 108 were evacuated from the Nizamuddin Markaz of the Tablighi Jamaat. He said two people who had attended the congregation died due to the disease on Thursday and cautioned that the number of positive cases may shoot up in the national capital in coming days.With the Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area last month emerging as one of the biggest hotspots of the coronavirus outbreak, authorities said nearly 9,000 people - members of the Jamaat and their primary contacts - have been identified and quarantined across the country. This includes, 1,306 foreigners associated with the group.A majority of the new cases identified on Thursday are linked to the congregation, officials said. The health ministry, however, asserted there was no evidence of community transmission and 20 existing and 22 potential hotspots have been identified across the country.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday issued a video message in which he asked countrymen to stay united in the fight against Covid-19. He also urged people to “challenge the darkness” of the coronavirus by lighting a lamp, torch or mobile flashlight on Sunday.PM Modi had interacted with chief ministers through a video conference on Thursday and told them to focus on Covid-19 containment measures - testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine - and said it was imperative to work on a war footing, identify hotspots and ensure that the infection does not spread.Hopes of the 21-day lockdown getting removed, at least partially, rose after Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said airlines are free to allow ticket booking for flights after April 14. He also said resumption of international flights will be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on which countries they are coming from, after the lockdown ends.In less than 100 days in the year 2020 - Thursday was the 93rd day to be precise - the virus has infected one million people globally and killed 50,000, ripping through 203 countries in a rampage that will likely exact as severe an economic, social and psychological toll as the number of casualties by the time humanity can beat it. Till now, a little over 200,000 have recovered from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-500-new-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-in-india-total-number-crosses-2-500/story-aQQqjClN2MudUgaBltmgeI.html

03-04-2020||India||Jamia PhD scholar held for ‘conspiring’ in North East Delhi riots||Delhi Police have arrested a PhD scholar from Jamia Millia Islamia in connection with a case of rioting and criminal conspiracy linked to the February riots in north-east Delhi, officers with knowledge of the development said.Joint commissioner of police (special cell) Neeraj Thakur confirmed Wednesday’s arrest of the scholar, Meeran Haider, but did not disclose details.The suspect’s alleged “involvement in the conspiracy to instigate the riots, funding the violence and the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Shaheen Bagh” is also being probed, the officers cited above said, requesting anonymity..At least 53 people were killed and more than 400 injured in the February 23-25 rioting in north-east Delhi that started as clashes between supporters and opponents of the CAA before acquiring a communal colour. Shaheen Bagh was the venue of an anti-CAA sit-in protest in December. A senior police officer, one of two cited in the first instance, said Haider was president of the Delhi unit of the Bihar-based Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)’s youth wing, Chhatra RJD. Haider is being interrogated at the special cell’s Lodhi Colony office. Haider, a resident of Jamia Nagar, was served a notice on March 31, asking him to join the probe in the case that was registered by the crime branch after the riots. He Haider was asked to reach the special cell’s Lodhi Colony office at 10am on Wednesday.“We arrested Haider as we have evidence to prove the charges against him. His role in funding the riots and anti-CAA protests is being probed,” the officer said. The Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) alleged that Haider was called for interrogation by the Delhi Police’s special cell on Wednesday. “Yesterday around 10pm, men in uniform had approached his residence enquiring about him. He was taken into custody around 10.30pm. The JCC demands that he must be released as charges against him are baseless,” the committee said.The University administration said it had not been informed about the incident by the police and declined to comment further.The JNU unit of RJD on Thursday also issued a statement demanding his release. “Delhi Police had asked Meeran Haider, the president of the young RJD, Delhi, to join the investigation and then arrested him without giving any valid reason. We demand his release,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamia-phd-scholar-held-for-conspiring-in-north-east-delhi-riots/story-8Byd6NvpPvmvnYC4LnjrlI.html
03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: India unveils rules for flights to ferry stranded foreigners, release of quarantined people||The government on Thursday announced new rules allowing flights to evacuate stranded foreign nationals and the release from quarantine of people who arrived in the country after February 15 and had tested negative for Covid-19.The new rules unveiled by the home ministry followed restrictions imposed on all international flights and rules requiring the quarantine of all people entering India at government or private facilities.The rules, which were conveyed to all states in a notification, state the external affairs ministry will examine on a “case to case” basis all requests by foreign governments to evacuate their nationals stranded in different parts of the country due to the current 21-day lockdown.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage If the evacuation requests are endorsed by the external affairs ministry, chartered flights will be arranged by the foreign governments in consultation with the civil aviation ministry.Before their departure, the foreign nationals will be screened for Covid-19 symptoms. “Only those foreign national(s) would be allowed to leave who are asymptomatic for Covid-19,” according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) for evacuation of foreigners.“In case of symptomatic person(s), the future course of treatment would be followed as per the standard health protocol,” the SOP states.Embassies will have to arrange local transport to ferry their nationals to airports and transit passes for such vehicles will be issued by state governments.The SOP for release of people quarantined after returning from abroad since February 15 state they will be released if they test negative. “However, this will not apply to a group, where even one person tests positive for Covid-19,” it states.The transit passes for people released from quarantine will be issued by state governments and they will have to undergo home quarantine for 14 days as a “measure of abundant caution” on reaching their destination.According to several estimates, countries such as the US, the UK, France, Germany, Israel and Russia are engaged in hectic efforts to evacuate more than 20,000 of their stranded nationals from different parts of the country.The Germany embassy has evacuated some 2,400 stranded travelers, including nationals of other European countries, in the past few days and flew out 600 more on two flights on Thursday.The US embassy has said it will have several evacuation flights from New Delhi and Mumbai from this weekend. The UK high commission has also asked its nationals to register for evacuation flights that expected to begin in the next few days.People familiar with developments said Air India is expected to operate flights from Mumbai and New Delhi to London between Saturday and Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-india-unveils-rules-for-flights-to-ferry-stranded-foreigners-release-of-quarantined-people/story-AhtXcrBkbp7Hni00AMLw7N.html
03-04-2020||India||A peek inside the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz||Most nights, the main avenue of Delhi’s tony Nizamuddin East is as silent as a grave. There is no traffic except for an occasional car, a “Niz East” dweller probably returning to his or her elegant apartment. The 17th-century tomb of Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khana remains shrouded in darkness.Sometimes though, in this silence, footsteps are heard — those of men walking in small groups, each holding a bundle under their arm or on the head. They are the Jamatis, members of the Tablighi Jamaat, on their way from the Nizamuddin railway station to the Markaz, the organisation’s headquarters. It is located across Mathura Road, next to the equally upscale Nizamuddin West, in the congested and not-upscale-at-all Nizamuddin Basti.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThis village takes its name from the shrine of Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, which lies deep in the heart of the basti. The Markaz’s grey building stands near the entrance, very close to the famous Karim’s restaurant, and a few steps away from a great literary landmark: poet Mirza Ghalib’s grave. Watch | Tablighi Jamaat members accused of misbehaving with nurses in GhaziabadThe front facade of the six-storey building is studded with long arch-shaped windows that look strangely similar to traditionally built windows seen in the bylanes of distant Venice – currently ravaged by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), another thing it has in common with the Markaz building that has emerged as India’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot so far. Social activist Faisal Khan, convener of Khudai Khidtmatgar welfare organisation, spends a couple of days every year inside the Markaz, in the month of Ramzan, for “peace and meditation”. Talking on the phone from his office in south Delhi’s Ghaffar Manzil, he gives an idea of the interiors of the Markaz complex. “The entrance hall is littered with hundreds of chappals that spill far out into the street. It’s a miracle that every Jamati finds his own sandals from that great pile.”Khan says that each floor in the Markaz has the same layout — a spacious hall lined with small rooms, each being the temporary dwelling of some learned elderly person to whom younger Jamatis might go for counsel. Most residents (some might stay for a week, others for just a weekend) would, however, settle with their backpacks and beddings in the big halls, sleeping at night on the floor. Sermons will be held in the mosque at different times of the day. An average day in the Markaz, Khan says, “is about performing prayers and listening to maulanas about how to be a good Muslim”.The eating arrangement, he says, “is just like the langars held in Sikh gurdwaras.” Simple meals such as dal and chawal are prepared communally, and served in a basement hall, he reports. In the evening, the Jamatis can be seen milling around in the basti. The Tablighi centre attracts visitors from countries such as the UK, the US, Germany, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Sudan and South Africa. A mere walk in the lanes of the Basti might take you to different corners of the world, as you are likely to overhear conversations in British-accented English, Chinese, French, or Arabic. Until a few years ago, the area had a popular telephone booth advertising special call rates for places such as Yemen and Morocco.Almost all the Jamatis are men. One evening, just a few days before the lockdown, this reporter spotted a few young Jamatis huddled in a small park not far from the Markaz. Some of these boys were exercising on the fitness equipment installed in the park. One man in a loose shalwar kameez was shyly working out on the chest press machine; two were sitting at the two ends of a see-saw. The “open gym” remained crowded for a long time, and then the boys walked back towards the Markaz.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-peek-inside-the-tablighi-jamaat-markaz/story-Kmx3PPBGlTYpHxUDVGib8O.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Is Delhi prepared?That isn’t a question designed to be alarmist. On Thursday, the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi rose to 293, driven upward by more people who attended the gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat at its HQ testing positive. That trend is likely to continue — in terms of both an increase in cases, and more from the Jamaat gathering testing positive. Hundreds evacuated from the Markaz Nizamuddin are in hospitals in Delhi; around 1,800 are in quarantine. Which is why this is an opportune time to ask the question.Is Delhi prepared?New York City clearly wasn’t. On Thursday, the number of Covid-19 fatalities in the city touched 1,397. On Wednesday, the New York Times listed the wishlist, in terms of critical medical equipment, of the city’s mayor Bill de Blaiso: 3.3 million N95 masks, 2.1 million surgical masks, 100,000 isolation gowns, 400 ventilators. All these are incremental numbers — requirements additional to what the city currently has.Administrators and health care professionals shaping India’s response to the pandemic would do well to study what is happening in New York City — what it got right and, more importantly, what it didn’t.It emerges that the big issue in Delhi right now is the shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment). This is a problem in other cities and states, and, indeed, in many parts of the world. Last week, the Indian government said it has placed orders with local and global manufacturers for around six million units of PPEs. Work on these to be proceeding apace, despite the hurdles posed by the lockdowns.Delhi government officials and doctors also say the city-state has enough isolation wards, ICUs, even ventilators, but many of these assessments are based on conservative estimates of the number of daily cases, in some cases, as low as 100. On April 1, New York City reported 3,144 new cases in a day. That’s the kind of number for which Delhi should be ready — and then heave a sigh of relief and celebrate when the numbers stay low.It’s also the kind of number for which Mumbai should be ready. On Wednesday, a 56-year-old man in Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum, in Mumbai, died of Covid-19. On Thursday, another person who worked in Dharavi tested positive. The prospect of the infection raging through the shanty town with a population density of 66,000 per square km is the stuff of which nightmares are made.Parts of Mumbai are already being treated as hot spots where clusters of infected people are found. There are around 13 such across India. The area around Markaz Nizamuddin is another cluster — where door-to-door surveys of people within a 3km and a 5km radius of the epicentre (in this case, the six-storey HQ) were undertaken on Thursday.Amidst all these local developments, US unemployment numbers soared to 6.6 million from 3.3 million last week — a statistic that should worry India because it shows the extent of economic havoc that can be wreaked by the pandemic.Around the world, companies are being forced to lay off people to cope — in India, apart from the few companies providing essential products and services that continue to function through a 21-day lockdown, every other business is idle, incurring costs with no revenue. The US has already announced a fiscal package amounting to roughly 10% of its GDP, with some of this amount going to businesses. France has said it will pay companies to not retrench people. India, too, needs to think in terms of a fiscal package for businesses. Even with one, the recovery will be slow and painful. Without one...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-QkikIP1iBKtCKXMJminUCL.html
03-04-2020||India||17 companies asked to help meet 38mn unit PPE shortfall||How do you produce millions of coveralls (a key part of personal protective equipment or PPE) that health care workers need when dealing with something as infectious as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), when, till last month, they were mostly imported ? How do you do so, and quickly, when no one had a design specification till February 27? For 17 firms that have been tasked with making the coveralls -- Hindustan Times spoke to six of them -- it is a race against time that involves dealing with raw material shortage, workers worried about their safety, and learning to quickly produce under the watchful and anxious eyes of the government.And for the only laboratory that tests them, it simply means working around the clock. It’s an experience that Tanmay Singhal, a recent graduate of OP Jindal School, didn’t anticipate in the first year of joining his father’s business. Their Haryana-based firm, Sai Synergy, was a supplier of fire protective gear that was used by oil rig workers in West Asia, till February. That’s when it received an SOS from the textile and health ministries of the Government of India. Director of Research and Development in the textiles ministry, Balram Kumar, reached out to the company to attend a meeting. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAt the meeting, there were a handful of other companies; all had one thing in common: they worked with or made unwoven fabric (used to make the protective clothes). The agenda of the meeting was simple: could these companies make PPEs? “We were ready but it took some time and paperwork for the manufacturing to start,’’ said Singhal. The work started two weeks ago and, on a good day, when trucks aren’t stuck at the highway because of the lockdown, the unit produces 12,000 to 15,000 of these suits. “The raw material is coming from Bangalore for us and so many times they get stranded, else we didn’t have any problems delivering our order,’’ said Singhal. Neither Singhal, nor the other firms, were willing to specify the exact orders that the government had placed with them. However, supply of raw materials is a common challenge for all of them. Nisheeth Dand of the Vadodara-based firm, Sure Safety, which is also involved in the production of these coveralls, said that the company is slowly trying to increase the pace of production but the lockdown isn’t helping. His raw materials also come from different parts of the country and their flow is proving to be a bottleneck. There is help, though -- in the form of nodal and field officers that the government has assigned to each of these firms, so that they can troubleshoot, call the local administration in the area that a particular truck is stuck in, but the delays are inevitable. Then, there are other obstacles.“I have 180 workers in my unit but right now only 44% are coming to work,’’ said Dand. “Their families won’t allow them, they are scared so the only thing I can offer them is higher pay.’’So for coming to the factory in times of lockdown, Dand says, he pays a worker who would usually get Rs 15,000 , Rs 25,000. “It’s not just labour, even the raw materials have become expensive. I know banks have been told to help us but they are totally unresponsive. They should be giving us interest-free credit.’’Despite these hurdles, Sure Safety is producing more and more kits every day. If it was 500 earlier, it is now 700 and the company hopes to be able to increase it to 1,500 soon. If it isn’t a supply problem, it’s the problem of learning to run a factory with social distancing, to take care of workers’ needs and concerns. At the Mumbai-based Venus Safety and Health Private Limited factory, which is the only one of two producers of N 95 masks in the country, this involves free food, free medical camps and upping the hygiene conditions for the 700-800 workers that work there. The company’s chief marketing officer, Ravi Shinde, said: “We have increased the space that’s occupied by individual workers and even though I am sure they have concerns, they know that this is for the country and so haven’t really objected to working.’’ Earlier the company was producing 2.5 lakh masks daily and now it is hoping to amp up their production to 3.5- 4 lakh per day.Every step of the way, the textile ministry’s officials are keeping an eye. Vijay Shankar of Shree Hari Healthcare in Chennai said that several ministry officials arrived at his unit on March 20, the day production started. “We normally wouldn’t work with the government but this was an urgent moment and we felt we had to pitch in,’’ said Shankar. He has been lucky with raw materials for his coveralls, with the ministry suggesting alternative sources when his were stuck. However, the challenge has been to take care of his workforce, majority of which are women.“We are working at a feverish pace but we can’t do so at the cost of their health,’’ he said. The company has mandatory hand wash hygiene breaks every hour and a compulsory Sunday off but the pace of production is “satisfactory”.The Kolkata-based Frontier Protective Wear has just started production of its coveralls in its Gurugram unit and will start in the Kolkata unit on Monday. “The ministry has assured us that we will continue to get all supplies that we need, so I am confident that we can deliver on time,’’ said Sweta Chaudhry Singh, one of the promoters.The one place that is stretched is Sitra, the government testing lab in Coimbatore that is receiving each of the samples from the manufacturers. “Before, we would get one sample a week,’’ said Prakash Vasudevan of Sitra. “Now we are getting 15-20 samples a day.’’ Considering that the lab has only four or five people working during the lockdown, it means that workdays go on till 2 or 3am. “We need to clear each sample that comes in daily and so we are really stretched.’’So when all 17 of these firms have fulfilled their orders and they are tested and ready to go, will this fulfil India’s protective gear deficit? Last week, Reuters reported that India needed around 38 million masks and 6.2 million pieces of PPE to take care of Covid-19 patients, quoting an internal report from Invest India. Invest India said it had contacted 730 companies for ventilators, ICU monitors, protective equipment, masks and testing kits, of which 319 firms had responded.An official of the textile ministry, which is tasked with the all important coveralls and masks, said that they are hopeful of hitting peak production by the middle of the month. Last week, the government issued a statement detailing its plans to procure 6.2 million PPEs desperately needed across the country. The three-week lockdown in India till April 14 will, if successful, flatten the curve of the disease’s spread -- giving the administration enough time to stockpile enough medical equipment, including masks. People like Singhal are at the forefront of that effort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-companies-asked-to-help-meet-38mn-unit-ppe-shortfall/story-N54od3qAm7tZZzH45DIPgM.html
03-04-2020||India||Plan staggered exit from lockdown, PM tells CMs||Underlining India’s goal of ensuring minimum loss of life and detailing the next steps in India’s strategy to deal with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday indicated that once the lockdown ends, the Centre and the states will together ensure a staggered re-emergence of the citizenry.Interacting with the state chief ministers over a video conference from his residential office at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the PM emphasised that in the next few weeks, “testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine” should remain the focus areas of the local administrations, according to an official statement.Many CMs praised the Centre’s role in dealing with the outbreak, especially in identifying and quarantining suspect cases arising from Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi. But nearly all states demanded more financial support and help with ramping up health care infrastructure to meet the surge in the Covid-19 cases. According to an official, all states were represented in the meeting. However, only a select number of CMs spoke. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was the only CM who was not present at the meet, but the state was represented by its chief secretary. During the interaction, Modi spoke about formulating a “common exit strategy” to ensure “staggered re-emergence of the population” once the lockdown ended. The PM asked the state governments to brainstorm and send suggestions to the Centre on how to do this. He emphasised that even after the lockdown ends, the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19 must be kept in mind. This is the first hint of the government’s thinking on what happens after April 14; it suggests that while a complete lockdown will not continue, neither will there be entirely free movement of people, with restrictions in place for certain geographical clusters, demographic groups and on travel. The Prime Minister announced on Tuesday last week that a 21-day lockdown was being put in place to control the spread of Covid-19, which has infected at least a million people across the world since last December.Experts believe that this may be a sensible approach. Ravindra Mehta, chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Apollo Hospitals, Bengaluru, said: “Staggered re-emergence of the public is the best option at the point as continuous lockdown for a long term is not sustainable. The government will test the waters and even when people come out, the government must enforce social distancing and restrict all non-essential activities such as foreign travel. But in the next few weeks, the top priority should be accorded to beefing up health care infrastructure.”But the staggered re-emergence will have implementation challenges. Yashovardhan Azad, a retired senior Indian Police Service officer, said: “Even after the lockdown is officially lifted, the identified hot spots of the virus need to be protected. But now, the states get about 13-14 days to plan their exit routes well. And they must use it well.”The video conference with CMs took place two weeks after the first such meeting on the pandemic on March 20. Thursday’s meeting focused on the current strategies in force and the next steps in the battle against the pandemic that has killed at least 51,000 people worldwide. The PM praised different states for their “teamwork” which helped check the speed of the virus, and thanked them for supporting the lockdown, due to which, the PM suggested, India had achieved some success in limiting the spread of Covid-19. He emphasised the need for quick identification of virus hot spots and to encircle them to ensure the virus does not spread out.The PM also pointed to the need to maintain law and order across the country — law and order is a state subject. He also asked the states to make available dedicated hospital facilities for Covid-19 patients, tap into the resource pool of AYUSH doctors, organise online training and utilise paramedical staff and civil society volunteers. States could consider setting up crisis management groups at the district level, in line with groups of bureaucrats formed by the Union government, and appoint district surveillance officers, he suggested. At a time when there remains a debate about whether India is testing enough, the PM underlined that data for testing must come from accredited labs so that there is congruence in data of district, state and the Centre. The PM also asked for staggered release of funds to the beneficiaries under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana to avoid crowding at banks. A video clip of the meeting also showed PM Modi pointing out that Covid-19 has attacked people’s faith, belief, traditions and the way of life. He added that to counter the outbreak, political leaders needed to reach out to community leaders and social welfare organisations.State governments put forth their demands at the meeting. The Rajasthan government asked for a package of ₹1 lakh crore, while West Bengal sought a grant of ₹25,000 crore, over and above their dues of ₹36,000 crore. States such as Andhra Pradesh and Bihar asked for more fiscal flexibility, while Odisha demanded unemployment allowance for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers. Experts believe that the crisis demands a strong Centre-state collaboration, and the former needed to be more supportive of financial needs of the states. Yamini Aiyar, president and chief executive of the Centre for Policy Research, said: “Genuine cooperative federalism is imperative. States are at the front lines and best placed to devise interventions suited to their contexts. But they are fiscally strapped. The Centre needs to devise a mechanism for support that is untied and flexible and buttresses state action rather than undermine it with central schemes. The demand for greater financial support from states is critical and the Centre must take heed.”Many CMs also sought medical equipment apart from cash to tackle the situation. Rajasthan wanted to take loans of up to 2% of the state’s GSP and asked for the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to be made the nodal office for buying personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators so that they are available to every state at best price and on time. It also underlined the need to focus on interstate supply chain protocol for essential items, medicines and medical equipment. West Bengal demanded more face masks, gloves, sanitisers, special suits for medical staff and also immediate release of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation and cess amount. Maharashtra, too, wanted immediate release of pending GST compensation, and permission to procure and manufacture PPE kits and N-95 masks.Speaking to the media after the interaction, Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa said: “The PM said that migrant labourers should be provided all facilities; lockdown should be implemented in full; food, medicine and other essential items should be made easily available; there should be no shortage of doctors or medical facilities; the PM Garib Kalyan package should be implemented smoothly; and states should ensure that there is no impact of lockdown on agricultural activities.”On agriculture, according to the official statement, the PM said that the Centre has provided some relaxation of rules to harvest crops but monitoring and social distancing must take place during harvesting. He also asked the states to think of other platforms for procuring grains apart from agriculture produce marketing committees, and explore the possibility of creating pooling platforms for rural areas, like that in ride-sharing apps, which can be used for this purpose.The Opposition asked the PM to be more consultative in his approach. The chief spokesperson of the Congress, Randeep Singh Surjewala, said that if the PM had consulted the CMs before announcing the nationwide lockdown, all the problems emerging now could have been avoided.“It’s better late than never. The battle against Covid-19 is not between political parties but a nation’s fight against the pandemic. Hence, the government should discuss all measures with the Opposition. The PM should take into confidence the entire Opposition and try to implement the suggestions given by the leaders of different political parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-staggered-exit-from-lockdown-pm-tells-cms/story-KpmujugToFPvsp6Ip4nZVN.html
03-04-2020||India||Jamaat accounts for lion’s share of Delhi’s Covid-19 infections||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections in the national capital jumped on Thursday by 141 – the biggest single-day increase yet – with nearly 92% (129) of them linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, a religious group that is now feared to be driving the outbreak in the country despite an unprecedented lockdown that has forced people to stay indoors for three weeks.The number of fatalities rose by two – both of these patients had also been to the Nizamuddin building – and the country’s overall number of confirmed cases rose 2,520, also soaring by a record number over Wednesday’s figure of 2006. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe national surge, too, was largely driven by Tablighi Jamaat-linked infections from states such as Tamil Nadu, where all 75 new infections reported the same origin. In all, about 9,000 members linked to the gathering in Delhi have been quarantined or are being sought out to be isolated after they attended events at the Delhi building that is believed to have turned into a hotbed of the infection this month.“The home ministry along with states and Union territories launched a massive effort and about 9,000 Tablighi Jamaat workers and their primary contacts were identified and quarantined. Among these, 1,306 people are foreigners,” said Punya Salila Srivastava, joint secretary in the Union home ministry, during a daily briefing on Thursday.Also Read: Nizamuddin markaz trail widens; coronavirus cases in India hit 2,000Srivastava said that 2,346 people were evacuated from Tablighi Jamaat’s six-storey complex in Nizamuddin since March 29. Of these, 250 were foreigners and 1,804 people were shifted to different quarantine centres, while 334 positive cases were hospitalised, the official said.Earlier in the day, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the number of cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat could shoot up since the government has decided to test all of the 2,346 people linked to the building.The government has begun action at several levels against the missionary group, booking its leader Maulana Mohammad Saad under sections that punish offences that could lead to the worsening of an epidemic and for criminal conspiracy. Union home minister Amit Shah said on Thursday the government has blacklisted 960 foreigners for their involvement in activities with the group while they were in India on tourist visas. Their visas have also been cancelled. The home minister added that the state director generals of police and Delhi Police commissioner have been directed to take necessary legal action against the overseas Tablighi Jamaat members as they violated the provisions of Foreigners Act, 1946 and Disaster Management Act, 2005. On Thursday, the Delhi Police mailed 24 questions to the group’s head, the first step in launching its formal investigation. The questions are related to the gathering of over 2,000 people at the six-storey building and Saad’s alleged violation of the orders that prohibited an assembly of large groups of people. Saad’s counsel, Fuzail Ayyubi, said, “We are preparing a reply. There are about two dozen questions. The maulana is not absconding. He is in self-quarantine, as advised by doctors.”Ayyubi also said that Saad has released an audio message urging all his followers to comply with the lockdown directions and be safe. In a minute-long video released on social media groups, Saad asked his followers to remain indoors and also cooperate with the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jamaat-accounts-for-lion-s-share-of-delhi-s-infections/story-QMYpmFLB1SDORagu2tXu9I.html
03-04-2020||India||Amid lockdown, villagers attack cops, crowds flock to markets on Ram Navami in Bengal||Despite repeated warnings, violation of social distancing guidelines continued to be a common sight in Bengal with a few villagers attacking policemen on Wednesday night for trying to enforce lockdown orders. On Thursday, the festival of Ram Navami too was celebrated in certain pockets of Kolkata and the districts.As 16 more patients tested positive for Covid-19 since Wednesday night, people in most parts of Kolkata and other cities did not leave their homes on Thursday. The stark violations thus triggered sharp reactions.People thronged vegetable markets in Kolkata and the districts, with very few keeping distance from the next person. On Thursday, prayers were offered at several temples on the occasion of Ram Navami and believers thronged in groups. Village fairs were organised in Purulia, Bankura and Cooch Behar districts. In Kurseong, however, the traditional Ram Navami fair was not held. “This is not the time to play carom or engage in chitchat with your friends at street corners. These can wait. If you do not adhere to social distancing, the consequences can be severe,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Wednesday afternoon. Hours later, a police team was attacked by some young men who were found drinking by the roadside at Dharmatala village in South 24 Parganas. Some local youth also pelted stones at a police van..“Five police personnel were injured and seven villagers were arrested,” said a district police officer who did not want to be named. He said, the villagers accused the policemen of being “too strict.” In adjacent North 24 Parganas district, policemen caught some villagers gambling. Significantly, Banerjee, who allowed sweet shops to stay open from 12 to 4 pm to help dairy owners who are facing a huge drop in sales, is facing criticism. “The crowds were already there and now crowds can be seen at sweet shops. Are sweets essential items? What is the meaning of this lockdown if the government announces one relaxation after another?” political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor at Rabindra Bharati University, wrote on his social media page, posting a photograph of shoppers in a vegetable market.“Those who are running to markets and sweet shops can put hundreds of lives in danger. Instead of keeping the markets open, the government should ask vendors to carry their goods to every neighbourhood at defined hours. China did this to keep people indoors,” Suparna Roy, a homemaker in south Kolkata said. Policemen had been very strict when the lockdown began and could be seen hitting people with batons to chase them away. They said they went soft after Banerjee pulled them up and accused them of going overboard. Three policemen were taken off the streets and sent to the barracks allegedly for acting tough.“If the government thinks that violators should be dealt with softly, why should we chase people away in the interest of public safety and invite the administration’s ire?” said the officer-in-charge of a police station in north Kolkata. No senior IPS officer was willing to talk on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-villagers-attack-cops-crowds-flock-to-markets-on-ram-navami-in-bengal/story-gZvUF6x85ipCtga5uf12YJ.html

Yediyurappa spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about how his government was responding to the crisis. Edited excerpts:What did Prime Minister Narendra Modi convey to chief ministers in Thursday’s video conference? The PM suggested several measures [to check spread of coronavirus] such as utilisation of AYUSH staff and doctor’s services and popularisation of AYUSH-suggested food items for strengthening the immune system. Karnataka has already implemented or is in the process of implementing most of the steps suggested by the PM. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhat are you doing to trace 45 people from Karnataka who were at the headquarters of a religious organisation in Delhi where some people have been found to be Covid-19 positive?We have tracked many of them and they will be quarantined. One of the three dead in Karnataka, who hailed from Sira town in Tumkur district, is suspected to have been among the 45. The whole town is being monitored. We are tracing them. We will track them .Karnataka has fewer Covid-19 cases compared to states like Kerala. What are you doing to keep the number down?Karnataka was the first state to announce a lockdown [on March 22] much before other states did so. When we reported the first Covid-19 death, we initiated various measures to contain the pandemic spread. We created a 1,500-bed facility at the Victoria hospital [Bengaluru] for exclusive treatment of Covid-19 cases. Immediately, we summoned experts and doctors and sought their opinions on how to check the disease. We went according to their suggestions... Many private hospitals announced they will offer ventilators and other facilities. Though the first death of a religious man, who had returned from abroad, was reported from Kalaburagi, we succeeded in controlling the spread. Also Read: Government may borrow Rs 40k crore as cash-strapped states seek fundsBengaluru has reported no new cases for three days? What will you attribute it to?All the precautions taken including setting up of war room with various apps to track and monitor the movement of the quarantined and those isolated. A Geo-fencing app has proved very fruitful as it provides accurate movements of the Covid-19 patients and quarantined people. This will help in disallowing suspects from mingling or roaming freely. Are you going to increase testing like Kerala, which has introduced rapid testing? Many say that the more we test, the better it is.More you isolate and distance the people from mingling, more we will be able to control the disease.. The first case was reported in Karnataka on March 6. Today, we have only 91 positive cases and this itself indicates how effective our measures are. Karnataka, which was the third worst-hit state all these days, has slid to 5th place, indicating we are on the right path in controlling the disease.Are your five testing labs enough? We are increasing the testing facilities. We now have seven testing centres. We are buying more than one lakh rapid testing kits from abroad. Isolation, quarantining and social and physical distancing will do wonders and not the testing centres.How are you dealing with the difficult situation that migrant workers are facing because of the 21-day national lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread? It is wrong to say that the migrants are harassed. Suddenly, we decided to lock down and they were taken aback. We have created all the facilities for them. We decided to serve them food . We are compensating for the losses of their livelihood. All construction workers are being given food, advance ration for two months and monthly Rs 1,000 . All this is in addition to the Centre’s relief measures.You have brought back people from places like Maharashtra. What measures have you adopted for them?All the labourers living in Karnataka, irrespective of which state they belong to, are being treated equally and given all the facilities being given to the people of the state . Even our party representatives are looking after the camps where the labourers are sheltered . We are also keeping a watch on their health.Is there a case of cluster spread at a Mysuru pharma company?In Mysuru, the disease was first detected among two workers at the pharma company. We have quarantined all the thousand-odd workers . Yesterday [Monday], six more workers tested positive. We are tracing their relatives and friends they may have mingled or been in contact with. It cannot be described as a cluster case. The pharma company had to be kept open. How is your government helping people from the northeast facing racism because of Covid-19?No incident of such discrimination has been reported from our state. People of Karnataka are known for tolerance and humanity... There are over 2 lakh people from the northeastern states and north India in Karnataka. Do not compare the situation elsewhere with Karnataka. We are peace loving.How would you react to criticism regarding breach of privacy over Karnataka’s move to publish addresses of those who have travelled internationally since March 8?It is a false news that we have published the addresses. However, we have made a list of the people, who arrived here from abroad, to keep a watch on their health. In some suspected cases, we have subjected them to quarantine. How can you say that it is violation of privacy. People coming from abroad are carriers. For instance, first Covid-19 death was from Kalaburagi and the man had come from a pilgrimage. In the larger interest of the society and to keep the disease from spreading, some measures have been initiated and there is nothing wrong.Do you think the lockdown should go beyond 21 days and how will you offset its economic impact?It is too premature to predict anything on the lockdown issue. If the disease subsides , there is no question of extending the curfew. The Centre will take the decision. Our state has a robust economy and we are going to bounce back soon. I am sure the lockdown impact on the economy will be minimal and we can overcome this economic crisis in a couple of months. A large number of people from Karnataka attended the religious congregation held in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has emerged as a hot spot for infection in India. Is that situation under control?We have already tracked many of them and they will be quarantined. One of the three dead, who hails from Sira town in Tumkur district, is one of these 45 suspects. Whole town has been under surveillance. Officially, they are suspecting 600 cases, of these 391 have been identified. So far, 11 have tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isolation-social-distancing-will-do-wonders-not-testing-bs-yediyurappa/story-3yMjY2VlxyyAY7RufS7maO.html
03-04-2020||India||Gurbani singer dead, event he attended under scanner||Bhai Nirmal Singh Khalsa, 67, a Padma Shri awardee and a former hazoori ragi (Gurbani exponent) at Amritsar’s Golden Temple, died of a heart attack on Thursday a day after he was diagnosed with coronavirus (Covid-19).Amritsar’s civil surgeon, Dr Prabhdeep Kaur Johal, said Khalsa was put on ventilator on Wednesday night after his condition worsened due to his bronchial asthma. “He had visited England in November. A health department team visited his house on March 3 after we got the information that two guests–his uncle and aunt–from the US visited him. They were found asymptomatic. When the home quarantine period of the guests was over on March 17, they were found asymptomatic. Bhai Nirmal Singh then went to Chandigarh for a kirtan samagam [a devotional event] on March 19 where over 100 people had gathered,” Johal said.She added he tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday. “He may have caught the infection during his trip to Chandigarh. He died of sudden cardiac arrest on Thursday.”With his death, the toll from Covid-19 in Punjab has risen to six.Khalsa was referred to the Guru Nanak Dev Hospital on March 30 after he complained of breathlessness.The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has quarantined 84 people, who had attended the religious gathering where Khalsa performed in the city on March 19. An official said the 84 include 14 members of a family.The religious gathering was held at a house in Chandigarh’s Sector 27. After Amritsar health authorities alerted their Chandigarh counterparts about Khalsa’s condition, tracing of his contacts was started in Chandigarh.A Sector 27 resident said the gathering was held for a pre-wedding ceremony. “The next day there was a ladies Sangeet [music ceremony] and then the wedding. During three-four days, lots of functions were held and many people visited the house and roads were blocked with vehicles, “ said another neighbour.A third neighbour said after reading the news about Khalsa’s death, she called police to inform them about the event in Sector 27. “One of the former judicial officers residing in the neighbourhood had advised them to postpone the wedding, but as their children had come from abroad, they could not change the plan at the last moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gurbani-singer-dead-event-he-attended-under-scanner/story-cRw6t5LypeZ46S1HS1BpLI.html
03-04-2020||India||In Dharavi, cramped quarters and squalor make Covid-19 fight difficult||Mumbai’s overworked public health workers have a new, daunting challenge on their hands--Dharavi. After a 56-year-old garment shop owner died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India’s largest slum on April 1, two teams of 50 officers and volunteers arrived in Dharavi to spread awareness of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the disease, and to quarantine 70 high-risk residents of the eight-building Slum Rehabilitation Authority complex in which the man stayed. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe neighbourhood also has 91 shops, all of which have been ordered shut. On Thursday, an additional 2,500 people were home-quarantined, and will probably be tested for the virus.On Thursday morning, just as the two teams plus 800 more community health volunteers were getting ready for another busy day in Dharavi, a second case emerged – a municipal conservancy worker from south Mumbai who was assigned to the area tested positive for Sars-Cov-2. Twenty of his friends and co-workers were quarantined.Neither the garment shop owner nor the conservancy worker has a recent travel history, according to information released by the city’s health department. “It is going to be an uphill task identifying asymptomatic patients in an area that has more than 850,000 people,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and the officer in charge of the city’s G ward, where Dharavi is situated.It is not just about Dharavi’s population. Its inhabitants live in some of the most cramped spaces in the country. In an area measuring 2.1 sq km, the slum has over 57,000 shanties, huts and small flats, almost all of them illegal. Its estimated population density – 66,000 people per square kilometre – is more than double that of Mumbai (32,303 people per square kilometre), the fifth most-densely populated city in the world, according to a United Nations Population Prospects study released in July 2019. Mumbai is also the city worst hit by Covid-19 in India, with at least 238 people having teste positive and nine deaths reported as of 6 pm on April 2. With private laboratories also testing for Covid-19, this number will only rise, health officials said.Also Read: ‘Lockdown in India was early, far-sighted and courageous’: WHO envoyMumbai’s – and Dharavi’s – population numbers make social distancing – one of the key preventive measures recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) – almost impossible to implement. “It is almost certain that the cases will spike in Dharavi due to overpopulation,” said Baburao Mane, a former state legislator from Dharavi. “There are, on average, 10-12 people living in thousands of 250 sq ft huts. As summer approaches and the temperature soars, it will be almost impossible to prevent home-quarantined people from coming out of their cramped spaces.”For Dharavi, BMC has put a special plan in place. It has created two teams of 25 people each that work round the clock in two shifts. These teams include a sanitary inspector, medical officers, police personnel and community volunteers. In addition, the ward officer has on board 800 community health volunteers whose primary responsibility will be to trace vulnerable residents such as senior citizens, patients with respiratory ailments and pregnant women.Also Read: Coronavirus: How world reached a million cases in 93 days“I have sought permission to convert the Rajiv Gandhi District Sports club into a quarantine facility with 300 beds,” said Dighavkar. “Once approved, we will shift high-risk people {to the facility}.”The primary concern of health officers is the people’s cooperation. “People in slums don’t cooperate. The statements given by the dead man’s wife and children have confused us. We are unable to trace his contacts. We don’t even know if he had visited his shop during the lockdown. Despite symptoms, has he roamed around the slum? The family can’t confirm his activity, and we don’t know how many people he may have infected.”Sanitation and water supply are the other issues . In line with WHO recommendations, the Maharashtra state health department has advocated regular hand-washing with water and soap to avoid any possible transmission of Sars-Cov-2. In Dharavi, this is a distant dream. Neena More, a local social activist ,said the slum averages one toilet per 500 people and most residents use the nearby Mahim creek for urinating and defecation. “Every morning, people stand in long queues to use the toilets making them susceptible to the infection,” she says.And then there is economic desperation. Almost every family in Dharavi faces the prospect of spending more than two months without wages on account of the nationwide lockdown and shutting of private business establishments. Shibani Salvi, a 26-year-old mother of two, lost her source of income in the third week of March. Prior to the lockdown, she earned Rs 20,000 a month working as a maid in five flats in the neighbourhood. “Now,” she said, “I cannot even go out of my house to collect my salary even though one of my employers called me. We have enough food to last only three more days. I don’t have money to buy even masks or sanitisers for my family.” One of Salvi’s employers is Divya Dhar, a 36-year-old designer who stays with her mother and two-year-old daughter in the affluent Shivaji Park. Even after the lockdown began, she would drive to Dharavi to fetch her maid and cook. Starting On Wednesday – the day the news broke about the first Covid-19 fatality in Dharavi – Dhar stopped the practice. “I can’t risk {the health of} my daughter, who is already an asthma patient. I will get tested. Until then, I have locked myself in a room,” Dhar said.Drinking water is another of Dharavi’s challenges. Qamruddin Sheikh, who runs a non-government organisation (NGO) named Bal Vikas Shikshan Sanstha in the area, said that in an area that has scant drinking water, it was impractical to think residents will keep washing their hands. “People are using handkerchiefs and cotton masks, both of which are of no use to stop the virus transmission. BMC should provide quarantined people with proper masks and hand sanitisers,” he said.The primary challenge for health officers will be tracing the people who were in close contact with infected patients. One health officer HT spoke to said on the condition of anonymity that “Many of the shops in Dharavi are illegal, and people do not share information openly. Getting accurate information here is the work of a full-time detective.”According to the ward officer, BMC has been providing rice, wheat and dal to those in home quarantine, but residents HT spoke to said the rations do not include essentials such as oil and vegetables. Sagar Kamble, a Dharavi resident, said: “Almost 80% of the slum-dwellers here are uneducated and do not understand the gravity of the situation. Only a few gated colonies in the area have locked their premises; the rest of the population is roaming around freely.” Mane said this was the main reason he has been asking for compulsory screening of all of Dharavi’s residents. “BMC needs to screen all the locals and if needed, send them back to their respective villages using available public transport. There is no other way to enforce social distancing or to contain the virus,” he said.But this is not possible, according to the BMC. The city’s health officers have overruled the possibility of running universal tests in Dharavi. “There are just not enough test kits,” said a health officer. “There is a shortage of masks and sanitisers in the slum, so with the help of NGOs and philanthropists, we are trying to procure protective masks for quarantined people.” He added: “There is also large-scale ignorance. When our volunteers counsel residents on the importance of sanitation and social distancing, many from the Muslim community respond by saying their immunity is high as they eat meat. It’s not going to be easy at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-dharavi-cramped-quarters-and-squalor-make-covid-fight-difficult/story-ikCrJedyQjQVWesUUfuqcN.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Health workers attacked in cities, 7 held in Indore for pelting stones||The Madhya Pradesh police arrested seven people on Thursday for allegedly attacking health workers in Indore’s Tatt Patti Bakhal area on Wednesday, as several such incidents of attacks on health workers were reported from different parts of the country.After the incidents, the Central government asked the state police to ensure security of health workers.The residents of a locality in Indore pelted stones at healthcare workers who went there to screen people in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Two female doctors reportedly sustained injuries in the incident.“We have been visiting the locality for the past three days for the screening of residents. We had information about a person coming in contact with a Covid-19 patient…We were talking to the person (the elderly woman) when, all of a sudden, residents got agitated and attacked us,” said one of the doctors.Health department officials said that the incident happened when the workers sought to take an elderly woman to hospital for her medical examination as she was said to have come in contact with a Covid-19 positive patient.The locality where this incident took place was Tatt Patti Bakhal area in Indore. In Bihar, police and medical personnel were attacked by locals in Munger town when they visited a locality to collect samples from people suspected to have contracted coronavirus. Stones were thrown at the quick response team (QRT), comprising policemen and an ambulance carrying medical personnel, when they visited the Hazratganj locality late on Wednesday, said the SHO of Qasim Bazar police station Shailesh Kumar.Relatives of a 49-year-old coronavirus patient who died at a government hospital in Hyderabad assaulted the duty doctor and the staff alleging negligence, police said. Telangana Director General of Police M Mahendar Reddy asserted that strong action will be taken against the culprits and necessary measures will be put in place to provide protection to all the doctors and paramedics treating Covid-19 patients.In Maharashtra, a man was assaulted by a group in Solapur district for allegedly informing a village official about those who attended the Tablighi gathering in Delhi. The 56-year-old man had informed the ‘gramsevak’ of Pimpri village about seven locals who attended the Tablighi meet and also insisted that they be tested for coronavirus, police said.In Bangalore, a group of ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers were allegedly assaulted at Sadiq layout near Hegdenagar on Wednesday by some youth belonging to the minority community when they had gone to collect information and create awareness about coronavirus.Krishnaveni, one of the ASHA workers apparently assaulted, said, “We were instructed to go to houses and collect data on who has cough, fever or any other symptoms. I have been in this field for five years, but inspite of explaining who we were, they heckled us, snatched our belongings and we couldn’t call anybody. We are here for their health and look how they treat us.”Some of the ASHA workers threatened that they would not continue the work if they were not provided protection, after which deputy CM Ashwath Narayan visited the house of Krishnaveni and said action would be taken against those who hinder the work of government servants. In West Bengal, there were clashes between police and locals at a few locations when the latter prevented health workers from collecting Covid-19 data. Nobody sustained major injuries.Police had a hard time enforcing social distancing norms in the wake of a large number of people coming out on the occasion of Ram Navami. Seven people were injured when police tried to enforce lockdown in North 24 Parganas district. “This is not the time to play carom or engage in chitchat with your friends at street corners. These can wait. If you do not adhere to social distancing, the consequences can be severe,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Thursday afternoon.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-health-workers-attacked-in-cities-7-held-in-indore-for-pelting-stones/story-ZlbAlxXRhH7aFQyLZb8wmN.html
03-04-2020||India||IAS officers identify hot spots, flag gaps in policy, equipment shortage||New Delhi: From the domestic production of Covid-19 testing kits and ventilators to lifting the lockdown cautiously, young civil servants across the country have offered a host of suggestions to tackle the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.In a survey, conducted by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, 266 Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers submitted a host of suggestion and identified hot spots across 16 states. They flagged some crucial gaps in policy, and highlighted the shortage of medical staff, equipment and facilities such as ICU beds, ventilators, ambulances, oxygen cylinders. “PPEs (personal protective equipment) such as masks, gloves etc. for medical staff was an area of concern for several districts and across states,” said the report by the National Preparedness Survey that was released on Thursday. The survey was conducted from March 25 to March 30, with 410 district collectors and IAS officers (batches 2014-2018) who have served as assistant secretaries registering for it. Of these, 266 submitted completed reports to the DARPG.“This is the feedback we have received from across the country,” a DARPG official said. “This the situation on the ground and the gaps that we want to highlight in the fight against Covid-19. The suggestions have been noted and will be addressed appropriately.” The respondents, while highlighting that the national, state and district administration has been “effective and purposeful” in response to the pandemic, recommended that issues related to procurement, logistics and supply chain of medical equipment should be addressed on priority to bridge the demand-supply gap.They also called for more testing centres (with separate centres in rural areas) and isolation wards to be set up.“The respondents suggested increase in the fiscal spending (around 5 - 10 Lakh Crore/ around 2% of GDP) on health infrastructure, essential commodities for poor and vulnerable groups,” according to the report. Other economic relief could include partially waiving commercial rent of shops under lockdown, they suggested. Among the other recommendations were standard operating procedures and guidelines for interstate movement of people across borders in light of the migrant movement in several areas; creating relief packages for daily wagers; and lifting the lockdown in a phased manner after the 21-day period ends.The civil servants also noted that more needed to be done to increase Covid-19 awareness in backward districts and the among tribal population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-officers-identify-hot-spots-flag-gaps-in-policy-equipment-shortage/story-W6yIvQeLmflbsmnLO3lniP.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Odisha govt official reveals identity of patient, asks contacts to quarantine themselves||Over fears of a Covid-19 patient triggering community transmission, the Odisha government on Thursday broke its own norms of not revealing the identity of coronavirus patients as it named the fifth person in the state who tested positive.Bhubaneswar Municipal Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury identified the patient who hails from the posh Surya Nagar area of the city and appealed to the people to quarantine themselves if they had come in contact with the person after March 1.“The man is mentally retarded and for last 3 months he has not gone anywhere except to some local hospitals for treatment. He is diabetic and has other co-morbidity conditions like hypertension when he was admitted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar on March 31 following problems in respiration. He has no records of travel. As there is no other known way of finding out how he contacted the virus, we have issued an appeal to people to inform us and go on quarantine,” said Chaudhury.Health and family welfare department of Odisha said the 60-year-old man first consulted a doctor in a private clinic in Bhubaneswar on March 5 and again consulted him on March 12. On March 27, he consulted a doctor in the OPD of a major private hospital after he experienced problems in breathing. The next day he went to OPD of AIIMS Bhubaneswar over same issues. As his respiratory problems persisted, he got admitted to casualty of AIIMS on March 31 where doctors suspected him to be suffering from Coronavirus.After his sample came positive on April 1, the the municipal authorities this evening sealed the area where the person lived with 13 others in his family. All his family members have been isolated. Apart from his 13 family members, 8 others the person came in contact with have been asked to go on quarantine for the next 14 days. The officials, however, allayed fears of community transmission of coronavirus beginning in Odisha as the patient had no record of travel.AIIMS Bhubaneswar acting medical superintendent, Jawahar Pillay said the patient is on ventilator.State government spokesperson on Covid-19, Subroto Bagchi also appealed people that if they have symptoms of the disease, they need not hide it. Bagchi said that many people were hiding the fact though they know that they have coronavirus symptoms.“And they are doing it out of fear. The person who avoided our phone call for 48 times did it out of fear. Tell your family and neighbours that if you feel you have coronavirus symptoms, do not hide it. Come out bold, your candidness will save you; your family, the society, the race will remain ever grateful to you,” said Bagchi.The revelation of the identity of the patient has come at a time when the state government has lodged cases against people for trying to reveal the identity of the infected persons. In Bhadrak district, police on Wednesday arrested 3 persons for revealing the identity of a 29-year-old chef working in Dubai who tested positive on March 31.Officials have identified 33 people who came in contact with the youth after he landed in Kolkata by an Emirates flight from Dubai and then took a train ride to Bhadrak on March 19. Though the man had quarantined himself after arrival at home, he is believed to have come in close contact with at least 25 people in train apart from 6 in his family and neighbourhood. Though the youth did not show any symptoms of the disease, he was tested as per government protocol of testing of all 4300 people who have returned from abroad after March 4.In a related development on Thursday, Odisha’s second coronavirus patient, a 19-year-old youth who had returned from UK and tested positive on March 20 was discharged from AIIMS Bhubaneswar. “The second Covid-19 positive case has completely recovered and tested negative for the virus,” said a health department official.Also on Thursday, two standalone Covid-19 speciality hospitals with a total capacity of 650 started functioning in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The first one is a 500 isolation bed facility in KIMS Bhubaneswar and the second one is at Ashwini Hospital in Cuttack with a 150 isolation beds. The State government earlier announced that patients would get free treatment along with free food and rent-free stay in these hospitals. The next Covid-19 hospital in SUM Hospital would have 500 isolation beds.While the state raced to build more isolation facilties for Covid-19 patients, Odisha has urged the centre to immediately send personal protective equipment (PPE) like Hazmat suits and masks as well as coronavirus testing kits.In a letter to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, Odisha health minister Naba Kishore Das said there is acute shortage of testing kits in the State which are essential for detection and treatment of the deadly virus.“Adequate ventilators, PPEs, masks, sanitisers may kindly be provided to important district headquarter hospitals including Rourkela General Hospital for better treatment of Coronavirus patients. The testing facilities may be extended to MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur and VIMSAR, Burla for testing more and more suspected patients of other parts of the State,” Das wrote in his letter on April 1. Due to lack of adequate testing kits, till April 2, Odisha has been able to test only 1113 samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-odisha-govt-official-reveals-identity-of-patient-asks-contacts-to-quarantine-themselves/story-DAKunawErkiOZ5jy94RA4J.html
03-04-2020||India||Sonia condemns unplanned lockdown, ‘miserly’ relief||New Delhi: Sonia Gandhi, the interim president of the Congress said on Thursday said that while the ongoing 21-day lockdown may have been required to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease, the unplanned manner in which it was implemented caused chaos and pain, provoking an immediate reaction from BJP president JP Nadda who accused the Congress of politicising the issue. Gandhi was speaking at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee, which also found fault with the relief package announced by the government. “The Financial Action Plan (FAP) I announced on March 25 was miserly, hopelessly inadequate and left out several vulnerable sections. It failed to instil confidence in the poor and, as a result, we witnessed the tragic spectacle of thousands of migrant workers desperately trying to go back to their villages by any means whatsoever, including on foot,’’ it said in a statement. Gandhi also hit out at the Centre over the exodus of migrant workers following the imposition of the three-week lockdown , saying the “tragic spectacle” of thousands of them walking back to their villages will “forever remain a blot on the Modi government”. Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said the comments were “unfortunate, false, and unnecessary.” Thousands of migrant workers left jobless by the lockdown began fleeing cities for their homes on foot last week in absence of public transport. The Centre last week announced an economic stimulus plan to provides direct cash transfers and food to the poor hit by the lockdown.The CWC, which is the Congress’s highest decision-making body, demanded FAP II to reassure the poor and also to provide adequate financial support to the sections left out earlier.“The NYAY [minimum income guarantee] scheme put forward by the Congress [as a pre-poll promise last year] offers a useful model that can be adapted and implemented,” said the resolution, which was passed after Gandhi chaired a CWC meeting via video conferencing.The CWC said the government has not given any thought to the deteriorating economic situation and demanded constitution of a task force of world-renowned economists to suggest three plans to deal with the crisis. “...firstly an emergency plan within one week, secondly a short to medium term plan within one month and thirdly a medium to long term plan within three months in order to protect and revive the economy.”The CWC said it is conscious that India and the world face an unprecedented crisis due to the rapid spread of Covid-19 while pledging its support to the government. The statement said the order of priorities before the government should be to contain the spread of virus, medical treatment to the infected, livelihood support to the poor and maintenance of supply of essentials and measures to deal with a sliding economy. The CWC regretted that the government has “miserably failed” to provide adequate livelihood support to the poor. The party said supply chains to crores of people, especially those living in towns, cities and remote villages have been severely disrupted by poor preparation and thoughtless orders and notifications.Gandhi said there is no alternative to constant and reliable testing to fight Covid-19 and demanded Personal Protection Equipment for doctors, nurses and health workers as also ventilators and breathing equipment, isolation beds and designated hospitals for patients. “The onus lies on governments to ensure that the spread of infection and casualties are not caused owing to lack of infrastructure or preparedness.”She urged the government to prepare a Common Minimum Relief programme, and insisted that Covid-19 does not differentiate between political ideology, religion, caste, age or gender. “The choices we make today will have a direct impact tomorrow on our family, neighbourhood, community, environment and nation. How effectively we meet this challenge, how we protect all sections of our society, especially the most vulnerable among us, will define us for generations to come. Only if we act together in solidarity, we will overcome.”Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the country has to fight Covid-19 with a specific strategy and consultation, and stressed the need to ensure that the most vulnerable and the poor as also aged people are protected .Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the Congress stands one with the nation to take on the challenge posed by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-condemns-unplanned-lockdown-miserly-relief/story-ac62e7wK8OUHSO9ieftCcL.html
03-04-2020||India||74 of 75 new Tamil Nadu coronavirus cases linked to Jamaat||Tamil Nadu on Thursday reported 75 fresh cases of Covid-19 of which 74 had attended the Tablighi Jamaat religious conference held in Delhi in March. The 75th person had contact with Patient 30 who had travel history, but not linked to the Delhi conference.The state now has 309 positive Covid-19 cases, of which 264 are related to the religious conference, which is now being treated as the largest cluster in the country. Including Thursday’s fresh cases, the virus has now spread across 20 districts in Tamil Nadu.“There are 75 fresh cases in Tamil Nadu today of which 74 were people who took part in this Delhi Conference. One person had contact with someone who has travel history,” health secretary Dr. Beela Rajesh said.Nearly 1500 persons from Tamil Nadu are believed to have attended the religious conference held in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin. Until Wednesday, the state has traced 1103 persons. “All 1103 people have been tested but some of the results are under process. Of these 264 have tested positive,” she said. “All have been tested but results are under process.” Rajesh said that the state was increasing the testing facilities and six more labs will be added soon. Each lab can carry out 100 tests every day. Tamil Nadu was using the lockdown time to ramp up testing facilities and focus on infrastructure and equipment. “We have enough masks, Personal Protective Equipment kits, enough to give all nurses who are working in isolation wards. We have made it mandatory for all who have to see patients in isolation wards. Daily there is a 20-minute ‘mock drill’ on how to put on the PPE and remove it, how to interact with the patients, and how to maintain the distance,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-75-new-tn-cases-linked-to-jamaat/story-eaa5jvLPEDndqKgiK56KML.html
03-04-2020||India||ICMR advises antibody testing in hot spots for faster diagnosis||New Delhi: India has allowed faster and cheaper antibody tests to check for the coronavirus disease in so-called hot spots -- these show clusters of infections -- of which there are 20 in the country, the health ministry said on Thursday. An expert said the decision could be a game-changer in India’s fight against the pandemic, not just because of the time and the cost, but also because Indian companies and laboratories have experience in doing such antibody tests (which are blood tests) and can easily develop inexpensive kits for it. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) advised on Thursday, antibody tests (or blood tests) in areas that are emerging as hot spots of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a move that will ensure faster detection of all possible cases in these clusters and help authorities buy some precious time to contain the fast-spreading pandemic. The test used now -- PCR (polymerase chain reaction) -- identifies the Sars-CoV-2 virus from throat or nasal swab samples of people with symptoms or high-risk individuals (health workers and family members) who might have come in contact with a Covid-19 patient. The antibody detection blood test will identify people who have been infected, but have mild or no symptoms, according to experts who say the move will help us know how many have been able to fight off the infection and have become what could be called a “corona-blocker”.While the results of PCR tests take up to five hours, the antibody test results will be available in 15-30 minutes.“Population in hot spot areas may be tested using rapid antibody test. And antibody positives to be confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) using throat/nasal swab, and antibody negatives to be quarantined at home,” said the interim ICMR advisory.This means positive results will be reconfirmed using the PCR test. The antibody test uses a few drops of blood to determine whether a person has antibodies against the coronavirus. Antibodies in the immune system means the person either had the disease at some point in the past, even though the person was never tested for it, and has now recovered, or has the disease now, minus the symptoms. An ICMR official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, the move will mean getting quicker results even if there is a large number of people.“However, to ensure there are no false positives or false negatives, we recommend confirmatory PCR-based test for all positive results,” this official said.ICMR also released a link (www.finddx.org/) having an information on all available CE-marked rapid Sars-CoV-2 antibody tests. CE-In Vitro Diagnostic approved kits can be used directly after due approval from Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and intimation to ICMR.ICMR earlier made public an expression of interest to procure a million antibody testing kits from manufacturers across the globe. However, due to the shortage of supply, the number was revised to 500,000 testing kits. The first shipment is expected by April 5.Experts say that India’s decision to introduce anti-body testing kits could be a game-changer in the country’s fight against the pandemic.“These tests are expected to be very economical, simple and give results within 15-20 minutes. They are being used for contact-tracing in some countries. The Indian health system has lot of experience in doing such tests, like the ones for dengue and chikungunya. So it will be easy to ramp up the screening. It is also a great tool for surveillance, and building up epidemiological data. Indian companies would be able to produce them (the kits) easily and at massive scale,” Lalit Kant, a senior infectious disease expert, said.Kant has a word of caution though. “While using these tests, one has to be careful about false positives as there may be cross-reaction with other virus antigens. Antibodies take time to develop, so if the test is performed early in the phase of the infection, may not give correct results. Still, this decision is transformational.”He also pointed out that the move would ease workload off main laboratories, as sophisticated equipment or highly trained manpower would not be needed for the process. “Mass screenings can be done using these tests to give us vital information on the number of people infected who never went to the hospital. It would give us an idea of the denominator to calculate fatality ratios,” he said.On Thursday, the Union health ministry said it identified 20 existing and 22 potential hot spots in the country, and asserted that although there was no evidence of widespread community transmission, containment measures will require large human resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-advises-antibody-testing-in-hot-spots-for-faster-diagnosis/story-ysAWd1LF4MaVRNCjyziYnK.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Hoarding, transport snags choke supply of essentials||A supply crunch of consumer items has cascaded across states, as buyers, rich and poor, scour markets for everyday needs amidst a sweeping lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Businesses blame their lean inventories on panic-buying of goods equivalent to two-three months of household supplies by affluent classes, as they hunkered down for an indefinite shutdown.They also blame issues with the transportation of food supplies, including grains, edible oil, fruits, vegetables, milk, even consumer products. Some stores are rationing supplies, selling limited quantities of items to discourage hoarding. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic “The excess buying has strained back-end stocks and godowns,” said market tracker Comtrade in a note. Inventories that should have lasted two months were exhausted within a week, it said.And deliveries at the last-mile are hobbling under tight local rules of individual states. Federal instructions and orders issued by state administrations are not in tandem, first-hand reports suggest. India is one economy but many individual markets. Steering all of them in one direction, all of sudden, has been a key challenge, ground reports indicate. Part of the problem is also that modern supply chains are intricate — they span whole sectors. A bread maker typically depends on three: agriculture, biological and chemical leavening agent producers and the packaging sector, each with its own supply chain. “There have been no biscuits in any store for three days,” Alka Aggarwal, a housewife said, pointing to her neighbourhood Samachar market in east Delhi. A soaring milk demand ahead of the lockdown followed by a sharp fall now had upset supply schedules, RS Sodhi, the managing director of Amul, India’s largest dairy cooperative, said . Small milk suppliers and aggregators were under pressure but the overall availability is adequate, he added . Some states have seen milk demand drop, leading to farm losses. “Owing to regulatory measures in the wake of Covid-19, there is a decline in demand of milk and milk products, and difficulties have also arisen in interstate movement for its conversion to milk powder,” Rajesh Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary of Kerala admitted . Government may borrow Rs 40k crore as cash-strapped states seek fundsHundreds of trucks are stuck on state borders, despite the home ministry’s orders allowing movement of both essentials and non-essentials. Truckers have sought government intervention to smoothen interstate movement. “The home ministry’s orders have not percolated to the ground level even though operators want their vehicles to move. Trucks are still being stopped at various state borders in states such as Delhi, UP and Haryana for example,” Kultaran Singh Atwal, president of the lobby group All-India Motor Transport Congress said.The Food Corporation of India is ramping up supplies. “During the lockdown, the Food Corporation of India is replenishing 10 lakh (1 million) tonne of foodgrains through 352 rakes of Indian railways,” Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said in a tweet. But there is a problem. It only stocks cereals (rice and wheat), and limited quantities of pulses and sugar. The crisis is concentrated in a clutch of other necessary items: flour, biscuits, edible oil, soaps, handwash, some varieties of lentils, vegetables, baby food, packaged juices, medicines for a variety of conditions, even matchboxes.“Earlier, wholesalers would deliver to my shop. Now, I have to make beeline to the wholesaler, taking several hours,” general provisions store proprietor Ravindra Ghosh said from Ranchi’s Kokar locality.To resolve logistics issues, the Union government has formed a committee under the ministry of home affairs. The committee on logistics comprises secretaries to the ministries of aviation, health, drugs, textiles, consumer affairs and shipping, apart from the railway board chairman. The committee is tasked with ensuring unhindered supply of essential and medical goods.On the ground, however, broken chains of command are testing the limits of ensuring a billion people’s essential needs are met. The country went into a lockdown with less than four hours of notice. Police crackdown on agricultural activities has upended harvesting and transportation of crops. Md. Moinuddin, a vegetable wholesaler in Assam’s Kamrup rural district outlying Guwahati, said he had not been able to hire trucks to get stocks into the Assam city after police seized some trucks plying without permits.Cultivators are piling perishables in cold chains, as buyers aren’t purchasing in large quantities, unsure of transport.Farmers in Haryana’s Babain near Kurukshetra town said aggregators weren’t willing to take risks. “I have stocked about 12 quintals (100 kg each) potatoes in cold storages. No more cold storages space is available in entire Kurukshetra,” Jagtar Singh, a farmer, said. Truckers have sought extension of the due date for payment of road tax and GST to September 30. “On the 8th day of the countrywide lockdown, the government is making frantic efforts to restore supply chains. There is no clear policy on whether to run vehicles or not, especially those with non-essential goods,” Singh said.There is no staff, no labour, no traders and factories as well as workshops are shut, Singh added. Drivers have no facilities for eating or basic shelter. “Transportation services cannot work in isolation,” the truck lobby president said.Three major wholesale hubs run by state-regulated agriculture produce market committees – Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, Mullana near Haryana’s Ambala and Gollapally in Telangana’s Karimnagar -- said they were operating with 30-40% less staff.In this vacuum, Indian Railways has stepped up. A railway ministry official said issues at many terminal points, loading and unloading operations were being resolved now. There are issues of shortage of labour, he said. As many as 1,43,458 wagons of essential goods were loaded over the past three days including 7,195 wagons of food grains, 64,567 wagons of coal, 3,314 wagons of steel and 3,838 wagons of petroleum. Special focus is being given to essential commodities like foodgrains, sugar, salt, fruits & vegetables, coal, petroleum products and fertilisers. Scheduled passenger flights have also been pressed into service to supply cargo nationwide. Over the past few days, 85 flights have carried 76 tonne. All passenger flights are grounded till April 14. “We are operating flights despite significant logistical challenges in road transportation of cargo to and from airports and in the movement of aviation personnel,” a ministry of civil aviation official said.“Bulk of the air cargo comprises low-weight-high-volume products such as masks, gloves and other consumables that require more cargo space per tonnage of material. Special permission has been granted to store cargo in the passenger seating area, with due care and precautions,” the aviation ministry official added. India is also deploying private airlines for supplies. Private carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and Blue Dart are also operating cargo flights on a commercial basis.“This is like a mass synchronisation game. It needs practice to get it right,” said Rahul Digmbar, a former senior manager (operations) of BlueDart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hoarding-transport-snags-choke-supply-of-essentials/story-mO8iZLYeFj5fBz1vU68DyL.html
03-04-2020||India||Navy’s temperature guns to cost ₹1,000||The Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, has designed and developed a hand-held infrared temperature sensor, and has the capacity to scale up its production, if agencies require the instruments in large numbers to screen people for fever amid the Covid-19 outbreak, the navy said in a statement on Thursday.The navy said the instrument has been developed due to the scarcity of temperature sensors in the market, where these are being sold for a high cost. “The instrument has been manufactured for under ₹1,000 using in-house resources. The cost is a fraction of the price of the temperature guns in the market,” the statement said, adding that the country’s medical infrastructure was being tested by the surge in the count of Covid-19 cases.The dockyard’s temperature sensor has an accuracy to 0.02 degree Celsius, as per the statement.The temperature guns will be used for screening the 20,000 personnel who visit the dockyard daily. This will reduce the workload of the sentries at the gates, the navy said.“In view of Covid-19, initial screening of these personnel entering the dockyard was essential to prevent the spread of the disease within the yard and the navy’s Western Fleet. The most preliminary method to screen a probable patient is to check for body temperature by non-contact means,” the statement said.As the country prepares to handle a rising number of cases and meet its need for ventilators, which about 5% of the Covid-19 patients may require, the navy has also pitched in with an innovative ventilator design that can cater to six patients simultaneously.The Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam, has manufactured this portable multi-feed oxygen manifold ventilator.“To cater to the requirement of oxygen supply for multiple patients during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, personnel from Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam, have designed an innovative ‘Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold(MOM)’ using a six-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder. This innovation will enable one oxygen bottle to supply six patients concurrently thus, enabling critical care management to a larger number of Covid patients with the existing limited resources,” the navy said in a statement earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-s-temperature-guns-to-cost-1-000/story-8fTu8GoemzMudiJvpo84yO.html

Besides, 9,000 hospital beds have been prepared to meet emergency requirements, the armed forces told the government on Wednesday.The ministry said on Thursday that it is heartening that veterans across the country have risen to the occasion, in keeping with the motto of ‘service before self’, to fight the outbreak. “ESM are disciplined, motivated and well trained to operate in adverse situations and they have pan-India presence in all the districts and villages across the country,” the statement said.It said more than 4,200 ESM are assisting in data collection from villages in Punjab, Chhattisgarh has employed veterans to help the police, district collectors in Andhra Pradesh have sought the assistance of ESM volunteers and retired medical personnel have been kept on standby in Uttar Pradesh.“In addition, Sainik rest houses are being readied in Uttarakhand to act as isolation/quarantine centres if the need arises. In Goa, a control room has been established and ESM have been asked to remain on standby for any assistance to the local administration,” the release said.The ministry also said the National Cadet Corps (NCC) has issued guidelines for temporary employment of its cadets to augment relief efforts and the functioning of various agencies involved in battling the pandemic under ‘Exercise NCC Yogdan’.“The tasks envisaged for NCC cadets include manning of helpline/call centres, distribution of relief material/medicines/ food/essential commodities, community assistance, data management and queue and traffic management,” the ministry said in another statement, adding that guidelines make it clear that cadets should not be employed in the handling of law and order situations or in active military duties, or deployed at hot spots. Only senior division volunteer cadets, over 18 years of age, will be roped in. “They should be employed in small cohesive groups of eight to 20 under the supervision of permanent instructor staff or and an associate NCC Officer,” it said. The ministry said on Wednesday that around 25,000 cadets are being mobilised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-servicemen-being-mobilised-to-aid-fight/story-ygG4lOrYyNz7OFNneANSiP.html
03-04-2020||India||‘Prepare or suffer’: CDS Gen Rawat delivers blunt message on Covid-19 battle||India’s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Bipin Rawat believes that India must break the Covid-19 virus chain by April 14, through the lockdown and social distancing, or be prepared to weather the long-term consequences of the pandemic.“The military dictum is ‘prepare or perish’, but in these times of Covid we have refined it to ‘prepare or suffer’. We must arrest the spread of the virus through a 100% lockdown and social distancing by April 14. With the harvesting season around the corner, India cannot afford the numbers to go up. The military is totally prepared to stand up to the demands made by government and the people,” Gen Rawat said in a phone interview.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicHe said that the army, navy and air force have moved into action by dedicating 17-18 hospitals to care for the infected, and the total bed capacity in the forces has been ramped up to 15,000 so far. “We have hospitals ready even in far-off places like Dimapur and Zakhama in Nagaland, even though the virus has not spread in North-east India. We have now two to three hospitals ready in each zone to treat, manage and control the infection,” he said.Also Read: Coronavirus: How world reached a million cases in 93 daysThe CDS said that the military and its doctors were constantly in touch with the Union health ministry, and he, as secretary of military affairs, was attending meetings with PK Mishra, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, and cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba.Gen Rawat said that one ward in each hospital, including places such as Delhi where the base hospital is normally crowded, will be dedicated for Covid-19 patients. “We have created isolation and quarantine facilities in Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Jhansi to accommodate 500 patients each for treatment, to add to the capacity of para-military facilities, such as the one in Manesar,” he said.The single-point military advisor to the government said that since army, navy and air force schools are closed due to the lockdown, the premises can be prepared as quarantine centres. “We have three army public schools, one navy school and one air force public school in Delhi. It has been decided that these schools should be made ready to be made quarantine centres, if required. Even though the capacities of these schools is about 1,500 patients each, only 200 will be put up in each school due to proper sanitation requirements. The same model is being readied in other parts of the country if there is a requirement, or in a worst-case scenario.”Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayGen Rawat also said that the defence ministry has made an important change in the procurement manual by allowing advance payments to be made to the manufacturers of medical equipment such as ventilators, masks and protection suits. “We have already placed an order of 370 ventilators with the DRDO {Defence Research and Development Organisation} and are asking ordnance factories also for manufacture of masks and PPE {personal protective equipment} suits. The power to make advance payments has been given to director generals of armed medical services, army commanders, corps commanders and brigade commanders so that there is no shortage of any medical supplies, both for troops and the public,” he said.The CDS also said that two naval medical ships were ready to help neighbouring countries in case of a medical emergency. The air force, which recently flew a 14-member team to the Maldives, is prepared to ferry medical supplies in and out of the country.Although Gen Rawat is optimistic that India can contain the virus, he is “keeping his fingers crossed” and hoping that “social distancing, lockdown, and the Indian summer heat” will end the threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-break-virus-chain-gen-rawat/story-ERUFfxopfqFFkdD5r8MWVP.html

He added the vendor’s body has been sent for a post mortem examination.The vendor allegedly committed suicide even as the result of his Covod-19 test was yet to come. He had returned to his village from Delhi on March 30 amid the 21-day lockdown imposed across the country to check the spread of the disease. He was quarantined the next day as he was feeling unwell. Another 23-year-old migrant worker allegedly committed suicide in Bareilly after escaping from a quarantine centre. Police said he had earlier escaped from the centre twice to meet his family, but was brought back on both occasions. Sub-divisional magistrate Digvijay Singh said the worker was quarantined following the government’s directions. “We told him that the isolation was a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of his family members and neighbours. The victim had fled from the camp to meet his family. When police reached the village searching for him, he escaped and was later found hanging.”Station house officer Chandrakant Singh said it appears that the victim took the extreme step as he started panicking at the quarantine centre despite repeated attempts by officials to make him understand that it was just a precautionary measure. “Authorities provided proper food and other necessary facilities at the centre. We are investigating the matter and a case will be registered based on the findings.”The 23-year-old was the youngest among six siblings and was quarantined at a school after returning from Gurugram on March 28. He was found hanging on the outskirts of his village after leaving his home upon learning that police were looking for him . Police said his body has been sent for autopsy and the district administration will provide compensation to his family. In Saharanpur, a 38-year-old clerk was also found hanging from a ceiling fan at his office on Wednesday evening, said circle officer Yatendra Singh Nagar. “A suicide note recovered from his pocket said he was committing suicide because he was afraid of getting infected,” Nagar said.Saharanpur’s senior police superintendent Dinesh Kumar P said the man committed suicide because he was suffering from depression. His body was sent for post mortem examination.A farmer suffering from fever and cold committed suicide to “save his entire village from being infected” in Mathura on Tuesday. A young man with similar symptoms hanged himself on March 24 because he feared he was suffering from Covid-19.Two men committed suicide in Hapur and Bareilly because they also believed that they were suffering from the deadly virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-suicides-in-up-linked-to-covid-police-authorities-on-high-alert/story-g9JIHtwG6CyXPndaTYXE1L.html
03-04-2020||India||‘Lockdown in India was early, far-sighted and courageous’: WHO envoy||There is no evidence to suggest that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) will disappear, says Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) special envoy on the disease, adding that people may have to consider new norms for the foreseeable future. Declaring a lockdown when there was relatively a small number of cases in India gave the country time to come to terms with the new virus, he tells Sanchita Sharma in an interview. Edited excerpts:Do you think Covid-19 can be stopped?If you don’t get in early and the outbreaks grow, they get very, very big very quickly and then managing them is a massive and a very taxing task. So, where you have countries with not many cases and strong, robust responses at the community level supported by governments, we are most hopeful.Everything starts at the community level, detecting people with disease and isolating them, finding their contacts and quarantining them, and maintaining, as far as possible, a ready state to respond to outbreaks very quickly, and widespread efforts to reduce opportunities of transmission through lockdowns. During a lockdown, you must build community capacity for interrupting transmission where its starts -- in local communities -- and I see it recognised in India. Also Watch | ‘Switch off lights, light candles at 9 pm on Sunday’: PM Modi amid lockdown l Full speechClick here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicHow would you rate India’s response?The lockdown in India was quite early on, when there was relatively a small number of cases detected. This was really a far-sighted decision because it gave the whole country the opportunity to come to terms with the reality of this enemy. People understood that there is a virus in our midst. It gave time to develop capacities at the local level for interrupting transmission and sorting out hospitals.Of course, there is a lot of debate and criticism, and inevitably with a lot of frustration and anger that life is being disturbed in this way. It is very, very upsetting. I think it is courageous of the government, honestly, to take this step and provoke this enormous public debate and let the frustration come out, to accept that there will be hundreds of millions of people whose lives are being disrupted. For poor people on daily wages, this is a massive sacrifice they are making. And to do it now at an early stage as opposed to waiting three or four weeks later when the virus is much more widespread, was very courageous.Unlike in Europe and the United States?Comparisons between governments are not very helpful, but I can say that there have been some countries where that kind of strong action was not taken early on and we see they now have to struggle with the most immense suffering. We are seeing health workers absolutely at the end of their tether, and getting infected because they are exhausted. We see long term lockdowns being talked about. For example, some people are talking about six weeks, eight weeks.Is lockdown for three weeks enough?That all depends on how well-organised the basic community-level public health services and hospitals are. And whether people can see it as a battle that requires solidarity right across society. I don’t make any kind of recommendation because I don’t know what is happening [on the ground].India is looking very, very carefully to make sure that when the lockdown is lifted, there won’t be a windfall, with lots and lots of cases, hospitals overwhelmed and a national crisis. I think that strategy is right.Also Read: Coronavirus: How world reached a million cases in 93 daysWhat about the people worst affected?We need to save the lives of people who are badly affected. We must be looking after our hospitals, treating our health workers like they have to be treated considering they are on the front line, protecting them as much as we can and supporting them in society so they get looked after... really making sure they are secure and safe.In imposing major lockdowns, all governments are having to juggle with the need to really get on top of outbreaks quickly and, at the same time, ensure that people through the lockdown are not experiencing extreme impoverishment or shortage of food.There is growing recognition all across the world that we have to manage lockdowns very carefully. The size of some of these lockdowns is really massive, so having an integrated policy of lockdown management that deals with the social and economic consequences is always important. As far as I know, there are 70 countries and territories where lockdown is being applied, which is somewhere around one-third or half of the world’s population. So lockdown management is a key activity to get right alongside the response to the disease.Will coronavirus go away or will it become a seasonal virus like the flu viruses?We don’t know how this virus will behave over time and whether it will become less serious and whether it will have a particular distribution pattern. The virus is four months old, to our knowledge, and we are learning over time. I don’t know what will happen in hotter weather. I’m really very eagerly awaiting information from your country which is now going into the hot season to know whether or not there is the same level of transmission, or whether it is the same level of illness that we’ve seen in temperate climate. I’m really hoping that it won’t be quite so severe and that weather will be on our side.We also don’t know how the virus will behave in communities where there is quite a lot of illness, like for example malaria or other infectious diseases.Will social distancing be the new normal?Let’s wait and see but let us plan for the virus to be with us in the world for the foreseeable future. There is no evidence to suggest it will suddenly disappear and let’s see what that means for how we organise our lives.I believe the coming reality for the world will be one where we are always defending against this enemy, like a kind of fire brigade is needed in place. And within that defence, then have the recovery of social interaction and economic activity but done in a way that keeps us all as safe as much as possible. I don’t think we have an impossible task but if we call on our collective ingenuity to establish norms that will enable society and business to get on with what they do best, which is enterprise that creates wealth and enables people to have a decent standard of life.I’m asking people to consider the new norms at the same time they are imposing lockdowns because the new norms are going to be key to exiting safely from lockdowns without exposing people to disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-in-india-was-early-this-was-far-sighted-courageous-move-who-special-envoy-on-covid-19/story-wNdCkNVOqV5gCN8Du9jJ3N.html

Prime Minister Modi conveyed his condolence for the loss of lives in the United Kingdom over the past few days. He expressed satisfaction that the Prince of Wales had recovered from his own indisposition and wished him lasting good health. The Prince expressed his appreciation for members of the Indian diaspora in the UK, including many members of the National Health Service, who were playing a vital role in fighting the pandemic. He also referred to the selfless work being done by religious and social organisations of the Indian community in the UK.The Prince thanked the Indian Prime Minister for the facilitation and help provided for British citizens stranded in India during the ongoing health crisis. Prime Minister Modi in turn expressed his gratitude to the Prince for the keen interest he has always taken in Ayurveda. He explained the recent Indian initiative aimed at teaching basic yoga exercises through short animation videos, and disseminating easy home-made traditional remedies for enhancing immunity. The Prince of Wales appreciated the potential of these initiatives for enhancing health and wellbeing, especially during the current health crisis the world is facing. Prince Charles is the longest-serving Prince of Wales and is the eldest son of Elizabeth II, the British monarch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-dials-prince-of-wales-discusses-covid-19-and-wishes-him-good-health/story-VxueLSXol7lPb1YgXvCXlL.html
03-04-2020||India||Sewage could hold clue to coronavirus circulation||Testing sewage water could give authorities clues about the circulation of Covid-19 in cities, new research has found. Scientists in the Netherlands found the virus circulating in sewage water even when cases of Covid-19 were very low and the outbreak was still in its early stages in Dutch cities. In another analysis, Chinese scientists have suggested the use of paper-based devices (analytical devices for rapid diagnostics of pathogens. For instance, paper-based testing kits for malaria) to trace these pathogens early on.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn the Dutch study, tests were conducted from sewage water samples three weeks before the first case of Covid-19 tested positive in the Netherlands but no markers were found in wastewater. When the test was conducted again on March 4 and 5, one week after the outbreak began in the country, markers were found in wastewater. Wastewater treatment plants were selected from two large and three medium sized Dutch cities and an airport to draw samples from which ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) was conducted. RT PCR enables identification of pathogens by detecting their genetic material.Also Read: ‘Lockdown in India was early, far-sighted and courageous’: WHO envoyScientists, however, clarified that there is no evidence yet that sewage is a transmission mode for SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a significant proportion of stool samples in earlier studies, just two studies reported finding infectious virus from these samples. This indicates virus doesn’t sustain in sewage water for long possibly due to treatment. Surveillance of sewage water, however, offers the opportunity to check for community prevalence of the disease.“It is important to collect information about the occurrence and fate of this new virus in sewage to understand if there is no risk to sewage work ers, but also to determine if sewage surveillance could be used to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in our communities… sewage surveillance could also serve as early warning of the re-emergence of Covid-19 in cities, much like the sewage surveillance for poliovirus that has been used for this purpose,” authors from the KWR Water Research Institute in the Netherlands said in the study published in medRxiv.Another analysis published in the Environment Science and Technology journal by scientists from the School of Water, Energy and Environment, Cranfield University, and Chinese Academy of Sciences said paper-based devices to pick up bio-markers in sewage samples similar to those being used for HIV, Malaria, Zika virus, human papillomavirus, among others, can be useful for tracking Covid-19.Dr Zhugen Yang, lecturer at Cranfield Water Science Institute, said: “In the case of asymptomatic infections in the community or when people are not sure whether they are infected or not, real time community sewage detection through paper analytical devices could determine whether there are Covid-19 carriers in an area to enable rapid screening, quarantine and prevention.”“Sewage surveillance has been done for polio and non-polio viruses in the past. But testing sewage samples is not easy. We need RT-PCR now on a large scale for people. Swabs from sewage in cities can be extracted from the common duct in an area to test it. But I think that would be a post -pandemic response in India. We need testing kits to be available right now. That’s a priority,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. India is testing at only about 36% of its capacity currently, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sewage-could-hold-clue-to-virus-circulation/story-zWrlgHh5XbcOlF4LUWMmkM.html
03-04-2020||India||62% of Delhi’s 293 Covid-19 cases now linked to Jamaat||At least 182 (62%) of the 293 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Delhi were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation that took place in Nizamuddin early in March, the Delhi government said on Thursday, while maintaining that the outbreak had not entered the community transmission phase in the national capital.Between Wednesday and Thursday, Delhi reported 141 new Covid-19 cases.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a digital news briefing on Thursday, said the number of deaths caused by the disease in Delhi increased to four on Thursday, up from two a day earlier. The two new deaths were traced to Nizamuddin Markaz, an emerging hot spot of infections discovered late in March.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicKejriwal also announced that a one-time compensation scheme of Rs 5,000 for Delhi’s construction workers will be extended to cover those operating public service vehicles such as auto-rickshaws, taxis and e-rickshaws.“We currently have 208 active coronavirus patients in various hospitals, out of which one is still on ventilator and five are on oxygen. The remaining 202 are stable,” Kejriwal said.Out of the 2,346 people evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin, 536 are in the hospital as they showed Covid-19 symptoms, according to the government. The remaining people have been taken to seven government quarantine centres, including one in Tughlakabad Railway colony and DDA flats in Bakkarwala, Narela and Sultanpuri.The chief minister reiterated that the number of cases could increase further as the government planned to begin testing even those Markaz evacuees who were under government quarantine.“The patients who were brought out from the Markaz are serious. So, we will conduct tests on each of the 2,346 persons evacuated from there. Some of them could be corona positive as more results arrive in a day or two. The Delhi tally will then shoot up,” Kejriwal said.He said it was vital that everyone followed the 21-day national lockdown to control the spread of the disease that has killed at 51,000 people worldwide.Kejriwal narrated a tale from Mahabharata in which Yudhishthir tells Vidur that neither the strongest nor the fastest would survive a forest fire and only those animals that live in burrows would see themselves through the fire. “This coronavirus is like a forest fire. Those who stay home will remain healthy,” Kejriwal said.Giving the latest figures of those under quarantine, he said 2,943 people were in the government’s quarantine facilities out of which 1,133 were those who came from abroad and 1,810 were cases linked to the Markaz. By late Thursday evening, the count of those in government quarantine touched 3,075.The chief minister announced that the Delhi government will give a one-time compensation of Rs 5,000 to those who have a public service vehicle (PSV) registered in Delhi. The decision is likely to benefit more than 250,000 owners of PSVs such as auto-rickshaws (nearly 95,000), e-rickshaws (around 85,000), taxis (nearly 75,000) and Gramin Sewas (over 6,100).“Many auto, e-rickshaw and taxi drivers have complained that their income has stopped as they cannot operate their vehicles due to the lockdown. My government has decided to give them Rs 5,000 each so they do not have to sleep hungry. Implementing this scheme will take about 10 days since we are still devising the system through which the money will be disbursed. We are thinking of direct bank transfers, but the problem is that we do not have the account details of many of them,” the chief minister said.On March 24, the Delhi government said it would give Rs 5,000 to all registered construction workers in the city. On Wednesday, the government released Rs 5,000 to 32,358 registered workers, while the process for 9,000 more was underway.Auto and taxi unions in the city welcomed the move and urged the government to ensure that the benefits were given to the right people. “We had been demanding for some kind of relief ever since the Delhi government announced the Capital’s lockdown on March 22. Finally, it has been addressed today. But, we request the government to ensure the money goes only to those who are in real need of it. For example, there are rich people who own multiple auto-rickshaws and give it to drivers on rent. So, I hope a system is devised where the benefit reaches the driver,” said Santosh Pandey, the president of Aapka Apna Auto Taxi Union, which is registered with the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/62-of-delhi-s-293-covid-19-cases-now-linked-to-jamaat/story-jwOw3WZfPat6AJdUMLHHNM.html
03-04-2020||India||Tracking to testing: Control rooms at forefront of efforts to contain Covid-19 spread||With more than 100 positive Covid-19 cases detected in at least nine states around the country -- apart from Delhi -- Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, among others, have set up control rooms to act as nodal centres to track the spread of the virus by processing real-time data from the districts, coordinating door-to-door surveillance, and testing people. Here is a look at what how these control rooms function.Uttar PradeshA 1,600 sq feet hall on the fourth floor of the health directorate office in Lucknow has about 20 people sitting before computer screens processing data, making calls, and coordinating with health officials in 75 districts.“We are connected to the state helpline (18001805145) to get inputs from across the state. We are also in touch with senior officials to pass on necessary inputs to districts,” said a staff member, requesting anonymity.Additional space and hardware, such as computer terminals, have been allocated in the building to expand operations. The control room has data of nearly 60,000 people with names, cell numbers and addresses. “The number of outbound calls had gone up to 2,000 a day when migrant workers were entering the state last week,” a control room official said. UP has earmarked 246 hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicTelanganaControl rooms have been set up at the state secretariat in Hyderabad, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation office, and at all three major police commissionerates in Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda. Apart from these, each district has its own control rooms to monitor Covid-19 cases and to enforce the national lockdown. The statewide control rooms are monitored by two IAS officers, Rahul Bojja and Anil Kumar; while the state ministers of information technology, health, animal husbandry and home coordinate regularly with the chief minister’s office. The district control room interacts with the police and medical teams tracking Covid-19 suspects through door-to-door surveillance. An application, TSCop, helps geotag the houses of foreign returnees and their contacts. People under home quarantine have also been asked to take selfies and submit them online.Three hospitals in Hyderabad have been dedicated for treating Covid-19 patients. A huge facility is coming up at Gachibowli sports complex with 14,000-beds. Also Read: Govt may borrow ₹40k crore as cash-strapped states seek fundsTamil NaduThe state has a 200-person strong 24x7 control room run out of the Directorate of Public Health office in Chennai, in addition to specific control rooms in each district. “We have a portal (stopcorona.tn.gov.in) on which we put out information,” a senior official from the National Health Mission - Tamil Nadu said.Districts provide three updates to the state control room every day: one on medical supplies, and two daily reports on the number of people quarantined; their health status, how many samples have been tested, and how many have tested positive.Responsibilities have been divided at the state control room: collecting data on home quarantines; relaying information to district collectors and deans of medical colleges; an integrated disease surveillance portal desk where the acute respiratory infection details are entered; and a dedicated call centre for the public.The state control room also has doctors, statistical assistants, and computer engineers. Fourteen hospitals around the state have been earmarked to treat Covid-19 patients in the state.Also Read: Coronavirus: How world reached a million cases in 93 daysKeralaOne-hundred and twenty officials work in the central control room in three shifts. Kerala’s round-the-clock toll free helpline (1056) is monitored from this facility. The head of the control room briefs the health secretary, who in turn, briefs the health minister and chief minister at a 4pm daily meeting. The network of people on the ground (rapid response teams including primary health workers, Asha and Anganwadi workers) who survey their areas with the help of local body members and the police submit reports to district medical officers every day. These are fed to the district control room, which sends it to the state control room, where at least four people have been assigned to each district. Apart from giving instructions to the ground staff, these control rooms track people who have returned from overseas and made self-declarations at airports and police stations. Those under quarantine use a geo-tracking application that maps their movements if they step out of their homes. Information about them is tracked by locak body workers and sent to the control rooms.Kerala has six Covid-only hospitals and each of the 14 districts have Covid care homes. All district and taluk hospitals have isolation wards, according to a state health official.KarnatakaA task force under chief minister BS Yediyurappa -- it includes deputy CM Ashwath Narayan, health minister B Sriramulu, and medical education minister K Sudhakar. The central control room has at least 120 people from various government departments tasked to update district-wise numbers, track developments, field calls, and coordinate efforts across the states.Bangalore based Pro-digital labs helped the government setup the control room. While initially the tracking was through excel sheets, now a specialised app called “Quarantine Watch” has been built in-house by the government. All those under home quarantine are required to upload hourly photos/selfies. This app automatically sends location data, which is checked to ensure that those being tracked are actually at the location they claim to be. Locally, information at district level is fed by Asha workers, Anganwadi workers and village volunteers. The data is centrally collated at the war room to monitor progress and track patients. Several government and private hospitals have been set aside for Covid-19 patients.Maharashtra The state has set up a dedicated control room in state secretariat, with 14 senior bureaucrats handling different responsibilities. For instance, Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance, has been tasked with ensuring that all government departments receive the grants allotted to them, while Rajiv Jalota, additional chief secretary, has been directed to formulate measures to implement all policy decisions taken by different departments. The state has earmarked 30 government hospitals and 1000 private hospitals for free treatment of Covid-19 patients under Maharashtra Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. Andhra PradeshA control centre at Vijayawada operates round-the-clock with staff from 21 government departments working in shifts.

03-04-2020||India||Government may borrow Rs 40k crore as cash-strapped states seek funds||The government may borrow about Rs 40,000 crore to compensate cash-strapped states for their revenue shortfall under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, and push its departments and public sector firms to clear their vendors’ dues , to rescue them from an acute liquidity crunch caused by the 21-day coronavirus lockdown, three officials aware of the developments said. Apart from states, government departments also owe money to companies across sectors for products bought, services rendered, or such things as subsidies. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIn a meeting with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi though video conference on Thursday, several state chief ministers demanded that the Centre pay their GST compensation, immediately release the wages of workers enrolled under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and sought help in Coronavirus relief efforts. The government is considering their proposals, the three officials said.The cabinet secretariat and the department of expenditure are continuously monitoring the situation so that the states do not face a funding crunch in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and companies, particularly micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME), receive their dues in time to tide over the crisis, the officials said on condition of anonymity. Several states have cited a funding crunch and announced salary cuts for their employees for March.Industry, particularly the MSME sector, has asked for the speedy release of outstanding payments by government agencies. “The expenditure secretary has told all ministries and CPSEs (central public sector enterprises) not to sit on vendors’ money and clear their dues expeditiously,” one of the officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.An official in the West Bengal government said the Centre must pay the entire compensation amount due to the states at this crucial juncture to meet their Covid-19 expenses. Punjab has asked for the release of Rs 6,752.83 crore in GST arrears immediately; the payment has been pending since October , 2019.A recent report on Covid-19 prepared by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) also asked the Centre provide liquidity to states by increasing the overdraft facility available to them from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and pay pending GST compensation immediately.Also Read: Hoarding, transport snags choke supply of essentials According to the Union government officials mentioned above, the total compensation payout ito the states n 2019-20 is expected to be over Rs 1.20 lakh crore while total collection from GST compensation cess was less than Rs 80,000 crore. “The government will put up a proposal to the GST Council to borrow from the market to pay compensation to states,” the second official said.The GST law assures the states a 14% increase in their revenue for five years and the Centre is committed to meeting any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes and other tobacco products.Most of the states asked the Centre to relax their borrowing limits,and demanded an additional grant in the aftermath of Covid-19 and advance wage payments to MGNREGS workers. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar requested the Union government to consider raising the fiscal deficit limit for the state to tide over the emergency. A similar demand also came from the Punjab and Rajasthan governments. The states’ current fiscal deficit limit stands at 3 % of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). West Bengal has demanded a grant of Rs 25,000 crore to fight the Coronavirus disease pandemic, besides kits to fight the virus, such as face masks, gloves, sanitizers and protective suits for medical staff. It also demanded that the Centre release Rs 36,000 crore under different accounts that had not been released earlier. “...to uphold the spirit of cooperative federalism, we need this minimum help from the central government to cope with the unprecedented impasse at this hour to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to the Prime Minister on Wednesday. She did not take part in the video conference with PM Modi on Thursday.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray sought the release of GST compensation worth Rs 16,000 crore. The state government also sought help with procurement and manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and N-95 masks, a government statement said.Punjab also demanded payment of 15 days’ unemployment allowance per month for three months to mitigate rural distress on account of the national lockdown, suggesting a 90:10 centre-state sharing for these. It asked for a special insurance package for fronline workers such as the police and sanitary workers. Rajasthan demanded Rs 1 lakh crore from the Centre to fight Covid-19. In a statement after the video conference with the PM, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said he had requested for a relief package and asked for an enhancement of the state’s borrowing limit. Gehlot requested an inter-state supply chain protocol for essential items, medicines and medical equipment, advance payment of wages to registered and active MNREGS workers and demanded cancellation of payment of interest to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other central financial institutions. Some CMs including Thackeray also demanded immediate distribution of Coronavirus safety equipment and testing kits. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik did not present any wish-list in the video conference with PM Modi, but he wrote to him earlier this week demanding unemployment allowance to 3.61 million active MGNREGS workers in the state for the lockdown period of 21 days. He requested the Centre to allow the state government to utilise Rs 380.39 crore from the MNREGS fund to provide the unemployment allowance for 21 days.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel in a letter to PM Modi on Wednesday demanded the allocation of a special relief package for labourers under MGNREGS. He also requested a support of Rs 750 per month to all Jan-Dhan account holders for the next three months. Under a relief package announced last week, the government will pay Rs 500 a month for three months to women who hold Jan Dhan accounts. The Union government has also received industry requests to release payments that are due to private sector units. According to an industry estimate, the outstanding payments to companies run into lakhs of crores. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) estimated payments owed by state distribution companies to power generation units at Rs 90,000 crore. In the delayed payments monitoring portal MSME Samadhaan, only 14% of the Rs 3,774.36 crore (against 11,619 claims) filed by MSMEs have been settled so far, it said.Assocham president Niranjan Hiranandani said the payment delays had created a massive liquidity crunch in two ways: “One, government is taking over all the cheap borrowing in the system (though inadequate), and two, they do not release cash flow to vendors – so the liquidity crisis has exacerbated. MSMEs struggle to cover the financial shortfall created by delayed payments, owing to the high cost of borrowing and this often creates viability issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-borrow-40k-crore-as-cash-strapped-states-seek-funds/story-nWAmkZKea4J94oCqGNXsWK.html
03-04-2020||India||Amid lockdown, 190-yr-old bridge on Pune-Mumbai expressway to be demolished||With the Pune-Mumbai expressway now deserted because of the 21-day lockdown, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has decided to demolish the 190-year-old historic Amrutanjan bridge near Khandala ghat on the expressway because it has become a hindrance to traffic, officials said.The MSRTC, which sought special permission from Raigad district collector and local police, will raze the bridge between April 4 and 14 using explosives. While there will not be much traffic on the expressway during the period, the Raigad police have made additional changes near Khandala ghat to ensure minimum hindrance to the demolition work.Raigad police said that the bridge built by the British in 1830 has become hindrance for traffic leading to mishaps on regular basis on the expressway. Though not in use since the MSRDC built another bridge parallel to the old one while constructing the expressway, the MSRDC had earlier decided to retain the Amrutanjan bridge.The iconic bridge which is a big draw for tourists to take photographs of the picturesque Khandala ghat, began to interrupt the traffic after the expressway was built with its pillars coming in the way of commuters. To smoothen the traffic, the MSRDC had written to Indian railways, which is the custodian of the bridge, for its demolition.“While the planning was on to demolish the Amrutanjan bridge for long, it wasn’t feasible due to otherwise heavy traffic movement on Expressway. However, with complete lockdown and deserted expressway, MSRTC after relevant permission has decided to raze h the bridge using explosive material between April 4 and 14,” said Digambar P. Pradhan, Superintendent of Police, HSP, Thane, in an order.Commuters between Pune and Mumbai often have to bear to bear the brunt of traffic congestion near the old structure. British officer Captain Hughes, responsible for developing railway tracks between Mumbai and Lonavala, built the bridge in one year. The bridge later became a vital link between the two cities of the state. It later came to be known as Amrutanjan bridge after a giant advertisement for the ointment by that name was put up near the bridge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-190-yr-old-bridge-on-pune-mumbai-expressway-to-be-demolished/story-jsAOTjJtaGjz2gz0Hg6iEP.html

03-04-2020||India||Aggressive tests, tracing infected people key to stopping Covid-19: South Korean envoy||South Korean ambassador Shin Bong-kil has said that aggressive testing, tracing people infected by the virus and quarantining them is key to preventing the spread of Covid-19. In an interview with HT, he also said the Indian government must take speedy steps after the end of the current lockdown to assist Korean companies that have heavily invested in the country to resume normal operations.Why has South Korea’s 3Ts (test, trace and treat) and civic participation policy been so successful?The Korean government’s Covid-19 control strategy consists of robust testing to identify confirmed cases, tracing their contacts to prevent further spread, and treating those infected at the earliest possible stage. It is also centred on actively engaging the public to participate in social distancing and other preventive measures.So we can say that robust diagnostic testing capability lies at the core of our control strategy for the Covid-19 epidemic.With our current diagnostic testing capacity of up to 15,000 tests per day, we have performed a total of over 400,000 tests so far and continue to test at near-full capacity.I think in the present situation where no Covid-19 vaccine is available, identifying, isolating the contagion and treating in the early stage can be the only viable method of fighting this invisible enemy.What is current status of the spread of Covid-19 in South Korea?The situation has been stabilised. The number of newly confirmed cases per day has been showing steady decline. Now, it fluctuates around the level of 100 per day. Patients who have fully recovered surpass that of the newly confirmed cases. Despite the encouraging trend, we continue to remain vigilant.Can the 3T policy be applied in India?In India’s case, the lockdown of the entire nation was a necessary step considering India’s sheer size and demographic. However, in order to prevent mass spread of the virus, it is important to identify those at high risk, carry out aggressive testing, then trace those infected with the virus and quarantine them.For example, Korea at the initial stage faced a mass outbreak due to a gathering of a religious congregation in one of its provinces. The Korean government acquired the list of all members of the religious organisation and aggressively proceeded to test and quarantine them. We were thus successful in controlling the spread of the virus at an early stage.How can India and South Korea collaborate to counter Covid-19?The Korean government is prepared to fully share all information and insight garnered in our ongoing fight against Covid-19 with India. President Moon Jae-in and Prime Minister Modi exchanged ideas through the virtual G20 Summit. We will partake in coordinated global responses, extend support to multilateral efforts and do our utmost to meet demands in other countries for medical equipment and supplies subject to our domestic needs and production capacity.In the long term, Korea and India, both advanced in the IT industry and the bio and pharmaceutical industry, can cooperate on R&D in the fight against virus-related diseases.What has been the impact on business of Korean companies and what steps can India take to address their concerns?As you are well aware, Korean companies such as Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Kia closed their plants due to the lockdown directive of the Indian government. Well aligned with the “Make in India” policy, our companies have invested heavily in the country and a complete shutdown incurs massive losses for them.I truly hope the shutdown situation is alleviated and India overcomes its Covid-19 crisis as soon as possible. Often, crisis leads to chance. India must not lose the opportunity to emerge as a world top manufacturing hub.Once the shutdown is lifted, new personnel will have to be dispatched for handling new equipment and installing new facilities. I hope the authorities expedite visas for engineers from Korea who wish to enter India.What is South Korea doing to evacuate its nationals, including stranded tourists?Korean residents in India have been strictly following social distancing directives of the authorities and closely watching developments.On the first weekend in April, we are preparing a special Korean Air flight to send Korean residents and tourists in India who desire to return to Korea. Further evacuation will be dependent on the future pandemic situation and the status of the shutdown, which is currently imposed till April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressive-tests-tracing-infected-people-key-to-stopping-covid-19-south-korean-envoy/story-OlBt5j7VN2laukKkQMOVlI.html
03-04-2020||India||PM Modi to share video message with people at 9 am||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who announced the 21-day national lockdown in a late evening televised address to the nation on March 24, on Thursday said that he would share a video message with “fellow Indians” tomorrow morning.“At 9 AM tomorrow morning, I’ll share a small video message with my fellow Indians,” PM Modi tweeted on Thursday soon after he spoke with chief ministers via video conference.Friday will be the 10th day of the lockdown that has brought the economy to a grinding halt. The government had ordered all industrial units, offices and educational institutions to be shut for 21 days and told people to stay indoors to minimise the number of coronavirus cases in the country.India has reported just a little over 2,000 coronavirus cases and 50 deaths.In his interaction with chief ministers earlier in the day, PM Modi had underlined that the country’s common goal was to ensure minimum loss of life and asked chief ministers for suggestions how the government could stagger relaxations so that people do not come out on the streets at the same time.He, however, cautioned states that they needed to keep the supply chain moving to ensure supply of essential medical products and raw material for medicines and medical equipment.Home Minister Amit Shah, who also spoke at this conference, had emphasised to the chief ministers the necessity of ensuring the lockdown is complete, a point that PM Modi had also underlined when he spoke about the deadly disease in his monthly radio programme Mann ki Baat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-share-video-message-with-people-on-friday-at-9-am/story-c9ic3VVeEWAl9CciVmqfDK.html
03-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: ‘Biggest challenge is fighting stigma’, says health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Covid-19||In the middle of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan spoke to Amandeep Shukla about “flattening the curve”, the importance of the lockdown period, aggressive testing, community transmission, and the quest for a cure, among other issues. Edited excerpts: India has crossed 1,500 Covid-19 cases. When do you think the curve will flatten?All public health measures are being put into place to mitigate the rise of the epidemic curve in India. The upcoming few days are critical. Our experience from the global response tells us that even with stringent lockdowns and public health measures, the transmission dynamics of Covid-19 is such that it takes about 2-4 weeks to bend the curve.We recommended quarantine for 14 days, based on the incubation period of the infection. Incubation period is the time between acquiring the infection and manifestation of the symptoms. So, persons who acquire the infection prior to the lockdown will keep manifesting symptoms and be reported as cases in the first 10-14 days of the lockdown period. Only after this incubation period is over can we expect a change in the trajectory of the epidemic curve.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicHow important is the lockdown period?It is an important intervention, as it delays the peak of the epidemic, slows the growth of the curve, and provides the health and social systems the time to mount a response. However, despite the lockdown and all public health measures being in place, it will take some time for the caseload to reduce, because individuals exposed just prior to the lockdown may take some time to manifest symptoms. Assuming that the lockdown is effective in ensuring social distancing, it will be important to see how the epi curve looks after two weeks.It is vital that we initiate community-led interventions to ensure social distancing, quarantining, and isolation of symptomatic persons to augment the scale of the lockdown.Do you think the lockdown should be extended?The situation is still evolving. No doubt, the lockdown and quarantine has tried to contain the spread amongst clusters, still we have a long way to go till every contact of a confirmed case is rendered safe.I would like to convey to your readers through this interview that they must honour the lockdown protocol. Staying at home is the only way of staying safe.There is a lot of discussion or speculation as to whether the country has reached stage 3 or not. Have there been cases of community transmission?There is no clear globally accepted definition for community transmission. Right now, India has mostly cases related to international travel, or such contacts. There have been only a few sporadic cases, which do not indicate a wider communitywide spread of infection at the national level. There are a few clusters of cases, which are being managed through cluster containment strategies. With the information at our disposal, it appears that there is no widespread transmission of Covid-19 in the community at the moment. However, we are far from being complacent, and we are maintaining stringent adherence to social distancing measures, ensuring a tight lockdown, and motivating the communities to own the social distancing strategies.How close or far are we from finding a cure? Is a vaccine still a distant possibility?There is no definitive cure for Covid-19 at the moment, and management is mostly symptomatic and supportive. However, a lot of investigational therapeutics are being researched, and India is part of international efforts to find a cure, such as the multi-country “Solidarity Trial” of WHO. Several treatment alternatives are also under trial; however, a definitive cure is not yet on the charts. Some of the agents under investigation include remdesivir, favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, to name a few. Some of the recent trials have indicated that the last two options may not be very effective. However, new evidence is emerging every day.According to WHO landscaping, there are over 40 vaccine candidates under investigation. However, most of them are in the pre-clinical evaluation stage, and only two have progressed to Phase 1 clinical trials. The availability of the genomic details has accelerated vaccine production, but still we are unlikely to have a vaccine ready to scale up in time to staunch the current epidemic.Also Read: Genetic sequencing takes lead in Covid-19 vaccine developmentAround 100 cases have been declared as recovered? What are the lessons learnt from those cases? Are there any patterns which give us hope?Most cases of Covid-19 are mild to moderate. Around 80-85% of cases are likely to be mild. Hence, we expect a significant proportion of infected people to recover without any significant sequelae. Our focus remains on preventing deaths. The most vulnerable groups include the elderly, or those with other conditions such as lung diseases, heart diseases and other chronic diseases. It is important to protect these high-risk individuals first.What is the biggest challenge in countering this virus?The timely dissemination of critical public health information down to the last man is the challenge. The other challenge is the misinformation about Covid-19 that is spread through social media or because of certain myths. We are constantly strategising on how to meet and counter both these challenges. Central and state infrastructure is pressed into action to ensure critical information related to precautions, social distancing norms, lockdown and self-quarantine protocols is available to the common public. Official channels of information are being constantly updated and monitored.Similarly, steps are being taken to prevent spread of misinformation that can otherwise give rise of panic amongst the people. The third challenge is to get the communities to own the process of ensuring social distancing and self-enforcing these measures so that transmissibility is reduced.My biggest challenge is to ensure that affected people are treated with compassion, and not stigmatised. This is also applicable for the health care workforce, which is working hard to counter this epidemic. It is through concerted, community-owned efforts, supported by the policies put in place by the government that we can contain this disease.A lot of people feel that India is not doing sufficient testing. The example being given is of South Korea. Are we going to increase testing, especially in rural areas?India has scaled up the capacity for testing in a massive way. As of April 1, 2020 there are 124 government laboratories across the nation that have been supported by ICMR. Further, 49 private laboratory chains have also been approved for testing. In order to ensure that we have reliable and accurate results, and the laboratory staff are also not exposed to undue risks of acquiring the infection, all labs have to meet a set of minimum standards. However, we have pan-India testing capacity, and are testing more samples every day.Further, in initiating the testing work, we have to keep in mind the Indian context as well as the state of propagation of the epidemic in India. While indiscriminate testing is discouraged to ensure optimal use of resources available to us, targeted testing of higher risk groups has been the strategy to identify and contain the cases. In the near future, however, we will be scaling up testing to reach out to a wider population.When will we widen testing and make it more aggressive?India has scaled up the capacity for testing in a massive way recently. Collection centres are located in over 16,000 places across India. At present, we are utilising only 43% of our capacity to test in public laboratories. As of April 1, 2020, 8pm, we have tested a total of 53,605 persons. The figure for today alone is 5,654 persons, who have undergone testing.Further, serologic testing is also under consideration, However, presence of antibodies indicates either past or currently active infection. They appear late in the natural history of disease between 5-7 days or so. Though these tests can be used for persons under surveillance, they cannot be used for early diagnosis. These laboratories are expected to offer tests to those who are eligible to receive the test based on the Covid-19 testing guidelines. These testing guidelines are appropriate for the level of the outbreak and avoid indiscriminate testing.What is your strategy for areas where the spread is more? NCR is one such area. Kerala and Maharashtra have almost over 200 cases each.A differential strategy needs to be adopted for areas depending on the extent of infections being reported. While it is important to protect the districts where no cases have emerged, it is also important to limit the spread of infection in districts where cases have been noted. To do this, we are focusing on multiple strategies.At present, 10 states are contributing more than 80 per cent of the total number of Covid cases in India. Maharashtra and Kerala have the highest number of confirmed cases. Also, Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka have the fastest-growing incidences.Only 16 districts account for 80% of the cases that have occurred in the last three days. Quite obviously, we work in a very focused way to contain the further spread of infection in these districts and employ multiple strategies for doing so. The central government works in very close coordination with the states to ensure that the rate of growth of new cases is contained.Testing of eligible populations remains a focus area. Self-reporting of symptomatic persons, either through mobile apps or helplines is also being undertaken in some places. The lockdown needs to be supplemented with sustenance and relief operations through provision of food or other benefits to ensure that people are incentivised to adhere to the lockdown.COVID-19 specific healthcare facilities need to be identified at district level, starting with the COVID-19 affected districts first. These facilities should be provided with the resources needed to combat the clinical workload.How cooperative have the states been?There is perfect coordination between the Centre and the states. I have been in regular touch with the state health ministers right from the beginning of this battle. I must commend them for the excellent work done by them in helping us control the spread of this epidemic either in the form of contact tracing, enforcing lockdown, providing isolation and quarantine facilities, ensuring smooth flow of supplies of critical equipment and supplies, boosting the morale of health workers, etc.There is a continuous dialogue that I hold with the states. Just recently, I asked them to request retired doctors to volunteer proactively for battling this disease. Similarly, I requested the states to sort out issues related to health workers transportation on priority so that there is no shortage of doctors, nurses and other staff. We have asked them to issue directives that no landlord can evict doctors, nurses and other health workers. We are ironing out all difficulties together.What is your message for the medical community?This is an unprecedented crisis that is facing humanity as a whole. My heartfelt gratitude to all our health workers and support staff taking care of patients across the world. They are the ones who are leading this battle from the front. I call them “Corona Warriors”. Their selfless service at this juncture is unparalleled. The health of the nation is in their hands, they are placing the needs of the patients before their own. My request is to provide them with safe and respectful working conditions.On March 22, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji told the nation to observe a day-long Janta Curfew and come out on the balconies at 5pm in large numbers to honour all the medical, nursing, paramedical, sanitary workers and other staff engaged in the hospitals. He asked the nation to stand up and in unison clap for our Corona Warriors and clang thalis. The air reverberated with the pious sounds of ‘Thali Bajao, Thali Bajao’ that evening. I felt moved by the commitment that people across the country showed, and I personally know many who cried that evening.My message to the community is simple – the nation shall never forget your sacrifice. We are grateful to not just you, but your families as well.What are the most important things to keep in mind during this crisis?I would like to reiterate the importance of remaining calm, ensuring that there is no spread of misinformation, and ensuring that there is adherence to the policies and advisories which are being provided by the government from time to time. ‘Precaution, and not panic’ is the need of the hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biggest-challenge-is-fighting-stigma-harsh-vardhan/story-iRCLKihLKBY3ZYuCEiuEXM.html
03-04-2020||India||Man lynched in Bihar’s Sitamarhi for informing about Covid-19 suspects||A 24-year-old man was lynched in Bihar’s Sitamarhi district after an argument over the information he shared about people who came back from Maharashtra on the state government’s helpline for Covid-19, police said on Tuesday.The man, identified as Babloo Kumar, was on way to his uncle’s house when a group of locals thrashed him in an area under Runnisaidpur police station late on Monday. He was rushed to Runnisaidpur primary health centre where doctors referred him to the Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur where he was declared ‘brought dead’.Babloo had called the helpline to give information about two people who had returned from Maharashtra with their families to Madhaul village. This allegedly angered the families.His elder brother Guddu said a joint team of medical and local police personnel reached the village and took them for tests and released after advising them home quarantine. He said Babloo worked in Maharashtra’s Pune and came back to the village two months ago.A case has been lodged against seven people—Thaga Mahto, Sudhir Kumar, Vikash Mahto, Madan Mahto, Deepak Kumar and Munna Mahto—on the basis of Guddu’s statement recorded by the Ahiyapur police station in Muzaffarpur district. SKMCH under the Ahiyapur police station had forwarded the matter to Runnisaidpur. Also read: States told to stop, shelter migrants walking back home amid lockdownDevendra Prasad Singh, the station house officer of Runnisaidpur police station, said out of the seven accused two—Sudhir and Munna—have been arrested and raids are on to nab others.Hundreds of thousands of such workers who work in other states have been coming back to their villages after a lockdown was imposed from March 25 to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. It left millions of such migrant workers jobless and many defied the restrictions imposed on movement as they tried to return home on foot in the absence of any public transport.The Centre has asked states to seal their borders, provide migrant workers shelter and food, and set up quarantine centres to prevent their further movement until the lockdown ends. The continuing movement of migrants has prompted authorities in Bihar to issue directions for keeping all those returning home under a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Officials said about 100,000 workers in Bihar are in government-monitored quarantine facilities and that many more on roads in different states. In a separate incident, a mob in Jehanabad’s Dayali-Bigha village attacked a medical team and damaged two vehicles including a police patrol car when a team from the Modanganj block administration reached the village after they got information that some people had returned from New Delhi and Durgapur in West Bengal.Sub-divisional police officer Prasant Bhusan Shrivastava said a medical team reached the village after they got information about suspected Covid-19 patients but villagers chased them from the spot.The medical team led by Ajay Kumar, the block development officer, has detained a man for a checkup. Irate over the action, villagers attacked and damaged the vehicles and snatched the cell phones from some of the team’s personnel. A case had been lodged and raids are on to nab the culprits, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-lynched-in-bihar-s-sitamarhi-for-informing-about-covid-19-suspects/story-ee2A4jlyMFtsXpXJ39wFmK.html
03-04-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown, social distancing spoil Chhhath festival in Bihar||The lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus has thrown a spanner in the Chhath celebrations in Bihar which began on Saturday.On the very first day of the four-day long festival, devotees who had to observe the Nahai Khai rituals, tried to visit the ghats on the banks of the Ganga in Patna to bathe and also to take back the water as the food for devotees is prepared with it on this occasion. But at most of the ghats they were not allowed.The local administration had already banned entry to the ghats and had been asking devotees to observe Chhath rituals at their houses.Many devotees are now worried about how to observe the rituals of offering Arghya to the setting and rising sun which are scheduled on Monday and Tuesday. To observe this ritual devotees have to be in waist deep in the water.Many devotees have been creating makeshift ponds either at the roooftop or at the gardens of their houses to observe this ritual. But this time many of them have not been able to create this facility due to lack of hands caused by social distancing.Follow coronavirus live updates here.Many are also having a tough time in preparing prasad (religious offering) which is prepared in huge quantities. No relative or even a family member has been able to turn up to participate in the preparations due to the lockdown.Chhath is a major festival in Bihar where devotees worship the Sun. The festival is observed twice in a year.“But the entire celebration has been spoilt by the lockdown and social distancing. Yesterday we tried to go to the Gandhi ghat in the city, but couldn’t. Finally my son requested the cops to allow him to go there and managed to get a can of Ganga water for the rituals,” Umashankar Mishra, a government official at Kadam Kuan in state capital, said.Also read: ‘Corona attack on Bihar’: JD(U) leader slams migrant workers’ exodusEven the artificial pond could not be created. “The man who used to create it for us every year, has already left for his village due to Covid-19. We may have to observe the rituals in the bathtub this time,” he said.Vikas Upadhyay, secretary of Shri Rajgir Teerth Mahasangh, said Chhath is a community festival. “Without the support of family and relatives and friends it cannot be celebrated. And this is why in many families this is the occasion when daughters or sons working in other cities, get back to their homes. This year everything has been spoilt by the virus and lockdown,” he said. The mood among fruit traders at wholesale fruit market is more depressed.“Though the festival has already started, the fruit market is without any buyer,” Barun Kumar, vice president of fruit traders association, Bihar, said.In the Chhath festival wide varieties of fruits and even vegetables which grow under the ground, are offered to the Sun God. “Considering the expected demand on Chhath traders had ordered for truckloads of fruits in bulk. But the buyers did not turn up. Now the fruits which have already been delivered to the traders, are lying rotting at the Bazar Samiti,” he said.Over 20 trucks of oranges had arrived from Nagpur while many trucks also arrived from Nasik with grapes. “By the time lockdown was announced three trucks loaded with bananas had arrived from Hyderabad. Imagine the loss of the traders. It is not less than Rs 50 crores,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-social-distancing-spoil-chhhath-festival-in-bihar/story-En7ioJ22tMV5JAV2v1izIK.html
03-04-2020||India||Malaysian preacher dies in Bihar mosque||The death of a 65-year-old preacher from Malaysia, who came to Bihar’s Araria along with nine others, inside a mosque has set alarm bells ringing in the region even though authorities have not yet confirmed the exact cause of his demise.The preacher, identified as Md Khairani Bin Lookman, had reached Araria on March 21 died on Thursday evening. Lookman had landed in Delhi on March 6.“He offered namaz and soon after fell unconscious and died,” a local resident said adding that he was rushed to Araria district hospital where he was declared brought dead.According to sources, Araia district administration forced the doctor to perform an autopsy in the hospital despite several health officials suggesting it should be done at a bigger centre.A senior doctor said the postmortem was just a formality.“We cannot say anything at this point whether the preacher was a Covid-19 patient or not,” the added.Prashanth Kumar Ch, Araria district magistrate, could not be contacted as his mobile was switched off.However, a senior deputy collector, Araria, Shambhu Kumar said, “The rest nine Islamic preachers have been quarantined in the mosque where they are staying.”A large number of Muslims abstained from performing the obligatory congregational prayer on Friday at Jama Masjid. However, at some places, they defied the lockdown and gathered at local mosque to perform collective prayers.There are nine Covid-19 patients in Bihar as the number across the country crossed the 700 mark on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malaysian-preacher-dies-in-bihar-mosque/story-EJUG4Tj6aZLsVIJpCZsubI.html
03-04-2020||Today's||Not religion, the Markaz crisis is about health, and irresponsibility | Opinion||The Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi during the month of March is in the news for all the wrong reasons. Out of the total number of coronavirus positive cases in the country, nearly one-fifth coronavirus positive cases have been linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation . Also, of all the 56 countrywide deaths, 15 were those who had attended the congregation held last month. This has led to widespread negative media coverage against the body which organised the meet and the sect leader Maulana Saad. The facts that have emerged so far point towards the fact that after the Delhi government notification regarding ban on meetings beyond a limit, the Jamat leadership failed to recognise the urgency of the directives related to the prevention of the coronavirus spread. That the infection spread among the participants is a fact. That 15-odd innocent people lost their lives due to the virus is a sad reality. In this situation, it is the government’s utmost duty and responsibility to ensure that all people who attended the meet are tested for the deadly Sars-CoV-2 pathogen and quarantined. The action to sanitise the place of meeting and the campus was urgently required to save everyone from the effects of the deadly virus.Today, we as a country are up against a deadly virus which has not only disrupted our daily lives but has also brought infinite misery to the most vulnerable sections of the population by depriving them of their means of livelihood. In these pressing times, it is the duty of every citizen to strictly follow the guidelines issued by governments to stop the spread of this deadly virus. Every instruction issued by the authorities has to be adhered to, whether we like it or not. But there are a few who choose to ignore the directives or do not take them seriously. Some temples located across the country had a few thousands devotees even on March 18-19, as per media reports. Fortunately, for them, there have been no reports of the virus spreading at these congregations. But the Tablighi congregation organisers were not that fortunate. They certainly owe the responsibility of not adhering to the guidelines issued. Like the mosque in Malaysia, which became the epicentre of coronavirus cases in that country and had to be closed immediately.It is heartening to know that very swift action to control the situation due to the Delhi congregation was initiated by the government and all those who had attended the meet are being tracked and tested for the virus. Since the participants were from all across the country and foreign countries, the task is herculean. But it is hoped that soon it will be accomplished and the participants will be saved from the deadly virus. Let us be clear that the effort to track all the participants is to save them, their families and the people who come in contact with them. There is no other motive or intention. It is to be understood that it may be very natural for anyone to resist either the testing, or the quarantine.While a country-wide impact of this episode is very difficult to ascertain at this moment, it is also unfortunate that a section of media and public has viewed the crisis through the prism of Hindu-Muslim divide. Instead of communalising the crisis, joint and concerted efforts are urgently required to control further transmission of the virus in the community and beyond. It is in this connection that Muslim leaders and the Ulema need to play a vital role. That a large number of attendees of Ijtima at Markaz have disappeared or have remained untraceable, further burdening the government machinery, is despicable. But at the same time, the effort by some TV channels to present the issue as “Corona Jihad” or “bio-jihad”, as it was called, is also shameful. This is undoubtedly a medical emergency, arising out of the irresponsible attitude of the Markaz authorities who, instead of cancelling the event, went ahead with the programme. The Markaz authorities have come out with an explanation that they had approached the Delhi Police and other officers for the evacuation of people from the centre but there was no positive response from them. However, instead of holding each other responsible for the emergent situation that originated from the Markaz, it is urgently required to nip the crisis in the bud. This would not be possible without the active support of the Muslim community. The identification process of infected people needs to be completed urgently with the help of the community. These infected people should not be allowed to hide in the community as it could prove disastrous for the whole nation. Similarly, saner people on both sides of the divide should effectively launch an exercise to keep the issue within the realm of medical emergency and not turn it into a communal imbroglio.(VS Pandey is a retired Uttar Pradesh cadre IAS officer and retired as secretary to the Government of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/not-religion-the-markaz-crisis-is-about-health-and-irresponsibility-opinion/story-Otr8nz7j0PDxEM1b9bIwpN.html
03-04-2020||Today's||Covid-19 Fight: How PM Modi’s video message and lighting candles may help||On Day 10 of the lockdown PM Modi delivered a symbolic video message at 9 am this morning.The Prime Minister told 1.3 billion Indians to spend 9 minutes of their time on their balconies at 9pm on Sunday to light candles or mobile flashlights to display collective spirit to fight the Coronavirus.The message was more symbolic than anything else. India completed nine days of lockdown yesterday. The PM’s appeal for a collective show of unity was clearly to deal with two things: A. Overcome the overwhelming feeling of being alone and isolated in these trying times and B. to send out a message of unity and togetherness in the war against Covid-19...Of course, given the experience during the Janta curfew, when some folks took to the streets to beat utensils and clap to celebrate the essential service workers, Modi this time added the social distance caveat in his message. He urged people to NOT gather at one place or take to the streets for this exercise. Watch| ‘Switch off lights, light candles at 9 pm on Sunday’: PM Modi’s message amid lockdown l Full speechBut social media was flooded with memes no sooner had the PM finished with his video message. The cynics came out in droves asking why Modi did not utter a single word about rising count of coronavirus cases, testing, health infrastructure, migrant workers or economic woes.In all fairness, expectations are high every time PM Modi puts out a message that he is going to address the nation. And many of us were expecting him to address the disgraceful attack on doctors and medical staff witnessed in many areas of the country over the past several days.But then, the symbolism in Modi’s message was perhaps equally important.Many simply underestimate PM Modi’s connect with the masses. Modi’s message underlined the importance of the lockdown, that it shouldn’t be violated and emphasised on the need of the hour that is social distancing.Also right now, when most everyone is confined to their respective homes and is relatively socially isolated, collective displays of unity will likely boost morale, and give a sense of togetherness in the fight.And if the collective task is to fight the Covid-19 darkness with diyas and mobile flashlights at 9pm for 9 minutes, then so be it.

03-04-2020||Editorials||The tough balancing act||Amid speculation that the national lockdown, which ends on April 14, may get extended, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered the first hint of the government’s thinking on the issue in his interaction with the chief ministers on Thursday. He said that the Centre and the states must, together, work on an exit plan from the lockdown which would allow the staggered re-emergence of citizens. This indicated that while the total lockdown will not get extended, restrictions will remain in place — possibly in high-risk clusters, for the more vulnerable demographic groups such as the elderly, and on inter-state and international travel.This is a tough balancing act and there are no easy choices here. On one hand is the view that India will need a longer lockdown to be able to flatten the curve of infections. This has not happened yet — because of the time lag that exists between a person getting infected, getting tested, and getting results. The hope remains that in a week from now, the effect of the lockdown will begin showing some impact. If this is the case, extending it is sensible, for opening up the country could once again revive the chain of transmission. The other school of thought prioritises the economic costs of the lockdown — and is based on the belief that there is great disruption to livelihoods and there may even be deaths due to distress. Since there is no immediate cure for the virus, India has to learn to adapt to it and restoration of normalcy — while remaining caution — is the only way out.The government clearly is trying to find the right balance amid these contrasting approaches. Staggered re-emergence, in that sense, carries merit. But this will need clearly defined rules — who is to be allowed, who is prohibited from moving. But more importantly, it will confront implementation challenges. In India, enforcing a total lockdown has been difficult — enforcing a partial one will be even more challenging. In the ultimate analysis, it is best for the government to wait and let science and data dictate the decision closer to the end of the lockdown. If India has been able to ramp up its health infrastructure, and infections are reducing, staggered re-emergence may work. If India is witnessing a surge, and its health system remains under-prepared, it may be best to extend the lockdown for some more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-tough-balancing-act/story-cGOzUJjM6b580aT3T2x2xI.html
