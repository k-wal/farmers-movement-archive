21-04-2020||News||India is poised for deep structural health reforms||Despite a history of a weak health system, India was near an inflection point on health care reforms even before the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). We had both the income levels and building blocks that have been a precursor to game-changing reforms in several countries. India’s weak health care is a legacy of limited attention to it after Independence, and the multiple priorities of a young nation. Health care has not been a vote-catching subject and the government spending is only 1.2% of GDP. Health insurance is fragmented and less than one-third of the population has coverage. Besides, access to health care is poor, fragmented, skewed to urban areas, and often of low quality.This legacy burden could change rapidly with structural health systems reform, and those could be imminent. Once reforms start, the results could be dramatic over a 10-15 year period. As seen in over 20 other countries that have undertaken structural health reform, out-of-pocket medical expenditure will reduce to less than half of the pre-reform levels. And access to health care facilities will improve, resulting in more than a doubling of outpatient visits per capita.Why do we believe that structural reforms are imminent? India’s per capita income and health expenditure are similar to those of other low-and-middle income countries when they initiated structural health care reforms. More important, for sustainable change, we are seeing the emergence of a set of building blocks that were critical to initiate, accelerate and sustain large-scale reforms across 21 countries which we analysed. There are four building blocks.First, the presence of “change triggers”, which are macroeconomic or political changes that provide an opportunity for large-scale reforms. These include economic shocks (as seen in Ghana, United Kingdom, and Rwanda); the emergence of a charismatic leader (Thailand and China); or a transition between political regimes (Colombia, Philippines and others). For India, the Covid-19 crisis is a once-in-a-century change trigger, and will make health care an important topic for voters.The second is the emergence of technocratic capability. Strong pro-reform technocracy enabled change in Thailand, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Chile. Technocracy was developed either by skilled research institutes and academicians and/or led by state-specific experiments. In India, going into this coronavirus crisis, we have had increasingly strong technocratic capabilities, with experience from several experiments that include schemes in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Kerala’s robust handling of both the Nipah and Covid-19 outbreaks demonstrate how stronger technocratic capabilities can drive outcomes. Technocratic capabilities have also been built up through private-sector innovation with digital insurance models and low-cost hospitals. Coming out of this crisis, we will have stronger institutional capacity across the board.Third, large-scale reforms begin with a set of “lock-ins”. These are early initiatives that cannot be reversed without severe consequences much like universal insurance schemes such as the Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional in Indonesia or National Health Insurance in Taiwan. Over time, these become too big to fail and too popular to be dismantled. In India, visible reforms like Ayushman Bharat are effective “lock-ins” that are hard to roll back and provide a platform to build on. Last, strong stewardship is critical for reform. In most countries, the government has played a pivotal role. In India too, the roles of Niti Aayog, the National Health Authority and state health agencies are evolving, which will likely add pressure on the system for efficiency and better outcomes.The Covid-19 crisis and presence of these building blocks will provide a big impetus to public health. While India’s journey of reforms, like others, will be non-linear and uneven, there are a few areas that could emerge as priorities.Insurance coverage will expand through schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, Employment State Insurance Scheme, state schemes, and private insurance. These funds will also need to be spent efficiently as demand ratchets up, driving the need for better purchasing and scheme designs. Providers will also feel the pressure to improve efficiency, particularly those paid through demand-side financing. Purchasers will be accountable for how pooled money is spent, thereby, driving increased use of claims data to alter provider behaviour.Primary care will also be a larger priority. Increased incidence of non-communicable diseases — 55% in 2016 versus 31% in 1990 — will surface affordable ways for citizens to use outpatient care more regularly. These include the expansion of health and wellness centres, formalisation and aggregation of smaller private players and expansion of private primary health care chains through pooled purchasing agreements. Governance and regulation will need to keep pace. Regulators will no longer be invisible as more of the population sees and feels the results of their actions. Instances of corruption and fraudulent claims will add pressures on regulatory bodies. This will be especially true in private insurance and public and private health care. Finally, digital innovation will enable a lot of this reform, supported by Aadhaar and other data. Not all these early measures will succeed, not all reforms will “lock-in”, but the ones that succeed and gain momentum will set the country up for the next era of health care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-is-poised-for-deep-structural-health-reforms/story-Jxr42qwyp0jftEFHB4E8TK.html
21-04-2020||News||The US presidential election match-up is welcome news for India||Earlier this month, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden’s opponent to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States (US), announced that he was suspending his campaign. This means that Biden will be the Democratic candidate for President. Biden has since got support from former president Barack Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself a former presidential candidate. All this is good news for Biden. This is also good news for India. That is the case because if Biden was to win the presidency, the future for India-US relations would be on solid ground. If Sanders had stayed in the race, managed to win the nomination, and gone on to win the presidency, those relations would have been on shaky ground. Sanders does not have a strong history of support for India or substantial foreign policy experience as a senator. More important, during his campaigning, he was critical of some key policy measures of the Narendra Modi administration. By contrast, former vice-president (V-P) Biden is a long-time friend of India with a stellar track record in the foreign policy arena. And, to date, he has not made any major negative public pronouncements about India’s government. Biden is best known for the manner in which he served for eight years as the “aide-de-camp” for President Barack Obama, acting as his lead person and a key consultant on numerous issues, both domestic and foreign. He distinguished himself as someone who could facilitate communications, construct compromises, and build consensus among those with varying interests.As part of his portfolio, Biden worked diligently to promote and advance Obama’s vision of a “defining partnership” between India and the US. He and his wife Jill visited India in 2013 when the V-P, according to the White House, “…set out an ambitious vision for the US-India relationship, looking not just at the months ahead or the years, but the decades ahead”. Biden had India on his radar screen and best interests in mind before joining Barack Obama in 2009. When he was a senator and chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden was an advocate for the successful passage of the Indo-US civil nuclear deal.Sanders voted against that bill in 2008. More recently, in 2020, Sanders has spoken out against India’s Kashmir policy, its enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the country’s treatment of its Muslim minority. Congressman Ro Khanna, an Indian-American, was co-chair of Sanders’ presidential campaign. He has also been critical of India’s human rights policies and has joined the Congressional Pakistan Caucus. This is more evidence that Sanders in the White House would have been problematic for India’s relations with the US.This brings the presidential match-up for the election to be held on November 3 between Biden and Donald Trump — who is running for re-election basically unopposed in the Republican Party. That match-up is welcome news for India. In Biden and Trump, whoever occupies the Oval Office on January 20, 2021, India will be dealing with two known leaders. Trump, even with his mercurial and unpredictable behaviour, currently appears to be the preferred candidate of New Delhi, symbolised by the “Howdy Modi” spectacle in Houston in September and “Namaste Trump” show in Ahmedabad in February.But there should be caution regarding the future of bilateral relations with the US with Trump as president going forward. While Trump can be counted on to stand silent on “internal matters” in India such as Kashmir, he cannot be relied upon to speak authentically or to keep his word on important issues such as getting a trade deal done. Biden, on the other hand, might say things about India’s handling of issues central to a vital and vibrant democracy such as immigration, equal opportunity, pluralism, and the free press, but he will do so in a diplomatic manner. One variable that will come into play for India will be the status of the coronavirus pandemic when the election is held. It is far too early to speculate on the nature of that condition now. What can be said at this point in time is that Trump has minimised the role of the federal government in confronting the pandemic in the US, stating that it is up to the state and local governments to take the lead. Biden as president would put much greater emphasis on the federal leadership.Another difference that will impact India is that the Trump administration’s approach to managing the pandemic is and will be isolationist, as evidenced by the closing down of America’s borders to other countries early on and not taking outside assistance in areas such as testing when the pandemic first struck the US. Biden, as president, will be an internationalist looking to bring countries together to confront the consequences of the coronavirus and to leverage resources to benefit all nations.Indians will not get to vote for the next president of the US. But Indian-Americans will. They should keep those distinct differences in style and behaviour in mind when they cast their ballots. I know that I will and that is why I am glad that Biden will be the Democratic candidate for president. That is good for both my motherland, India and my homeland, the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-us-presidential-election-match-up-is-welcome-news-for-india/story-5j2N7T0FsUiYwZhMvsCYfI.html
21-04-2020||News||Understanding the oil price churn||The front-month May West Texas Intermediate (WTI) — the United States (US) oil price benchmark — futures contract crashed into negative territory for the first time on April 20. Though this was a temporary phenomenon, and one that is specific to the way WTI contracts work in the context of the US oil industry, it is a clear indication that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced demand rout has triggered a glut with consequences that are ricocheting across oil markets, including affecting Brent — the leading international standard for crude prices. This is despite US President Donald Trump’s mediating efforts to stabilise the global oil industry through an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)++ pact — even though he is a self-confessed Opec “hater”. On April 12, the Opec+ cartel — a group of 23 oil-producing nations — after much dramatic posturing cobbled together a historic agreement to slash oil production by 9.7 million barrels per day (mb/d) through May and June, after which the cuts taper off till 2022. Notwithstanding its enviable credentials, the agreement will fall short of propping up prices enough to ward off shut-ins. It will only function to arrest Brent touching single digits and provide some relief before the storage tanks spillover.This becomes evident on unpacking the numbers. The 10 members of the Opec and another 10 of the extended Opec+ group will reduce oil production by 6.085 mb/d and 3.615 mb/d respectively to balance supply against plunging demand. US-sanctioned Iran and Venezuela and war-torn Libya are exempt from the cuts. Saudi Arabia and Russia, the second- and third-largest oil producers globally, have agreed to each cut 2.5 mb/d of their production from a baseline of 11 mb/d. Meanwhile, some other numbers are being thrown around. Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said that the Opec++ (Opec+ and other oil producers) group will take 19.5 mb/d supply off the pipelines, voluntarily or otherwise, from May. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak pegs the effective cuts at 15-20 mb/d while Trump, through his diplomatic tool of choice, Twitter, has written that cuts will total 20mb/d. This, ostensibly, is by factoring in “expected” curtailed production of 3.7 mb/d of G20 countries, such as the US, Brazil and Canada; supply cuts through national purchases for strategic petroleum reserves; and possible cuts by Norway.There are many moving parts here. It is difficult to predict how much American production will fall given the divergence within the industry to accept quota cuts. The Railroad Commission of Texas — the Texas regulatory agency — had the last statewide cut in 1973. Although, Mexico has agreed to a 100,000 barrel cut, the US has said it will help Mexico by picking up “some of the slack” — the specifics of this are still unclear. Irrespective, even if one considers the 20 mb/d supply-reduction scenario as realistic, the demand destruction is staggering enough to overwhelm the proposed cuts. According to the International Energy Agency, the fall in global demand for crude will be 29 mb/d for April and 26 mb/d for May. Some other oil traders are estimating it to be 35mb/d. A 3% decline in growth in 2020, as predicted by the International Monetary Fund, erases almost a year of oil demand growth. Assuming there is compliance by the members, the Opec++ reductions, therefore, will only partially offset supply overhang till the next quarter. But compliance to quota cuts for Opec+ members has been faulty on prior occasions--some, such as Saudi Arabia, make deeper cuts while others cheat on their pledges. The question remains: Who will monitor compliance? The G20 energy ministers’ meet on April 10 signed an agreement to set up a voluntary focus group which will monitor oil markets. But the locus standi of a G20 platform to monitor an Opec country is questionable. The only real physical barrier to shutting the oil spigots is when storage spaces run out. Moreover, a deal does not signal that Riyadh and Moscow have buried the hatchet after their recent market-share scuffle. The kingdom has slashed its official selling price, ostensibly eyeing the Mediterranean and Asian markets, and swelling global crude inventories till the new deal kicks in. Reportedly, it is also selling about 600,000 barrels of crude per day to the US this month — the highest volume in a year. Moscow and others will react to push their own volumes. Meanwhile, Washington has not yet dismissed the possibility of oil import tariffs to protect its domestic oil industry. The dynamics between the three “alpha males” of the oil industry — the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia — played out in this vulnerable landscape will further determine how low Brent settles. The markets have figured this out, notwithstanding the padded reduction figures. Predictably, Brent whimpered up a few dollars after the Opec+ pact before falling below $30 again. Market reports suggest that Brent needs to skip over $40 and remain pinned there to prevent oil producers’ revenues from shrinking further. With pipelines and storages clogging up and the virus continuing to gobble oil demand at unprecedented levels, pressure is building on de facto leaders of the Opec+ group, Saudi Arabia and Russia, to seam a broader alliance or deepen cuts. However, countering the impacts of this pandemic on oil markets will be a daunting task for a wobbly cartel of oil producers with divergent interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/understanding-the-oil-price-churn/story-EnxXxSDUNS5EUk1p5KzySK.html
21-04-2020||Gurugram||18 people placed under quarantine in Bhondsi jail after head warder tests positive for Covid-19||Eighteen samples of Bhondsi jail staff members were sent to the Civil Hospital on Sunday for Covid-19 testing, after a jail warder tested positive for the disease. The samples came out negative, said jail officials on Tuesday.The 40-year-old head warder of Bhondsi jail had tested positive on Saturday. Jai Kishan Chillar, superintendent of Bhondsi jail, said the warder was on leave for six days and had resumed his duties on April 16. “His sample was sent for tests as he had travelled to Bhiwani to meet his ailing wife. We followed the Covid-19 protocol, which states that anyone who goes out of the jail premises has to get tested for the virus before resuming work. Although he had no visible symptoms, we still took all the precautionary measures. He was put under quarantine after giving his samples for testing,” he said.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer(CMO), Gurugram, said, “All the 18 samples tested were found to be negative. Even the patient, who was found to be positive, tested negative in the second test on Tuesday,” he said.The 18 people from whom the samples were taken were those whom the warder had met after returning from home. This group included his colleague, who drove him on a motorcycle to the Civil Hospital for getting tested. All the people are still placed under quarantine.To prevent contamination, the jail premises and all the barracks are regularly being sanitised by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram ( MCG) and the medical teams, said jail officials.Chillar said they are not allowing any outsider to cross the boundary of jail premises and even the staff members are not being allowed to step outside unless there is any medical emergency. “We are taking all precautionary measures and ensuring all the staff members and inmates are using sanitisers and wearing masks. Also, social distancing of at least two metres is being observed,” he said.Jail authorities have converted a barrack into a quarantine ward for the inmates and in a portion of the staff quarters for the staff and their family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/18-people-placed-under-quarantine-in-bhondsi-jail-after-head-warder-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-0HNJSZ7DNPpQsYcCxivqYI.html
21-04-2020||City||25 industries to resume operations this week||Gurugram: At least 25 industrial units and companies in the district can resume operations this week as they are likely to get approval by Wednesday morning, officials privy to the matter said on Tuesday. The development comes two days after the Haryana government released a standard operating procedure (SOP) for reopening industrial units amid the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.VS Kundu, who is the monitoring official for Covid-19 preparations in Gurugram, said that auto major “Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) would be able to commence production” at its Manesar plant from this week. Kundu is also the CEO of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority. On Sunday, officials had said that industries would have to apply through the Saral portal for approval. On Monday, the state portal was opened for accepting online applications from the industries and companies.According to officials, within 24 hours from Monday afternoon till Tuesday afternoon, the portal received more than 500 applications from industrial units in the district, excluding units already in operations supplying essential goods. “We have received about 500 applications, of which 25 to 30 will be granted permission as their scrutiny is underway. Hopefully, by Wednesday morning they will receive permissions to resume operations of factories with strict guidelines of Covid-19 lockdown. The industries have been informed of the guidelines through media and by all other relevant sources,” Kundu said.The Gurugram labour department, too, confirmed that by Wednesday morning it will hand out permission to 25 to 30 firms for resuming operations. The companies, which are likely to be granted permission, range from a Korean firm requiring a single pass to auto major Maruti Suzuki, said labour department officials.Maruti Suzuki has applied for both of its plants at Gurugram and Manesar, but till now there is no communication from the government regarding approval, said a spokesperson for MSIL.The labour department, which is playing a key role in resumption of industrial activities, said that permissions are being given on ‘first come first serve’ basis, and units will be allowed to open in a gradual manner. “The process of approvals is dynamic and those companies which have already done the groundwork for social distancing will get preference. If permission is given for 100 passes, all of these should not be utilized in one go and employees should be called in a phased manner,” said Munish Sharma, additional labour commissioner, Gurugram.Sharma also said that initially passes are being given so that firms can mark spots for social distancing at entrance, mark six feet distance at shop floor, ensure lifts are not used and if used they should be divided into squares so that only three to four people are inside. “In rural areas such as Manesar, some industries at IMT Manesar are being given permission as we have limited number of passes. Construction projects inside the municipal limits will only be given permission if the labour force is staying at project sites,” the additional labour commissioner said.Meanwhile, industry owners expressed unhappiness over the delay in granting permissions as they have to pay salaries to employees for April. Representatives of various industry associations on Tuesday met deputy commissioner (DC) Amit Khatri in this regard.Pawan Yadav, president of IMT Manesar Industrial Association, said, “We are not in good financial condition to pay salaries to our employees this month and we have sought help from the DC. We hope the government will consider our appeal.”The industrialists stated that during March and April, a large number of labourers usually migrate to their villages for working in their farms, but due to lockdown this did not happen. They said that the small industries, which are not in good financial condition, will face a lot of problems if they are not able to pay salaries for April. “Despite giving passes, a number of workers are not coming citing transport and security issues,” said an industrialist, who preferred anonymity.When asked, Khatri said, “The industrial representatives met me and submitted their requests. I will do the needful.”In Gurugram, there are 11 lakh employees engaged in over 7,000 industries which are observing closure for the past four weeks.The labour department said that those BPOs, which are providing service to government, will be allowed to operate. IT and IT-enabled services companies will be allowed to operate at half the strength while they will also be allowed to shift their employees from Delhi or Faridabad for one time only, the officials said. Besides, only those employees would be allowed to work who either have a medical insurance or health insurance. The employees must also download the Arogya Setu mobile application, and strictly follow social distancing norms, the officials said.Kundu said that primary objective of government is to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. “All safeguards and measures will have to be followed by the firms to ensure there is no spread of the disease,” he said.In neighbouring Faridabad, officials said that resumption of industries would be done in phases and only units located in industrial estates would be allowed operations. “We have received applications from around 150 units and they are being scrutinized,” said Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad.On Monday night, the Haryana government withdrew its decision to allow the opening of book shops and showrooms selling air-conditioners and coolers.“In larger public interest, this order has been withdrawn,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-industries-to-resume-operations-this-week/story-I3UtZW8KIXKFJzemJbOUcN.html
21-04-2020||Gurugram||61 people, including 30 journalists, test negative for Covid-19 on day 2||At least 61 people, including 30 journalists, were tested for Covid-19 using rapid testing kits (RTKs) in the district on Tuesday. All were tested negative, according to district health officials. Earlier, Gurugram rolled out antibody testing for Covid-19 in the Sohna containment zone on Monday. It was two days after the district health department received 750 RTKs, which can provide results within 30 minutes.The health department took the decision to test city-based journalists after 53 TV reporters and camerapersons in Mumbai were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus on Monday.Journalists from local electronic and print media visited the old Civil Hospital to give their blood samples. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, Gurugram’s chief medical officer(CMO) said that the antibody test for journalists will be done on Wednesday too. “Thirty journalists gave their blood samples and all of them were found to be negative. On Monday night, the district administration decided to test reporters and camerapersons after the reports of Mumbai-based journalists contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged. A lot of journalists in the city are visiting hospitals and slums and meeting people. Therefore it is important that we test them,” said Punia.Sudhir Singla, MLA Gurugram, who wrote to deputy commissioner Amit Khatri on this issue on Monday, said, “The plan was to test electronic media journalists and camerapersons on Tuesday and print media journalists on Wednesday. However, we saw a mixed group on Tuesday. More tests are likely to be conducted on Wednesday.”TESTING IN SOHNA CONTAINMENT ZONEThe health department team, on the other hand, comprising accredited social health activists (ASHAs), auxiliary nurses and midwives (ANMs) and medical officers, conducted a survey of more than 260 houses in the Sohna containment zone. At least 31 people were tested and all were found to be negative for Covid-19. Punia said that as a part of survey, they enquire about the health conditions especially flu-like symptoms, such as fever and cough in the last five to six days. “The suspected cases were taken to the Sohna sub-divisional hospital where their samples were taken. Their test results were shared by sending messages on their mobile numbers,” said Punia.The state health department has clarified that government will use the kits in hotspot districts, such as Gurugram, Nuh and Hathin in Palwal. In Gurugram, there are six containment zones, namely Devi Lal Colony, Sun City Sector 54, Sector 39, Fazilpur village in Jharsa, Village Raipur in Sohna and Ward no. 11, Pataudi.The district health department launched the antibody tests in the containment zone in Sohna after it reported 14 cases. On Monday, five antibody tests were conducted in Sohna, which were found to negative. Punia said that the test will also start in Pataudi, where six Covid-19 cases have been reported. Till now, 37 cases have been reported in the city, of which 26 have recovered and 11 are undergoing treatment. Antibody test helps in finding out whether a person has developed antibodies against Covid-19. A negative test does not prove that the person is free of disease. Health officials say it is likely that antibodies for coronavirus are not present in a patient’s blood in the initial stages of the infection.As per the state guideline prepared by PGIMS Rohtak, even if a suspected case with flu-like symptom tests negative for antibody, his/her swabs will be taken for RT-PCR test and the person have to be isolated or quarantined for 10 days. Antibody tests will not be done on those having signs of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and on high-risk cases. Their samples will be directly collected for RT-PCR.On Monday, Haryana also received its first shipment of 25,000 RTKs from SD Bio Sensor, a Korean company based in IMT Manesar. State health department said that additional kits would help in speeding up testing in containment zones, hot spots and asymptomatic cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/61-people-including-30-journalists-test-negative-for-covid-19-on-day-2/story-YH2UJAwDrCOxFp5vstX38O.html

The tasks were distributed so that critical technical operations don’t get impacted. Amid all these, we are making sure that workers are taken care of,” said Raman Chawla, president, resident’s welfare association.“Around 170 people are working within the complex, most of them in the day shift. Out of these, around 50 people were staying in the EWS flats. The remaining workers come from villages in the neighbourhood and their health condition is monitored daily. We have told all everyone that they can take leave if required, and there will be no deductions. They are being provided cooked meals three times a day. We wanted to make sure they are comfortable while they continue to deliver the essential services,” said Chawla.Residents have also been helping staff members staying in the complex. “Residents provide tea, coffee, and other refreshments for workers. Everyone plays a part in ensuring that they are well taken care of,” said Dipen Sanghvi, general secretary, RWA.The condominium also carried out a drive to provide ration to part-time workers like drivers, domestic helps and others. “We decided to help our part-time workers, around 500 of them, with ration kits comprising five kilos of flour, two kilos of pulses, cooking oil and biscuits. The kits were distributed, while adhering to the physical distancing protocols,” said Chawla. The RWA also appealed to residents to pay domestic helps and other workers full salaries.Chawla said that the condominium is tiding over the lockdown with the cooperation of residents and support staff. Early on, the condominium formed a Covid-19 task force comprising healthcare professionals, RWA board members, and two resident volunteers to take measures to contain spread on the premises. This was followed by the creation of a volunteer network for catering to the needs of the residents. The condominium has around 10 towers and a volunteer has been appointed as the point of contact for each tower.“The tower volunteers serve as the first line of contact. We have convinced senior citizens to take help from tower volunteers for any assistance. Volunteers are helping them in ordering necessities and technical assistance or any concern that may arise,” said Sanghvi.Of the three entry points, the condominium, with 756 flats, is using only one entry to surveil movement in and out. The society has barred the entry of part-time domestic helps, cooks, drivers and car cleaners. Walking of pets has also been banned, while deliveries are to be dropped off at the main entrance.Delivery persons are asked to deposit the packages in spaces reserved to each tower, following which there is a delivery distribution every few hours. “We carry out the distribution of delivery every two to three hours. There is a vehicle that goes around every tower, depositing the deliveries and the tower guard ensures that it reaches all floors. The residents don’t step out and the commodity is delivered in a contactless manner,” said Sanghvi.All persons entering the building are thermal scanned and mandatorily required to use sanitisers. A washing area has been provided at the entrance where visitors are required to wash their hands with soap. Further, anyone entering the condominium is required to have a mask in place. Inside, toothpicks and sponges have been placed within the lifts to avoid direct contact.“In our condominium, toothpicks have been kept inside the lifts and the lifts are sanitised five times in a day. A chart has been created and with each subsequent sanitisation of the lifts and other common areas, a note is made, and the progress shared with all the residents,” said Samiksha Ojha, a resident.She said that after the initial hiccups, most residents are adjusting to the restrictions in place and complying with directions to contain the spread of the pandemic.The condominium has a shopping area within the complex, which has shops catering to the daily needs of residents. Social distancing markers have been created to ensure that residents maintain a gap from one another and only two people are allowed in at one time. Besides, guards on duty ensure that residents adhere to physical distancing protocols and stand at a distance from each other.“Two of the shops are open and well-stocked. If residents feel the need to get anything extra, they can step out and get it from other retail chains in the vicinity,” said Sanghvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/reduced-staff-strength-regular-sanitisation-and-drives-to-help-workers-mark-lockdown-in-grand-arch-society/story-UZS1VuJBvWQaBeee0BnJVM.html

On the other hand, committed expenditure such as debt servicing, pensions, salaries and relief measures for Covid-19 is budgeted at ₹7,301 crore for the month of April,” he said, resulting in the huge resource gap.(BOX)ASKS CENTRE TO ALLOW SALE OF LIQUORAmarinder, in his letter to Amit Shah, also sought the Centre’s permission to allow sale of liquor, in a phased manner, to mop up value-added tax (VAT) and excise revenue. “The home ministry should allow the state to take a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent Covid-19,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-seeks-3-000-cr-compensation-from-centre-for-april/story-icwOzwWFYCQgn0Y6IyYe1H.html
21-04-2020||Noida||Neuter amid lockdown, best time to control stray dog population: Experts||With the dog breeding season around the corner, animal activists have called for neutering as many street dogs as possible to control their population, stating that the lockdown was a favourable time to do so.Veterinarians and experts said the suggestion “may sound cruel” but it would ensure dogs are treated better. They said increased neutering activity was needed in the city which sees its fair share of complaints about dog bites and resulting cruelty towards the animal. Neutering, a surgical procedure for removal of the reproductive organ of the animals, is a healthier and more humane way of animal birth control.They added that if not neutered, the upcoming breeding season would leave streets with more animals to be fed with lesser food sources; this would lead to more territory fights and man-dog conflicts as well. While most of the neutering or sterilisation units are shut due to the lockdown, a few such as People For Animals (PFA) had managed to neuter 20 dogs.“Neutering is an ongoing process, but it has stopped at most places due to the lockdown. However, we have managed to somehow continue this work. This is the best time to do so because there are fewer people feeding them; on normal days it’s difficult to catch the dogs. They come to us more easily and it’s easier to catch them gently and sterilize or neuter them,” said Kaveri Rana, president of PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar.She added that while dogs breed around the year, there are two major seasons depending on the age of the female—winters (December-January) and summers (June through August).“Of the 20 dogs we neutered 17 were females and 3 were males. Nineteen were rescued after they were injured, while one was lost. Each one of them was capable of producing a litter of at least six pups, which means in next few months there could have been over 100 additional dogs on the streets if we had not sterilised them,” she said, adding that population control amid animals is also important to reduce dog bites as neutering reduces aggression.Dr Krishna Yadav, a Noida based veterinarian whose clinic in Sector 122 is being approached by NGOs and activists for neutering rescued dogs, said, “It’s important to understand that we have to step up animal birth control especially now because breeding season is almost here and once the lockdown is over there will be issues like large number of road accidents, aggression and unhealthy dogs etc. and rising cases of man-dog conflicts. We have performed around 35 neutering surgeries since lockdown stated. A number of NGOs and animal activists bring rescued or abandoned dogs.”Pointing out that both the Supreme Court and Wold Health Organisation (WHO) recommend neutering, experts said neutering stray dogs was as important as feeding them.“The dog population rises exponentially, so say there are 6,000 dogs on street today; by the year end there would be over 8,000 even if we consider the highest mortality rates in the offspring. Neutering is an important task for better public health and animal welfare,” Dr Abhishek Dabar, official veterinarian at Noida authority’s animal shelter at Sector 94 which houses over 900 dogs, said, adding that though they have stopped neutering these days because of the lockdown, the process will be resumed after the lockdown.But Sanjay Kumar Mahapatra, head of Noida-based NGO House of Stray Animals (HSA), said the activity must be resumed as soon as possible. “Due to the lockdown, we have to cover as much area as possible to feed the dogs and we see a number of lactating females with as many as eight pups. Upcoming breeding season, they would breed again with a direct impact on their health and their offspring. Also, sustenance would be challenge; it happens all the time, and thus neutering is very much called for,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/neuter-amid-lockdown-best-time-to-control-stray-dog-population-experts/story-mYT62GKzL4THon5Cz21W4M.html
21-04-2020||Noida||Two more COVID-19 cases, total reach 102||Two more cases of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were identified in Gautam Budh Nagar on Tuesday taking the total number of cases in the district to 102. The new cases include a 23-year-old man from Sector 8 slums, where the total number of Covid-19 patients is now 11, and a woman in her 50s from C Block of Sector 19. Both the patients have been admitted at the Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida.According to the officials, the woman had gone for dialysis at a private hospital in Ghaziabad. She was tested at the same hospital for Covid-19 and her result showed she had contracted the infection. The Sector 8 patient was found negative in his first test but his second test showed he had been infected, officials said. Since April 8, officials have shifted hundreds of people from the slums in Sector 8 and 5 to government quarantine centres as a precautionary measure. The step was taken after four persons, with one linked to Ceasefire, tested positive for Covid-19 in the Sector 5 JJ Colony.Officials fear community spread in areas where there are no resident’s welfare associations and social distancing was not possible because of higher population density, such as the slums. The exact or direct source of infection is not known in both the cases, officials said, adding that they suspect the 23-year-old Sector 8 resident may have contracted infection from the other patients of the area. Officials are awaiting reports of more people from Sector 8. “We are in the process of identifying the exact source of infection for the two patients. We suspect the woman may have got infected during her hospital visit. We have taken multiple samples from Sector 8 and 5 to ensure there is no community spread. Most people who were found positive were already under quarantine at the government centers which reduced the chances of virus’ spread,” said a senior health official.Meanwhile, the district administration and local police are trying to intensify the lockdown in containment zones. According to officials, 70% of the total population of the district is in containment zones (32) as on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the police department registered seven FIRs and arrested 20 persons for violating Section 144 of the CrPC, which is in place in the district. Around 795 vehicles were checked and 323 fines were issued. Officials have also barricaded 200 check points in the district.The health department had notified 1,967 travellers, officials had collected 2,362 samples for testing by Tuesday night. A total of 102 cases have come out positive while 43 have been discharged. Currently, there are 59 active Covid-19 cases in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-more-covid-19-cases-total-reach-102/story-o1lWRriylAVOQMblA099wM.html

The victim, Sachin Kumar, is a volunteer for community kitchen being run to feed needy people in Greater Noida, the police said, adding that the incident took place on Monday evening when he was returning home.Sachin is a resident of Sakipur village. His father Yashpal Singh filed a complaint at Surajpur police station on Tuesday. Singh said that Sachin was returning home after attending a community kitchen in the neighbourhood in Sector Zeta 1. “A group of eight persons were playing cards in the neighbourhood and they were violating lockdown guidelines. My son advised them that they should maintain social distancing and stay indoor,” he said.Singh said that this led to a heated argument with his son and the suspects. “They verbally abused my son, who returned home. However, soon the suspects reached our home and thrashed my son with sticks and rods,” he alleged. Sachin received injuries to his head, hands and legs, and was admitted to a private hospital, the police said. His father said that the group has been playing cards regularly. “Four days ago, a police team had reached the spot and dispersed the crowd. We have no personal enmity with the suspects. But they believe we had shared the information with the police,” Singh said. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that a case has been registered against the suspects under sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 452 (house trespass), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 504 (intentional insult), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), and 148 (rioting) of the Indian Penal Code. “A police team is conducting search to arrest the suspects who are at large,” Chander said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/volunteer-beaten-up-for-objecting-to-8-men-playing-cards-amid-lockdown/story-gxrFLnBXtipimjSfUfY61O.html
21-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus outbreak: Don’t post derogatory remarks against state government on social media, IMA Maharashtra tells doctors||The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra, has issued a letter to its members, asking them to use “non-offending language” while posting their comments on WhatsApp groups against the state government. Doctors in the state have criticised the move. According to IMA, government agencies have informed the association that some doctors are posting comments against the government and the decisions taken with regards to the Covid-19 outbreak. The letter, released by IMA on Monday, reads, “We received intimation from one of the officers at Maharashtra Cyber cell that spoke of the WhatsApp groups of doctors posting comments against the Maharashtra government and its officers.”The letter further stated that social media groups should be used to send messages and discuss news, and not for “derogatory comments on the government’s decisions”. “We may post our reactions to certain decisions but in non-offending languages,” it reads.The development comes at a time when 250 medical staffers have contracted the infection through cross-transmission in Mumbai’s hospitals. Many doctors have interpreted IMA’s diktat as a violation of freedom of speech. “Doctors on Covid duty are being attacked all across the state, but there is no law or proper security measures to protect them. Hundreds of doctors are contracting the virus on duty owing to lack of safety kits. We are the front-line staff but we don’t have rights to criticise the government,” said a senior pulmonologist from a south Mumbai hospital.However, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, IMA president, Maharashtra, has clarified that doctors are only being asked to refrain from offensive comments. He said, “We are not asking the doctors not to give their opinions. We are requesting them not to use any foul or abusive languages.”After the IMA released its letter, another letter with photo-shopped images was circulated in social media sites, which claimed that IMA is an agency of the state government and is trying to suppress the opinion of the doctors. Dr Bhondwe has decided to file a complaint with the cyber cell of the police against the fake letter. ‘White Alert’ on WednesdayIMA has asked its members to observe a ‘White Alert’ on Wednesday 9pm at their respective hospitals and light candles wearing their white coats to protest against an incident in Chennai in which a mob did not permit the burial of the body of a doctor who died of coronavirus.The association has also warned that if the central government doesn’t enact a law on violence against doctors and hospitals, IMA will observe a ‘Black Day’ on Thursday, during which all the doctors will wear a black badge while working.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coronavirus-outbreak-don-t-post-derogatory-remarks-against-state-government-on-social-media-ima-maharashtra-tells-doctors/story-GATTdb9Wtauycori76vq6M.html

21-04-2020||City||5 patients tested Covid-19 positive in March yet to recover||Ghaizabad: Five out of eight patients who were found positive for Covid-19 in late March are yet be discharged from various hospitals in the district. Health officials have raised concerns over this and said they are conducting regular tests of these patients to get two consecutive negative reports needed to declare them negative for Sars-Cov-2.According to the officials, the five patients include a 30-year-old man from Vaishali who has a travel history to Dubai and tested positive on March 26. The other is a 32-year-old employee of Noida-based company -- Ceasefire – who tested positive on March 26. Another case is of a couple from Savior Park high-rise at Mohan Nagar who were found Covid-19 positive on March 28. The fifth case is of a 34-year-old man from Duhai who was tested positive on March 31 after he came in contact with a positive patient.“This effect could be a result of high viral load. We possibly picked up the five persons when the infection was not at its peak. It takes about seven to eight days when the infection reaches its peak and takes another 10-12 days to decline. However, we are yet to get two consecutive negative reports of these five patients. In between, some test reports also got delayed and we are following up regularly,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.Gupta said that two doctors from Max Hospital, Vaishali, who tested positive for coronavirus on April 14 and April 17, were found negative and discharged on April 20.“The two resident doctors of Max Hospital were discharged within couple of days. This may seem early, but the two could be cases where the infection was on decline and their two consecutive reports turned negative. They were sent home on Monday evening. One of the doctors who resides in Vaishali had to face resistance from locals. So, we had to take help from the police and administration and the patient was moved to his house,” the CMO said.A Max Hospital spokesperson termed the incident with one of its doctors as unfortunate, and said that the community was allegedly stigmatising health care workers instead of extending support.“After a week of their quarantining at the facility, two consecutive samples, collected from both doctors within 24 hours, tested negative. Hence, they have been discharged and asked to home quarantine for 14 days. Both the junior doctors were stable throughout their course of stay at the Covid-19 facility,” the spokesperson said.Till Tuesday evening, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad district stood at 46 and 13 of them were discharged from different hospitals. Gupta said that there was no new addition to the tally on Tuesday and the district at present has 33 active cases.Overall in the state, the total number of positive cases shot up to 1,294 and 140 persons discharged from different hospitals.“We now have a total of 1,134 active cases in UP. We will be introducing pool testing in different districts where the positive cases are less or in buffer zones outside the containment areas. We have also observed that maximum cases are coming from persons who are already in quarantine with us. So, we have been able to contain the outspread,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).The UP government on Tuesday also issued an order in which district magistrates have been directed to ensure that schools should not force students to deposit three months’ fees in advance, or debar students from online studies. Besides,the schools cannot take any steps to strike off the names of students, the order said.The communication by principal secretary Ardhana Shukla also stated that some schools were demanding the transport fees even though the schools are closed during the lockdown period. In her communication, she has directed that no transport fees should be charged by schools during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/5-patients-tested-covid-19-positive-in-march-yet-to-recover/story-sZuqf4SWGtlMzfz8DE4c0I.html

21-04-2020||City||Chaos at Delhi-Ghaziabad border after sealing over six Covid-19 cases||Ghaziabad: Hundreds of people, including those involved in essential services, were stuck on the border with Delhi on Tuesday after the Ghaziabad district magistrate issued an order to seal all borders, to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The escalating situation forced the DM, Ajay Shankar Pandey, to the border on Tuesday afternoon, accompanied by police officers.Pandey had issued the closure direction late on Monday, under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, prohibiting any travel between Ghaziabad and the national capital.The order came after at least six people in Ghaziabad, who health and district officials said had travelled to Delhi, tested positive for Covid-19.However, as a result of the directions on Monday night, hundreds of commuters were left stranded at the borders for hours on Tuesday.Doctors, transport workers and bankers were among those stuck on either sides of the border after the police refused to allow their entry or exit.“I was headed home to Raj Nagar Extension [in Ghaziabad] after night duty from my hospital. I was stuck up at UP Gate border as the police did not allow entries. From 8.30am to 11am, I was stuck, like hundreds of other people in their vehicles,” a doctor from a Delhi government hospital designated as Covid-19 facility, said.“The police did not allow me to enter, despite my producing my duty pass and ID card,” the doctor added.“I had to call up my contacts, who contacted the Ghaziabad police, after which I was allowed to leave. But all this took me about three hours to enter into Ghaziabad. The police even told me that I should stay in Delhi. I have more duties lined up on Wednesday and don’t know whether I will be able to attend to these or not,” the doctor said.Bishambhar Dayal, an employee of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) from Sanjay Nagar in Ghaziabad, had to report for duty at 12.30pm on Tuesday and was headed to a depot at Sukhdev Vihar.“I came to the Kaushambi border, but the police did not allow me to go to Delhi. I showed them my ID card and my duty pass, but they still refused,” Dayal said.“I moved to UP Gate but the cops there too denied me passage to Delhi. So, I have informed my officers and went back home,” Dayal said.A number of ambulances carrying patients also got delayed at the border.Pradeep Jain, a senior officer with a central public sector enterprise and resident of Ramprastha Greens in Ghaziabad’s Vaishali, said he would prefer to work from home rather than attending office in Delhi’s Vasant Vihar.“I had to wait for two hours and many vehicles carrying essential items were stuck at UP Gate border. Tuesday was the second day when a few employees were directed to attend office. With these conditions prevailing, however, I would prefer to work from home,” he added.A woman banker, who had to go to her office in Karol Bagh, said the police did not allow her entry into Delhi and she had to call up her colleague who took bank keys in order to open the branch.This happened despite the order stating that “people involved in essential supplies or valid pass holders will be allowed to move.”Senior government officials of the national capital told HT that the UP government did not communicate the decision to the Delhi government on time. Later in the day, to resolve the gridlock, the Delhi government sent a team of officers — led by east Delhi district magistrate Arun Kumar Mishra, to meet his Ghaziabad counterpart.The Delhi Police also apprised Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief secretary Vijay Dev about the condition at the border. Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar on Tuesday said the “sudden” restriction by the Ghaziabad administration had led to the severe snarls at the borders.“Senior police officers from both Ghaziabad and Delhi came to the border. We are also in touch with the Uttar Pradesh administration to ease the situation as soon as possible,” Kumar said.A Delhi Police officer deployed at the border said they deployed eight companies (around 70 personnel) at the border.The Ghaziabad police, however, claimed no one working or involved in providing essential services was stopped.“People who are not attached to any essential services are not allowed to travel to Delhi. However, while there may have been some hiccups, those attached to essential services are not being stopped,” Anshu Jain, circle officer, Indirapuram, said.“We have also deployed the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), apart from civil police to maintain strict checks,” Jain said.Hundreds of commuters travel between Delhi and Ghaziabad from the UP Gate, Anand Vihar and Kaushambi and Loni border areas on a daily basis.Later in the day, Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home) said Ghaziabad and Noida officials have been asked to ensure the lockdown guidelines were followed to the hilt.“The Ghaziabad and Noida administrations have decided that only vehicles ferrying those involved in essential services will be allowed to enter and exit,” he added.(With inputs from Sweta Goswami and Anvit Srivastava)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chaos-at-delhi-ghaziabad-border-after-sealing-over-six-covid-19-cases/story-2CkCOGLgw0hDCdx5KCTA5O.html
21-04-2020||Noida||Noida entrepreneurs demand interest-free loans to cope with Covid impact||Entrepreneurs and factory owners have demanded interest-free loans and other benefits for a year to cope with the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They said that in the current circumstance, they will not be able to continue paying salary to staff as businesses are at a standstill.The state government has directed factory owners, entrepreneurs and other employers to continue paying salaries to their respective staff during the lockdown.Members of the Noida entrepreneurs’ association (NEA), an apex body representing at least 12,000 industrial units including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), said that the government should declare “zero period” until industries remain affected due to the pandemic.They estimate a loss of around ₹40,000 crore due to the shutdown in Noida. “Zero period means the government should completely waive off all taxes and charges, including lease rent, electricity charges and water charges. Salaries of the staff should be arranged under the Employees State Insurance Act. Importantly, they should provide us interest-free loans for a year to revive the industry after the lockdown. Without this, the industry will die and fail to continue operations because shutting down business has destroyed fund liquidity,” said Vipin Malhan, the president of NEA.The government, at present, has postponed payment of water, lease rent and electricity, including a moratorium for business loans. “Postponement will not help because the government is imposing interest on the postponement of instalments for all loans. The government must come up with a workable solution,” said Sudhir Shrivastava, spokesperson for NEA.He said that these 12,000 industrial units under them collectively employ at least five lakh workers directly and at least two lakh more, indirectly.The NEA has written to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and top officials of the state industrial department, outlining their demands and concerns.“The NEA has submitted its representation regarding zero period, in view of Covid-19 pandemic, and interest-free loans to revive the industry. We have sent the representation to the UP government for decisions on these issues. The government is taking measures to ensure workers get salaries during the crisis. Micro industry workers are facing problems now. The decisions on demands will be taken by the state government,” said Anil Kumar, deputy commissioner of the District Industries Centre (DIC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-entrepreneurs-demand-interest-free-loans-to-cope-with-covid-impact/story-0pA8ZOMua2bGIeTcDYKyMK.html
21-04-2020||Mumbai||Epidemiological model studying spread of Covid-19 recommends testing and isolation||Rather than a lockdown, extensive testing to identify asymptomatic carriers and quarantining those diagnosed with Covid-19 with continued social distancing would effectively contain the pandemic in India, recommends the first India-specific epidemiological model for Covid-19 spread.Termed INDISCI-SIM, the first, detailed, state-level, epidemiological model for India has been developed by scientists from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science at Bengaluru and Ashoka University.Gautam Menon, professor of biology and physics at Ashoka University, said INDISCI-SIM is the most detailed and versatile among current models for the disease’s trajectory in India. The model involves nine, different, detailed compartments – susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, mild symptomatic, severely symptomatic, hospitalised, recovered, and dead. Each stage is compared with non-pharmaceutical interventions (such as lockdown, quarantining and expanded testing) to draw an inference on propagation of the disease.“In case of the virus and depending on a person, the patient may take one of these nine paths. Our model demonstrates how one phase of a typical population will travel from one compartment to another,” said Bhalchandra Pujari of SPPU. For instance, the window of recovery is highest for tested asymptomatic individuals followed by mildly symptomatic, while it’s the least for severely symptomatic and critical. Pujari further said, “Extension or not of the lockdown after May 3, India must increase testing capacities faster than the propagation of the disease.”“We stress that a comprehensive testing and quarantining regime is the only real long-term solution until a vaccine is found,” said Menon. While emphasising that these simulations do not quantify the economic costs of lockdown, Pujari said, “Opening up transport pan-India is not a good idea as per our model.”Subsequent versions of the model will incorporate district level description, in addition to differing health care capacities across different regions and their implications for disease spread. Menon said the program will be made publicly available soon.On Tuesday, principal scientific advisor to the government of India K VijayRaghavan said on social media that the findings of INDISCI-SIM “are being looked at carefully along with other inputs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/epidemiological-model-studying-spread-of-covid-19-recommends-testing-and-isolation/story-kZAZax8XI3mxR2Z7i35KhO.html
21-04-2020||City||Lockdown restrictions eased: Complying with conditions set by state government tough, say industrial units in rural Maharashtra||Although the state gave nod for industrial operations in rural areas from Monday, not many units have started functioning, as they are finding it difficult to comply with the conditions, which include responsibility of workers’ vulnerability to Covid-19.Maharashtra has 10.26 lakh registered MSMEs and 3,052 mega and large industrial projects registered in the state. All these industrial units (MSMEs and mega-large projects) employ 69.70 lakh workers and employees. On the lines of the Central government’s decision to allow industrial units to function partially, the state too relaxed the curbs, allowing 3,500 units to operate, only after they arrange for the stay, food and transportation for workers.“Industries are not very enthusiastic about beginning operations, as they are not finding it financially feasible to operate while complying with the stringent conditions. Making arrangements for stay, food and transportation is difficult and also costly and time consuming. Even if we begin the operations after compliance, marketing and supply of production will be a major issue amid lockdown restrictions,” said Ram Bhogale, former president, Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture. Bhogale said moreover, technical snags made getting permissions on the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) portal tough. Rahul Desai of Yantrik Engineers, which has two units manufacturing industrial machines in Pune, has got permissions for operations. “Liquidity in the market has dried up and payments against our semi-finished and finished machines are stuck with clients. Banks and financial institutions are not willing to finance us. In such a situation, we can’t shoulder the additional burden of stay, food and health services such as medical cover. It would be difficult to continue operations for long in the given situation,” he said.P Anbalagan, chief executive officer, MIDC, said, “The conditions imposed are as per the central and state government notification that are issued in unusual situation of Covid-19. We have sorted the technical problem on the portal. Of the 3,500 applications, 60% of the industries have committed to make arrangements for accommodation of the employees.” Milind Kamble, president, Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said they are in touch with the state to resolve the issues and get finance from banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-restrictions-eased-complying-with-conditions-set-by-state-government-tough-say-industrial-units-in-rural-maharashtra/story-H8rFOaTvM26z7lFKGSBvcL.html
21-04-2020||Lucknow||Ghaziabad, Noida borders with Delhi sealed to check corona spread||The UP government on Tuesday decided to seal the borders of Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) with Delhi to check the spread of Sars-Cov-2 in both the districts.Only transport vehicles, health department teams, doctors, paramedical staff and people associated with essential services will be permitted to enter Ghaziabad and Noida from Delhi. The lockdown norms will be implemented strictly in both the districts. Addressing a press conference, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said chief minister Yogi Adityanath reviewed the relaxation in the lockdown granted by the state government according to the guidelines issued by the ministry of home affairs (MHA).No positive Covid case was reported in Ghaziabad and Noida on Tuesday, but earlier, there was a spurt in cases in both the districts. To check the spread of coronavirus, it was decided to withdraw the relaxation in the lockdown and seal the border of both the districts with Delhi. There would be limited movement across the border from Delhi to Ghaziabad/ Noida and vice-versa, he said.The state government has directed district magistrate, Gautam Buddha Nagar, commissioner of police, Noida and DM and SP, Ghaziabad to implement the lockdown strictly. The officers of both the districts had been empowered to take decisions according to the prevailing situation, Awasthi said.A health department officer familiar with the development said during the review of coronavirus cases in Ghaziabad and Noida, it was found that infected people moving from Delhi to these two districts were spreading the infection among the local people. The state government had identified hotspots in both the districts to contain the spread of the disease. People were screened and samples of suspected patients sent to the laboratory for test, he said. During the review meeting, the chief minister directed the officers to restrict the movement of people –both inter- district as well as from neighbouring states. He expressed concern over the entry of people from neighbouring states in Jhansi and Lalitpur districts located in Madhya Pradesh. The people were caught moving in the transport vehicles and trucks.The state government has called upon the migrant workers not to move during the lockdown. The nodal officers appointed by the state government will supply food and medicine at their stay in various states.The people entering UP would be lodged in quarantine centres, Awasthi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ghaziabad-noida-borders-with-delhi-sealed-to-check-corona-spread/story-8JuAFZNn6bUGj3sofq4PWN.html

We’ve sent their samples again on Tuesday for confirmation.”On being asked whether the area will still be declared a containment zone, he said, “Yes, the officials of the health department will take more samples as many persons in the area had visited the doctor in Panchkula. The restrictions in the area will continue for some time. The same process will continue in the new colony, industrial area of Ambala Cantonment where the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) worker resides.”The worker had tested positive on Saturday as per the reports of the said Gurugram private lab. She was discharged from the hospital on Monday.All the patients had tested positive on Saturday and Sunday as per the reports of a private lab based in Gurugram after which the areas were declared containment zone and SOPs (standard operating procedure) were followed and more samples were taken. But within 24 hours, they all were tested negative in the reports from a government lab leading to questions on the disparity in such a short time.Taking stock of the situation, Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Monday ordered an inquiry after four patients tested negative within 24 hours of being declared infected and banned Covid-19 testing at the private lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ambala-three-of-family-reported-covid-19-positive-by-private-lab-test-negative-again/story-OYLEiRe4d3ElYltZ9Q4X3L.html

We have also been talking to village heads and procurement agencies to procure wheat, in case the strike continues. Our officials are in touch with commission agents and we are hopeful of a positive response”, the DC added.However, wheat procurement in Rohtak and Bhiwani districts picked pace on the second day.Balwan Singh, a farmer from Rohtak’s Sampla village, said that he had brought 35 quintals of wheat and sold the same to a commission agent.“I brought less quantity of wheat because the remaining 50 quintals have some moisture. Today I will get a good night’s sleep”, he added.In Dadri, as many as 44 farmers had visited six wheat procurement centres and sold 3,048 quintals of their produce.Dadri DC Shyam Lal Punia said that the turnout of farmers to the mandis was less than expected.“The farmers have been visiting all six wheat procurement centres in the district”, he added.Ram Kumar Ritolia, a commission agent, said that they will continue their strike until the government withdraws the e-procurement system and makes payments to farmers through commission agents.Sonepat deputy commissioner Ansaj Singh held a meeting with district officials and asked them to roll out a plan to procure wheat through agencies at Gohana and other centres, where arhtiyas are not participating in the procurement process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jind-admn-ensures-direct-wheat-procurement-by-agencies-after-arhtiyas-go-on-strike/story-gd71WR9TiiDuiXbJVFCcmN.html

They said they wanted to donate personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, masks and sanitiser bottles to the medical staff in jail to ensure they remained protected against Covid-19.However, when they said they also wanted to ‘gift’ a carrom board to inmate Deepak alias Tinnu, the jail officials got suspicious and searched them, to find five mobile phones, two chargers, three earphones and two data cables hidden in the carrom board.Investigations revealed the duo with the ASI were not members of any organisation involved with social service.The search also revealed Rs 38,500 with a Samsung mobile phone, police official Iqbal Singh said.The accused were booked under Section 52-A of the Prisons Act, 1894, 420, 511 IPC on the basis of the jail official’s statement.The four, including inmate Tinnu, were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-asi-3-others-arrested-for-trying-to-smuggle-mobile-phones-hidden-in-carrom-board-into-jail/story-GeKPL6kIF6PJem4DGsinrO.html

21-04-2020||City||Once mired in controversy, Gian Sagar medical college now becomes refuge for corona patients||The Gian Sagar Medical College and Hospital, Banur, which was shut down in 2017 following controversy over financial mismanagement and started again last year with a changed management, has now become a refuge for Covid-19 patients.As many as 51 patients are undergoing treatment at this private hospital, which has been notified as an isolation and treatment facility by the state government after coronavirus outbreak. The number of patients in the hospital is higher than those in all the three government medical college and hospitals in the state. Gian Sagar medical superintendent Col SPS Goraya (retd) said a total of 61 patients were shifted here from Mohali, the worst-affected district in the state, Fatehgarh Sahib and Rupnagar.Of these eight were cured of the disease while two others died.He said the hospital had offered to the Punjab government that it was prepared to make available isolation wards to quarantine suspected coronavirus patients.Later, the Punjab health and family welfare department notified the entire Gian Sagar Medical College and Hospital as an isolation facility even as it was decided that the hospital would continue to function normally as it had enough beds to quarantine suspected coronavirus patients.The hospital has made available 300 beds exclusively for coronavirus patients.“As of now, the hospital has 20 ventilators, but we can manage 100 ventilators if the government provides us more ventilators,” said Col Goraya.The hospital management last week signed a memorandum of understanding with the Punjab Health Systems Corporation wherein it was agreed that the hospital would make available 500 beds for Covid-19 patients, if the need arose, he added.Punjab health minister Balbir Sidhu said Gian Sagar was chosen as isolation and treatment centre, as it is was on the outskirts of the town and is fully equipped.The medical college, which was earlier run by the family of Pearl group chairman Nirmal Singh Bhangu, had run into rough weather due to financial mismanagement and shut down in 2017. The state government had then shifted its students to the government-run medical colleges in the state. However, it was started with a changed management last year due to personal efforts of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/once-mired-in-controversy-gian-sagar-medical-college-now-becomes-refuge-for-corona-patients/story-QpJNTE8ogRjrShwXK3E3CO.html

Also, we were clueless on where they are putting up after being disowned by their employers,” said Mukesh Meshram, divisional commissioner.The need of the survey was felt even more when the administration started getting frantic calls from people informing us about stranded labourers with no food and water, said Meshram, adding: “We roped in Nagar Nigam to carry out a survey and covered all eight zones and tehsils. The figure, which came to fore, was much more than what we were expecting.”As per the survey, around 5,243 labourers from different states and districts and employed in Lucknow at the time of lockdown were stranded and facing difficulties.“Mostly from Bengal, Bihar, Delhi and Jharkhand, maximum numbers of labourers were found in Sarojininagar tehsil. The survey also includes their address and the states or districts to which they belong,” said the commissioner.“Once the survey was done, our priority was to ensure regular food supply to these stranded labourers. Hence we decided to prepare a survival kit and ensured its distribution among them,” he added.The survival kit included 30kg of essential food material, including rice, flour, gram, edible oil, potatoes, onions, spices, salt, sugar etc enough to cater to the family of four.An official said the kit had enough material to last for the entire lockdown period.Other than this, the administration has also launched a helpline 9415005004, or 9650682159 to report stranded labourers or those in need. Officials said after lockdown, the administration would ensure the safe return of these labourers to their home towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/5-000-labourers-stranded-in-lucknow-get-survival-kit/story-6uhrq4rXUiu6UtyxbMk9dP.html

21-04-2020||City||Maharashtra rolls back lockdown relaxation: Mumbai civic body says no to construction activities||As the state rolled back its decision to give relaxations during the lockdown owing to the increase in the number of people stepping out, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday said its order to permit pre-monsoon construction activities of private real estate projects, too, is withdrawn.Starting April 20, the state had allowed construction work, private courier services, home delivery by restaurants, farsan and sweet shops to remain open, with riders. Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, too, had on Sunday issued a circular stating construction of private projects can begin, provided workers are available at the site and they reside there through the construction phase. Earlier on Tuesday, the BMC issued 13-point guidelines, clarifying private developers can’t begin work on a new project and they have been allowed to carry out only urgent pre-monsoon work. However, the guidelines were withdrawn later in the day after the state announced that the restrictions up to April 17 have been imposed again. Vinod Chithore, chief engineer of the BMC’s development plan department, said, “Our order of allowing pre-monsoon construction activities now stands withdrawn, as the state has rolled back the relaxations given in the lockdown period. We do not need to issue any new order on the withdrawal, after the state decision.”The circular had stated that “work can resume at constructed or under-construction site, where works such as construction of retaining walls, or work of shore piling etc. to protect against landslide, waterproofing of terraces and such exposed areas, completion of basements and other sub-soil works had commenced prior to 14th March, 2020 and were required to be left as it is, due to commencement of lockdown”. The BMC’s guidelines had also said all workers will have to be tested using rapid testing kits, once they arrive, and an isolation facility will have to be set up for workers who fall sick. The civic body is awaiting rapid testing kits from domestic and international vendors. Harshul Savla, a developer in the island city, said, “The order was not practical or useful for all developers, considering only those who had labourers could start their work, whereas many developers do not have labour considering they have rushed back to their hometowns. Also, even if there was labour, the conditions put by the authorities to start work were exhaustive, and were not practically feasible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-rolls-back-relaxation-mumbai-civic-body-says-no-to-construction-activities/story-1ZqJNy1pNR2xMDqx12L0YO.html
21-04-2020||Mumbai||Hospitals breach rules on release of bodies of suspected Covid patients: Fadnavis||Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has alleged that city hospitals are breaching Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) protocols by releasing dead bodies of patients as non-coronavirus despite the reason of death being noted as suspected Covid-19 cases. Fadnavis in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday claimed civic-run BYL Nair Hospital has released 44 bodies wherein the patients had been admitted as suspected Covid-19 cases but died before swab tests were carried out, and added that these bodies have been cremated as non-Covid cases. He also forwarded two test case details in the letter from the hospital. “As per papers available with me, Nair Hospital alone has released 44 such bodies for cremation as non-Covid cases where swab tests were not carried out but they are suspected of being infected by coronavirus. Such instances are going on in other hospitals too. Overall, due to this, death rate of Covid-19 will come down but it increases chances of spread of the outbreak as high- and low-risk contacts of these people are not being screened or tested,’’ said Fadnavis. Fadnavis said Thackeray should immediately stop this practice and ensure that all hospitals follow the protocols; especially that of carrying out swab tests of the person admitted.However, BMC health officials claimed testing was being done as per protocols. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer of the BMC, said, “We are following guidelines of testing people who are dead. The testing is done by doctors based on clinical reasons, and anyone or everyone cannot be tested. There are deaths due to alcoholism, and we can’t conduct tests on such individuals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hospitals-breach-rules-on-release-of-bodies-of-suspected-covid-patients-fadnavis/story-bsAmUD4nLAG8eMkudqdhBN.html

Currently we have 15 migrants staying here. Every day two to three more migrants are being added,” said Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, manager at the school. Mascarenhas said they can accommodate 125 people in the school premises.Some NGOs, police as well as the civic body are bringing in migrants who are in need of a shelter to the school. Fr Nigel Barett, spokesperson of the Archdiocese of Bombay, said they haven’t yet received a response from Home Guards on their offer to use other schools as relief camps. Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the archbishop of Mumbai, had offered four schools to the Home Guards last week to set up relief centres and camps. “It has been observed that it is hard to convince migrants to stay at one place even at the camps, which is why they (Home Guards) might have not accepted our offer,” said Barett.With around 230 migrant labourers staying at Versova migrant camp, volunteers from a nearby church have decided to keep them entertained by arranging movie and songs nights.Betty Fernandes, parishioner from Good Shepherd church at Four Bungalows, said they were instructed by their parish priest to volunteer at the camp and that they have played two movies over the last three days.“These migrants are depressed and want to leave the camp because they have nothing to do all day. It is difficult to keep them in the camp as they don’t understand the intensity of the situation,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bandra-school-now-a-migrant-camp/story-sLfftSCgiZhf4LBRGJEk4L.html
21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab industries remain lukewarm despite govt go-ahead||A day after it allowed industrial activities in non-containment areas in line with the Union home ministry guidelines, the Punjab government drew a lukewarm response from industries in the state.The 2,200-odd factories manufacturing essential goods, which were permitted to resume operations by the state government earlier, have continued to operate, but very few other industrial units came forward to seek permission to resume their operations in all the districts, except Ludhiana, on day two of the easing of the coronavirus lockdown norms.The officials of industries department received a few queries from local industries in some districts, but there were hardly any applications received from units for permission to resume production even with limited capacities. Around 60 applications were received through email In Ludhiana, where permissions were granted to resume production to 842 units in the past three weeks. “We have been getting these many requests for permission daily from mostly factories manufacturing essential items. Those which fulfil the norms are granted permission to operate,” Mahesh Khanna, general manager, district industries centre, Ludhiana, said.Barring spinning mills and some other medium and large units, most other industries in Ludhiana, which is home to 95,000 registered units, have decided not to resume operations. In other districts such as Amritsar, Patiala, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Tarn Taran, the number of queries ranged from three to 12 throughout the day. Darshan Singh, general manager, DIC, Bathinda, said he had received a few requests and would put up the file to the deputy commissioner after all formalities were complete. Punjab has a total of 2.52 lakh registered units.However, industries director C Sibin said the response in the first couple of days would not be the correct way to read the situation. “The government gave the go-ahead for allowing industrial activities in non-containment areas on Monday. The actual picture will become clear in one week’s time. Also, we are taking steps such online approvals to streamline the process,” he said. The state has 35 containment zones in 13 districts and five industrial districts of Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala and SAS Nagar (Mohali) account for two-thirds of the coronavirus cases.The Union home ministry had on April 15 issued detailed guidelines allowing factories in rural areas, special economic zones, industrial townships, and industrial estates, besides export-oriented units (EoUs), in non-Covid hotspots and containment zones to reopen from April 20 onwards. However, the state government kept going back and forth for three days by first imposing stricter conditions related to boarding and loading of workers and transport on all categories of industries and then totally refusing to lift any curbs before giving the clearance for easing of the curfew norms.These flip-flops and stringent norms apart, industry leaders, battered by the month-long coronavirus-induced lockdown, continue to harbour doubts about the restoration of the broken supply chain, dip in demand and raw material. “Bulk and retail markets are shut in most parts of the country except for those selling essentials. If anyone resumes production, the problem is where is he going to sell and payments are also an issue,” PHDCCI (Punjab) ex-chairman RS Sachdeva said.‘APPLY ONLINE, START OPERATIONS’Industries minister Sunder Sham Arora said the industrial units which want to start operations can apply online, take permission and start operations. “The industries department has started the online approval system to facilitate them during the curfew period. The general managers of District Industries Centres have been authorised by deputy commissioners to issue the permissions,” he said in a statement. He said online facility would reduce the time and also dispense with the physical visits to offices for obtaining the permissions.Blurb: Industry leaders apprehensive about starting operations as they don’t find any market to sell the goods||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-industries-remain-lukewarm-despite-govt-go-ahead/story-AdZGreBy7GA9lATyig11BI.html
21-04-2020||City||UK’s first Sikh emergency doctor dies of Covid-19||Manjeet Singh Riyat, 52, an emergency medicine consultant who was hugely respected and much loved by colleagues and patients in Derbyshire, died on Monday after being infected by coronavirus, making him the latest Indian-origin medical professional to fall victim to the virus.Riyat, who gained his medical qualifications from the University of Leicester in 1992, was the first accident and emergency consultant in the National Health Service from the Sikh community and was instrumental in building the emergency medicine service in Derbyshire, his hospital trust said.Gavin Boyle, chief executive of the hospital, said: “I want to pay tribute to Mr Manjeet Riyat, who has sadly passed away…He was an incredibly charming person and well loved. Manjeet knew so many people here across the hospital, we will all miss him immensely.”Riyat’s colleague Susie Hewitt, said: “In 2003, Manjeet became one of four consultants in emergency medicine at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary...Manjeet was enormously valued and much loved as a colleague, supervisor and mentor.”“Manjeet’s passion for teaching and contribution to medical education was a constant thread during his career…Despite his many achievements, Manjeet was most at home as a highly visible shop floor emergency medicine consultant,” she added. Riyat is survived by wife and two sons.Earlier this month, cardio-thoracic surgeon Jitendra Kumar Rathod, who gained his qualifications in India and moved to the UK, passed away in Wales. The Cardiff and Vale University Health Board described him as a ‘greatly respected’ doctor and colleague.Riyat, Rathod and east Sussex-based pharmacist Pooja Sharma are among over 50 non-white medical professionals who have passed away in the coronavirus pandemic. Frontline medical staff treating patients includes many Indian origin doctors and nurses.Initial hospital data suggests that minority non-white people in the UK constitute 35% among those in critical care hospitals, prompting an inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/uk-s-first-sikh-emergency-doctor-dies-of-covid-19/story-ueOoW1jL1dGNLnGM6DOlGJ.html
21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 stigma: Doraha dairy owner feels his release from hospital may end bias against his family||26-year-old Liaquat Ali, who was discharged from the civil hospital here on Tuesday evening after recovering from the novel coronavirus, feels that his release from the hospital may bring an end to the discrimination his family has been suffering for over a fortnight now.Liaquat, a dairy owner, who lives with other family members at the outskirts of Rajgarh village in Doraha town, said since the time he tested positive for Covid-19, the sarpanch of the village barred his family from selling milk in the village. “My family was left with no option and had to travel to Ludhiana for selling milk,” he said.Narrating the series of events before he was tested positive, Liaquat said, after the aviation ministry shared his travel details with the local authorities, on April 2, he was picked by officials of the health and police department for the test.He added on April 4 morning, health authorities had sent him home stating that his test report was negative. Later, during the evening, the team arrived again and took him back to the civil hospital, stating that the revised analysis had showed him Covid-19 positive, he said.“Then began the ordeal of my family. My wife, children and parents were also taken to the civil hospital, but they all tested negative. Since then, the other family members, including my brother and their children, have been arranging vegetables and other grocery items from nearby villages for my family. With the fear of catching the virus, no one in our village wanted to come near my family members,” said Liaquat.‘I AM NOT A JAMAATI’Liaquat said like other Covid-19 positive patients, he was also not aware as to when he came in contact with the virus. “But the health department kept suspecting that I had attended the markaz at Nizamuddin in Delhi, from where I came in contact with the virus,” he said, adding that he had left home on March 16 and reached Vijaywara in Andhra Pradesh on March 18. Due to the lockdown, he took a flight from Hyderabad and reached Delhi on March 23.“I stayed at the airport that day as, due to curfew, no transport service was available. On the morning of March 24, I took a flight from Delhi and reached Sahnewal. During this time, I never visited Nizamuddin,” he said.‘TESTS ARE IMPORTANT’He urged the people not to fall prey to misconception and get the test done if they have any Covid-19 symptoms. “I was asymptomatic, still I tested positive. It is through timely detection only that we can win over this virus. We should also show respect to the doctors and paramedical staff, who are risking their lives, to save us,” said Liaquat, who spent most of his time reading spiritual books, particularly the holy Quran Sharif during his treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-stigma-doraha-dairy-owner-feels-his-release-from-hospital-may-end-bias-against-his-family/story-a4E2eOTzwQKj03v5mdZuIP.html

In a related development, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Tuesday said that they will take legal action against BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra and national secretary Sunil Deodhar for making defamatory statements against their party over the incident. Pawar was referring to the incident on April 16 where three people, including two seers, were lynched by a mob at Gadachinchle village, Palghar district on the suspicion of being thieves. “The incident has nothing to do with the novel coronavirus. It was unfortunate, condemnable and should not have happened. Political scores can be settled later, this is not the right time for it,” said the NCP chief in a video interaction with people.BJP leaders Sambit Patra and Sunil Deodhar had also blamed CPI (M) leaders for the incident. CPI (M), in a statement issued on Tuesday said that they will take legal action against the BJP leaders. A statement by Narasayya Adam, former legislator and state secretary of the CPI (M), states that the Gadachinchle village where the killings took place has a BJP gram panchayat for the last ten years. “In this background to whom are the ringleaders of the killings connected?’’ reads the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-the-right-time-to-settle-political-scores-pawar-on-palghar-lynching/story-TaFksrHBNPaHnH1MnoiFeJ.html

On April 16, the city’s tally crossed 2,000 and since then, the virus multiplied rapidly, reaching 3,032 cases on April 20.The number of fatalities, too, have spiked in the past few days. The first Covid-19 death in Mumbai was recorded on March 17, when a 64-year-old man succumbed to the infection at Kasturba Hospital. The toll crossed 50 in 24 days, with 10 deaths taking the toll to 54 on April 9. On April 20, the toll was 139.Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, health department, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said, “Our testing rate is higher than other cities. Cases are increasing, but we are tracking people at an early stage through contact tracing, which reduces the chances of further spread. Of the total cases, 1,344 cases were detected through contact tracing, containment measures and fever clinics.”To identify symptomatic patients, the BMC has started screening people through special clinics. Civic officials confirmed that a total of 5,428 people have been screened in 138 special screening clinics and 2,039 swab samples have been sent for tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-reached-1k-cases-in-30-days-2k-in-6-days-3k-in-4/story-ZTuhTVACl31zFtm8IHX6wM.html

21-04-2020||Mumbai||Lots in the name, if the bungalow’s named Corona||For Celsia Bocarro, a resident of Bandra, the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak has brought with it a little humour as well. “A civic employee did say that he will never forget that he sprayed disinfectant on Corona,” quipped Bocarro, owner of a bungalow with a name that would catch everyone’s attention now — Corona.Located on the quiet St Leo Road in Bandra (West), the bungalow, built in 1963, is named Corona, derived from the Latin word for crown.The coronaviruses themselves are named after the Latin word because they have “crown-like spikes on their surface,” as per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Everyone who remembers our bungalow’s name is now having a good laugh. Some who are getting to know now are taken by surprise,” said Erika Cunha, Bocarro’s daughter, who grew up in the bungalow and now stays in Malabar Hill.“I think people passing by would think we are just horrible people,” she quipped. Erika also took a picture of herself with the bungalow in the backdrop to share with her friends. “There is nothing we can do about it now. We are not going to change the name,” she said.Bocarro, however, said no one has told her anything about the bungalow’s name apart from the stray comment from a civic employee, undertaking a drive to disinfect the road two weeks ago.“I think people are just being polite to me,” she said. A retired microbiologist, Bocarro further said, “There is a Corona garden on St John Baptist Road where so many receptions have been held all these years. There is a saint named Corona. It means the crowning glory, on which we name the bungalow.”A known-name in Bandra circles, Bocarro’s late husband, Eric, was a trustee of the Bandra Gymkhana and also served as the president of the Salsette Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lots-in-the-name-if-the-bungalow-s-named-corona/story-PiYjMlFuRVDUqyRhZ4K6hP.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal expands free ration scheme to cover an additional 3 million poor non-ration card holders||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday announced that his government’s free ration scheme will be expanded to cover an additional three million poor, non-ration card holders in the capital.Laying forth his government’s food security plan in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kejriwal said the programme, in addition to a new food coupon scheme, will cover nearly half of Delhi’s population of around 20 million. Kejriwal, in a digital media address, also said the government will procure 60 ambulances in view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi.“As long as the impact of the coronavirus lasts and the poor are unable to earn their keep, we will ensure their food security. At least 7.1 million people have already been given 7.5kg of ration for free. Then, we gave 5kg ration for free to one million people who did not have ration cards,” he said. “Today, the government has decided to distribute free 5kg ration to another three million people. So in all, our food security scheme will now cover 11 million people, which is more than half of Delhi’s population,” Kejriwal said.The chief minister, however, did not specify the period till which the temporary relief will last, but hinted that it will continue until economic activities resume in the city. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, he said, also decided to provide a daily items kit to all beneficiaries, besides the monthly free ration. “Every family with a ration card and also those with e-coupons will be given a basic kit comprising items of daily need, including cooking oil, spices, pulses, sugar, salt, and soap, among others, along with their ration for the month of May when the distribution begins from April 29,” Kejriwal said.In another welfare measure, aimed to cover several other temporary migrant workers who may not figure in the above two categories of people, Kejriwal announced a food coupon scheme, which he said will be delivered through the people’s representative of the state.Under the coupon scheme, every MP and MLA representing Delhi will be given 2,000 food coupons each to be distributed among temporary migrant workers, who do not have neither ration cards nor e-coupons (obtained after registering online). The food coupon will make the holder eligible to receive 5kg of free ration. Delhi has 70 MLAs -- 62 from the AAP and eight from the BJP — apart from seven MPs, all from the BJP.“The three million people who will get free 5kg ration are those who have applied online using ID cards like Aadhaar. But there are people in Delhi who do not have any ID card. Each of these coupons will be enable its holder to get 5kg free ration. The MPs and MLAs can give these coupons to people who do not have a ration card or any ID proof,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal also said the government will start Covid-19 testing for media persons from Wednesday, at a centre which is yet to be disclosed by the government. “We have set up a centre. All media houses and journalists will be informed about it. Interested media persons can undergo tests from Wednesday morning at the centre,” Kejriwal said.A senior official in the chief minister’s office later said any media person working in the national capital and having a valid media ID card will be accepted for tests. The scheme will include photojournalists as well. The decision comes after more than 50 journalists tested positive for coronavirus in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-expands-free-ration-scheme-to-cover-an-additional-3-million-poor-non-ration-card-holders/story-KYOY4I9iQ5bZBE5481gFtO.html

21-04-2020||Delhi||EDMC health worker dies of suspected Covid, another tests positive||A 52-year-old woman sanitation worker of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) died of a heart attack Tuesday at the Lok Nayak hospital, but doctors suspect that she may been suffering from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Her Covid-19 test results are yet to arrive.EDMC spokesperson Arun Kumar said, “We have been told that she had suffered a heart attack at the LN Hospital Tuesday and died, but her final Covid test reports are yet to arrive. So we can’t be sure of any underlying reasons for the heart attack she suffered.” Neither the area district magistrate nor the LN hospital authorities was able to confirm the development. However, the 52-year-old woman’s husband, over the phone, said, “We have been verbally told that she had contracted the coronavirus infection. We are not being handed over the body and have been told to reach the Nigambodh Ghat directly for her last rites. The doctors also said only a maximum of four people can be at the crematorium and a team of doctors will be there to supervise the last rites. She was only given a mask by EDMC to carry out her duties -- she did not even have gloves on.” Also, on Tuesday, a 35-year-old co-worker of the dead woman was Tuesday admitted to the Lok Nayak hospital after she tested positive for Covid-19. Officials said she works in the Dharampura area of Shahdara. EDMC officers said they were perplexed about how the two women could have contracted the disease when “they were not engaged in serving in or near quarantine centres or homes”.“As far as picking up garbage from quarantine homes is concerned, a special team -- whose members have been provided full personal protective equipment, including hazmat suits, masks, boots and gloves -- is doing it. These two women were only engaged in sweeping roads,” a senior health official of EDMC, who did not wish to be named, said.“However, we have started taking all precautionary steps such as spraying disinfectant in and around their homes. We are also working with the area district surveillance officer (DSO) to trace contacts of these women and sent all the women safai karmacharis, who worked with these two women, on leave,” the municipal health official said.Meanwhile, leaders of both the north and south Delhi municipal corporations wrote to the additional secretary in the Union health ministry to include municipal sanitation workers and anti-dengue/malaria workers in the national insurance scheme for health workers fighting Covid-19South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) former mayor Narendra Chawla said, “Our workers are risking their lives every day. The least they deserve is a proper health insurance cover.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/edmc-health-worker-dies-of-suspected-covid-another-tests-positive/story-IfgTQTWnLPIlAyAxJiK1AO.html

21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Staff safety a priority, says PGI after workers demand action for negligence||Contract workers of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, have written to the city’s police chief demanding that an FIR be registered against the institute’s administration for their negligence due to which two workers have been infected with Covid-19. However, the institute has stated that extensive measures have been undertaken for safety of its staff at all levels.Chairman of PGIMER’s contract workers union, in a letter to UT’s senior superintendent of police, has stated that officials of the institute failed to establish standard operation procedures and did not draw a road-map for dealing with patients up to April 2. As a result, they said, two healthcare workers have been infected.Although the institute has not responded to the allegations, a separate press release quotes the institute’s director Dr Jagat Ram on the matter. “It goes without saying that the safety of our front line warriors is of utmost importance to us. We, in PGIMER, currently follow a roster system wherein a health care worker (HCW) performs duty for 7 days in the Covid unit, during which they stay in designated isolation rooms within PGIMER campus after their daily shifts,” says the director in the press release.The statement adds that after seven days of duty, HCWs are quarantined in single occupancy rooms, either within the campus or at off-site hotels specifically designated for this purpose by the UT administration. This roster, however, is subject to change based on trends of Covid containment in India and subsequent requirement of health care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/staff-safety-a-priority-says-pgi-after-workers-demand-action-for-negligence/story-Iz6sQgaGHwGh1IyBHmwWsL.html
21-04-2020||City||Dissolved oxygen content up from 8% to 56.5% in UP stretch of river Yamuna||The water quality in the stretch of river Yamuna that passes through Uttar Pradesh has improved considerably, thanks to the lockdown that has closed industries and kept people away from the river.A report on water quality of river Yamuna, prepared by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), said the dissolved oxygen (DO) level in the river has gone up in the range 8% to 56.5% during the lockdown period at six locations -- upstream, Vrindavan (39.6%), downstream, Vrindavan (38.46%), upstream, Mathura (48.3%), downstream, Mathura (56.5%), upstream, Kailashghat in Agra (12.5%) and downstream at Taj Mahal, Agra (8.0%) -- when compared to the pre-lockdown period.According to UPPCB officials, the study took into account the pre-lockdown period (as on March 7, 2020) and lockdown period (as on April 8, 2020). “To assess river health, we need to study f three parameters – DO, BOD and total coliform. It is required that BOD should be low and DO higher. If DO is low, then the aquatic life will not be able to survive. Likewise, contaminants in form of total coliform should also be low in order for improved water quality,” Utsav Sharma, regional manager, UPPCB, said.A periodic report released in January 2020 by the UPPCB states that the DO level ranged between 1.5 milligrams/litre (mg/l) and 4.8mg/l at the 14 sampling points, starting at Okhla Barrage and ending at Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh.In contrast, officials during the latest study found that on April 8 (during the lockdown period), the values of DO were considerably higher than on normal days and ranged between 5.4mg/l and 7.4mg/l at the six locations. On March 3 (pre-lockdown), the DO values ranged between 4.6mg/l and 5.6mg/l at these locations.The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) -- the amount of dissolved oxygen needed for organisms to break down organic material present in water -- also came down and was in the range of 17.6% to 23.1% during the lockdown period.Another parameter of river water quality is the total coliform content. If the total coliform bacteria are found in a water sample, it indicates surface contamination has reached the water. The UPPCB study indicated that the total coliform content declined in the range 12.9% to 38.6% during the lockdown period, when compared to the pre-lockdown period.“The decrease in total coliform in April 2020, as compared to that in March 2020 at all (six) locations indicates that the improvement in the water quality is principally due to dilution as a result of increase in water flow,” the report said.According to UPPCB, the average discharge of water in river Yamuna from the Gokul Barrage during the pre-lockdown period (March 5 to March 7, 2020) was about 3,120.70 cusecs. But it was 7,938.3 cusecs during the lockdown period (April 6 to April 8, 2020), an increase of about 154.4%.Experts said the data gathered during the lockdown period will provide a useful baseline for further studies. “The lockdown was unprecedented. The data will give us a useful insight on the effect of pollution on the river’s health. Until now, our focus was more on treatment of sewage/drains etc. But during the lockdown, the drains/sewage are still discharging into the river, but industrial discharge is minimal. Now we will know how much industrial/commercial activities impact the river. Since the industrial activity is significantly reduced, in the future, we need to focus on the removal of all such sources of pollution,” Manoj Misra, convener, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said.“Near Okhla, there is reduced DO level but it increases near cities such as Vrindavan and Mathura. That is because for this 150km stretch of the river, there are no major cities along it. So the river gets a period of relief. The lockdown period study will also help us know the level of flow needed to maintain the health of Yamuna,” Misra said.However, UPPCB officials said during the lockdown, the water quality of the river at all the locations was found under category ‘D’ which is useful for ‘propagation of wild life and fisheries’, still a far cry from category A, or fit for drinking after treatment.“A study of tributaries of river Yamuna is also being done for the pre-lockdown and lockdown period,” an official of UPPCB, on condition of anonymity said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dissolved-oxygen-content-up-from-8-to-56-5-in-up-stretch-of-river-yamuna/story-Yz61Ivb8IHK0BwRpi5GGBK.html

The person has no history of travel to foreign countries. The health department is in the process of tracing his contacts, a senior government official said. A similar case in Gujarat’s Surat last week had set the alarm bells ringing for fear of a community spread, and the municipal corporation of Surat had reportedly asked all beneficiaries of the fair price shop to visit the nearby health centre for a medical examination.The test result of the ration shop owner in Roop Nagar, which HT has seen, showed that his sample was collected on April 18 and the report came on Monday.District magistrate (central) Nidhi Srivastava confirmed the case and said the administration is taking all necessary precautions and have asked all beneficiaries of the shop to remain in home quarantine.A health department official further confirmed that they have been approached by other residents of the area who are proactively participating in ensuring proper isolation and quarantine. Some of them have proposed to the government that the area be declared a containment zone and sealed.“The ration shop owner was feeling unwell last week and first visited the doctor on April 15. His family members have been sent into quarantine and they are scheduled to be tested on April 25. The shop has 1,648 beneficiaries registered. This is a matter of concern. The patient in this case has been admitted to a private hospital and his family is unsure about any financial aid from the government,” Shailendra Kumar, president of public distribution system welfare association, said.Meanwhile, Tuesday, the Delhi government issued an order directing all fair price shop dealers to update records of their stocks and beneficiaries on a day-to-day basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ration-shop-owner-tests-covid-positive-in-roop-nagar-1-648-beneficiaries-put-in-home-quarantine/story-UzZmtHYl4icadVoDEHA58H.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||Four constables of Nabi Karim police station Covid-19 positive, 20 cops infected so far||Four constables of the Delhi Police posted at central Delhi’s Nabi Karim tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) after 80 personnel of the police station were screened till Monday. All four were asymptomatic and their testing was done after Nabi Karim was declared a containment zone.With the four new cases, the total number of police personnel infected with the virus rose to 20. Of these, 12 personnel are from Nabi Karim and Chandni Mahal police stations in central Delhi. Eight personnel at the Chandni Mahal police station had earlier tested positive for the virus. The station was sealed last week, as the building was in a containment zone and two constables had tested positive for Covid-19.“The Nabi Karim police station has not been sealed yet as everyone else, besides the four, tested negative. So far, screening of more than 150 personnel of the two police stations has been done. Of them, 12 have been found positive and they all were asymptomatic,” said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central).Of the four personnel, three were on picket duty while one was deployed on the station premises. “We are trying to ascertain the source through which these police personnel got the infection. The entire police station building was disinfected and sanitised,” the DCP said.On Monday, six personnel — five from the Chandni Mahal police station and one head constable posted with the anti-terrorism wing of the special cell — were found positive for the virus. It was the highest single-day rise of Covid-19 cases among the police.Of the 20 personnel infected with the disease, an assistant sub-inspector with the traffic police, who was the first to be diagnosed, was discharged from the hospital last Friday.The other personnel infected with the virus were posted at AIIMS Trauma Centre police post, at the Delhi airport, at a police picket in Bara Hindu Rao, and in Burari. A policeman staying in Model Town police colony tested positive after his wife, nursing staff at a government hospital, was found infected. Their son had also tested positive for the virus.Two deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) of the South West district and as many as 300 personnel of other ranks, who had come in contact with the infected personnel during duty, are in home-quarantine at present. The DCPs tested negative for the virus and are likely to resume their duties from Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-constables-of-nabi-karim-police-station-covid-19-positive-20-cops-infected-so-far/story-CMusrvOHH1f8PdW1GcnZQL.html

21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Hypertension patients should not discontinue medicine amid Covid-19 outbreak, say experts||Experts said since hypertensive patients are at highest risk of becoming dangerously sick due to coronavirus, they should keep on taking their medicines and non-adherence to treatment could be dangerous. Even as the medical fraternity rushes to put in place effective and credible treatment protocols to curb the global pandemic, some studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors and ARBs commonly used to treat blood pressure could aggravate the symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Clearing the air on the matter, public health experts and medical practitioners from premier institutions across the country stated that it is too early to draw such conclusions and non-adherence to treatment could be dangerous.Dr Yash Paul Sharma, professor and head, department of cardiology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, said people with hypertension are indeed at a higher risk of catching the coronavirus.Citing a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that appeared in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases that assessed the prevalence of co-morbidities in Covid-19 infected patients, Sharma said hypertensive patients with the underlying disease were more at risk. He added that Covid-19 patients had fatality rate of 8.4%, 13.2%, 9.2%, 8% and 7.6% in those with hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and cancer, respectively.“As such, avoiding blood pressure medications is a risk India cannot afford to take as our healthcare systems are already stretched because of the Covid-19 spread,” he said.Dr Garg, professor and head, community medicine of Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospitals said, “Hypertensive persons are best advised, in addition to their blood pressure medication, to follow non-pharmacological approaches such as yoga, stress management and low calorie intake to keep their blood pressure levels under check.”Dr Sonu Goel, professor, department of community medicine and school of public health, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) spoke on the need of monitoring other risk factors such as tobacco use.Dr Tom Frieden, president and CEO, Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, said evidence from around the world showed that people with hypertension should not forego their regular medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hypertension-patients-should-not-discontinue-medicine-amid-covid-19-outbreak-say-experts/story-T6bD2bYdWqjNQwiYv3PYUK.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||Yamuna water improves during lockdown period, CPCB analysis shows||There has been a “significant improvement” in the water quality of river Yamuna in the national capital during the lockdown period, thanks to polluting industries being shut and people keeping away from the river, as per an analysis done by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and submitted to the Yamuna monitoring committee, a body appointed by the National Green Tribunal.This came a day after the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) came out with its report based on tests of samples collected from nine locations. It, too, had concluded that the overall water quality had improved by up to 33%, though it is still not being fit for bathing. The CPCB report is based on water samples collected from three major locations --- Palla (the entry point of the river in Delhi), Nizamuddin bridge (between Wazirabad and Okhla barrages where 14 drains discharge into it) and Okhla barrage upstream (after discharge from 16 drains).The CPCB also took samples from two major drains --- Najafgarh and Shahdara --- that contribute at least two-thirds of the hydraulic ( sand, silt and gravel) load in the river, the report said. The samples were collected on April 6, 2020, and have been compared with the results of tests done in March 2020. The nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The analysis indicates that there is considerable improvement in water quality, in terms of DO (dissolved oxygen), BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) and COD (chemical oxygen demand), when compared with the pre-lockdown period, at all three monitored locations. However, water quality at Nizamuddin and Okhla upstream did not meet the primary water quality criteria for bathing,” the report stated. BOD means the amount of oxygen required by the river to maintain its flow. The prescribed BOD standards are 3 milligrams per litre (mg/l). The lower the BOD, the better the water quality. COD indicates the presence of industrial effluents in a water body. A reduction in COD means that the amount of effluents in the river is also going down.DO is an indicator of how much oxygen is present in the river for the survival of aquatic life. The higher the DO, the better the health of the river. As per the report findings, at Palla, post-lockdown, the BOD was 2mg/l, down from 7.9mg/l (pre-lockdown).The DO here was 8.3mg/l, compared to 17.1mg/l (pre-lockdown) and COD was 6mg/l, down from 28mg/l (pre-lockdown). The pH levels (a measure of acidity in the water measured on a scale of 0-14) were 7.8 in April as compared to that of 8.7 in March. “The results comply with the primary water quality criteria for outdoor bathing with respect to analysed parameters of pH, DO and BOD,” the report said. At Nizamuddin Bridge, the analysis results showed that pH was 7.2 as compared to 7.3 in March, BOD levels were 5.6mg/l from.57 mg/l and COD was 16mg/l as compared to 90mg/l previously. DO levels were not detected. “The results do not meet the primary criteria of being fit for bathing with respect to DO and BOD,” it said. At Okhla barrage (upstream), the report said the results do not meet the prescribed standards for bathing. The pH was 7.1 as compared to 7.2, BOD was 6.1mg/l from .27mg/l, COD level was 18mg/l from 95 mg/l. DO was 1.2 mg/l, but could not be compared as values for March could not be detected. “Though water quality does not meet the primary criteria, there was a considerable reduction in concentration of BOD (77.41) and COD (81.05%) levels, which can be attributed to no industrial effluent discharges and the stretch of about 7.5km (after Nizamuddin Bridge) that might be helping in self-purification of river Yamuna,” it said. It further said the waste water quality in the two drains ---Najafgarh and Shahdara --- has also shown improvement of about 30-45% in BOD levels, though the drains, even with this improvement, had BOD levels of 56 mg/l and 89mg/l, respectively. The report has attributed the post-lockdown overall improvement in the water quality to various factors, including release of abundant fresh water from Wazirabad Barrage and availability of dilution in the river; no industrial effluent discharge (only about 35.9MLD); good penetration of solar radiation in water body, owing to the washing out of bottom sediments and colloidal form of pollutants; and reduced human activity such as throwing of religious offerings, materials and solid waste; bathing and washing of clothes in the river. The two-member Yamuna monitoring committee had asked the CPCB and DPCC to test water quality during the lockdown period to ascertain the reasons behind the seemingly cleaner Yamuna. Seeing both the reports, the committee has observed that one of the major reasons behind the water being cleaner was the availability of fresh water that allowed dilution of pollutants. “As per data obtained from the Delhi Jal Board (D JB), there was a fivefold increase in the water released into the river from Wazirabad during the lockdown, which was less than 1000 cusecs prior to the lockdown. Besides the closure of industries and reduced human activity too has contributed to the better health of the river,” the committee concluded in its report Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/yamuna-water-improves-during-lockdown-period-cpcb-analysis-shows/story-4v49aV6ywKvHVHXT4V6vOI.html

21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Irregularity in issuance of passes delaying wheat procurement in Ludhiana||Even as a week has elapsed since the process of wheat procurement commenced in the state, the authorities concerned have failed to streamline the process of issuing curfew passes to the arhtiyas, who distribute them among the farmers. The arhtiyas rued that the passes are issued to them with a gap of a day due to which the procurement process is getting delayed. Also, if the farmer is not able to transport the produce on the same day then the pass turns void. Bharti Kisan Union (Lakhowal) Harinder Singh Lakhowal said that the farmers are facing problems in transportation of their produce due to shortage of passes. “The market committee is issuing passes to arhtiyas with a gap of a day, forcing them and their labourers to sit idle in the markets as a major portion of the grain markets remains empty,” he said.The farmers are also facing harassment as hey have to wait for their turn to transport their produce to the grain market. For instance, if the combine harvest develops snag or the farmer is not able to arrange trolley on a particular day, they won’t be able to transport their produce the next day as the pass is valid only for only one day.“The government should issue regular passes to the arhtiyas so that the farmers could bring their produce on daily basis. If the procurement continues at this pace then the government would not be able to achieve the target in 45 days,” said Lakhowal.One of the arhtiyas at the Gill road grain market requesting anonymity said that the market committee is providing only five passes to arhtiyas in a day. “When we contacted the market committee, the officials claimed that they are working as per the directions issued by the state government to reduce rush at the markets. The officials have asked us to directly procure the produce of big farmers at their farms only, however, it is not possible as it will require transportation of labour and machinery for the whole process,” said the arhtiya.Market committee chairman Darshan Lal (Laddoo) Baweja said that the passes are being issued in phased manner as per the guidelines of the state government to avoid rush at the grain markets. “This year is different. The farmers cannot compare it with the previous years.We have to take precautions to contain the spread of Covid-19,” he added.Chairman recommends cancellation of licences of 3 arhtiyasAfter some arhtiyas were caught illegally operating at the main vegetable market (sabzi mandi) near Jalandhar Bypass on Friday night, the chairman of market committee has sent recommendations to the secretary of market committee to cancel the licences of three arhtiyas.On April 17, a few arhtiyas had illegally assembled a large number of vendors at the vegetable market . A video of the same had gone viral and following a tip off, the police had arrested four vendors who were present there.Market committee chairman Baweja said, “After watching the video, I sent a recommendation to the secretary of the market committee that action must be taken against the three arhtiyas and their licence should be cancelled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/irregularity-in-issuance-of-passes-delaying-wheat-procurement-in-ludhiana/story-tXJcpZWKwJ3SVAR8L5VQXO.html
21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Probe ordered after video of Chandigarh woman constable arguing with Punjab police officials goes viral||After a video of a woman constable arguing with a Punjab police personnel went viral on social media platforms the Chandigarh police on Tuesday ordered a probe into the matter.Constable Usha Yadav posted at the challaning branch of the traffic unit was asked to report for duty at the Sector 23 checkpoint because of the lockdown due to Covid-19. However, according to sources who did not want to be named, she was on her way from Nayagaon to Chandigarh when she found the road barricaded by Mohali police to prevent movement of people because of the curfew. The video shot by an unidentified person captured her misbehaving with the sub-inspector and his team, demanding that the barricades be removed to allow her through as she used the route every day for her commute.The police officials at the check post are heard denying her permission to pass, citing clampdown orders from the Mohali administration and the district police chief and asking her to use another route instead.Taking note of the incident, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Mohali, Kuldeep Chahal wrote to his UT counterpart Nilambari Jagadale, seeking action against Yadav.“A fact finding report has been sought on the incident and it will also include details of the daily conduct of the woman officer in question. We have also communicated to the Mohali police that in future they should be more accommodating towards members of the Chandigarh police force. They should not be stopped when going to or returning from their duty,” said Jagadale. Meanwhile, the official probing the incident recommended her transfer to her parent unit, the reserve battalion (IRB), stating that numerous complaints had been filed against her in the past.“Her language and behaviour is rude.

Later, the hospital released the body for burial without the report, which is a violation of the guidelines of the Union health ministry.Mohammad Rabbani, a resident of Bihar, who was suffering from a chronic kidney ailment for the last three years came to Mumbai in the second week of March to stay with his brother- Mohammad Jinal, 36, with the hope of getting cured. His brother took him to the government-run JJ Hospital.“Doctor had told us that if his condition deteriorates, he would require dialysis. But due to the lockdown, we couldn’t take him to the hospital for it. Soon, he stopped eating,” said Jinal, who resides in Byculla.With the help of activists, an ambulance was arranged that took him to BYL Nair Hospital, last week. But as the hospital was in the process of getting converted into a Covid-19 facility, they refused to take a non-Covid patient. Soon, his condition worsened.On Sunday, the patient was rushed to JJ Hospital. But the hospital refused to admit the patient and referred him to St George Hospital which doesn’t even have the testing facility.Brijesh Gadhia, a member of Kidney Warriors Foundation who helped the patient with admission said, “He was admitted in the intensive care unit of St George Hospital, but it was too late as the patient kept waiting for the test report for Covid-19.”On Monday night, the patient was declared dead and his body was handed over to his brother who performed his last rites at Bada Qabrastan, Mumbai Central. This is without getting the test result of the patient, which is considered as the violation of the guideline of the Union Health Ministry, that has specified guidelines for the burial of Covid-19 patients to stop any possible spread of infection.“He has two daughters in our village, I don’t know what will happen to them. I am so scared that I haven’t been able to tell them yet about his death,” said Jinal.The dean of JJ Hospital, Dr Ranjit Maheshwar said, “I am unaware of it but will investigate the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kidney-ailment-patient-dies-while-waiting-for-covid-19-test-report/story-WiUvyXq5Pe0iRkTJXIBGgP.html
21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Amid lockdown, Ludhiana residents raising morale of police personnel||During the lockdown duty, the police personnel deployed at different checkpoints in the city are being treated with lot of regard and respect by the city residents. The personnel say they have never witnessed such gratitude towards their department before. Residents’ acknowledgement is undoubtedly boosting their morale to fight the Covid-19 crisis undeterred. “The news of assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Anil Kohli’s death due to coronavirus has been very disheartening for us. Our families are extremely worried about our safety. But the moral support that we are getting from the police chief, state government and our city residents is actually helping us a lot in boosting our morale,” one of the police personnel said.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Pardeep Kumar, 46, who is deployed at the checkpoint installed on Ferozepur Road near Verka Milk Plant, said that in the past 27 years of his service, he has never seen residents treating the policemen in such a respectful manner. “With this respect and gratitude, our willpower to perform duty has doubled. I feel proud of being a policeman and with this high spirit, I can easily fight with the situation,” he added.The messages floating on various social media platforms — ‘Proud of Punjab of Police’, ‘Salute to our heroes’, ‘God bless the cops on duty’ and ‘Brave sons and daughters of the city’— are also encouraging our front-line warriors. Initially, it was quite unusual for them when commuters paused and greeted them with a thank you, but not anymore. “At times, when residents come across us, they enquire not only about our well-being, but even our family members’ well-being. While some of them even give us blessings. This gesture simply makes our day,” said head constables Gurjant Singh and Sohan Das, adding that this has never happened in the past. Both the head constables are the part of PCR team and work for 24 hours in a stretch on alternative days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-lockdown-ludhiana-residents-raising-morale-of-police-personnel/story-ItH99jct79BEa83sCQcUmJ.html

21-04-2020||Lucknow||Don’t deploy cops with history of illness on Covid-19 duty: UP DGP||Uttar Pradesh director general of police (DGP) on Tuesday asked senior authorities to ensure that police personnel with history of illness are not deployed on frontline of Covid-19 duty.Directing authorities to make a list of personnel, who are above 55 years of age, and those having history of health issues, DGP Hitesh Chandra Awasthi said those who are vulnerable must not be given Covid-19 duty.Issuing a detailed circular to all district police chiefs, the DGP asked authorities to strictly follow the directive to ensure that men in force do not get exposed to the deadly virus.The circular said the personnel suffering from diseases related to respiration, lungs, heart and diabetes should be kept free from frontline duty.As per the circular, the frontline duty included anything in which people have to come across unknown persons like hospital duty, quarantine security, rapid action team, duty along with health workers etc.The directives said the district authorities should be very cautious while deploying police personnel who are above the age of 55 years as they could be vulnerable to infection.The DGP circular stated that those deployed on the frontline duty should be regularly briefed to strictly follow standard operating procedures especially in containment zones and other places where they are likely to be exposed to coronavirus infection.He also asked senior authorities to ensure that safety kits were given to personnel deployed for duties in containment zones or along with health workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/don-t-deploy-cops-with-history-of-illness-on-covid-19-duty-up-dgp/story-WiaRQZkKV9Agt3e26prClJ.html
21-04-2020||City||IIT Ropar researchers design doffing unit for healthcare workers||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar, have designed a doffing unit for healthcare workers. The special doffing unit, which is separated from the donning or clean room, has been designed by a team of researchers, including Khushboo Rakha, assistant professor at the department of metallurgical and materials engineering, Dhiraj Mahajan, associate professor at the department of mechanical engineering and senior scientific officer Naresh Rakha.Rakha said the unit was developed taking into consideration the safety of healthcare workers who spend a lot of time in close proximity with patients and are involved in high risk activities such as placing patients on ventilators and collecting and handling samples.She said that personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, gloves and gowns, that keep nurses and doctors safe need to be fitted, worn, and removed in a specific way. “However, it has been reported in the past that healthcare workers make mistakes while wearing and removing PPE, which exposes them to pathogens,” she added.Rakha said it was imperative to maintain sterile conditions in the doffing station, the place where healthcare professionals remove their PPE at the end of their duty. Explaining the model of the doffing station, the researcher said, “The unit involves use of three well established and documented germicidal technologies; chemical disinfectants, negative pressure rooms and ultra-violet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). The unit begins with a disinfection tunnel using a safe and effective disinfectant recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO).”“After doffing/removal of PPE (through prescribed procedure), healthcare workers should place the PPE in one of the two chutes for reuse or proper disposal. Both the chutes will be attached with UV-C germicidal tubes for disinfection before further removal. The unit will be maintaining ‘Negative pressure outlet,’ which will significantly lower the risk of virus transmission through air,” she said.Rakha said that UV-C type germicidal bulbs/tubes will be installed in the entire space to disinfect the room after every doffing session or alternatively every 2-3 hours and that no person would be allowed inside the station during UV-C disinfection session.The researchers also recommend the use of copper or brass-70%Cu to be used for door knobs/handles and taps in this chamber because of its anti-microbial properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iit-ropar-researchers-design-doffing-unit-for-healthcare-workers/story-Tsu48i3kB12WnUkZKyOkYL.html
21-04-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration decentralises food distribution, but a long way to go||Facing flak from the public, the Chandigarh administration has decentralised its cooked food distribution, shifting the responsibility from the food supplies and consumer affairs department to all three sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) to feed the poor. While residents say food availability has gone up in the past couple of days, a lot still needs to be done. Farmilla Devi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillor from Dadumajra, an area that has nearly 5,000 poor families, said cooked food is distributed at three points in her ward, but inadequate distribution results in long queues. “People also have to wait for hours for getting free ration. The problem is that local councillors are not being involved in the process,” said Devi, adding that city BJP president Arun Sood had sought intervention of UT administrator and, hopefully, they will be involved. SEVERAL AREAS STILL UNTOUCHEDThe UT media bulletin on Tuesday claimed to have distributed cooked food to 1.30 lakh people. This, according to deputy commissioner (DC) Mandip Brar, has doubled in the past one week. Though Brar said the situation on ground has improved, there are areas where the supply is still poor. Satish Kainth, councillor from ward number 11, which has more than 3,000 poor families living in Sector 53 (Nehru Colony), Sector 55 (Indira, Kamal and Adarsh colonies) and Palsora village, said, “The administration has only set up a single distribution point at the Sector 56 community centre for such a huge area. I spoke to area SDM SK Jain several times but things have not improved,” said Kainth. Jain could not be reached for comments. MORE DISTRIBUTION POINTS NEEDEDAs per the information, the UT still has 19 major distribution points, which seems insufficient given that each point, on an average, is catering to more than 5,000 people now. The DC said he has already directed all SDMs to visit the field and explore new points for distribution. “There is definitely a need to have more points to further streamline the distribution but it is a matter of great achievement that UT has started feeding over 1 lakh people on a daily basis,” said Brar. “It is a challenging job feeding a large number of residents. There was food shortage for a few days after resources of some NGOs had dried up, but the UT has now begun providing ration to them. Besides, food preparation has increased in kitchens run by the administration,” the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-decentralises-delivery-system-but-a-long-way-to-go/story-vwTH1CoSgY16z7R0v20FQO.html

We are also putting our lives at risk every day,” said Anju Mehta, district press secretary of the Anganwadi Mulazim Union.Mehta criticised the Centre and the state government for asking them to be frontline warriors, but without ensuring their safety and livelihood.Presently, there are 2,487 Anganwadi centres in the district with two workers in each centre.“The government has ignored us in all respects. While the administration is assigning us duties of distributing ration and pensions among the people amid lockdown, but it has not even provided us face masks, sanitisers or gloves for duty,” she added.The workers, holding protest from rooftops, held placards with the message ‘Bhashan Na Do, Rashan Do’ (Give ration, not speech).Mehta claimed ration distribution in the district had not been carried out effectively due to insufficient supply of ration.“In the first week, we started the process of filling forms for the distribution of ration, but that was stopped after a few days due to lack of supply. We can only start effective distribution of ration among the needy, if the government ensures enough supply,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aaganwadi-workers-hold-protest-from-rooftops-in-ludhiana/story-uQP3QUWX7LRbB00W8UrXTM.html
21-04-2020||City||98% samples taken in Haryana test negative for Covid-19||About 98% of the samples taken in Haryana have tested negative for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), shows the data accessed from the Haryana health department. As per the figures, the Haryana government has so far sent samples of 14,560 people, 12,253 of which tested negative. Only 255 — about 2% — have tested positive for the infection, whereas reports of 2,069 samples sent to different labs in the state are awaited. Even in most of the districts, about 99% of the samples collected have tested negative, raising questions over the criteria set for the sampling as the country is already reeling under the shortage of testing kits. In Karnal district, total 585 samples have been sent for examination of which, only six (1.15%) came out positive. 521 samples have tested negative, while reports of 55 are pending. In Panipat, of 395 samples, 364 tested negative, whereas reports of 27 are awaited. Only five persons (1.37%) in the district were found infected and four of them have been cured and discharged. Similarly, 536 samples were sent for examination from Kurukshetra district and reports of 489 came out negative. Results of 45 samples are pending. As of now, only two persons, 0.40% of the people examined, have tested positive. They have been cured. A senior official in the Haryana health department, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Yes, we can see that most of the samples tested negative. On the one hand, it is a good thing; but on the other, the huge number of negative reports has raised many questions as there already is shortage of testing kits in the country.” “In fact, all 98 samples sent to Covid-19 lab in Karnal’s Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College from Ambala on Monday have tested negative,” he added. In this regard, most of the officials in the health department were reluctant to speak and maintained that they were following the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “We test only suspected patients and it is an expansive exercise. We take samples of only those people who fit in the criteria. Many of the patients are asymptomatic, but we need to examine them,” said Dr Sheelkant Pajani, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Ambala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/98-samples-taken-in-haryana-test-negative-for-covid-19/story-Mvn6RDQrBenr06mQTZeuuL.html

No response, however, to the letter has been received.In another letter issued later, the employees have said: “All the department heads should be asked to draw a roster keeping in view the DoPT guidelines, which has not been done after passing of more than two weeks since we wrote to the institute.”Around 100 disabled workers in the institute are affiliated with DoPT.Commenting on the matter, Satyaveer Dagur, president of the Disabled Employees’ Union of the institute, said it was getting increasingly difficult for the staff to report for duties due to non-availability of transport, which the institute should have provided.He demanded that PGIMER implement the Central government’s order.PGIMER spokesperson, Dr Ashok Kumar, said the orders will be implemented soon. “I need to check with the administration about what can be done on our part.

Instead of taking action against the violators, even the police are looking the other way,” said one of the employees working for a drug store in the market. Another employee said that even schedule H drugs, particularly de-addition drugs, are also being sold unabatedly. “Even ayurvedic medicine wholesalers are receiving huge rush of people demanding immunity booster medicines. While the business could be justified, but what if a COVID-19 positive patient, who is asymptomatic, enters the market and spread the virus. There should be some mechanism in place. We are poor people and do not have any other source of earning. If we object, we will be thrown out of the job,” said the employee.Ludhiana Wholesale Chemist Association president GS Chawla said that like everyone else, the chemists are also worried about their health and the well being of our children and they are taking every precaution to protect themselves from the virus.“There are 400 wholesalers in the narrow streets of the market. Of the total, nearly 200 have the pass to supply medicines. Besides the owners of these wholesale shops, 800 to 900 people employed in these shops visit the market daily. Apart from them, traders from other parts of the state also visit the Pindi Street market. The crowd mainly involves these people and rush mainly appears because of congested street,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-distancing-missing-at-ludhiana-s-wholesale-medicine-market/story-V5c6BzPgCCSCGoNH5Y4nlN.html

So, it is requested that blood donation camps may be organised on campus... in association with the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32.”The move comes as city-based government hospitals are left with only a week or 10 days’ worth of blood stock.GMCH director principal Dr BS Chavan said, “Yesterday, we had only 200 units of blood left. Our daily requirement is of 25-30 units, which means, we are left with hardly one week’s worth of stock.”At the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), around 40 people donate blood every day, 30 of whom are voluntary donors. Currently, the demand has reduced to about 80 units (blood and blood components), while the collection has come down to 100-150 units. The hospital staff and NGO workers have been making hundreds of calls every day to those in the list of volunteer blood donors and organisations. PU CONSTITUTES PANEL Meanwhile, PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar has constituted a 15-member panel to coordinate for the blood donation. The panel includes dean university instructions (DUI) Shankar Ji Jha and dean students welfare (DSW) Emanual Nahar, and Dr Keshav Malhotra.The committee has been in constant touch with the blood banks of GMCH, PGIMER, Government Multi Speciality Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, and Rotary and Blood Bank Society Resource Centre, Sector 37, where university students and employees can donate blood.PU Campus Students Council (PUCSC) president Chetan Chaudhary, who is also a member of the panel, has requested all the students of the university to come forward and donate blood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-asks-pu-to-pitch-in-with-blood-donation/story-hrOOCs0AMOEF8ajeFaW2rM.html

The hospital’s move comes after the Union labour ministry’s March 30 notification that had relaxed the rules of PF withdrawal to help people in financial distress amid the pandemic.Exempted PF establishments are the ones that have exemptions of filing employees’ provident fund (EPF) returns with the Employees Provident Fund and Organisation (EPFO) and manage their workers’ PF accounts as well as funds.‘28 ADVANCE WITHDRAWAL CLAIM REQUESTS SETTLED’CMCH finance manager Amit Aggarwal said that so far, the establishment has settled all the 28 advance withdrawal claim requests they had received from their employees. “Since the government’s notification, we have received around 28 claim requests from our staff, including nurses, lab technicians and doctors. We are settling all the withdrawal claims of Covid-19 within 24 hours of requests,” he said.On Monday, the EPFO head office had shared that till date, the private PF trusts across the country have disbursed a total of Rs 481.63 crore to their employees as the Covid-19 advance claim. “It is heartening to see that CMCH, the only exempted establishment covered under the jurisdiction of Ludhiana regional office, rose to the occasion and extended benefits to its employees in a timely manner,” said EPFO regional commissioner Dheeraj Gupta.

21-04-2020||Mumbai||Schools come up with safety guidelines to follow once lockdown ends||In order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of students once schools open, a group of educationists from the country have come up with a list of suggestions and recommendations that schools could adhere to once the lockdown ends. Drafted by SLN Global Network, a group which consists of school heads, academicians and education experts, the suggestions include measures to be taken before and after schools reopen. In addition to basic precautions like sanitisation of the school campus, temperature checks of staff and avoiding outside visitors in schools, the document also lists out recommendations on classroom functioning. Some of the suggested measures include having one student per bench with six feet distance between two students, rotational online and offline classes for students and splitting the class into two and conducting double shifts to ensure that all students don’t have to come at the same time. The document also suggests the formation of a core committee consisting of the school heads and medical professionals to conduct safety audits of campuses, recommend home quarantine for students if required and to prepare for any kind of health emergencies. “The anxiety level among the parents post the Covid-19 Lockdown might remain high until a vaccine is found. Hence schools have to start incorporating changes in their campus and innovate structures which enable them to function with a blended learning education model (school + online+ home) if they wish to retain the trust of parents when it comes to being a safe campus. These conversations have started taking place elsewhere in the world and in India, we wanted to initiate them. These are suggestions, not guidelines, as context will vary from school to school,” said Francis Joseph,co-founder, SLN Global Network. With the lockdown being postponed until May 3, most CBSE and ICSE schools have already started their new academic years online while children from the state board are also being sent online study material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-come-up-with-safety-guidelines-to-follow-once-lockdown-ends/story-UFwPgEcArKrjMx07qywFrJ.html

We are keeping our systems up to the mark so that transactions and data update continue without issues,” said Verma. Verma, who is going to the regional office of EPFO in Shyam Nagar on a rotational basis with others, said the entire department staff members are working hard and more intensely than normal days. “Since the government has relaxed norms for making advance PF deposits and withdrawals, we are settling more claims than we did on normal days. The office is settling claims within 24 hours. Since, we represent a region that employs a large number of workers, each of us is making extra effort to resolve grievances and disburse the claims without delay,” he said. “We are also working under many health and family pressures. Stepping out of home during this time of pandemic is also scary and risky, especially for me. I was diagnosed with aplastic anemia in 2014, the treatment of which includes medicines to suppress one’s immune system. After that, the doctor advised me to take all preventive measures throughout my life. People with low immunity like me are more at risk of coronavirus, so I have been taking all the necessary precautions to protect myself while on duty,” he said. Verma’s wife Prembala is also an employee in the PF office.They have two children Sachita, 13, and Arnav, 10. The family likes to watch Ramayana and Mahabharata, that made a comeback on the national television last month. “While my kids are fond of cartoons, Ramayana and Mahabharata have been our all-time favorite,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-in-the-times-of-pandemic-epfo-has-taken-special-measures-to-resolve-grievances-during-lockdown/story-0HvOsvq7PWxF11XD2IhU6K.html

The UGC’s recent notice banning self-plagiarism is yet another part of its initiative to restrict academic piracy. According to the regulatory body, text-recycling of self-plagiarism can be in the form ofrepublishing the same paper already published elsewhere without due and full citation or even publishing smaller or excerpted work from a longer and previous work in order to show a larger number of publications. Reusing data already used in a published work, or communicated for publication, in another work will not be accepted. Researchers can neither publish smaller parts of a longer study as new work nor paraphrase their own previously published work. To be able to do any of these, they must give full citation of their published work, said the UGC adding that self-citations will not add to the researcher’s citation index or h-index in global academia.The UGC has directed university authorities involved in academic performance evaluation andassessment to be on the lookout for self-plagiarism while deciding promotions, selections, credit allotment and award of research degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/self-plagiarism-will-not-be-accepted-in-any-new-research-work-ugc/story-eu69P3XW2SksEn9VG50Z3N.html
21-04-2020||Mumbai||CET announces online admissions for medical and dental courses||To avoid delay in admissions to post-graduate medical and dental courses due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the state common entrance test (CET) cell has started online admissions. In a circular released on Monday, the CET cell requested state medical and dental institutes to share contact details of staff handling admissions and make arrangements for an online payment portal, so that students can pay the fees and confirm admissions once the seat allotment list is released on April 24. “While otherwise, a candidate would report physically to pay fees and confirm his/her seat, right now we’ve given students two options. In case of heavy lockdown due to Covid-19 in their area, one can visit the institute’s website to complete seat confirmation whereas if they are from parts of the state where lockdown status is lenient, they can physically visit the institute for the same purpose,” read the circular. The medical admissions process is otherwise divided between pre and post announcement of the seat allocation list. While the forms and preferences are filled online, candidates’ documents are verified individually by the state CET cell. Once the list is announced, students are expected to physically visit the college with required documents and pay the fees. Due to the lockdown, this entire process will now be done online. The CET cell has also requested institutes to go lenient on students given the outbreak. “Colleges are advised to sympathetically deal with admissions and only essential documents as per the information brochure should be demanded from candidates. In the event of candidates getting upgraded institutes in the consequent rounds or cancellation of admission, the fees deposited by them should be refunded within two working days,” adds the circular.While results for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-post graduate (NEET-PG) was announced in February, the admission process was delayed due to the lockdown. While currently there is little clarity over the lockdown period, officials said they can’t delay the admission process any further. “Candidates finished filling preferences online and the three rounds of common admissions too can be conducted online. Once this process is over, we will wait for the higher authorities to decide when to start the new academic year,” said a senior CET official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cet-announces-online-admissions-for-medical-and-dental-courses/story-r6v0sB0IM6tCIDjkeOAmDK.html

Our other role is going to the wards and taking rounds of the wards where the patients have been admitted. Thus, we have the dual role of examining patients in the OPD (out patients department) and taking rounds of the wards.How does your day begin and roll out?I wake up at 6 am and carry out my regular exercise for about an hour, take hot water bath and eat light breakfast and reach the hospital for duty. At 1 pm, I have my lunch which is provided by the hospital and before leaving the hospital in the evening, I sanitize myself with a spray which has been prepared by the hospital. On reaching home, I directly go to the bathroom to take hot water bath and after that take rest. The clothes I wear are put in hot water as the virus does not survive at 30 degrees Celsius. What precautions are you taking?I start my day with my mask on my face. After reaching the hospital, I am provided with head-cap, gloves, apron and goggles when I am in the OPD and taking the round in the patient wards. Now and then, we clean our hands with sanitisers. I see to it that the patient is seated at a distance of one metre from me and have masks on their face. I also ensure that they don’t touch the case papers, tables, chair. After examining each of the patients, we sanitise our hands. We see to it that we don’t touch our eyes, face, nose and ears so to avoid getting infected. We take the highest precautions and observe all the safety guidelines while dealing with the patients.What is your assessment of the Covid-19 crisis in Pune? How is it unfolding?My assessment as far as Naidu Hospital is concerned is that the virus strain is mild in nature and if precautions like social distancing and staying at home is taken, then we can overcome this crisis. Clusters where infections are rampant have been identified and concentrated effort must be taken in those clusters. We must ensure that each and every person belonging such clusters is sanitised. In line with what Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has appealed to the countrymen to stay indoors, we should all stay inside our houses to overcome the Covid-19 COVID crisis. What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?No such gaps, but the police department has to be alert because we see soon many people coming out and secondly, most importantly, a team of psychiatrists should be formed to take on the after-effects of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-this-virus-strain-appears-to-be-mild-in-nature-says-dr-arvind-parmar-rmo-naidu-hospital/story-gvkZew5S6uVxEuqOAdONyO.html

Following this, parts of Sector 30 and Dadumajra have been sealed and some RWAs are making individual efforts to seal their localities. Adviser to UT administrator, Manoj Parida, also reached out to mayor Raj Bala Malik on Tuesday to rope in all local area councillors to help residents seal their sectors. On Monday, Badnore had asked authorities and local organisations to identify and seal localites that were contaminated, to contain the epidemic.Sector 30, where four positive cases have been detected, was sealed by the efforts of local area councillor Devinder Singh Babla. Speaking to HT, Babla said, “Police have sealed the EWS colony area. Residents cannot leave this area even during curfew relaxation hours.” On Tuesday a CTU bus delivered fruits and vegetables to Sector 30 residents. For the task, vendors wore PPE kits and used wooden sticks to enforce social distancing.As government offices opened from Monday, many societies in Sector 13 have also restricted entry by keeping only one entrance open. KL Sachdeva, secretary of Modern Housing Complex (duplex) resident welfare association (RWA), said, “After a meeting with Manimajra station house officer (SHO) , we closed gate number 4 and 5. Only gate number 3 is open. However, we have written to the SHO to seal gate number 4 with barricades till the curfew is in effect.”Residents of Sector 38 West have also sealed parts of their localities. As per Pankaj Gupta, RWA president here, they have kept only one exit point open which is monitored 24/7 by guards. “Nobody can enter without a movement pass. Vendors have been given RWA identity cards without which they cant enter.”Entry to apartment societies in southern sectors is strictly banned and all their gates are closed. Vice president of Sector 49 RWA, Jatinder Mehta, who lives in the Chandigarh Housing Board society here, said, “With help from the police, we have barricaded entry points and kept only one gate open. Previously, many unauthorised vendors were coming here from Punjab side but now no one can enter without a valid pass.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/on-badnore-s-call-rwas-councillors-help-seal-high-risk-localities/story-yOXj120iISFNCErSmynyJJ.html

21-04-2020||Lucknow||What led to change in plan for relaxation of lockdown||CRUCIAL FACTORS Spurt in corona cases, lax enforcement of lockdown and attacks on medical teams prompted govt to do a rethink A lot changed between two Sundays and that was enough to throw a spanner in the Uttar Pradesh government’s plans to relax the Covid-19 lockdown for a partial resumption of economic activities from Monday.On Sunday, April 12, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath held two meetings and spoke about lockdown relaxations.He said the state would look forward to initiating partial relaxation in the lockdown to support economic activities. These meetings were held with cabinet members and the Covid-19 management Team-11.At that time, the chief minister had been highlighting that Uttar Pradesh was doing far better than other states on Covid-19 containment, despite being the most populous state.Initially, the date for partial relaxation was April 15, the end of the first phase of the lockdown, but then it was extended to April 20.But, things were not looking up by Friday, April 17, when the chief minister held a meeting with district magistrates and district police chiefs.The chief minister expressed displeasure over violation of the lockdown, rising number of Tablighi Jamaat related Covid-19 infections, and an overall rise in positive cases.He got his feedback on the situation from the state intelligence wing, Covid control rooms and CCTV footage. The next day, additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi sent a letter to all the district magistrates and the district police chiefs, noting that the performance of 40 of the 75 districts was ‘unsatisfactory’ in adherence to the lockdown.All the high Covid-19 incidence districts fell in this category-- Agra, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Lucknow, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Kanpur. The letter had set the tone for the state to rethink the proposed relaxations in lockdown.The primary criteria on which the districts’ performance was gauged were: high number of Covid-19 cases, high number of Tablighi Jamaat members, attacks on police and healthcare providers.The number of positive cases rose drastically in several districts between the two Sundays. For instance, Agra had 104 cases on April 12 and the number rose to 240 by April 19. Lucknow’s case count jumped from 32 to 165, Gautam Buddha Nagar’s from 64 to 95; Ghaziabad’s from 27 to 41, Meerut’s from 51 to 74 and Saharanpur’s from 28 to 72. The number of total positive cases in the state shot up from 483 to 1,100.The death toll went up from five on April 12 to 17 on April 19, according to state health department figures.Additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said: “The idea behind the communication to the districts was to make the underperforming districts get their act together, go intensive in the containment of Covid-19 and wage a war against the virus to eradicate it from Uttar Pradesh.”Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday (April 19) night made it clear to district magistrates that there would be no easing of the lockdown in hotspots and asked the principal secretary, health, not to open 19 sensitive districts, which have reported 10 or more coronavirus cases each. Issuing these instructions at separate meetings, he empowered district magistrates to take a call on lockdown relaxations. He underscored that DMs of 19 sensitive districts should decide on the basis of ‘awareness and alertness’ after intimating the government.All the district magistrates announced the status quo on the lockdown and continued the restrictions as they were.On Monday evening, the additional chief secretary announced: “The state now has 322 hotspots.”HOW CASES JUMPED IN SEVEN DAYSThe number of positive cases rose drastically in several districts between the two Sundays. For instance, Agra had 104 cases on April 12 and the number rose to 240 by April 19. Lucknow’s case count jumped from 32 to 165 during the same period, Gautam Buddha Nagar from 64 to 95; Ghaziabad from 27 to 41; Meerut from 51 to 74 and Saharanpur from 28 to 72. The number of total positive cases in the state rose drastically--from 483 to 1,100.The death toll went up from five on April 12 to 17 on April 19, according to state health department figures.40 UNSATISFACTORY LOCKDOWN DISTRICTSMeerut, Baghpat, Hapur, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahar, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Agra, Mathura, Firozabad, Mainpuri, Bareilly, Badaun, Moradabad, Bijnor, Rampur, Amroha, Sambhal, Lucknow, Kheri, Rae Bareli, Sitapur, Barabanki, Sultanpur, Kanpur City, Kanpur Dehat, Kannauj, Jalaun, Prayagraj, Pratapgarh, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Kushinagar, Basti, Gonda, Bahraich and Balrampur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/what-led-to-change-in-plan-for-relaxation-of-lockdown/story-N3RWuXSbDDUJ1FDg8mP9aO.html
21-04-2020||City||CITU, CPI(M) demand food and shelter for labourers in Himachal||The Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) on Tuesday staged a silent protest in the state and demanded financial assistance worth ₹7500, shelter and ration for labourers. They also demanded that the government stop retrenchment of media, information iechnology (IT) and industrial workers. CITU state president Vijendra Mehra said the state and central government had failed to protect the daily wage workers and labourers during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Mehra alleged that most of the industries in the state had not paid wages to contract labourers since March 22. He said that the workers who used to receive ₹ 10,500 as salary were only paid ₹2,000 at the Shimla Municipal Corporation’s Solid Waste Management Plant in Tutu. There are many industrial workers who have not received salary since the announcement of lockdown. This is in violation of Central government’s directions of March 20 and 29, according to which workers should get their wages and salaries without any deductions, Mehra said.CITU has warned the Union and state government that they will intensify the protest if their demands are not fulfilled.Apart from this, Communist Party of India ( Marxist) leader and Theog’s Legislator Rakesh Singha, Himachal Pradesh Kisan Sabha President Kuldeep Tanwar and Former Mayor Sanjay Chauhan staged a sit in protest outside SDM office demanding food and shelter for labourers.‘SINGHA THREATENING OFFICIALS’Meanwhile, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers have condemned CPI(M) protest and have accused Rakesh Singha of threatening government officials.State BJP spokesperson Shashi Dutt said that at a time when government officials are serving the people by putting their lives on the line, CPI(M) leaders are trying to gain political leverage by misbehaving and threatening government officials instead of helping people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/citu-cpi-m-demand-food-and-shelter-for-labourers-in-himachal/story-ovqiBT7TIw57vmMFdM9dwN.html

21-04-2020||Mumbai||IL&FS Fraud: HC quashes criminal proceedings against two key auditor firms||In a major relief to auditor firms BSR & Associates, a KPMG affiliate, and Deloitte Haskins, which is accused of conniving in the IL&FS subsidiary IFIN financial fraud case, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday quashed criminal proceedings against the audit firms in the special court. However, the court did not stay the proceedings in the NCLT. After pronouncing the order on the request of the Central government, HC stayed its order for eight weeks to allow the investigating agency to challenge the order before the Supreme Court. The court, however, specified that interim protection of the auditor firms from coercive action would continue.A division bench of chief justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and justice Nitin Borkar who conducted proceedings through video conferencing on Tuesday held that the firms could not be prosecuted by the special court as they had already resigned as auditors of IL&FS before the alleged fraud came to light. The counsel for BSR also argued that the criminal proceedings against them were initiated a day after Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) had filed a 32,000 interim report and hence, it was not possible for the government to arrive at a conclusion within such a short span and initiate criminal action against them.The SFIO had, however, argued the report was final and not an interim report as being portrayed by the audit firms. The Central government had submitted that the report was being labelled as interim as investigations were on against 79 firms, however, the action against the two firms was based on investigations which pointed to their role in the fraud.The operative part of the order upheld the firms’ contentions about the criminal proceedings being invalid and set aside the trial against the two auditor firms. The bench justified its decision stating that while section 140 (5) of the Companies Act was constitutionally valid, it could not be applied to firms that had resigned. The bench, however, did not pass orders on the other plea by the firms to set aside the five-year ban imposed on them by NCLT.After the order was pronounced, the bench stayed its order for eight weeks and said the interim protection against any coercive action against the firms granted in September 2019 would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/il-fs-fraud-hc-quashes-criminal-proceedings-against-two-key-auditor-firms/story-g3iCmHAqprY28AhC7sxdzK.html

The ACB has booked Marathe along with several others for fabricating records and twisting facts to extend undue benefits to the developer, M/s KS Chamankar Enterprises.Marathe was accused of suppressing actual floor space index (FSI) available to the developer and instead showed a lesser FSI, thus causing loss to the government.However, Marathe’s counsel argued that all the documents relied on as proof showed that he opposed the proposal submitted by M/s Chamankar. His counsel further submitted that despite his opposition, elected office bearers like the then deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal went ahead with the project and as such, the petitioner cannot be blamed in the matter.Besides, Marathe’s counsel claimed that the proposal was finalised in August 2006, two months after his client had retired from service.The contentions, however, failed to impress upon the bench and it rejected the petition, saying that there was enough material to try Marathe for the offences charged and the material cannot be examined pre-trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/andheri-rto-plot-scam-hc-refuses-to-quash-fir-against-former-pwd-secy/story-ngRvk8OIZ6JupaO4CIOqhM.html

I thank all these villages for their grand gesture. I hope other panchayats and people will too come forward to make contributions towards the state corona fund,” DC added.After making the highest donation among all the villages in the district, Badsa sarpanch Naresh Devi said that their primary goal is to help the government in all the ways to defeat the deadly virus.“The government has given everything to our village, including extension of AIIMS campus and a school. Our main aim is to save lives from the pandemic. The health department officials have been doing door-to-door screening in our village after so many Jamaat attendees tested positive in huge numbers. Despite this, neither our village nor the district has reported a single case of coronavirus. We stand by the government, administration and Covid-19 warriors,” she added.The sarpanch said the volunteers of her village have been providing food and other essential items to policemen, who are deployed outside the AIIMS extension campus and the outskirts.When asked about the steps taken by her to combat the virus, Devi said they had stopped supplying hand pump water and only clean tanker supply was being provided to the villagers.Acting sarpanch of Kheri Jasaur, Deepak Kumar, said that the village panches and residents unanimously extended their support to donate ₹51 lakh to the state corona relief fund.“We want to ensure that the government receives the financial aid it needs to combat the disease.

The monthly get-togethers have now become virtual, mastering the art of socialising while social distancing.A 52-year-old resident of Civil Lines, Sushma Kapoor, and her gang believe that fighting self-isolation can be gloomy, but social distancing doesn’t mean disconnecting. Kapoor says, “In the beginning of the month, we were weighing the options, and rescheduled the kitty twice due to the scare of coronavirus. Then my son suggested that we could still host it online.” So, Kapoor downloaded a video conferencing app and asked her social circle to do the same.To this, another kitty group member, Sapna Seth, a 43-year-old Delhi based entrepreneur, adds, “When my meetings can go online, why not my kitties?” Seth also feels that, in such testing times, all you need to do is stay connected with your close ones, and this is the best way to utilise technology.Her group has also downloaded a mobile app to play Tambola or Housie on phones, for entertainment within the group, and are using various modes of online money transfer for the kitty amount.Dress codes and themes ensure that the participants enjoy these virtual parties with the same excitement. Deepa Goyal, a college professor, shares, “For this month’s spring theme, we wore floral prints and pastel hues on the conference call.” She adds, “Even though we were eating in our own homes, some of us managed to prepare the same dishes.

21-04-2020||Pune||On the frontline: We clean public toilets thrice a day with jetting machines, chemicals, says PMC sanitation inspector||Sanitation inspector Inamdar Imamuddin Sirajuddin also known as Baba Inamdar has been working in the Pune Municipal Corporations’s (PMC) solid waste management department for 30 years. Armed with a BA, LLB diploma in labour law and labour welfare, and a diploma in information technology with a post graduate diploma in human rights studies, Inamdar is proud of his work. He was awarded a prize in population Census silver medal 2001 from APJ Abdul Kalam for his work in Pune. He speaks to HT about how maintaining hygiene in the city will help curb the virus.What exactly is your role in the crisis?My job is to oversee garbage collection, waste segregation, cleaning of public toilets. In addition to this, I conduct door-to-door surveys to help identify persons with flu-like symptoms. I visit houses to collect medical waste, such as used masks, which are collected separately and disposed in the incinerator. My job also involves motivating the staff, training them to maintain social distance, making a list of positive patients and as directed by the doctors, to shift them to hospitals for checking. I also look after the cremation process of Covid-19 patients. I have helped in the cremation of six bodies as no one was ready to take responsibility. Now we have formed a team for handling cremations.How does your day begin and roll out?I leave my house at 6.30 am and start coordinating with my team once I reach office. I also exercise in my office and walk as much as I can. I coordinate the movement of garbage trucks which include ghanta gadi, small vans, and bulk carriers. I also need to check on the drivers, staff coming for collection.At 8 am, I deal with the teams who visit positive patients’ homes and areas. I also help out with the team that does house-to-house survey at micro level. Then I go to the hospitals. In my rounds during the day, I visit schools in Ghole road which is under my jurisdiction to check upon the labourers and to clean the place. We clean public toilets in the city thrice a day with jetting machines using chemicals. I work until 7pm.What precautions are you taking?I don’t eat anything outside; I wear mask regularly, use sanitiser and soap. As a supervisor I must follow all the rules so that my team will follow them too.What is your assessment of the covid crisis n Pune? How is it unfolding?PMC is doing a good job by making sure that residents follow lockdown norms. We all must act responsibly to win war against Covid-19 and ensure social distancing in public places.What gaps do you see in healthcare and relief work?We are all working together as a team. The only problem we face is that patients hide their history which makes puts us in a dangerous situation. I appeal to patients that if they have the symptoms then they must be open about their travel history.It is also noticed that if one person in the slums is found positive, the other positive people tend to run away, then with the help of the police and ambulance, we have to find them and send them to the hospital. This makes our work difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/on-the-frontline-we-clean-public-toilets-thrice-a-day-with-jetting-machines-chemicals-says-pmc-sanitation-inspector/story-MvXmNm7AfZuDxAhjFDBoYP.html

So, when someone comes with the coronavirus symptoms, she has to treat them,” Jeev, a four-time European Tour champion, told PTI.“She checks the patients, stabilises them, performs intubation (insertion of artificial ventilation tube into a patient) before they are sent to special wards to quarantine the Covid-19 patients,” he added.PATIALA MEDICAL COLLEGE ALUMNA GETS CALL FROM HOME EVERY DAY54-year-old Mona passed out of Patiala Medical College before moving to the US in the ’90s. She has been working there for more than 20 years.“I am so proud of her. She says it is like running a marathon every day. She has been working five days a week, sometimes day shifts, sometimes night shifts, 12-hour shifts and it is tough but she has to do the job as best as she can.” Her 48-year-old brother from Chandigarh said the job is a stressful one and sometimes he feels scared for her.“I feel worried. When you are treating people, anything can happen, so we talk to her everyday. My mom and dad also keep checking on her.“We keep asking how she is feeling and if there are any symptoms. I tell her to stay positive and boost her immune system,” said Jeev, also a five-time Asian Tour winner.‘BE RESPECTFUL TO FRONTLINE WORKERS’New York has reported nearly 250,000 confirmed cases and over 18,000 fatalities, forcing the government to extend its lockdown till May 15 to contain the fast-spreading disease.However, the lockdown is also giving rise to a lot of mental health issues among people, who also need equal attention.“With New York in partial lockdown, she gets a lot of patients who are suffering from depression as they are not used to staying at home,” Jeev elaborated.“There are people who come with bullet wounds, people who are having anxiety attacks, youngsters with drug overdose or old people getting heart attacks, basically any kind of emergency, she has to treat them all,” he said.The Chandigarh-based golfer also called for greater respect for the frontline workers, who have been attacked in India while performing their duties.“It is my humble request to every citizen of the world to respect the frontline workers because they are there to help us, whether it is the doctors, police, people who pick up garbage ... we must be respectful, kind and grateful to them and make sure they are taken care of,” he said.The dreaded virus has infected more than 20 lakh people across the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/milkha-singh-s-daughter-fights-covid-19-pandemic-from-the-frontline-in-new-york-hospital/story-OeSMhbOQCWGTGJk131Y1SK.html

21-04-2020||Kolkata||‘Anti-federal campaign’: Trinamool on Centre’s Covid-19 team in Bengal||Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha leader and national spokesperson Derek O’Brien alleged on Tuesday that while the states in India were fighting a battle against novel coronavirus, the Narendra Modi-led Central government was fighting some states instead of fighting the virus.“About 70%-80% of the districts chosen for the Central teams’ visits are from states ruled by opposition parties. Why no district from Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat is part of the list?” O’Brien asked.“All states are fighting corona but we are sad to note that the Centre is fighting a battle against some states,” O’Brien said. The MP termed the sending of central teams to the state without consulting the state government in advance as an “anti-federal campaign.”Two inter-ministerial teams from the union government landed in Kolkata on Monday to visit seven districts to inquire into issues regarding proper implementation of the lockdown and moves taken by the health administration. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday had strongly objected to this visit, terming the Centre’s decision as ‘unilateral’ and ‘undesirable’.On Tuesday, while addressing the media, O’Brien and the party’s Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay accused the Centre of playing politics during a national crisis.“The centre needs to explain on what basis the seven districts were chosen,” Bandyopadhyay said, adding that the number of testing in the state had increased to 400 tests per day on an average and that it would increase to 600 per day Tuesday onwards. Taking digs at the Centre, O’Brien said, “We, despite our political differences with those governing Kerala, have no hesitation in acknowledging that Kerala has done a lot of good things just like Bengal has done too. Of course, there is scope for improvement in Bengal. But we restrained ourselves from criticising the Centre. We raised the issue on March 5 and 6 in Parliament. “When we washed our hands or wore marks in the Parliament, it was called a gimmick. We did not ask why the Centre woke up late because our chairperson asked us to refrain from indulging in politics at this hour.” Of the two central teams, the one for four south Bengal districts is supposed to visit North 24-Parganas on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/why-not-uttar-pradesh-or-gujarat-trinamool-on-covid-19-team-in-bengal/story-IruF5KdFP8A9usMpDYbYfO.html

The PSGPC has already issued a statement that the domes have been repaired and affixed at their places. So, this is not an issue at all.”Five domes on the roof of the entrance to the newly built congregation hall in the complex of the gurdwara, the last resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak, were damaged after they fell down on Friday night due to high velocity winds. Bhai Gobind Singh, the granthi of the gurdwara, said the domes are made of fibreglass and were re-affixed after repair on Sunday.India had officially taken up the issue after Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa raised this issue with the government.A long-pending demand of the Indian Sikh community was fulfilled when the 4-km-long corridor was opened on November 9 last year from Dera Baba Nanak, a border town, to Kartarpur gurdwara. This is a visa-free access to the historic gurdwara for Indian devotees. However, the corridor is closed due to the Covid-19 outbreak at present.‘CHANGE LIFESTYLE TO FIGHT CORONA’On the national lockdown to fight the coronavirus outbreak, Giani Harpreet Singh, who heads the highest Sikh temporal seat, said, “The government has imposed a lockdown, which is good, but it alone is not a permanent solution to the coronavirus problem. For a permanent solution, we need to change our lifestyle and improve our eating habits. Junk junk food and revive desi (local) dishes. Farmers of Punjab should opt for organic farming and discard chemical spray because of the health hazards. Besides, we have to remove the fear of this disease from our minds.”‘SET ASIDE POLITICS, HELP NEEDY’On the lack of arrangements for the needy, he said, “The Centre’s responsibility is bigger in this unprecedented situation. It must fund the state governments, so that they can help the needy. However, such relief activities should not be politicised, because everyone, whether he’s a Congressman, Akali or Communist, turns hungry and everybody needs essential items.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/damage-to-domes-at-kartarpur-gurdwara-in-pakistan-is-not-an-issue-says-akal-takht-jathedar/story-my0QidQqMMnzmzypFuDXHK.html

It was a complicated surgery as the hand was chopped off. For functional success, it will require 4-5 months as physiotherapy is needed,” PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said.According to the doctors treating the injured policeman, the reattached part has survived and circulation has been established which is good sign. In the next step, combined efforts from doctors and the patient are required for restoring the functionality. “Blood saturation in his fingers (reattached part) is equal to the normal blood saturation value by which we can say that the muscularity (blood flow in the hand) has been established. It is a big relief. He will be discharged within 10 days if all goes well,” Dr RK Sharma, head of the plastic surgery department at PGIMER, said.The policeman’s hand was chopped off, and a few others were injured when a group of nihangs allegedly attacked them at a vegetable market in Patiala district on April 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cop-whose-hand-was-cut-off-in-patiala-on-road-to-recovery-will-need-five-months-of-physiotherapy/story-wll8hOxaRnL1zlai9aHpDP.html

She was confined to bed with 30 surgical staples near her thigh.Doctor who operated on her had advised her to visit hospital on April 13 to get the stitches removed. However, her ill health, vulnerability to Covid-19 exposure and movement restrictions due to lockdown prevented her from taking the risk of going to hospital.Advised by an acquaintance, the distressed septuagenarian called up CRPF 131 battalion, Patna, seeking medical assistance.“On April 18, the CRPF control team received a call from the old woman who narrated her ordeal to them”, said a CRPF official.Moved by Eapen’s plea, commandant D P Bhardwaj instructed the CRPF team to reach her at the earliest for help.Dr Vivekanand, senior medical officer associated with 131 battalion, reached Eapen’s residence with medical kit and equipment.He said “After brief medical examination, her staples were removed under aseptic condition followed by wound dressing. Now there is no possibility of infection. She has been counselled for taking proper care of wound. I hope she will get healed and would be able to walk in a couple of weeks. Our team also helped her to download and use Aarogya Setu mobile application.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/son-abroad-79-yr-old-woman-in-patna-gets-crpf-aid-during-lockdown/story-boi4Kclo125fyrgeLmHGTM.html

21-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body will not use drones to disinfect coronavirus containment zones||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has said that it will not use drones to disinfect containment zones in the city and has termed the process “useless.”Last week a citizen had suggested the BMC to use drones to disinfect those containment zones which were inaccessible, said BMC insecticide officer Rajan Naringrekar.“After a discussion with experts on the feasibility, we realised that drones are ineffective in cleansing major touch points which have been identified across the containment clusters,” said Naringrekar.Currently, there are more than 720 containment zones across Mumbai, with the maximum ones at Worli, Prabhadevi, Byculla, Girgaum, Mazagaon and Tardeo.The insecticide department had identified five main touch points that citizens in containment zones need to be aware about to control community transmission. These touch points include common toilets, stair handles or railings connecting two or three-storied structures, parapets connecting one settlement to the other, sitting areas such as concrete platforms outside slum structures and door handles. “Drones are not in a position to treat these touch points. It will release the disinfectant on rooftops or surfaces where the virus is not present, rendering the activity completely useless,” said Naringrekar.These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are currently being used by the Mumbai Police to monitor the movement of citizens during the lockdown and make announcements in densely-populated containment areas where traversing by foot is difficult, he added. “Also, large network of cables in these zones will hinder spraying disinfectants,” said Naringrekar. Meanwhile, the confusion over the usage of disinfection chambers continues to prevail among state bodies despite the Centre’s advisory against its usage.While spraying disinfectants has been recommended for cleaning purposes, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued an advisory on Saturday that spraying disinfectants or using tunnels on individuals or groups “was not recommended under any circumstances as it is physically and psychologically harmful”. “Even if a person is potentially exposed with the Covid-19 virus, spraying the external part of the body does not kill the virus that has entered the body. Also there is no scientific evidence to suggest that they are effective even in disinfecting the outer clothing,” the advisory read. But in Maharashtra, disinfection tunnels have been installed across the state and the government plans to install more such chambers across market places, government buildings and railways stations. “This is an unscientific process, which can lead to severe skin problems as well health effects, if the sodium hypochlorite solution in the tunnel is inhaled in large quantity. It is best to be avoided,” said Dr Jerryl Banait, dermatologist and Supreme Court petitioner in Covid-19 matters.However, the BMC has clarified that it will not be using disinfection chambers. Naringrekar said BMC will continue not to use disinfection chambers. “It gives a false impression that a person is cleaned and they will neglect the use of sanitisers or hand washing,” he said.Union health ministry’s advisory•Spraying chemical disinfectants on individuals or groups is not recommended under any circumstances as it is physically and psychologically harmful•Even if a person is potentially exposed with the Covid-19 virus, spraying on the external part of the body does not kill the virus that has entered the body•Spraying chlorine on individuals can lead to irritation of eyes and skin and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting•Inhalation of sodium hypochlorite can lead to irritation of mucous membranes to the nose, throat and respiratory tract•Use of such measures may lead to a false sense of disinfection, safety and hamper public observance to hand washing and social distancing measures||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-will-not-use-drones-to-disinfect-coronavirus-containment-zones/story-ZZjYKXx2EUpwTRTa27BXVN.html
21-04-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government awaits experts’ nod to initiate rapid testing process for coronavirus||Even as some states have already started conducting rapid diagnostic tests to detect the presence of Covid-19 antibodies in patients, the Maharashtra government is yet to take a decision on the issue. Maharashtra has received the approval to acquire the rapid testing kits (RTKs) from the Centre. But the state said that it is in consultation with experts on the issue and will apply for the procurement process only after a policy is formulated on it. The presence of antibodies could indicate if a person is infected. The central government had procured 5.5 lakh RTKs from China for antibiotic diagnosis among suspected Covid-19 patients. While Jammu and Kashmir has received the kits, Delhi has started testing on Monday.“We are yet to decide if it is a good idea to use the diagnosis, as several experts have said that these tests lead to false reporting of positive cases. This testing is not scientifically proven and needs more research. So we will wait until our expert panel decides on it. Many European countries have stopped this procedure due to loopholes in the tests. It is better to be cautious instead of rushing under pressure,” said Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (family welfare) and director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra. When a person contracts Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, the body develops antibodies as a defence. In the first week, IgM antibodies are produced and gradually, IgG antibodies start growing, which remain in the body for almost a month. With the help of these two types of antibodies, it can be found if a person is infected or was infected at some point of a time. However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), in some cases, antibodies are not produced in the bodies of patients carrying the Covid-19 pathogens. Thus the world health body issued an advisory stating, “WHO doesn’t currently recommend the use of antigen-rapid diagnostic tests for patient care.”However according to experts, rapid diagnostic tests have been fruitful for community-based testing as it takes only 15 minutes to get the result of the analysis. This can be helpful for a state like Maharashtra where 65% of the patients have been diagnosed as asymptomatic. “Rapid diagnosis may provide a false report as sometimes antibodies don’t produce in the body within a certain window period. But in the case of analysis of a larger community, it can be helpful to understand the presence of the virus through IgM and IgG antibodies,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital. “It is not perfect science but can be helpful for a population with higher asymptomatic patients,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-awaits-experts-nod-to-initiate-rapid-testing-process-for-coronavirus/story-xN5dEjpJBvvFyeujG5MVEK.html

21-04-2020||Mumbai||Maha virus case count goes up to 4,666; death toll rises to 232||Maharashtra’s coronavirus case count on Monday went up to 4,666 with the addition of 466 patients — the second-highest single-day jump after Sunday’s 552 cases.On the day the nationwide lockdown was partially relaxed across the state, Mumbai crossed the 3,000-case mark as 308 more people tested positive, taking the city’s count to 3,032.The death toll of the state touched 232 as nine deaths were recorded on Monday. Of them, seven are in Mumbai, taking the city’s toll to 139, and two in Malegaon.The state health minister Rajesh Tope said there was no need to be afraid as although the number is rising, there is improvement in the situation. “The doubling rate of the state has now reached seven days, up from two days. We are trying to increase it even further,” Tope said. He said the state is conducting maximum tests across the country. ”So far, we have conducted 76,000 tests in the state and in Mumbai alone, 50,000 tests were conducted. We are also doing surveillance and contract tracing aggressively,” he added.Monday was the 17th consecutive day the number of new cases in the state was in three digits. A total of 4,181 cases were reported in April alone, after the first coronavirus disease (Covid-19) case in the state was reported on March 9. The mortality rate of the state has significantly dropped to 5.30% (223 till Sunday) from 7.41% (148 last Monday [April 13]).However, it continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.14% till Sunday, revealed data from the state medical education department.Meanwhile, three new districts — Parbhani, Nandurbar and Chandrapur — reported its first cases in the past few days. Chandrapur has two and Parbhani and Nandurbar one case each. After this, only four districts — Nanded, Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli — do not have a single case, as of now.“The number is still not very alarming, except that of Mumbai. All the other areas are quite under control. In Mumbai, it is limited to certain areas and we still believe that the growth is not exponential,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.“The concern should be that they [cases] are not spreading to other places and that with geometric progression. The number of infected people in the three districts (Chandrapur, Parbhani and Nandurbar) is minimal,” said the official.The state health department has conducted 76,092 tests at various public and private facilities till date. Of them, 71,611 people tested negative. State currently has 364 containment zones. Around 5,648 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 20.85 lakh people. A total of 331 patients have been discharged from hospitals. It has also kept 6,879 patients at government quarantine facilities, while 93,655 are home quarantined, said state health officials.Lockdown was imposed in the state from the midnight of March 23 and was lifted partially after 27 days on Monday.Even as the number kept rising, the state government lifted restrictions in many of the areas. It has allowed construction work in the municipal corporation and municipality areas, including Mumbai and Pune, with a rider that prior permission from the municipal commissioner will be needed. It has allowed taking up all urgent pre-monsoon works. It has also decided to allow industries to operate in all rural areas of the state. Manufacturing and other industrial establishments in special economic zones, industrial townships of only non-containment areas are allowed, except in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune Municipal Corporations (PMC) limits. It has further allowed construction activities of roads, buildings and irrigation projects outside municipal corporation limits.“It will take a couple of days to streamline all things. We need to understand their difficulties and what more changes are required. All these need to be understand and acted upon. As public health is our top priority, we have put many conditions on industrial for operating,” said Harshdeep Kamble, development commissioner (industries).Officials said that many of them would be facing other difficulties such as requirement of labour, work order, availability of raw material etc, and thus a few days are needed to start operations.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has set up an online system to provide permission to industries to operate and has received over 1,300 applications so far. Officials said that they are still collating the figures on how many industries resumed operations from Monday.“To provide permission to the industries to start their operations in the state, we have set up an online system where they have to apply. They will have to submit requisite details, such as number of employees, travel arrangements for workers and other such details. They will also have to give self-certification on the conditions such as social distancing and others, which are required to be fulfilled, for starting operations,” said the development commissioner“The applications will be reviewed by the concerned district collector and permissions are being issued within hours. We are still collating the data,” Kamble said.“We have given permission to 1,355 industrial units for starting operations today. Of them ,752 are in MIDC areas and 603 are outside MIDC areas. Most of the permissions are given in Nashik district. Apart from this, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Amravati, Nagpur and Yavatmal are the districts where permissions have been given to the industrial units,” said a senior official from the industries department, wishing not to be named.Tope on Monday said that 75,000 rapid testing or antibody test kits will be made available to Maharashtra and the tests will be carried out soon. The minister also said that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tablets will also be given as prophylaxis to health workers, quarantined people. However, those with heart ailments and under the age of 15 and over age 60 will not be given HCQ.“The Centre has now approved rapid testing, and we have decided to conduct 75,000 rapid tests. It will be done as per the advisory of the Centre. Those with high fever and persistent cough will undergo this test. Similarly, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also said that hydroxychloroquine can be given as prophylaxis to limited number of people like healthcare workers, those in quarantine,” Tope said. The minister hinted that HCQs will be used for quarantine patients in Dharavi.The state government has also got the nod from the ICMR to start plasma therapy. The plasma from the recovered patients can be used on critical patients, to help them build antibodies to fight Covid-19.The minister also outlined the zoning done by the state government to allow lockdown relaxation. He said that those districts that have had no new Covid-19 cases in the last 14 days will be marked as an orange zone, while the districts where there have been no new case in the last 28 days will be marked as a green zone. The districts that have more than 15 cases are marked as red zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-virus-case-count-goes-up-to-4-666-death-toll-rises-to-232/story-pXyaCv0ScZyX1Ckrx6l1ON.html
21-04-2020||Mumbai||Textbook publishers stare at huge losses||After the extension of the national lockdown to May 3, school books publishers in the state are staring at big losses as the peak season for textbook and study material publication is hit. With the lockdown in place, publishers have not been able to print and distribute textbooks, notebooks and reference material, thus losing out on a large chunk of their yearly business. Many publishers have requested the government to consider allowing them to operate as an essential service. Narendra Nandu, president, Bombay Booksellers and Publishers’ Association, said, “We are all staring at big losses as our peak business happens during March-May. During this time, we print textbooks, reference material and notebooks for the new academic year that begins in June...We are going to formally request the government to come up with some solution.” He said medium publishers are likely to lose nearly ₹50 lakh due to this. Publishers alleged that with online publishers allowed to operate, print publications are getting an unfair treatment. Deepak Sheth, director of Sheth Publishers, said even if the government permits printing, there are other permissions which need to be taken care of. “Our staff will not be able to come if transport is not available. Hence, all these things need to be considered before taking any decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/textbook-publishers-stare-at-huge-losses/story-InwcpEOVLx3xWBeZxQHBGJ.html

The total number of cases in the district was 100 till Monday night. Officials said that patients include a 33-year-old woman from the Tech Zone 4 area of Greater Noida, who gave birth to a boy around 1pm on Monday at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida. The woman’s husband is a doctor with Jaypee Hospital whose sample reports are awaited. Officials think that he possibly acted as a carrier. He has now been quarantined, they added. Recently, a 62-year-old Muzaffarnagar woman who had come for an operation to Jaypee Hospital, was found positive for Covid-19. The woman had undergone surgery for pancreatic tumour at the hospital on March 7. The doctor’s wife was shifted from Jaypee Hospital in Sector 128 to GIMS on Sunday night.GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta said that both mother and child are doing fine and are under observation.The baby has been kept under observation away from the mother to ensure that the infection is not transmitted to him. A team of doctors and the medical staff lead by the chief medical superintendent and head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Professor Shikha Seth conducted the woman’s caesarean surgery. Officials had made special arrangements in the operation theatre as this was the first case where a Covid-19 patient needed an OT. “Both mother and child are doing well. We will conduct a Covid-19 test for the baby on Tuesday as it can be performed only after 24 hours of birth. He is currently under observation. The chances of him getting the infection are almost zero as it can happen only after the child consumes the mother’s milk which won’t happen in this case. We are happy that our team successfully conducted the surgery after taking all required precautions,” Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS, said.The second identified Covid-19 patient is a 52-year-old woman from Sector 34, Noida, who works with a private hospital in Patparganj, Delhi. Officials said that she was exposed in the operation theatre of the hospital. The woman is being treated at the same hospital’s branch in Delhi’s Saket area, where there are isolation wards for Covid-19 patients.The third patient is a 61-year-old woman from Block B, Sector 55, Noida. The woman is a cancer patient and her condition was stable at the time of admission at the Sharda Hospital, officials said. Her source of infection is yet to be identified. She is undergoing chemotherapy.

He was later arrested,” police said.The main accused and father of the girl, Wajid, was working as a labourer at a brick kiln in Khaikheda in Kakrauli police station area and was residing in a nearby area along with his wife Rehana and five children--- three daughters and two sons. According to the police, during interrogation Wajid said that there were disputes going on in his family for many months. When he discussed it with Irfaan, another labourer at the brick kiln who was allegedly interested in witchcraft, he advised him to sacrifice his daughter to maintain peace among the family members. Police also said that Wajid is continuously changing his statements and there is a possibility that he had murdered his daughter out of frustration. Wajid also said he murdered his two-year-old daughter as she reminded him of his past girlfriend, the police said. Police said that FIR was registered against Wajid and Irfaan under the charges of murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/human-sacrifice-man-kills-two-year-old-daughter-in-muzzaffarnagar/story-49TjsTOkWHmWv0gOPEipnJ.html

He had also visited a flu clinic on April 5 but the exact source of transmission had yet to be ascertained, health officials said.Dr Ashok Kumar, spokesperson of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), said another patient discharged on Sunday was a 23 year-old resident of Sector 29.Two children aged 16 and 13, of a Sector 30 resident who tested positive on Friday last week, were also sampled at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. Meanwhile, all 15 contacts of a positive case of Kacchi colony, Dhanas, have turned out negative.RETESTING SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS POST RECOVERYMedical authorities in Chandigarh have also decided to retest symptomatic patients who have recovered from Covid-19. Himachal Pradesh has recently reported a case in which a patient who had recovered retested positive.Arun Gupta, UTs principal health secretary, said that patients who had recovered from the disease and showed symptoms after the day-mandatory quarantine would be tested again.Meanwhile, data analysis by authorities on Monday showed the rate of doubling of Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh on Monday at 25.4 days against the national average of 7.5 days. Doubling of cases means the number of days in which active cases double. For this usually data of the current day is compared with data collected a week back. The government considers any district to be hotspot if doubling rate is less than four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/82-year-old-chandigarh-woman-tests-positive-for-covid-19-takes-city-count-to-27/story-U5qIo3YRYoFimAU56wYR2O.html
21-04-2020||Gurugram||Govt caps movement passes for industry workers, to be issued on first-cum-first-serve basis||The industry and commerce department of Haryana has now capped the number of passes to be issued by local administrations for industry workers by issuing a fresh set of instructions on Monday. The additional guidelines were issued a day after the government had released a standard operating procedure (SOP), allowing industrial and other establishments in the state to apply on the SARAL portal for permission to resume factory operations after a gap of almost four weeks due to nationwide lockdown.The power to approve passes rests with three different committees in a district headed, each by sub divisional magistrate (SDM), additional deputy commissioner (ADC) and commissioner Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and deputy commissioner (DC), for permission of movement to industry owners, on a first-cum-first-serve basis.“Initially, permissions will be granted by the committees on a first-cum-first-serve basis restricting the total number of industrial workers/employees as per given the instructions,” said the letter from the department.First category is for industries applying for passes for up to 25 persons.“An SDM-level committee shall grant permissions to a maximum of 1,000 persons per block in rural areas and 1,000 persons per town in urban areas in their jurisdiction in the first phase,” said the letter.The second category is for industries applying for 25 to 200 persons.In this category, the ADC as well as the commissioner of concerned civic bodies shall grant permissions to a maximum of 2,000 persons each in their jurisdictions in the first phase.The third category comprises approval of passes for industries applying for more than 200 persons and concerned DC can grant permissions to a maximum of 3,000 persons in the district in the first phase.The letter, however, does not say what it means by “first phase”.TVSN Prasad, additional chief secretary, industry department, Haryana, said, “This is a lockdown period and the government has to ensure movements remain under control of local administration, which is why the approval passes have been capped. As things move forward and the situation improves, the local administration will take a call as per the prevailing situation and allow more industries.”After the SOP was issued, many industry owners in Gurugram expressed concerns over clauses such as FIRs for violations and two years’ imprisonment to the industry owner in case an employee gets infected with Covid-19.According to industry owners, capping of approval passes in the district is a clear indication that the government does not want to grant permissions to all industries at the same time during lockdown till May 3.“There was no point in capping approval passes. There is also no clarity on how long the first phase will last. There are many concerns and we have written to the Haryana government over the same,” said Deepak Maini, an industrialist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-caps-movement-passes-for-industry-workers-to-be-issued-on-first-cum-first-serve-basis/story-mqkKsSUqVcUZICYYT9lLOM.html
21-04-2020||Gurugram||Stay safe and help others: The lockdown mantra of this Gurugram society||A community fridge placed in front of HEWO 1 Apartments in Sector 56 is helping residents reach out to those in need of food. The initiative, started around a year ago, is proving to be quite useful in the current situation, say residents. Placed right next to the main gate and run through seven days of the week, there is no lock on the fridge and passersby can pick any item at any point of the day, they said. “Residents are contributing to the fridge by placing packets of home-cooked food. As soon as items are placed, some one or the other picks it up,” said Virender Singh, the vice-president of the residents’ welfare association (RWA). Minisha Bhardwaj, an artist, who stays in the building, says residents are taking safety precautions while placing the food. Also, those placing food post on the apartment social media group, ensuring that only healthy persons contribute. “The fridge is touched by a lot of people. So, you have to ensure that it is safe for those contributing as well as those collecting the food. Every time someone places an item in the fridge, they put a message on the WhatsApp group,” said Bhardwaj.The society has also accommodated all staff members, mostly from nearby villages and slums, at vacant apartments and makeshift quarters in the changing rooms adjoining a swimming pool. They use the cooking facilities to prepare food, while residents, sometimes, provide them with tea and snacks. Dry ration — rice, dal, oil, sugar and salt, among other items — were recently distributed to them by the RWA. At the gate, security guards have been provided with infrared thermometers to measure the temperature of those entering the society. They are directed to mandatorily sanitise their hands and sanitisers have been provided at each tower lobby. The RWA has also procured its own supply of sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as liquid bleach, for sanitising the complex twice a day. Special attention is given to commonly used areas — elevators, lobbies and stairs. The society has a grocery store, which has now been expanded to include vegetables and fruits. In the initial days of the lockdown, it had to depend on food delivery trucks of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).“We now have a shop for fresh vegetables and fruits, so that residents don’t have to step out. The shop has been provided to him (grocery store owner) rent-free. A rate card has been displayed outside the store and he has to sell it as per the government rates,” said Singh. He added that only one resident is allowed inside the shop at a go, while others have to wait outside on the markings to ensure social distancing. All online deliveries are currently restricted to the gate. Residents are expected to pick up their orders to ensure that non-residents don’t the society. Following the lockdown, the society worked hard to gather the travel histories of residents. Tower volunteers called up each of the 200-odd families residing in the society to find out if they had recently travelled. “It was tiring to call up each family, but then the task was done at the end. We called up each household, asked for their travel history over the past 15 days. Not all of them came forward, so we had to cross-check with neighbours too,” said Diksha Babhoota, a resident, who helped record travel histories of residents.After the collection of travel history, the society asked three families to home-quarantine, as they had recently returned from foreign trips. “They were strictly told that they cannot step out. At the same time, we ensured that all their essential needs were catered to by the security team,” said Singh. The society put in place a no-walking policy and even informed residents via circulars of the same. However, some continue with their old routines. “We have a few residents who continue to take walks. They are few in numbers. We are strictly enforcing masks in public spaces. Residents have to wear masks every time they step out of the apartment,” said Singh. He added that for the time being, pet owners have mostly chosen to remain indoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/stay-safe-and-help-others-the-lockdown-mantra-of-this-gurugram-society/story-UtWMwtRR8enUPVXUp7Da3M.html

The test results of all the 16 persons, including the owner of the food joint where the delivery executive worked, have come negative,” district magistrate (south) BM Mishra said.“None of the low-risk contacts to whom the infected person had delivered food over the past month have shown any symptoms so far. But they will continue to be under home quarantine; they’re being strictly monitored,” he added.The delivery person, who tested positive on April 14, is being treated at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur.According to the police, he is an employee of Box 8, and the last order he delivered was a pizza from the kitchen of the adjoining restaurant MOJO Pizza, also located in the same building in Malviya Nagar. Police said that apart from serving its own menu, Box 8 has a tie-up with multiple food chains.While larger food delivery chains and essential supplies providers have strict processes to ensure the safety of their deliveries, smaller firms may fall below the radar, prompting government officials to consider drafting standardised norms.Mishra said the delivery person had not been feeling well for nearly a month.In a statement on its official Twitter account on April 16, Box 8 had said: “After all precautions and vigilance, in an unfortunate turn of events, a delivery partner of our Malviya Nagar kitchen in south Delhi has tested COVID positive yesterday….The delivery partner has been keeping well and getting the required medical attention. All his co-workers have been quarantined and we have shut down the Malviya Nagar kitchen in South Delhi for the next 14 days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-outbreak-16-high-risk-contacts-linked-to-pizza-delivery-boy-test-negative-in-south-delhi/story-Y9V6Zp9SNcKsH3unwxpmOJ.html
21-04-2020||Noida||GB Nagar to issue safety guidelines for delivery persons||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration is working on safety guidelines for delivery persons working with organisations providing delivery of essential items. The move follows last week’s incident in Delhi’s Malviya Nagar, wherein a delivery boy of a restaurant tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) and subsequently, 72 families and 17 of his colleagues were placed in quarantine.Officials said that it is important to ensure the safety of delivery boys as it can lead to the spread of Covid-19 in societies across the district where they are providing services.“We are going to start conducting random Covid-19 tests of delivery boys involved in door-to-door services, especially in the hot spots and containment areas. We have asked all service providers to ensure that delivery boys are following mandatory measures, such as wearing masks, using sanitisers and ensuring social distancing. The firms have to keep a tab on the health of their employees by checking their temperatures on a regular basis,” said LY Suhas, district magistrate, GB Nagar.“We are soon going to issue detailed and strict guidelines pertaining to delivery boys. Special attention will be paid to delivery boys working in containment areas,” said Suhas.The chemists’ association of Gautam Budh Nagar has asked their delivery persons to drop off the packages at the main gate of the society and maintain a high level of hygiene.“We have given sanitisers and masks to all our men involved in home deliveries. We have strictly told them to deliver medicines at the main gate only. We are also requesting people to make online payments or through payment apps. At shops also, people have started using sanitisers before and after swiping the debit card. The safety of delivery boys is important for people receiving the services also. We have asked those running medical stores to immediately contact the health department if a delivery person has fever, cold or any Covid-19 symptom,” said Anoop Khanna, president, chemists’ association.From Monday, officials also started barricading hot spots. Only essential services will be allowed in containment areas and movement of vehicles or people will not be allowed. The containment drive is going to be intensified, said Suhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-to-issue-safety-guidelines-for-delivery-persons/story-QzqrL0Q7CUGGfkxMn3b6zH.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||Life on the front lines: Three of a family infected, fourth in quarantine||When the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 was announced on March 24, a family of four in north-west Delhi’s Model Town was worried. A policeman, a nurse, and their young sons -- they knew they faced a high risk of infection because of their jobs.Even as the nurse continued to work, the family went to great lengths to ensure that they did not infect each other, their colleagues, their neighbours, or their house help. Each member stayed in a separate room at their four-bedroom house in Model Town Police Colony; they paid their domestic help and car cleaner for the month, and asked them to stay home during the lockdown; the 52-year-old policeman, who had undergone a heart surgery months earlier, took his pending leave to stay home; and the family cut off all physical contact with their neighbours. “It was an exemplary act. They went out of their way to keep their neighbours away, not to save themselves but to protect the others,” said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west).But despite their efforts, the disease got to them. Three members of the family — the couple and their younger son (21) — tested positive for the virus between April 11 and 13. For the last week, the three have been confined to a room at the Lok Nayak Hospital.The couple’s 23-year-old son is in home-quarantine.The woman, an assistant nursing superintendent at Lok Nayak hospital, went to work every day, and knew that if her family was affected, she would be the source. “There was no public conveyance from home to hospital, so my husband would drive me home every day. I knew that once I was infected, he would get it too,” the nurse said.She began showing symptoms in early April. “My nursing colleagues were regularly serving Covid-19 patients without being equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE). I must have contracted the disease from them,” she said, even as the authorities are unclear about the source of her infection.She was hospitalised on April 9, and two days later, an RT-PCR test confirmed that she was Covid-19 positive. The family of four was moved to Lok Nayak Hospital. On April 13, her husband and 21-year-old son tested positive as well. However, their older son tested negative and was sent home.“We think he didn’t get the infection because he has better immunity and we ensured we avoided contact with him. But my younger son began cooking for us once I fell unwell. He would serve me food and collect my utensils. Maybe, that is how he got infected,” she said.The three was allotted a separate small room at the hospital. The proximity at least allows them to talk to one another.“We are so close to each other, and yet, so far. In the hospital room, our beds are at a distance of a metre from each other. We cannot watch a film together on one mobile phone. We cannot exchange phones or share our chargers. Even our meals arrive separately,” said the 52-year-old assistant sub-inspector (ASI) with the Delhi Police’s provisioning and logistics department.In the hospital room, the couple spends all day on the phone — either attending to calls from relatives or calling up their son at home. The younger son spends time watching films on the phone. But the couple says their main concern is their son back home.“My son may be able to handle the home-quarantine emotionally, but he is in isolation and staying alone, at the end of the day. When relatives call us, we ask them to call up my son after disconnecting the call,” the policeman said.Once in a while, the family encounters a familiar face, as the nurses attending them know the woman as a senior . They say that the presence of acquaintances around them gives them a “feeling of being with an extended family”.“I tell them that I’ll join them as soon as I am discharged and allowed to serve,” said the nurse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/life-on-the-front-lines-three-of-a-family-infected-fourth-in-quarantine/story-knfK3HPAnOxY5BCTSt0V8H.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||Capital readies more quarantine centres||Districts across the national Capital have been asked to identify additional quarantine centres, including paid facilities, for suspected Covid-19 patients, as the number of positive cases in the city spiked to 2,081 on Monday.According to a report accessed by HT, Delhi has 17 institutional quarantine centres that are currently accommodating 3,220 suspected patients. Of this, 2,852 persons are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation that took place in Nizamuddin in mid-March, while 368 were categorised as ‘others’ (contact related).As per the report, there are only 1,185 vacant beds in all of Delhi’s quarantine centres. Gauging the pace of new positive cases and the increasing number of containment zones in the city, district magistrates have been asked to arrange for additional centres and also offer the option of paid quarantine in hotels.The South West zone is one of the first districts to have its quarantine plan ready. “As part of our exigency plan, we have already identified four additional quarantine centres, two of which will be paid and the others free. In case there is a sudden need for more quarantine centres, we will be able to start these within a few hours of intimation,” said Rahul Singh, district magistrate (South West).The subdivisional magistrates of the district have roped in hotels, such as Taj Vivanta and ITC Welcome in Dwarka, to set up paid quarantine facilities. Free quarantine centres at the Chaudhary Brahm Prakash College, which is centrally air-conditioned and has attached bathrooms, and the Police Training College in Jharoda Kalan have been kept on standby, with 362 beds in total.In the South district, officials said they have sent a proposal to the health department to keep three hotels ready. “At present, we have around 150 people living in our quarantine centres. We have zeroed in on three hotels, in and around Green Park, to provide paid facilities,” said the official, on condition of anonymity.However, revenue officials in New Delhi district said the need for additional quarantine centres has not yet arisen in their area. “Our existing centres still have at least 252 beds available. So, we are yet to go on to the next phase of getting more centres ready,” said a senior revenue official of New Delhi district, on condition of anonymity.In the Shahdara district, there was no vacancy as of Monday. “Our quarantine centre at Delhi Police residential complex has a capacity of 450 people. But, despite having 141 beds vacant, we are temporarily keeping the vacancies suspended because some more recently tested positive for Covid-19. So, the rooms and all other areas are undergoing thorough sanitisation and disinfection at the moment,” said a revenue official of Shahdara district.At present, the biggest quarantine facility in Delhi is in North district’s Narela, where flats of the Delhi Development Authority are being used. The centre has a capacity of 1,260 beds, of which only 176 were available as of Monday.Earlier, the paid quarantine centres in Aerocity near the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport was the largest quarantine facility in the country. The paid centres, set up in five plush hotels of Aerocity, were shut by the Delhi government on April 10 after all 608 persons who were using the facility successfully finished their quarantine. Most of them were passengers who had arrived in Delhi from other countries and had to undergo the mandated quarantine.A quarantine facility has a dedicated team of doctors and health workers, besides centre-wise dedicated sanitation staff. Such a facility is different from a Covid Care Centre (CCC), which is for people who show symptoms and test positive for the virus.In a quarantine facility, mostly asymptomatic persons or others who had come in contact with a Covid-19 positive person are kept for a period of 14 days. They are allowed to leave the facility only after they test negative for Covid-19 twice, including one while exiting the centre, after which they are mandated to home-quarantine for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/more-quarantine-centres-in-the-works-as-cases-spike/story-4noVZrxILpsOWShmSZCv3H.html
21-04-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram health dept starts antibody tests in Sohna||The health department on Monday started rapid antibody tests in Sohna and tested five persons with the help of Rapid Testing Kits (RTKs). The district health department has 750 RTKs which will be used in tracing people who have developed antibodies against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)—i.e. they are asymptomatic or have mild influenza-like symptoms. In a statement released by the administration, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said, “The district has more than 700 RTKs, which will help find suspected Covid-19 cases. While the RT-PCR method takes at least two days, antibody tests give results in 15-30 minutes. The kits will be used in containment zones of the city to check for Covid-19 clustering.”Officials said that the result of all five tests carried out at the sub-divisional hospital in Sohna on Monday was negative. The district has six containment zones — Devi Lal Colony, Sun City Sector 54, Sector 39, Fazilpur village in Jharsa, Village Raipur in Sohna and Ward no. 11 Pataudi. The district health department has started the tests in Sohna’s containment zones after it reported 14 cases.On Monday noon, the medical team at Sohna was trained in the usage of the kit. With the staff’s training complete, more people will be tested on Tuesday, officials said. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “With the help of RTKs, we can find out whether a person has developed antibodies against Covid-19. We are taking the blood samples of those with influenza-like illness. Once identified we will also do their RT-PCR tests for final confirmation. But those tested for antibodies will be quarantined for 10 days.”On Friday, the Haryana government received its first shipment of 10,000 RTKs from the central government. As per the plan, blood tests to detect coronavirus antibodies through RTKs will be done at three Covid-19 hot spot districts — Gurugram, Nuh and Hathin in Palwal. Haryana also received its first shipment of 25,000 RTKs from SD Bio Sensor, a Korean company based in IMT Manesar. Rajiv Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “ We are the first state to receive bulk supply from our own sources. This will help speed up testing in containment zones, hot spots and asymptomatic cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-health-dept-starts-antibody-tests-in-sohna/story-IVZUHADyIVHU7GC6AshYRP.html

21-04-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Azadpur market to remain open round the clock to help farmers sell produce||In order to help farmers sell their produce without any hassle and to ensure uninterrupted supply of essentials in the national capital, the agriculture produce market in Azadpur will remain open round the clock from Tuesday (April 21) till the lockdown is lifted, Delhi minister Gopal Rai said on Monday.The decision was taken a day after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that Delhi will witness no relaxation in the lockdown norms from April 20 – the revised guidelines of the Union home ministry have made some relaxations for certain sectors till May 3, such as construction work, IT companies, online deliveries and farming sector, among others.Azadpur agriculture market is considered the lifeline of Delhi in terms of supply of fruits and vegetables. To get a sense of the scale of operations, the market witnessed transactions of nearly 350 tonnes of tomatoes, 302 tonnes of potatoes, 350 tonnes of onions, 82 tonnes of cauliflower and cabbage, 70 tonnes of orange and 313 tonnes of apple were supplied at the Azadpur Mandi on March 25, the day the nationwide lockdown started.“Under the new arrangement, from 6am to 10pm, vegetables and fruits will be sold as usual at the Azadpur mandi . From 10pm to 6am, truck movement will be allowed in and out of the market. Every four hours, the entry of 1,000 people will be allowed,” said Rai.He further said, to ensure social distancing, the government will deploy 900 civil defence volunteers and install two more CCTV cameras at crucial points in the market to help monitor the people density within its premises.Earlier this month, the government had introduced staggered timings for truckers and an odd-even system for traders in the market. All sheds in the market are numbered. Under the new system, traders in odd-numbered sheds and even-numbered sheds were allowed to operate on alternate days.“The policy was adopted to ensure social distancing but it proved costly in terms of business and supply chain. Farmers started complaining as the new arrangements reduced avenues for them to sell their produce and it hit the supply chain of fruits and vegetables in the city. This was conveyed to the government. The new arrangement is a relief,” Adil Khan, chairperson of the Azadpur agriculture produce market committee, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/azadpur-market-to-remain-open-round-the-clock-to-help-farmers-sell-produce/story-yokmTZzqJuHK3zd7whnBjP.html
21-04-2020||Chandigarh||In locked down Chandigarh drug users turn to therapy centres for ‘safe’ doses to fight withdrawal symptoms||With illegal drug supply restricted due to curfew in the wake of Covid-19, drug users in Chandigarh are willingly choosing safer opioid substitutes to cope with withdrawal symptoms, doctors say.More than a 100 injecting drug users (IDUs) have reached out for help to opioid substitution therapy (OST) centres run by the State AIDS Control Society (SACS), Chandigarh. Used medically to treat moderate to severe pain opioids are like opiates such as morphine and codeine, but are not made from opium.Doctors say IDUs are being administered Buprenorphine, an opioid used to treat opioid use disorder, acute pain, and chronic pain. “It’s a medically approved, safer and long acting drug and is given daily to those who are registered with the centres,” says Sandeep Mittal, deputy director, SACS.1,400 IDUs registeredAbout 1,400 IDUs are registered with NGOs for the programme, out of which about 600 are taking Buprenorphine based OST under SACS. Buprenorphine tablets are given daily to users to counter withdrawal symptoms and allow them to perform routine activities. “Slowly, the dosage is reduced,” adds Mittal. The project is being run with the help of NGOs Sehat and Society for Service to Voluntary Agencies (SOSVA) at four such centres in the city.Pirity, project manager, SOSVA, who only uses one name, looks after drug users at two OST centres in sectors 38 and 56. “We have 668 users who inject drugs of which 18 are women, but only 230 are taking medications regularly. After the lockdown, however, 21 new cases have come to us,” she says.Many patients who had quit the centres prematurely earlier are returning willingly, she adds. A 23-year-old who had sought therapy in October last year did not return after he was tested positive for AIDS. “Today, he came to the centre willingly and enrolled for therapy,” Pirity adds.Act sensitively, NGOs toldNGOs have been advised to act sensitively and not ask users too many questions, says Sanjeev Kumar, project manager with Sehat. “Yesterday, I got a call from an 18-year-old youth wanting to restart therapy. They are in need, and we are going to help them,” he says.Sehat manages two centres in Manimajra and Ram Darbar “We have 1,026 IDUs registered with us (485 in Manimajra and 541 in Ram Darbar). A majority of them are in the 18 to 19 age bracket and the average age is 32 years,” adds Kumar. “Currently 290 IDUs are taking regular medication from the two centres, but since the lockdown, the number has increased. At least 80 people who had earlier left us midway during therapy have enrolled with us again,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-locked-down-chandigarh-drug-users-turn-to-therapy-centres-for-safe-doses-to-fight-withdrawal-symptoms/story-mOkTT12HVUphSzxgNcnueN.html

21-04-2020||Delhi||Yamuna’s water quality improves, but not fit for use||The overall quality of water in the Yamuna river has improved by up to 33% at the Okhla barrage (Agra canal) during the lockdown period but it is still to meet prescribed standards, a comparative study of water samples taken from nine different locations by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) earlier this month shows. The improvement is mainly on account of an increased flow of fresh water in the river and reduced pollutant load from commercial and industrial sectors. According to officials, the prescribed BOD (bio-chemical oxygen demand) standard for Yamuna river water is 3mg/l, when the water can be considered fit for bathing. BOD levels mean the amount of oxygen required by the river to maintain its flow. The lower the BOD levels, the better the quality of water.Except for two locations — Palla (2.8 mg/l in April 2020 compared to 1.7 mg/l in 2019) and Surghat (3.8mg/l in April 2020 compared to 2.8mg/l in 2019) — the water quality did not meet the prescribed parameters (fit for bathing) at the rest of the locations, the DPCC report released on Monday said. Besides nine locations along the river, samples were also taken from 20 major drains falling into the river on April 6 and have been compared with the water quality recorded during the same period in 2019. “The quality of water in river Yamuna has improved during the lockdown period. At Okhla Barrage (Agra canal) the bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) value of 16 mg/l was observed, compared to 24 mg/l last year (April 2019), which is an improvement of 33%. However, the water quality is still not meeting the prescribed standards,” the report stated. “During the lockdown period, with abundant rainfall in and around Delhi, the flow of fresh water in the river was almost three times more than that of last year during the same time. Increased flow in the river helps wash away pollutants,” a senior DPCC official, who did not wish to be named, said. In April 2020, the average flow in the river was of 3,900 cusecs, as compared to 1,000 cusecs at the same time in 2019. “The increased flow has helped in dilution of the pollutants, which is contributing to the improvement of water quality,” the report said. Of the nine locations, the maximum reduction was observed at Okhla barrage (Agra canal) Nizamuddin, ITO Bridge, Agra Canal (Jaitpur) and Okhla barrage (after meeting Shahdara drain) ITO bridge saw a reduction of 21% in pollution levels. The BOD levels here were 22mg/l in comparison to 28mg/l last year. At Nizamuddin Bridge, the improvement was of 20%, which recorded BOD levels of 16 mg/l as compared to 20 mg/l in 2019. At Agra Canal (Jaitpur), the reduction was 26% with BOD levels of 17 mg/l, as compared to 23mg/l last year while at Okhla barrage (after meeting Shahdara drain) the quality improved by 18%, as it recorded 23 mg/l BOD levels in comparison to 28 mg/l in 2019. However, no significant change was observed at Qudesia Ghat, while an increase in pollution level of up to 42% was found at Khajuri Paltoon pool. Meanwhile, the waste water quality of the major drains too saw a reduction in pollution levels, including Najafgarh drain (22%), Barapulla drain (32%), ISBT drain (68%), Shahdara drain (33%) and Civil Mill drain (80%). The National Green Tribunal-appointed two-member Yamuna Monitoring Committee had asked the pollution monitoring bodies to test the water quality of the river during the lockdown. According to Manoj Misra, convener, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, even though the values are far from prescribed standard, it is a significant improvement. “The data has established an important baseline in terms of the factors that affect the river health as well as steps required to revive it. The improvement shows that controlling the discharge of industrial effluents is crucial. Besides it also shows the importance of maintaining dilution flow in the river,” said Misra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/yamuna-water-quality-improves-by-up-to-33-but-it-is-still-not-satisfactory/story-SEs1U0dE3Cbumd7rPHOxSP.html
21-04-2020||Pune||With entire Pune, PCMC containment zones, police pull out all stops to enforce lockdown strictly||A day after entire Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad were declared as containment zones by the respective city administrations, the police issued fresh orders bringing in more restrictions in the region as part of the government’s efforts to limit the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 disease. The curfew, according to an order issued by Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, came into effect across the city at 2pm on Monday following which most areas where there was limited movement, were completely deserted. Similar orders were also issued by the Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissioner Sandeep Bishnoi on Sunday night. Both the orders will be valid until midnight of April 27.“These orders will be applicable in parts of the city which were not mentioned in the earlier list of containment zones,” read a part of joint CP Shisve’s order. On April 7, a few locations in four police station jurisdictions were declared as containment zones. One week later, on April 15, 28 new containment zones were declared. The order from the police issued under Section 144(1) (3) of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in Pune was preceded by Pune Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad’s announcement late on Sunday declaring the entire Pune city as a containment zone. Even as civic chief’s order was in effect, people were found roaming in their areas in the name of purchasing essential commodities in many parts of the city during the first half. Long queues were seen especially at vegetable and grocery shops. As per the order, shops of essential commodities will be open for limited hours. “There were 383 cases of violations (under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code) in Pune city on Monday while there have been 9,432 cases reported since March 19,” said deputy commissioner of police, crime, Bachchan Singh.However, post 2pm when fresh orders of the police came into effect, roads looked completely deserted in Sadashiv peth, Satara road and NIBM road areas. Satish Desai, former corporator, said that despite the lockdown, he had seen many people roaming on the roads till Monday morning in the peth areas, which has already been sealed by the authorities. “I stay near SP College area and there were numerous vehicles on the roads, but since Monday afternoon, the police has taken complete control. Hardly anyone has been seen roaming on the roads with police officials taking care that people do not step out of their homes.”Hanumant Pawar, who stays neer Teen Hati chowk, said, “From our locality, where people mostly live in chawls, the urban poor used to spend the day on the footpaths. Monday afternoon, every one stayed indoors.”Municipal commissioner Gaikwad said that as the areas had been sealed on Sunday midnight, some people were not aware of it and as a result there was some crowding on the streets. “However, police and civic staff would ensure that in the coming days that there is no unnecessary movement of people on the roads. I am also appealing to the citizens to not panic for essential commodities as the supply is enough. Those who step out daily to buy essential good should cooperate and buy supply to last a week. Residents should join the fight against Covid-19 as administration is taking these steps in their interest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-entire-pune-pcmc-containment-zones-police-pull-out-all-stops-to-enforce-lockdown-strictly/story-makuYq370NkNiAvIsZRMYJ.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi schools shut, distribution of sanitary napkins stops||Sixteen-year-old Shagun — a resident of Delhi’s largest unauthorised colony, Sangam Vihar — has been using cloth pieces instead of sanitary napkins during her monthly cycle for the last couple of months. The Class 9 student at government girls senior secondary school in Sangam Vihar used to get a packet of sanitary napkins every month from her school. But with her school shut for more than a month due to the ongoing lockdown in place to stop the spread of Covid-19, the distribution of sanitary napkins too have come to a halt. Daughter of a mason and a domestic help, Shagun said that her family is not being able to makes ends meet due to the lockdown. “My father has not earned a penny in the last one month . We are collecting food twice a day from a food distribution centre at a nearby school. We can’t even think about buying sanitary pads at the moment. I had received my last packet of pads from the school in February. Now, me and my sister (14) are both using cloth pieces. It’s really uncomfortable, but we can’t help,” she said.Savita Devi, vice chairperson of the management committee at Shagun’s school, said that majority of the girls studying in their school in Sangam Vihar are dependent on the sanitary napkins they receive from them. “Even during normal days, they cannot afford to buy sanitary napkins. It’s impossible for them to go buy them now, as a pandemic rages on in the city,” she said.The female students of classes 6 to 12, studying in government schools across the country, are given sanitary napkin packets every month under the Central government’s Kishori Shakti Yojna. Every month more than 8 lakh girls benefit from the scheme in Delhi government schools.However, distribution has been disrupted these days as schools are closed due to the lockdown, adding to the woes of students, a majority of who come from lower income group families. Rashmi, 17, a student at a government school in east Delhi’s New Kondli area, said that her mother has stitched sanitary napkins using cloth and cotton at home for her and her two sisters. “People like us who can’t afford to buy sanitary napkins have to make alternate arrangements. I hope my school can provide some by next month. It will become really difficult for us to survive without pads, she said, adding that her school last distributed sanitary napkins in February. The Class 10 student said that her father, an e-rikshaw driver and sole bread earner of the family of five, has not been able to go to work due to the lockdown since last month. “We can sacrifice other things, but periods don’t stop because of a pandemic,” she said.Several government school teachers said they have been receiving distress calls from their students. Arti Qanungo, a teacher at a government school in Shakarpur, said that some of her students have switched to using cloth in the absence of sanitary pads. “Some others said that they have stock for this month. But the situation will become really difficult for them now that the schools are not going to re-open anytime soon,” she said.Binay Bhushan, Director of the Directorate of Education (DoE), said that the department will discuss the matter with schools. “The situation is very difficult these days. It will be difficult to distribute sanitary pads from schools and we do no have any mechanism for home delivery. We will have to come up with an alternative,” he said.Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynaecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli — an NGO that works on menstrual health with Delhi government in its schools — said they are also going to discuss the matter with government officials. “The only solution is that schools should provide sanitary napkins at the food distribution centres and the government school students can pick them from there. Our NGO has also begun to distribute packets of sanitary pads at these centres now,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-schools-shut-distribution-of-sanitary-napkins-stops/story-V7BYhovHUetfhfC8gxJuAP.html
21-04-2020||City||Life in lockdown: Punjab ties up with radio channel for teaching rural area students||While private and government schools in urban areas have switched to online teaching amid the lockdown, students in rural areas are suffering due to poor internet connectivity, unavailability of smartphones, computers and laptops, besides exhaustion of data pack and wi-fi plans.​To address these problems and make recorded lectures of all classes available online, the state education department has decided to reach out to these students through a radio app.For this, the authorities have tied up with the radio channel, Chann Pardesi, and a two-hour programme will be aired from 1 pm to 3 pm for students of all classes from Tuesday.To listen to the programme, students can download the app from the Play Store of their android and iPhones. However, this initiative by the department will not prove helpful to the students, who do not have smartphones and wi-fi connection, so there was a need to come up with other options as well.Government school teachers are also sending small recorded videos to students on WhatsApp groups so that they can easily watch them and understand the concepts.The state education department has also come up with an Iscuela mobile app to cater to learning needs of government school students. All the content such as e-books, videos, and class-wise YouTube playlists are available for the students on this app.A government school student, Ramandeep Kaur, said, “To attend online classes through zoom app, I face many challenges as several times, the voice is not clear and the data pack also gets exhausted in limited time. To clear my doubts, I call my subject teachers. A lecture through television or a local radio channel can be helpful as a majority of students have these gadgets and can easily continue with their studies.”To resolve the data challenges faced by the students in a rural area, experts of the Kaligidhar Trust have also come up with three modules --- live video sessions through apps like Google Duo, Zoom and Seesaw, dividing and disseminating lectures into small video files and voice messages on WhatsApp not to exhaust much data and one-to-one interactive sessions over the telephone for clearing doubts.In Ludhiana, the Trust runs five schools with a strength of 2,754 students. President of the trust Baba Iqbal Singh said, “To resolve the problems of students, we have developed a methodology to deliver quality education during the lockdown through three modules.”He said, “Teachers clip their lectures into small video files so that less download time is consumed and files can easily be sent on email or Whatsapp/Seesaw.”The trust chief added, “To manage the problems of limited internet usage and server, the schools have advised all the teachers not to conduct virtual classes with a dozen or more students, because when the number of users in a single video-conferencing room increases, the quality of internet connection gets hampered.”“For students, whose parents do not have either a smartphone or a computer, classes are conducted over the phone,” said Harcharan Kaur, principal of the Akal Academy Jandiali.​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/life-in-lockdown-punjab-ties-up-with-radio-channel-for-teaching-rural-area-students/story-ltIJfllLLYabZeJ6KUIH6K.html

21-04-2020||Pune||After bubonic plague, entire Pune, PCMC sealed for first time under 123-year-old Epidemic Act||The coronavirus pandemic has forced the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic administration to declare the entire region as a containment zone on Sunday midnight. After the bubonic plague of 1897, it is the first time after 123 years that the entire Pune metropolitan region (Pune city, rural and PCMC) has been sealed under the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, according to historians and civic officials. A curfew, too, has been imposed in the city, starting 2pm on Monday.Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad on Sunday used the provisions of the 1897 Epidemic Diseases Act to declare the whole city as a containment zone. “I am not sure, but this is the first case wherein the whole city has been sealed using the provisions of the Epidemic Act. Earlier, during swine flu and wars, some provisions of the Act might have been used for only certain sections of the city,” said Gaikwad.“The administration has invoked provisions of the Act in the interest of the residents and to break the chain of the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 disease,” added Gaikwad.Raja Dixit, emeritus professor of History department of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), said, “I have never heard or read about the sealing of the whole city in the past years. We read about the plague in history books and Rand’s assassination, but I am not aware if the entire city was sealed during that time. I was very young when the war against China and Pakistan occurred and during that time we used to hear the sirens blaring at times. But this is historic, the entire city has been sealed.”Former editor of the newspaper Kesari Arvind Gokhale said, “British plague commissioner WC Rand used the provisions of the Act in 1897. After that, this is the first case wherein the whole city has been sealed. Lokmanya Tilak, who started the Kesari newspaper, supported the British government when the Act was introduced to protect the citizen’s health issues. However, British soldiers misused the provisions of the Act against women, which resulted in the assassination of Rand by the Chapekar Brothers.” The Kesari newspaper was active during the bubonic plague.In June 1897, the brothers, Damodar Hari Chapekar and Balkrishna Hari Chapekar, assassinated WC Rand, the plague commissioner of Poona [now Pune], and Lieutenant Charles Egerton Ayerst, an officer of the administration. Both the British officers were considered guilty of misusing the Act.Dr Satish Desai, publisher of the Punyabhushan magazine and former elected member, said, “It is the first time that the Act has been invoked throughout the city as per my knowledge after the plague. In 1962, 1965 and 1972, the government announced black out, but the existing situation is different.”Former mayor Ankush Kakade said, “This is for the first time that the whole city has been sealed for a long time after the plague. It is in the interest of the citizens. Government has appealed to people to stay at home, but as some residents are not cooperating, the government machineries have no option but to use strict measures.”Documentation of Covid-19Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said that after the plague, Covid-19 is the first case where every one is affected. I have instructed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials to document every thing as it will remain a historic event for the next generations. “The documentation will have all the details, including the first case to various measures taken by the government and PMC officials,” said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/after-bubonic-plague-entire-pune-pcmc-sealed-for-first-time-under-123-year-old-epidemic-act/story-mAVzLCby52rLoR6fMQ408J.html
21-04-2020||Pune||Maharashtra bans use of disinfectant tunnels||District and civic authorities will ban the installation of disinfectant tunnels set up by private bodies at various localities across the city after the state government on Sunday issued an order that these tunnels are ineffective to fight Covid-19 (coronavirus) spread.Dr Archana Patil, state health director, said, “Through its notification, the Centre has asked not to use disinfectant tunnels as there is no study to back its effectiveness. Also, it can be harmful to health as well.”Experts and NGOs had earlier warned about the health hazards of such tunnels as the disinfectant used contains sodium hypochlorite that should be applied only on inanimate objects.Sandeep Khardekar, president, Creative Foundation, a social organisation working on various issues including health, had written to PMC health department about the rampant use of such tunnels without considering the health risks.Khardekar in his application said that it has become a “fashion to install disinfectant tunnels” during Covid-19 crisis where there are no set guidelines by the state government. “Social groups and philanthropists are coming ahead to sponsor the installation of these tunnels,” he said.“There are two things which will happen because of the rise in the use of the tunnels. Firstly, people will ignore to wash hands and they will not wear masks. Secondly, the chemical released from the tunnel affects the body and is harmful to the eyes and can cause other health issues,” said Khardekar.Khardekar said that a reply from civic administration is still awaited.Sandeep Rairikar, deputy general manager and scientist, Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), said, “There is a danger of inhalation of sodium hypochlorite released in the tunnel which can cause irritations and it might lead to health issues.”Dr Anant Phadke, co-convenor, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, said, “Using chemical spray on human beings like in the use of tunnels can impact health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/district-administration-bans-use-of-disinfectant-tunnels/story-yQ8T8oNijQc74frIjfn87I.html
21-04-2020||Chandigarh||More curbs in place for Haryana companies amid lockdown||The Haryana government on Monday put a further cap on the number of workers allowed for deployment by the industrial and commercial establishment to resume economic activity.Establishments outside the containment zones have been allowed to operate in a phased manner. District and block-level committees have been constituted to grant approvals.Issuing an additional set of guidelines on Monday, the industries and commerce department said that permission to a maximum of 1,000 people per block in rural areas would be granted to industries and commercial establishments seeking deployment of up to 25 people.“Permissions will be granted by the designated approval committees on first come first serve basis in the first phase,” said a top official.For urban areas, permission for a maximum of 1,000 people per town (for municipal corporation areas a maximum of 2,000) will be granted for establishments. In case of establishments seeking permission to deploy up to 200 workers, the municipal corporation commissioner or the additional deputy commissioner will grant permission to a maximum of 2,000 people each in their jurisdiction in the first phase.In case there is no municipal corporation in the district, the maximum number of permissions shall be restricted to 2,000 people in that district.For establishments seeking permission to deploy more than 200 workers, the deputy commissioner will grant permission to a maximum of 3,000 people in the district in first phase. Workers deployed for in-situ construction projects shall not be accounted for in these permission limits.Outlining the restrictions on workforce deployment the government had on Sunday said for the industrial, commercial and private establishments (excluding IT and IT-enabled services) having workforce requirement of more than 20 people, 50% of the workforce will be allowed to be deployed. Units having workforce requirement of not more than 20 people will be allowed 100% deployment.For IT and IT-enabled services units seeking deployment of more than 20 people, 33% or 10 people, whichever is higher, will be allowed and for units wanting to deploy up to 20 persons, 50% of the workforce will be allowed. For in-situ construction projects, operations will be allowed with 50% of the total workforce. However, no movement passes will be issued.For non in-situ construction projects such as roads, building, industrial projects, operations will be allowed with 50% of the total workforce with issuance of blue passes, the guidelines said.‘Be practical, have trust in us’Entrepreneurs from Haryana on Monday sought a more affirmative approach from the state government to resume industrial operations in the state. JN Mangla, president of Gurgaon Industrial Association said the government seems to be in some ambiguity over the resumption of industrial activity.“The impression which I am getting from the GIA members is that the government does not want economic activity to be resumed. They just want to bide time till May 3. The conditions imposed makes it practically impossible to run the enterprise smoothly,” he said.Mangla said the industry is apprehensive about the provisions of challan and prosecution. The government has not been able to give confidence to the industrialists,” Mahal remarked.A Panipat exporter, Amit Goel said the guidelines do not seem to be practical. “We should be allowed to start administrative operations by allowing 3-4 persons from the management staff. Subsequently, permission to scale up the manufacturing can be given. Also, we suggest that workers who want to come on bike or cycle should be allowed. That’s better than bringing them in buses,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-restrictions-in-place-for-haryana-enterprise-planning-to-resume-operations-from-today/story-qilffbw7bFCPhmTH9iFUdK.html

Well, the corona crisis might not disappear like the magician’s hat, but a little bit of entertainment might leave a long-lasting smile on your face amid the tense environment. And this was exactly what a shelter house, for migrant labourers, recently witnessed in a magic show by illusionist Rajkumar. READ | A shot of life: Delhi Police drive expecting mothers to hospitalsOrganised by the Delhi Police, this show was conducted at the shelter home in Lajpat Nagar, which has housed 250 migrant labourers including 30 women and 42 children. “This magic show was organised keeping in mind the migrant labourers who cannot go back to their villages, have nothing to do the whole day, and are missing their home. We wanted them to feel cared for and also get entertainment. And we also gave them the message of social distancing via the medium of this show,” says RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Southeast). The recent announcement of extension of the lockdown has increased anxiety among the migrant labourers and their families. Magician Rajkumar who called his show Magic With a Message, says, “Among those who were in the shelter home, there were rickshaw pullers, auto drivers and beggars. I wanted to entertain everyone and also motivate them, so that they feel better. They were delighted with my act. The response was such that the Delhi Police has requested me to perform more shows in various other shelter homes!” READ | A thought for Covid-19 warriors: Two Gurugrammers instal tents for police officersAnd Rajkumar ensured to take all necessary precautions while performing this show. He informs, “I wore double masks, and maintained a distance of five metres while performing. I even used the spray recommended by doctors to sanitised the mic and my magic props.” Author tweets @FizzyBuddha Follow @htTweets for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/it-s-magic-delhi-police-announces-showtime-for-migrant-labourers-at-shelter-home/story-Qm7hjvaemcRSz4BSINA3eK.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||In Delhi burial grounds, a tightrope between closure and caution||Until Covid-19 hit Delhi, he had never seen human bodies being treated like “untouchable objects”, says Mohammad Shamim, the 38- year-old supervisor at Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, a graveyard near Delhi GateIn many cases, even their own sons are reluctant to carry the dead on their shoulders for laying them to rest at the cemetery, Shamim adds.“I am the third generation of my family working here, but we have never seen people being so afraid of touching the bodies of their relatives. The other day, a few relatives of a man who died of Covid-19 came to attend the burial, but some of them got scared and left as soon as the hospital van carrying the body arrived at the cemetery gate. In another case, a few neighbours of a person who died of Covid-19 had to come for the burial, as relatives refused to join.” Shamim has overseen burial of 26 Covid-19 victims.The disease has now claimed 45 lives and infected 2,003 others in Delhi. The administration is enforcing a strict lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, and all funerals have to be in line with procedures laid down by the government.Shamim manages a team of gravediggers, gardeners, and security guards at the cemetery. His job is to ensure that all the burials at the cemetery take place smoothly. These days, he says, his job has become “dangerous” and “challenging” because he is supervising the burial of Covid-19 victims almost every day. On Friday, four; and on Saturday two victims of Covid-19 were buried at the cemetery.The cemetery office, he says, gets calls from the Capital’s designated Covid-19 hospitals with details of patients who have died. The bodies then arrive at the cemetery in a hearse provided by the hospitals in line with the Delhi government’s Standard Operating Procedure. Similar rules and guidelines apply to crematoriums.“Bodies generally come after noon, but two hours before the bodies arrive, the relatives come for a briefing about how the burial will proceed,” said Shamim, who lives in a house within the cemetery. “ I advise them to bring personal protection suits, gloves, masks, sanitisers, and ropes to lower the body into the grave,” he added.The cemetery has earmarked a separate area for the burial of Covid 19 victims -- a large clearing about 150 metres away from the main burial site.“ In a normal burial, the grave is dug by our gravedigger; and it is generally three feet deep. But for the Covid-19 victims, the grave is 10 feet deep, and we have to use earth-moving machines to dig the graves,” said Shamim.“Traditionally, the relatives lower the body into the grave with their own hands after performing prayers, but in case of Covid 19 victims, the body is tied with ropes and lowered into the grave, ” he added on a WhatApp call with HT on Friday.In Islamic tradition, a burial is a simple yet personal ceremony. Before the body is laid to rest, those attending the funeral are allowed to have a look at the face of the dead, and to say a personal prayer for the soul of the departed. Relatives of the dead help place the body in the grave. Covid-19 has changed all that.The body of a Covid 19 victim, Shamim says, has now arrived, and switches to a video call to show us live what transpires.Shamim, who has long, floppy hair, is wearing a white cap, a mask and gloves — and standing about 50 metres from the grave. With him is the operator of the earthmoving machine, who has dug the grave in advance. About nine men are at the burial site, including the two health care workers in personal protective gear who have come with the hearse, parked a few metres away.Two of the mourners are in protective suits. They are the only ones near the body — others, all wearing masks, are standing a few metres away, but come closer to the body, maintaining distance, when the prayers are performed. The two men in protective suits try to tie the rope to the feet and chest to lower the body into the grave. They seem to fumble, and Shamim shouts to the men, keeping the video call on.“Not like this. Lift the body a bit,” he is heard saying.Finally, the men in protective suits manage to tie the ropes. The need help to lower the body into the deep grave. No one volunteers for a while, and then a relative comes forward. Finally, the three men manage to lower the body into its final resting place.He now tells the operator of the earthmover to cover the grave. The burial is over in less than 30 minutes. Shamim switches to a voice call as he walks back towards the cemetery’s office.“Usually, we help the dead person’s relatives with the burial, but I am scared to get close to the bodies of Covid-19 victims. When I return home late in the evening, I take a bath with water mixed with antiseptic liquid before entering my house. I am worried about the safety of my four daughters and wife,” sais Shamim. “The scenes from the burial haunt me day and night. It is the saddest way to leave the world.”Haji Faiyazuddin, the secretary of the managing committee at Jadid Qabristan Ahle Islam, says that the staff is following all the guidelines laid down by both the state and central governments, including the precautions that have to be taken by employees of the cemetery.“We decided to earmark a part of the cemetery to Covid-19 victims so that relatives of victims do not face problems. We do not charge fee from them. Eventually, we will cover the Covid-19 burial area with a wall; the structure will serve as a reminder of what the city went through,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-delhi-burial-grounds-a-tightrope-between-closure-and-caution/story-u1hUtK0Rx0vDQvsSSw1ykN.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||How Covid-19 is affecting dialysis patients||Kanchan Devi, 45, died last week after at least four hospitals were forced to refuse life-saving dialysis in the city. She had been on maintenance dialysis – a procedure to filter blood the way a healthy kidney does – twice a week for two-and-a-half years after she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.“My mother got her last dialysis on April 7 and was to get the next one on April 11. The private hospital where she was undergoing treatment asked us to get a Covid-19 test done before the next visit. We got the test report on April 9 and I called the hospital. They said that they could not do the dialysis because the centre had to be shut down (as a patient there had died of Covid-19),” said her son Rishabh Soni.The family then started calling all hospitals in east Delhi.“We called up three private hospitals and one government hospital, but they all refused to taker her in. Finally, we had to take her to the emergency department of a private hospitals because her condition started deteriorating. She was given dialysis but it was too late, she died,” said Soni.What is dialysis? Dialysis is a medical procedure that removes excess water and toxins from the blood of the people with impaired kidney function. Who needs dialysis?Patients with acute kidney injury -- where the kidney is unable to perform its function suddenly -- need dialysis. This may be reversible if the underlying condition is healed. Patients with end-stage kidney failure -- whose kidneys have lost 85 to 90% of their function -- need maintenance dialysis two to three times a week to take over the function of their kidney. This is not reversible and the patients need it till they get a kidney transplant. Why are dialysis patients at a higher risk from Covid-19?Patients undergoing dialysis usually have multiple co-morbid conditions like hypertension and diabetesThey are usually old*They are also immunocompromised*They visit hospitals often for dialysisHer treatment was interrupted after east Delhi’s Shanti Mukund hospital had to shut its dialysis unit. At least three persons undergoing dialysis at the centre had tested positive for the infection, with one person succumbing to it.Patients from at least two other private hospitals offering dialysis – south-east Delhi’s Moolchand hospital and east Delhi’s Ahimsa Dham – also had to scramble to get dialysis at other hospitals after their centres were shut down. In Ahimsa Dham, at least two people had tested positive of whom one had died of Covid-19, and at least six patients from Moolchand hospital’s dialysis unit had tested positive for the infection. “When the cases were first reported, we immediately asked the centres to shut their services. All the patients who had undergone dialysis after the first person tested positive were put on surveillance and we are still in the process of testing them,” said an official from Delhi’s health department, on condition of anonymity. To help the people in Delhi get the life-saving procedure, the Delhi government ordered that no hospital shall refuse emergency care to any patients. And, strict action, including cancellation of registration, maybe taken for denying care for not having a negative Covid-19 report.Over-stretched dialysis centresBesides hospitals unwilling to take in patients who might have the infection, over-stretched dialysis facilities are adding to the woes of those who have been displaced from these three hospitals. “The hospitals do not want to take the chance of accepting a patient who might have the infection as it puts their other patients in jeopardy,” said the official from Delhi government.“What will happen to the patients who have been undergoing regular treatment? Most dialysis centres in the city run at capacity and do not have space to accommodate the 50 to 100 patients,” said Akshat Garg, director, Deep Chand Dialysis Centre (DCDC), which runs around 60 dialysis machines in partnership with the Delhi government. “The government needs to earmark a separate facility for suspected or positive Covid-19 cases.”Lok Nayak hospital, which is a dedicated Covid-19 faciltiy – on Sunday earmarked eight of its in-house dialysis machines for Covid-19 patients. The other machines run under public-private partnership (PPP) have been moved to other DCDC centres for now. India currently has more than 1.5 million people suffering from end-stage renal disease, with about 200,000 being added to that total every year. Why are dialysis patients at riskRepeated exposure to the hospital environment coupled with lower immunity puts people requiring dialysis at a higher risk of getting the infection and developing severe symptoms. “They usually also have additional comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension. Multiple hospital visits in a week also puts them at a risk of getting the infection,” said Dr RP Mathur, senior consultant of nephrology at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS).Mohin Khar, 78, has been going for dialysis sessions twice a week for two years now. She started wearing a mask two months ago when cases of Covid-19 first started being reported. She religiously washes her hand every 15 minutes. “We also ensure that she takes a proper diet and maintains weight as prescribed by the doctor. We also try to keep her engaged and happy,” her son said. And, hospitals are taking care to ensure that these vulnerable people do not get the infection.At the hospital Khar goes to, Max hospital, Vaishali, everybody is checked for fever and other symptoms. They have to sanitise their hands once when they enter and then again when they enter the dialysis ward. “To ensure ease of travel during the lockdown, the hospital had also issued us a letter that specifies the dialysis schedule and the name of the attendant. The police let us pass whenever we show the letter,” the son said. The doctors have also created a WhatsApp group of the patients coming to the dialysis centre where they can check in on the patients.“Inside the ward, we clean all the surfaces, change the sheets and seat the patients at a distance to minimise the risk of transmitting the infection. Anyone who had Covid-19 like symptoms is taken to a separate room for the dialysis and a test is done to check for the infection,” said Dr. Manoj K Singhal, director, nephrology and kidney transplant medicine, Max Hospital, Vaishali. At ILBS, in addition to checking people for symptoms before entering the dialysis ward, washing hands and other precautions, screens have been placed between two patients to further minimise the risk of the infection being transmitted within the ward.The asymptomatic Covid-19 patients have the dialysis centres worried as it is not possible to test everyone before each session. “It is very difficult to manage dialysis patients in this scenario. All the staff members have to wear complete PPE in case there is even a slight possibility that someone might have the infection. If anyone does test positive that would mean the facility shutting down, the staff being quarantined. And, it is not possible to test these patients every time they come for dialysis, some people come thrice a week,” said Dr Suman Nayak, senior consultant of renal transplant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/how-covid-19-is-affecting-dialysis-patients/story-zKXDsVd50rrKoY4HrXKLVN.html
21-04-2020||Delhi||Antibody tests begin in Delhi to identify plasma donors||The first batch of 42,000 rapid testing kits arrived in Delhi on Friday, which are to be deployed to evaluate 92 cured patients, being discharged from Lok Nayak hospital for plasma therapy trial, to treat the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as well as containment zones and hotspot areas. Plasma therapy uses one of the blood components rich in the virus-fighting antibodies in people who have recovered from Covid-19 to help critical patients fight the virus better.“The blood samples of 92 patients, who were being discharged from the hospital after recovering, are being collected. Based on the test report, they will be selected as donors,” said Dr JC Passey, director, Lok Nayak hospital, which is conducting the trial in collaboration with the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS).The plasma derived from the two millilitre blood samples collected from the recovered patients will be diluted repeatedly and tested with the rapid antibody kits to measure the amount of antibodies present.“The plasma is diluted 1:1, then 1:2, then 1:3, just to check till what level of dilution the sample comes out positive. The solutions that test positive at the highest level of dilution are the ones with high antibody levels. Ideally, a neutralising antibody test must be done where the antibody is added to a viral culture to check its effect, but that can only be done in BSL III laboratories. This is recommended as the best practice the world over in the absence of the other test,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, ILBS.The Delhi government did not use rapid testing kits for community testing on Sunday, as the kits are yet to reach the Capital’s district offices. The state health minister Satyendar Jain had on Saturday said that the “technicians” were undergoing training for the roll-out the next day.“We do not yet know how the tests would be done and whether the kits are prick-based or blood has to be drawn. There was some state-level workshop yesterday, but none of the staff from the district offices have been trained yet,” said an official from one of the district offices, requesting anonymity.An official from another district confirmed this, saying, “Once the kits reach us, we will be able to figure out how to go about them. The drive will likely begin from Monday or Tuesday.”The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had revised its guidelines on Saturday to allow rapid testing in hotspots. Earlier, the tests were to be done only in areas with very few or no cases at all.A third state-level official confirmed that testing would be started from Monday, to be done by the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) posted across government dispensaries in the city. “They will go into the community to perform tests,” said the third official. The testing will be started in all hotspots across the city at once.To scale up testing, the district administration has arranged mobile testing vans and makeshift camps outside containment zones, said an official from the chief minister’s office.Meanwhile, Jain did not rule out the possibility of community transmission in Delhi, citing around 200 cases for which the sources could not be traced so far while some were asymptomatic, had no travel history, or came in contact with anyone with a travel history connected to a Covid-affected country. “There is a chance (of community transmission). We will be in a better position to say anything after the 42,000 rapid antibody tests are conducted in a week,” he said.Delhi stumbled into another crisis on Sunday with food distribution centres in the city having come under the radar of health teams, after a volunteer tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2. Following this, 700 workers spread across several food distribution centres had to be quarantined and the staff replaced immediately. The food centres in Delhi collectively provide meals twice a day to around a million people currently, most of whom are migrant workers, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said all those who visit the centres regularly, assuming the same set of people more or less depend on the same centres for food, and officials and volunteers deployed across over 1,500 food distribution centres in the city – which includes shelter homes, school buildings and community halls – will be among the first batches to be tested with the rapid antibody kits.Unlike real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits which detect the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, the rapid tests detect antibodies in the blood and indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus. It can show results within 30 minutes. Once a person tests positive after the antibody test, an RT-PCR test is done to confirm the result.Collection of samples for the rapid antibody test is also much easier than for the RT-PCR test. “Taking a throat swab generates aerosols that may contain the virus and infect the healthcare worker taking the sample. The healthcare workers have to be in proper PPE kits for collecting RT PCR samples,” said another Delhi government health official.To encourage RT-PCR test in the community, the government set up 22 Covid-19 sample collection centres in hotels and dharmashalas and started giving ₹100 as incentive per sample to each team collecting the samples in the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/antibody-tests-begin-in-delhi-to-identify-plasma-donors-food-distribution-centre-workers-to-be-tested/story-NXNi0YXKTuaYtg6swk7hEO.html
21-04-2020||World||Covid-19: LA testing warns of more infections than known; toll over 42,000||Antibody tests for the coronavirus has showed the number of infections in the Los Angeles county , California could be 28 to 55 times higher than the number of reported confirmed cases, suggesting the possibility that many more people are infected in the United States than currently known.The total number of infections stood at 787,960 on Tuesday, up by 25,240; and 42,364 fatalities, up by 1,433, continuing declining single-day toll from the record high yet of 4,591 last Friday.The Los Angeles county anti-body testing results point to a more widespread presence of the infection in the population than understood and, more worrying for public health officials, many of those of infected could be asymptomatic and thus be carrying out the virus without realizing it, and passing it on.The antibody testing, also called the serology test, checks for antibodies in people who may or may not be symptomatic, unlike the tests being used more popularly now that only checks people who are demonstrating all or one of the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.Researchers of the University of Southern California conducted the study on 863 individuals and found, as they reported Monday, about 2.8% to 5.6% of the county’s adult population has antibody to the virus, that is approximately 221,000 to 442,000 adults in the count. And that estimate, they said, is 28 to 55 times higher than the 7,994 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported to the county at the time the study was conducted.“We haven’t known the true extent of Covid-19 infections in our community because we have only tested people with symptoms, and the availability of tests has been limited,” lead investigator Neeraj Sood, said in a statement. He is a professor of public policy. “The estimates also suggest that we might have to recalibrate disease prediction models and rethink public health strategies,” he added, with obvious implications for the rest of the country.New York began antibody testing Monday and these tests form a crucial part of all plans of reopening the country to make sure the virus was not left undetected among asymptomatic populations. But these are only beginning to be tolled out now as the country continues to grapple with a shortage the usual kits. States have asked the federal government for help.As lockdown protests continued across the country three Three Republican-ruled states in the south have announced plans to begin easing the restrictions. South Carolina allowed the the reopening of department stores and flea markets on Monday, Georgia will allow gyms, spas and saloon to start from Friday and Tennessee will not extend the lockdown after April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-la-testing-warns-of-more-infections-than-known-toll-over-42-000/story-KgghlYATgV9meW1ybHMdNM.html

All precautions are in place to make sure his work environment is safe and healthy,” Ghani’s spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said on Twitter.Ghani and his wife were both tested and “both results are negative,” he added.About 20 workers in Kabul’s presidential palace and a dozen more in an adjoining office had contracted the virus, officials told AFP on Saturday.Recent official photos had shown 70-year-old Ghani wearing a mask and gloves, and mainly holding online meetings with officials.But on Tuesday a healthy-looking Ghani appeared on TV and urged Afghans to take the virus seriously.“Coronavirus took all by surprise,” he said. “But we, from the first days, took this virus seriously and by the grace of God the number of fatalities in our country is lower than in other countries,” he said.Neighbouring Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan will also be tested for COVID-19, his doctor announced.The test comes after Faisal Edhi, the owner and operator of Pakistan’s largest private charity, said he had tested positive for the highly contagious disease. He met with Khan last week in Islamabad.Pakistan and Afghanistan, where handshakes and close family gatherings are the norm, have both struggled to persuade citizens to practice social distancing.So far, Pakistan has confirmed at least 192 deaths from coronavirus and Afghanistan 36, but many believe the low numbers are because of limited access to testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-negative-for-coronavirus-after-palace-outbreak/story-SwGBJMdamvsK4mAYrlghOI.html

21-04-2020||World||If Not Kim Jong Un, who? Possible heirs to North Korea’s throne||The mystery surrounding Kim Jong Un’s health exposes deep uncertainty about North Korea’s line of succession more than eight years after he took power.While the Kim family has ruled for seven decades by passing power between male heirs like other hereditary dynasties, the 36-year-old Kim has named no successor. His own children are still young and the ruling family’s surviving adults all face potential barriers to their rise.Here are some possible successors:Kim Yo Jong, SisterPart royal representative, part personal assistant, Kim Yo Jong has emerged as one of her older brother’s closest aides. Earlier this month, she was reinstated as an alternate Politburo member of the ruling Workers Party of Korea. As such, she’s the only other member of the Kim family with anything approaching real power in the regime.Although she became the first member of the ruling family to visit Seoul and accompanied Kim Jong Un in his summits with U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping, she’s also performed mundane tasks, such as helping the leader extinguish a cigarette during a train stop in China. Whether North Korea’s patriarchal elite will support a relatively young woman as the country’s next “supreme leader” is unclear.Kim Jong Un’s SonA male heir would provide the most conventional line of succession in a dynasty previously ruled by Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, and founded by his grandfather, Kim Il Sung. South Korean intelligence said Kim married Ri Sol Ju, a former singer, in 2009 and is thought to have three children.Problem is, the children have yet to be officially mentioned in state media and the oldest is believed to be a son born in 2010, according to South Korea’s DongA Ilbo newspaper. Dennis Rodman, the offbeat former basketball star who visited North Korea, said in 2013 that he also held a baby daughter named Ju Ae. That would likely require any of the children to rule under some form of regent until they come of age.Kim Han Sol, NephewKim Han Sol, born in 1995, may have become heir-apparent himself if his father, Kim Jong Nam, hadn’t fallen out with Kim Jong Il and gone into exile in the Chinese gambling hub of Macau. Kim Jong Nam was Kim Jong Un’s older half-brother and his most serious rival, frequenting casinos and occasionally criticizing his younger sibling’s regime.Any hopes that Kim Han Sol might have had of returning to Pyongyang were dashed in 2017, when his father was murdered at the Kuala Lumpur airport by two women who smeared VX nerve agent on his face. Chinese police later arrested several North Koreans dispatched to Beijing on suspicion of plotting to kill Kim Han Sol, South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported at the time. His whereabouts remain unknown.Kim Jong Chol, BrotherKim Jong Chol, Kim Jong Un’s only surviving brother, would be another longshot, since he has shown more interest in guitars than politics. Thae Yong Ho, the former No. 2 at North Korea’s embassy in London who defected to South Korea, once said Kim’s elder brother “doesn’t own any official title” adding he’s “just a really talented guitarist.”Kim Jong Il saw his middle son as “girlish,” according to the person who goes by the pen name of Kenji Fujimoto and claims to have been the personal sushi chef for the former North Korean leader. In 2011, South Korean broadcaster KBS captured Kim Jong Chol enjoying an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore. Little else is known about him except that he studied in Switzerland and is a fan of U.S. professional basketball like his brother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-not-kim-jong-un-who-possible-heirs-to-north-korea-s-throne/story-sNQMmCr4OuI2zWtnJzgDFL.html
21-04-2020||World||Donald Trump says will suspend immigrations to save Covid-19 jobs losses||President Donald Trump on Monday said he is temporarily suspending immigration to protect American jobs threatened by the dire economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. India has been the top country of origin for legal immigrants to the US in recent years, with over 126,000 in 2017.“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” theAmerican president said in a post on twitter Monday evening.More than 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in last four weeks of stay-at-home lockdowns in force in most parts of the United States.It was not immediately clear from President Trump’s tweet what kind of immigrants would be impacted — new immigrants are mostly those applying for Green Cards on professional and family visas, refugees and asylum seekers.The Trump administration was considering suspending some work visas and Green Cards for 120 days, CNN reported Tuesday morning citing sources. HT was not able to independently verify it.But temporary foreign workers hired on H-1B, tourists and business visitors — the most popular visas for Indians — are unlikely to be impacted because they are on non-immigrant visas.The order is likely to be challenged in court, said industry sources.A response was awaited from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services for what to expect, and who are likely to be impacted, or not. It was not clear if immigrations applications already in the system will be frozen because of the order, and if that could happen to Green Cards as well.More than 1 million new immigrants are admitted to the United states every year. India sent the most in 2017 with 126,000 people, according to a Pew study. It was followed by Mexico (124,000), China (121,000) and Cuba (41,000). Overall, people from Mexico comprise the largest group of foreign-born US national in 2018 at 25%, followed by India and China, with 6% each, according to the same report.There were no indications Tuesday when the US president planned to issue the executive order, which could effectively shut down the legal immigration system for an indefinite period.While Trump has striven to block all illegal immigration, a key election promise, he has explicitly and repeatedly supported legal, merit-based immigration. The annual diversity visa, granted to residents of underrepresented countries, have been discontinued and intake of refugees has also been curtailed.The number of immigrant visas have dropped by about 25% from 617,752 in 2016, the year before President Trump took office, to 462,422, according to official US data.There has been a growing chorus of demand from Republican lawmakers and conservative analysts and commentators in recent days demanding a suspension of immigration in view of the increasing job losses due to the epidemic and the shutdown in place to slow and stop it.“25 million Americans are unemployed today. All immigration should be halted until every citizen who wants a job has a job,” Paul Gosar, a Republican congressman from Arizona and staunch Trump ally, wrote on Twitter last week. And Jeff Sessions, former US attorney general and estranged Trump aide who has been an immigration hawk, has called on the federal government to “IMMEDIATELY halt immigration to the United States until Americans are back to work”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-will-suspend-immigrations-to-save-covid-19-jobs-losses/story-2qsYsGlnoiUTvvqC3JQLJJ.html

Later today, at around about 2pm (local time), he will be speaking with President Trump,” the spokesperson said.However, it was stressed that Johnson would be “continuing his recovery at Chequers and isn’t formally doing government work”, with Raab continuing to be in charge as his deputy.Johnson has been recuperating at his prime ministerial country residence in Buckinghamshire since his discharge from St. Thomas’ Hospital in London last week, after he tested positive for coronavirus and had to be shifted into intensive care for a few days as his condition worsened.It is customary for the British prime minister to hold a weekly audience with the monarch, which had been transformed into telephone engagements as the coronavirus lockdown came into force last month. Johnson will now be resuming the phone audience with the Queen, who turned 94 on Tuesday, after a three-week hiatus due to his illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-on-way-back-to-work-to-speak-to-trump-and-queen/story-MVMUYrtwywMWG84CHYCn4N.html
21-04-2020||World||China extensively censored Coronavirus outbreak info, impact felt globally: Media watchdog||China “extensively” censored information on the coronavirus outbreak, a leading media watchdog has said, adding that the negative effects of Beijing’s “information hyper-control” system have been experienced globally amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated “the many crises” threatening press freedom across the world, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Tuesday, unveiling its annual press rankings.The RSF called out authoritarian governments for taking advantage of the international health crisis to push through repressive media laws, censure journalists and censor news.“Both China (177th) and Iran (173rd) censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively,” the RSF report said, adding: “China, which is trying to establish a ‘new world media order’ maintains its system of information hyper-control, of which the negative effects for the entire world have been seen during the coronavirus public health crisis”.China has been accused of downplaying and covering up initial information of the coronavirus which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The severity of the “unknown fever” was downplayed and doctors who attempted to raise the alarm were harassed and detained; medics who shared their concerns within the community were rounded up as “rumourmongers” Until nearly the third week of January, officials did not publicly reveal the full picture of the outbreak, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to travel out of Wuhan.China, since the initial costly missteps, has largely brought the outbreak under control within the country.On Tuesday, the Chinese mainland reported 11 new confirmed Covid-19 cases, with four imported cases, and 37 new asymptomatic.Overall, the China now has over 4,600 deaths and more than 82,700 cases.Separately, RSF’s UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent told CNN Business that if there had been a free press in China and if the whistleblowers hadn’t been silenced, then this could have been prevented from turning into a pandemic.“Sometimes we can talk about press freedom in a theoretical way, but this shows the impact can at times be physical. It can affect all of our health,” she said.China’s foreign ministry dismissed the RSF’s report.Spokesperson Geng Shuang said that “this organisation has always held deep-rooted prejudice against China and their so-called report is not worth rebutting.”“China upholds the basic national policy of opening up to the outside word, and welcomes foreign media and journalists,” Geng said.“We are opposed to ideological biases against China, publication of fake news in the name of so-called press freedom as well as behaviors that are against journalistic ethics.”Norway topped the global index of media freedom for the fourth year in a row, with Scandinavian countries filling the top spots. Finland came in second, Denmark third and Sweden fourth.“The democratically elected presidents of two countries, Donald Trump in the United States (up 3 at 45th) and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil (down 2 at 107th), continue to denigrate the media and encourage hatred of journalists in their respective countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-extensively-censored-coronavirus-outbreak-info-impact-felt-globally-media-watchdog/story-cpGOiCYvqH4inGkcr8PxJO.html

Altogether 4,632 people have died of the disease, it said.Also, 37 new asymptomatic cases, including two from abroad, were reported on the mainland with 992 cases, including 180 from abroad, were still under medical observation.However, Chinese health officials apprehend a second wave of the coronavirus attack especially from hundreds of Chinese nationals returning from abroad.A Chinese health expert Zhang Wenhong said recently that China could be hit by a second wave of coronavirus cases in November this year as winter returns but by that time the country would be well prepared to deal with COVID-19.Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an emergency situation, some Chinese medics would be injected with coronavirus vaccines.In accordance with how the epidemic develops, in case of emergency, some medical staff would be injected with a newly developed coronavirus vaccine, Gao said, noting that any medicines and vaccines have their own research and development cycles. “I believe we could come up with vaccines with the joint efforts of everyone,” he was quoted as saying by state-run Global Times.China has approved three COVID-19 vaccine candidates for clinical trials.An adenovirus vector vaccine, developed by Institute of Military Medicine under the Academy of Military Sciences, was the first to be approved to enter a clinical trial.The first phase of the clinical trial was completed at the end of March, and the second phase started on April 12.It is the first COVID-19 vaccine in the world that has entered the second phase of clinical trial, according to World Health Organisation (WHO), the Xinhua report said. Several countries, including China are speeding up coronavirus vaccine development to cut the time span to few months instead of several years. Concerning the timetable for vaccine research and development, the director of the Chinese CDC said, “if you follow the normal procedure, the vaccine may not come out until the end of this year or early next year,” noting that if the situation continues worsening, medics might be injected with the vaccines by the end of this year. He also emphasised that this won’t be used among normal people, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-inject-medics-with-newly-developed-covid-19-vaccine-to-deal-with-any-emergency-health-official/story-2CyAJ1Uq0ei3moVTJJLnGI.html
21-04-2020||World||Pakistan quietly removes 4,000 from its terrorist watchlist: Report||Pakistan has discreetly removed the names of around 4,000 terrorists from its watchlist, including that of one of the major planners of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) startup has revealed.Due to Pakistan’s long history of exporting terror to India and the rest of the world, the country has been placed under grey list by Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global watchdog for terror funding.Dissatisfied with Pakistan’s efforts to curb terror-funding, the FATF in February noted that Islamabad had addressed only 14 points out of 27 conditions to get off the grey list.Also read: 5 times India dissed Pakistan’s propaganda during Covid-19 crisisThe FATF is to again evaluate Pakistan’s progress in June.The New York-based startup Castellum, which automates watchlist compliance, has found that in the last year and a half, Pakistan has deleted “3,800 names from the Proscribed Persons List, without explanation or notification to the public”.The Imran Khan government removed about 1,800 names from its terrorist watchlist since March 9th “without any public explanation, including Zaka ur-Rehman, an alias of the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader and alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks”, the Castellum report said.According to a FATF report, Pakistan’s terrorist watchlist had about 7,600 names in October 2018.Also read| ‘Bizarre’: India dismisses Pak PM’s tweet on discrimination against MuslimsCastellum.AI, which regularly uses new data sources, added the Pakistan Proscribed Persons List to its database on March 9.Between March 9 and March 27, Castellum.AI data showed that the Khan government removed 1,069 names from the Proscribed Persons List, and that all those names then appeared on Pakistan’s official denotified list. Since March 27, another 800 or so names have been deleted.To ensure that the AI looked at only the most likely cases where internationally listed terrorists were removed, the startup first downloaded the official Denotified List, then screening the names against its watchlist database.Following this, the AI removed all matches that did not match all name parts and removed all matches where the listed persons were not citizens of Afghanistan or Pakistan (the Proscribed Persons list seems to only have these two groups).Then the AI ensured that exculpatory information does not exist, for example, IDs that do not match, or news reports that the individual is deceased.The AI also ensured that the name, if not exact, matches an official alias. For example, Zaka Ur Rehman, who is more commonly known as Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi, but has an official alias ‘Zaki Ur Rehman’.“In the case of Zaka Ur Rehman, the difference between Zaka and Zaki fits within the parameters of an accurate phonetic translation. Castellum.AI also searched for the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader’s full name, Zaki Ur Rehman Lakhvi, on the Pakistan Proscribed Persons list, and he was not on the list. This means that if the removed name is a false positive, that Pakistan has not added the Lashkar-e-Taiba leader to its terrorism watchlist,” the report said.Pakistan’s Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) lead, the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), has provided no explanation for removal of the names.Castellum.AI provided data to the Wall Street Journal who in turn contacted the Pakistani government for comment.On April 15, an article was published in a Pakistani newspaper, saying that names were removed because “the list has been bloated up to 7,000 names with multiple inaccuracies such as the names of dead individuals, Afghan nationals, untraceable names without proper identifiers”.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-removes-names-of-4-000-terrorists-from-its-watchlist/story-yAQG1Qst4llUwFSDwZBPKL.html

CNN cited an anonymous U.S. official who said Kim was in “grave danger” after an unspecified surgery.The Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said it wouldn’t comment on the CNN report or another report by Daily NK, which cited anonymous sources saying Kim was recovering from heart surgery in the capital Pyongyang and that his condition was improving.The presidential Blue House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Speculation about Kim’s health was raised after he missed the celebration of his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, the country’s most important holiday.Also Watch | Coronavirus: S Korea starts own version of odd-even, rations purchase of masks Outside governments and media have a mixed record on tracking developments among North Korea’s ruling elite, made difficult by Pyongyang’s stringent control of information about them.In 2016, South Korea media quoted intelligence officials as saying Kim Jong Un had Ri Yong Gil, a former North Korean military chief, executed for corruption and other charges. But North Korea’s state media months later showed that Ri was alive and in possession of several new senior posts.Kim’s absence from state media often triggers speculations or rumors about his health.

Another 81 who were in the eatery did not. The infections, according to an analysis by Center for Disease Control (CDC) experts in China, took place because the three families were in the draught of the same air conditioner as the index patient, although they were on different tables. The findings now offer new insights -- how the virus travels (it infected only those in the air current while others were safe); the challenge in detecting infected persons (the index patient did not have any symptoms); and consequences for closed, air-conditioned spaces (restaurants, offices, even public transport) -- as the world struggles to determine how people can go back to everyday routines.“On January 23, family A travelled from Wuhan and arrived in Guangzhou. On January 24, the index case-patient (patient A1) ate lunch with 3 other family members (A2–A4) at restaurant X. Two other families, B and C, sat at neighbouring tables. Later that day, patient A1 experienced fever and cough and went to the hospital. By February 5, a total of nine others (four members of family A, three members of family B, and two members of family C) had become ill with Covid-19,” said the research letter published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.The researchers say the infections show the virus was spread through droplets carried in the air-conditioning draught. The lack of infection in others at two tables close by (but not in the line of the air flow), and in other floors of the restaurant appeared to suggest the virus did not spread through “aerosol transmission”. If a virus spreads as an aerosol, it is harder to contain since it lingers in the air for longer and disperses more easily over longer distances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ac-air-flow-spread-covid-19-in-china-restaurant/story-4XU9YVC3bAyAkHahV7bMOO.html

The nurses asked judges to order the defendants to provide masks and other protection to nurses.“These lawsuits were filed to protect our nurses, our patients and our communities from grossly inadequate and negligent protections,” said a statement from Pat Kane, the association’s executive director.The court filings said the hospitals were ignoring requirements by the state’s COVID-19 task force that healthcare workers receive an N95 respirator mask daily, and that the health department was not enforcing it.The Department of Health said it has taken every step necessary to ensure that healthcare workers have the needed support and supplies.Westchester Medical Center Health Network said its focus has been on protecting its workforce, while Montefiore said nurses were attacking the system while their colleagues were working to save lives.The association represents 42,000 nurses in the state, which leads the country with about 233,000 COVID-19 cases. The association said that 9,514 of its registered nurses have tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus and that 11 have died.The association asked a state judge to block the Department of Health from enforcing a directive requiring healthcare personnel to return to work only seven days after the onset of COVID-19, even if they still have symptoms. The nurses said the directive violated a state law adopted in March that provided quarantined workers 14 days paid sick leave.The filings described Westchester Medical Center as “like a war zone.”“We have been instructed to date our N95 respirators and to use the same N95 respirator for a week,” said Mary-Lynn Boyts, a nurse at Westchester Medical Center, in an affidavit.While tens of millions of Americans have been laid off or are working from home, safety is becoming a flashpoint for those who are staffing grocery stores, fast food restaurants and warehouses.Workers have stayed home from meat processing plants, which have been hit by coronavirus outbreaks, and Amazon.com Inc fired three employees who questioned the safety of its warehouses..The head of the Teamsters union told U.S. President Donald Trump last week that workers needed greater access to protective gear and disinfected workplaces before returning to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-nurses-sue-state-2-hospitals-over-inadequate-coronavirus-protection/story-YBrfisXus0beqq75hx15ON.html

Children’s Fund (UNICEF).UNICEF said children were nearly half of an estimated eight million people who will be hurt by the loss of about 1.7 million jobs this year as a result of businesses closing, salaries being suspended and other effects of lockdowns in the region.“It is evident that the pandemic is affecting children firsthand. Many families in the region are already becoming poorer due to the loss of jobs especially the daily-paid,” Ted Chaiban, UNICEF’s regional director in the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement issued on Monday from Amman. “Families are struggling to bring food to their table due to containment measures,” he added.About 110 million children are now at home and not in schools in the region, UNICEF said.Humanitarian agencies and NGOs say curfews and lockdowns are already making it difficult or impossible for many to provide for their families.UNICEF estimates that there are 25 million children in need, including refugees and internally displaced people from conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Sudan Palestinian territories, Iraq and Libya.The agency said it was appealing for $92 million to allow it to step up its efforts to combat COVID-19.Millions already lack health care, food, water and electricity in conflict-stricken countries where prices are rising and infrastructure damaged, UN and humanitarian agencies say.“The combination of lack or inadequate basic services, years of conflict in several parts of the region, poverty, deprivation and now COVID-19 are hitting vulnerable children the most, making their hard lives simply unbearable,” Chaiban said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-to-impoverish-millions-of-children-in-middle-east-as-caregivers-lose-jobs-unicef/story-2e252kCTe9AHrrfUm3Ys1H.html

You know, the strategic reserves,” Trump told reporters at his daily coronavirus press conference.“And we are looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves,” he added.Later in the briefing, he specified that he would only buy that amount if Congress authorized the funding -- or if the federal government could rent storage space to third parties for a fee.When prices eventually rebound, these vendors could sell their excess oil.US oil prices crashed to unprecedented lows Monday as futures in New York ended in negative territory for the first time amid a devastating supply glut that has forced traders to pay others to take the crude off their hands.The president had announced his intention on March 13 to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to the brim.As of April 17, it contained 635 million barrels of its current authorized limit of 713.5 million barrels. Stored in a complex of four underground sites along the Gulf coasts of Texas and Louisiana, in the south of the United States, the SPR has a total storage capacity of 727 million barrels.

The country’s top court has already ruled governors and mayors can decide on social isolation measures regardless of the federal government’s position. Bolsonaro, meanwhile, wants a quick reopening to stop the deterioration of Brazil’s faltering economy.“Everything done in excess ends up bringing problems. These measures did not reach their goal in some states,” Bolsonaro told journalists in front of the presidential residence in Brasilia. “I hope this is the last week of this quarantine, of this way of fighting the virus.”The Brazilian president favors a less restrictive model in which only those in high-risk groups would be quarantined at home until the end of the outbreak.After Bolsonaro replaced critic Luiz Henrique Mandetta with Nelson Teich as health minister, several governors and mayors said they were considering even stricter isolation measures in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.Teich previously published an article defending quarantine policies, but he has not spoken to the press since a vague introduction speech on Friday and it is unclear what he will do on the job.On Monday evening, Brazil’s health ministry shared a video in which Teich says there will be “a progressive, structured and planned exit from social isolation.” He also promised to raise the country’s capacity of testing from promised 24 million in the next weeks to up to 46 million.Brazil confirmed 113 deaths of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, putting the country’s total at 2,575. More than 40,000 people have contracted the disease in the South American nation, the highest figure in Latin America.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Bolsonaro’s comments came one day after he met outdoors with dozens of supporters who want the closing of the country’s congress and supreme court. His presence in such demonstration is drawing widespread repudiation in a nation that endured a military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985.The Brazilian president denied he was attacking the country’s democracy at the protest, but said: “I am actually the constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-seeks-end-to-social-isolation-measures-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-aUuijDci5Iz2I1YDBSsq6H.html

21-04-2020||World||Another ‘much loved’ Indian-origin doctor dies of Covid-19 in UK||Manjeet Singh Riyat, an emergency medicine consultant who was ‘hugely respected and much loved’ by colleagues and patients in Derbyshire, died on Monday after being infected by coronavirus, making him the latest Indian-origin medical professional to fall victim to the virus.Riyat, who got his medical qualifications from the University of Leicester in 1992, was the first Sikh accident and emergency consultant in the National Health Service, and was instrumental in building the emergency medicine service in Derbyshire, his hospital trust said.Gavin Boyle, chief executive of the hospital, said: “I want to pay tribute to Mr Manjeet Riyat, who has sadly passed away…He was an incredibly charming person and he was loved. Manjeet knew so many people here in the hospital, we will all miss him immensely”.Riyat’s colleague, Susie Hewitt, said: “In 2003, Manjeet became one of four consultants in Emergency Medicine at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary...Manjeet was enormously valued and much loved as a colleague, supervisor and mentor”.“Manjeet’s passion for teaching and contribution to medical education were constant during his career…he had many skills, but was most comfortable as an emergency medicine consultant”, she added. Riyat has left behind his wife and two sons.Earlier this month, cardio-thoracic surgeon Jitendra Kumar Rathod, who gained his qualifications in India and moved to the UK, passed away in Wales. The Cardiff and Vale University Health Board described him as ‘a greatly respected doctor and colleague’.Britain’s health officials have paid tributes to other Indian-origin medical professionals who passed away in recent days, including Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Vivek Sharma, Rajesh Kalraiya, Krishan Arora, Amrik Bamotra, Sophie Fagan and Pooja Sharma.Initial hospital data suggests that minority non-white people in the UK constitute 35 per cent among those in critical care hospitals, prompting an inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-much-loved-indian-origin-doctor-dies-of-covid-19-in-uk/story-X6W71Wbu01ZgQRHBTK8rYJ.html

The presidential palace has refused to comment on the development. Ghani has reportedly been self-isolating, although he still meets daily with some senior officials.At 70 and a cancer survivor, Ghani is considered in the higher risk category.Afghanistan has reported only 993 positive cases even as the International Office of Migration, which monitors the movement of refugees, says more than 200,000 Afghans have returned from Iran in the last two months.Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the region with more than 82,000 confirmed cases and over 5,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghani-self-isolates-as-his-staff-test-positive/story-7CbEfIUSbgHBfWUpTcOLcI.html
21-04-2020||World||‘China’s victim, not culprit’: Beijing disses calls for probe into Covid-19 origin||China on Monday rejected Australia’s call for a probe examining the global response to the coronavirus pandemic -- including Beijing’s early handling of the outbreak.Washington and several allies have accused China of failing to adequately respond to the viral disease threat in the weeks after it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. US President Donald Trump also cut funding to the World Health Organization after accusing it of mismanaging the crisis and covering up the seriousness of the initial outbreak before it spread around the world and killed more than 165,000 people. But Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations disrespected “the Chinese people’s tremendous efforts and sacrifices” in fighting the contagion. “Any question about China’s transparency in the prevention and control of epidemic situation is not in line with facts,” Geng told a regular press briefing.He was speaking in response to a question about Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, who a day earlier said her country would “insist” on the probe into the response by Beijing and the WHO. Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online in December.There were also questions about China’s recording of COVID-19 infections, as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the outbreak.Chinese scientists have rejected conspiracy theories pushed by some in the US government claiming the virus could have originated at a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan. But Trump has suggested that China could have been “knowingly responsible” for spreading the infection and could face consequences as a result. bys/gle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-victim-not-culprit-beijing-disses-calls-for-probe-into-covid-19-origin/story-j0yAVjclTr6s128eydZVPJ.html
21-04-2020||World||Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya loses appeal against extradition in UK High Court||Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Monday lost his appeal in the UK High Court against the 2018 order to extradite him to India to face charges of financial irregularities.Mallya, 64, is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences amounting to Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) from several Indian banks.The case will now go to home secretary Priti Patel for a final decision on his extradition.Justices Irwin and Elisabeth Laing handed down their verdict by email.The flamboyant businessman was ordered to be extradited to India back in December 2018 on a request from the Indian government that has accused him of “knowingly misrepresenting” the profitability of his companies when he sought bank loans in 2009.Also read |  Vijay Mallya phoned lobbyist aide, asked for help to ‘manage his case’: EDIn their 46-page judgement, Justice Irwin and Justice Laing said: “(In) our judgment, the SDJ (senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot) was entitled to find that there was a prima facie case of fraud by false representation…(We) reject the submission that the SDJ was wrong to find a prima facie case of conspiracy to defraud”.The judges rejected the six grounds on which Mallya’s lawyer, Claire Montgomery, had appealed, and upheld Arbuthnot’s judgement.The judges said: “It is clear beyond any doubt that the SDJ directed herself properly. It is clear she had the criminal burden and standard in mind when she considered whether there was a prima facie case”.“The role of an extradition court considering this question is to consider whether a tribunal of fact, properly directed, could reasonably and properly convict on the basis of the evidence. The extradition court is, emphatically, not required itself to be sure of guilt in order to send the case to the Home Secretary”.Also read | ‘Please banks, take your money’: Vijay Mallya appeals again after UK court hearing“The extradition court must conclude that a tribunal of fact, properly directed and considering all the relevant evidence, could reasonably be sure of guilt. There is no basis upon which it could be said the SDJ misunderstood this, or that she misdirected herself”, they added.India’s case for his extradition rests on, what had been described in court proceedings by the prosecution as, the “three chapters of dishonesty”: misrepresentations to various banks to acquire loans, the misuse of the loans and his conduct after the banks recalled the loans.The Crown Prosecution Service, on behalf of the Indian government, argued that there was at least a case that Mallya had to answer back home and a reasonable jury could conclude that the businessman and his company indulged in conspiracy, fraud, and used loans for unintended purposes, including part of the loans going to his motor racing team.Mark Summers, CPS lawyer, reminded Justice Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing of the high court of England and Wales that in extradition cases, British courts are solely required to establish whether the person requested has a prima facie case to answer, not to establish the truth.To that extent, he argued, the magistrates court had taken into account all relevant evidence and had ruled that Mallya had a prima facie case to answer and that he needed to be extradited to India to face trial.Mallya’s lawyer Claire Montgomery, on the other hand, has insisted that Mallya’s inability to repay bank loans was due to a genuine business failure and the result of wider challenges facing the aviation industry at the time.Mallya has, on numerous occasions, alleged that he was prepared to repay the loans. “I have made repeated offers to pay 100% of the amount borrowed by KFA to the Banks… Neither are Banks willing to take money and neither is the ED willing to release their attachments which they did at the behest of the Banks. I wish the FM would listen in this time of crisis,” he tweeted on March 31.In New Delhi, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBII) and ED, which have been pursuing the case against Mallya, welcomed the verdict.“It is a significant achievement in continuing a war against economic fugitives who have been managing to stay away from the judicial process in the country. It also validates the painstaking and meticulous investigation done by the CBI,” CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fugitive-businessman-vijay-mallya-loses-appeal-against-extradition-in-uk-high-court/story-Q7eyztfPTsuexFo8OMsMaM.html
21-04-2020||India||Plan afoot for contactless checks at airports, Metro||New Delhi: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is preparing fresh Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for its security operations at airports and the Delhi Metro once the lockdown is lifted, and the measures may include contactless frisking, the use of Aarogya Setu app to identify Covid-19 patients entering security gates, and a reduction in passengers in train coaches, three officials familiar with the development said.For its own security personnel who come in direct contact with millions of passengers every day at Metro stations and airports, CISF plans sanitisation of hands after clearing every two or three people, personal protection equipment (PPE) for all staff, and sanitisation of X-ray machines and other equipment on a regular basis.Suburban rail services and air travel are prohibited at the moment to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. The government has not yet come up with guidelines on when these services will resume, and it remains unclear if they will be operational even when the second phase of the national lockdown ends on May 3. But officials believe that additional precautions will be needed, whenever the ban is lifted, and it can no longer be “business as usual”. Rajesh Ranjan, CISF’s director general, said the key objective was to ensure that both security personnel as well as commuters were protected from the infection, but with minimal inconvenience, and without compromising on safety. “We’re looking at changing the process for access at airports and Metro stations. The SOPs are in final stages and will be sent to the civil aviation ministry and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) soon,” he said.On contactless frisking, Ranjan said, “We are exploring how to use contactless frisking as much as we can. However, it will not be possible to make it fully contactless and pat-down searches will depend on person to person.”He added that the businesses inside airports and metro stations will need to have extra access control for their employees. CISF personnel will also be trained about the additional personal safety measures they have to follow — on duty, and after going back to their barracks.For Metro services, the proposed SOP entails reducing the number of passengers by at least half in each coach so that social distancing measures are followed.At airports, a second official said, the CISF is considering suggesting to the government that passengers be asked to download Aarogya Setu app before coming to the airport for a colour coded risk analysis to identifying Covid-19 patients. All CISF personnel across the country have already been told to download the Aarogya Setu application. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has consistently encouraged citizens to download the app, and even mentioned the possibility of it being used as an “e-pass” for travel and mobility. The Aarogya Setu is one of several contact tracing applications in use across the world. Every time two people who have installed the application come within metres of each other, the application creates a record that can later be pulled in case of these individuals develops Covid-19 and the other needs to be warned off being infected.The SOPs propose that passengers are asked to sanitise their hands at pre-embarkation security checkpoints and the security hold area. The paramilitary force is also likely to advise airlines to provide small bottles of hand sanitisers to passengers once they pass the security hold area, since CISF doesn’t allow liquids at airport security checkpoints. The SOPs pertaining to maintaining proper queues and distancing, and the use of PPEs, will also be followed in other government installations where CISF is deployed, the second official said. The force is augmenting its present stock of face masks, gloves, alcohol-based sanitisers, and other PPE kits so that they have sufficient numbers available for an initial period of three months.Apart from this, almost all 349 units of CISF across the country are distributing face masks, sanitisers, dry soaps, dry ration/cooked meals to the underprivileged in the surrounding areas on a regular basis while maintaining proper hygiene and distancing, CISF spokesperson Hemendra Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-afoot-for-contactless-checks-at-airports-metro/story-OqU6ZnwyFlNbDuBvnv5SHP.html
21-04-2020||India||Central teams visit hot spots across states||Mumbai/Bhopal/Lucknow: The inter-ministerial central teams formed to assess the situation in Covid-19 hotspot districts on Tuesday began their three-day visits to Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.A team led by additional secretary Manoj Joshi visited Mumbai’s Worli Koliwada area for an inspection of the containment area, which has the highest cases in Mumbai, 425. Another team led by Sanjay Malhotra, additional secretary, held a meeting with Pune’s divisional commissioner and other senior officials.A state government official, requesting anonymity, said the team raised concerns over the high mortality rate in Mumbai. “They were also concerned that containment in certain areas such as Dharavi was not being followed strictly,” the official said.Officials said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, health minister Rajesh Tope and other top Maharashtra government officials interacted with the central teams through video conferencing. Thackeray told the teams that the Centre should make arrangement for travel of six lakh migrant labourers stuck in Maharashtra and also study why a majority of Covid-19 patients in India are asymptomatic.Maharashtra is the worst-hit state by the pandemic.In Madhya Pradesh, a central team visited Indore’s containment zones, accompanied by several officials including divisional commissioner Akash Tripathi and district collector Manish Singh.Tripathi said the team visited various containment zones to see if the lockdown restrictions were being followed completely. The team wanted to know if the number of drones being used to monitor the movement of people could be increased. “The team looked satisfied with the arrangements.”In Jaipur, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said a central team met chief secretary DB Gupta, additional chief secretary (home) Rajeeva Swarup and other officials before meeting him.Gehlot said he raised the issue of central procurement of equipment and absence of financial grant by the Centre to the states to fight Covid-19. The team will be in Jaipur for two more days, he said, adding that it expressed satisfaction with the implementation of lockdown and other measures for containment of Covid-19. “A five-member team of the Central government has arrived here for 4-5 days to help the state,” health minister Raghu Shara said.In West Bengal, central teams were allowed to visit the containment zones after a warning by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla. The teams had complained to the home ministry that local administration was not cooperating with them.Congress leader Ahmed Patel said a Central team should also be sent to Gujarat and the exercise should not be limited to select states. “Given the rising cases and lockdown violations was criteria for sending the central teams to states, I request [Union home minister] Amit [Shah] Bhai to deploy similar teams to Gujarat also,” Patel tweeted.The Centre has constituted two teams each for West Bengal and Maharashtra and one each for Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan for the assessment of the situation and for issuing necessary directions to state authorities and to submit their reports to the Centre.The teams will focus on complaints about the implementation of lockdown measures as per guidelines, check the supply of essential commodities, measures to ensure social distancing, the preparedness of health infrastructure, the safety of health professionals and conditions of the relief camps for workers and the poor.Bhalla wrote to chief secretaries of all states and union territories on Monday asking them to comply with the Centre’s “revised and consolidated” guidelines issued on April 15 for easing of lockdown norms from Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-teams-visit-hot-spots-across-states/story-UhwxAXsGIXWGUY0wSAJJSL.html

Of the 79 positive cases in Odisha, 24 had travelled to neighbouring Bengal, which is slowly turning out to be a Covid hotspot.To oversee the lockdown and sealing arrangements along Odisha-Bengal border, DGP Abhay today visited Balasore and Mayurbhanj districts and ordered for tightening of the lockdown. A senior police official said that despite adequate police arrangements, it was not possible to stop people coming from Bengal as there were at least 37 pucca roads through which people could move into Odisha.“From today, we have stopped all ambulances from Bengal as hundreds were coming to Odisha using them. But how do we close other routes through farmlands in Jaleswar and Bhogarai area of Balasore. The local gram panchayat functionaries will have to play a key role,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-covid-cases-rise-naveen-patnaik-looks-to-sarpanches-to-block-influx-from-across-the-border/story-yyZHtXYC0mhAHjU8P4QhIL.html
21-04-2020||India||ICMR starts replacing defective RT-PCR kits||Kolkata: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has started replacing consignments of apparently defective RT-PCR testing kits from state-run laboratories that were providing inconclusive results, Shanta Dutta, director of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) in Kolkata, said on Tuesday.“ICMR has decided to replace the kits which, some states claimed, were yielding inconclusive results. These kits were supposed to be standardised by the medical colleges and kept in -80 degrees Celsius without which they would give inconclusive results,” Dutta said.“It appears that the state-run medical colleges neither standardized the kits nor did they maintain the right temperature. But as the tests need to be go on, these will now be replaced by kits from the National Institute of Virology in Pune,” she added.ICMR–NICED in Kolkata is a research institute under the Union health ministry and the regional Virus Research Diagnostic Lab (VRDL) for eastern India.“In Kolkata we have already replaced around 2,000 kits at IPGMER. We have also received some requests from School of Tropical Medicine to get their kits replaced. They are being replaced by kits from NIV Pune, which are pre-standardised,” Dutta said.IPGMER is short for the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research. In a series of tweets, the Mamata Banerjee government of West Bengal, which has been drawing flak for its slow pace of Covid-19 testing, recently accused ICMR-NICED of providing defective test kits.“The apparently defective test kits supplied by ICMR-NICED, Kolkata, are resulting in a high number of repeat / confirmatory tests and causing delays and other attendant problems at a time when we are batting a pandemic,” the state health department tweeted on Sunday evening.The state government also tweeted that there had been no problems earlier when the testing kits were being received directly from the National Institute of Virology, Pune. Recently, supplies to government labs in West Bengal have been routed through ICMR-NICED.Until April 21, West Bengal tested 6,182 samples. The state has 274 active Covid-19 cases. Fifteen people have died so far in the state of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-starts-replacing-defective-rt-pcr-kits/story-2InlTZBPZgyALFAba4kwxK.html
21-04-2020||India||Harvest season marked by staggered sales amid curbs||The coronavirus lockdown has made life harder for farmers during the ongoing harvest season as authorities enforce new rules to stagger crop sales in the usually chaotic mandis, or agricultural markets, where it is easy for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to spread.Social distancing rules have doubled the time and labour required to clear harvested stocks, farmers in Punjab and Haryana, two of the country’s largest producers of foodgrains, say. Cultivators are in the middle of winter-sown harvesting. Two key winter crops being harvested now, wheat and oilseeds such as mustard, account for nearly three-fourths of seasonal farm incomes. Authorities in Haryana and Punjab, two food-bowl states, have started issuing coupons or permits to farmers for ferrying grains to markets, which are being run with fewer staff. These trade stamps are being issued to farmers through commission agents, who act as intermediaries in the supply chain. Farmers in these states with harvests must move their grains on specified dates and at specified timings to contract sales at markets regulated under the Agriculture Produce Market Committee Act. “Earlier, it was easy to harvest field after field. Now, you can’t harvest all of your crop at one go. There’s no storage space on my farm,” Jaipal Singh Nain of Haryana’s Mukarpur village said, pointing to what he calls is a “trolley limit” imposed by the authorities. Officials are permitting no more than 50-60 quintals (100kg each), nearly as much as a tractor-pulled trolley or carriage can hold, Nain said. Farmers said they did not mind practising social distancing, but want governments to compensate them. “Two days of rain last week has spoiled nearly 25% of my wheat. The government should announce higher bonuses for wheat,” said Nirmal Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Muktsar. Labour costs have doubled because farmers are now being required to first hold the harvested crops before transporting them to the state-regulated markets on specified dates.Punjab is looking to harvest nearly 14 million tonnes of wheat, as India eyes a bumper harvest of the winter staple. The state has set up over 3,500 market yards to eliminate crowding, while Haryana has set up nearly 2,000. Since procurement, which refers to the government’s buying of the produce at federally fixed minimum support price, is staggered, both Haryana and Punjab will extend the date by which operations will be wrapped up, an official, requesting anonymity, said. “Of total wheat sown in 31 million hectares, 63-67% has already been harvested in the country,” the official said.Experts say they expect kharif or summer sowing to begin around the usual third week of June. “Completion of sowing of paddy may take longer time though through the transplantation method under which the crop is first planted in nursery beds before saplings are moved to larger fields,” said Arun Sundaresan, an agricultural scientist with Gromore, a hybrid seed manufacturer. Farmers with power tillers and mechanised farms should see the least disruptions to sowing, he said. Winter pulses were sown in 16 million hectares, official estimates show. Of these, harvesting has been completed for gram, lentil, urad, mung and field peas, the official cited above said. Sugarcane harvesting has been also been completed in states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harvest-season-marked-by-staggered-sales-amid-curbs/story-uQxfHJb3Lof2TKtQUwEjOI.html

This is time to create positivity and help people and the state government is doing that successfully,” said Pandya.The state government has also appointed five senior IAS officers to provide guidance and supervise the district administration along with effective implementation of the preventive measures taken for curbing the spread of the pandemic Covid-19. These appointed officers are Sonal Mishra, secretary (Narmada) for Bhavnagar, Mamta Verma (tourism Secretary) for Patan, AM Solanki (managing director (MD), Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Limited) for Anand, Shahmeena Husain (MD, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited) for Bharuch, and Rajesh Manjhu (transport Commissioner) for Panchmahal.The charge of these districts is given to these officials in addition to their usual responsibilities, a government statement said.Meanwhile, on the first day of the state government’s decision to resume the industrial units in areas other than the municipal corporations and municipality limits of the state, around 6,000 industrial units have become functional.According to government officials, 40,000 to 45,000 worked reported for work in these 6,000 industrial units. “These units mostly consist of chemicals, ceramic tiles, cement and small scale industries. Considering the permissions granted to the industry in the state, more than 15,000 units are estimated to be operational in the next two days,” said an government official.The state government has also appointed a District Committee headed by the Collector to operate the industrial units in the state, keeping in view the strict compliance of the guidelines of the Government of India including social distancing, while providing employment-economic support to the working-class people during the time of lockdown.“The committee has been given the powers to withdraw the permission, if the industries violate or miss the guidelines of the central government,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-die-in-24-hrs-gujarat-tally-reaches-2-718/story-HSciNROkgGmWQuolyQUMEN.html
21-04-2020||India||Gulshan Ewing, pioneering magazine editor, dies of Covid-19 in London||Gulshan Ewing, pioneering editor of magazines in India who interviewed top Bollywood and Hollywood actors and encouraged a generation of writers, passed away on Saturday after being infected with the coronavirus in a care home in London, her daughter said on Tuesday. She was 92. Mrs Ewing, who belonged to a Parsi family in Mumbai, was editor of Eve’s Weekly and Star & Style. She was one of the first women editors of leading Indian publications since the mid-1960s, setting benchmarks in film journalism and focussing on women readers. A confidante of the late Madhubala, one of the most popular actors in Indian film history, Mrs. Ewing was part of Bollywood’s glamour set, interacting closely with leading personalities. She also interviewed Hollywood actors like Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Danny Kaye, Kirk Douglas and Roger Moore. Mrs. Ewing was part of the group of eclectic Mumbai-based writers, editors and journalists in the Mumbai of the 1970s and 1980s that included prominent names such as Khushwant Singh, BK Karanjia, Dom Moraes and Vimla Patil.Her London-based daughter, Anjali Ewing, said: “There is a very lovely carefree photo with Madhubala and another lady but I don’t have any background on their relationship. She left Mumbai in 1990 for good”.“She kept in touch with a group of journalists from Eve’s Weekly throughout. She didn’t do any writing in London. She loved to encourage new talent. They always talk about how kind she was to them”, she added.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is one of the writers Mrs. Ewing encouraged. He acknowledged her support for his early writing in his 1990 book, ‘The Five Dollar Smile and Other Stories’.Mrs Ewing was married to Guy Ewing, who grew up in Manchester and moved to India to work as a journalist.

Also read: Testing, quarantine more effective than lockdown to check Covid-19, suggests epidemiological model“The public can approach these vans for any general health related problem. The mobile units are instructed, if any person approaches with serious illness, the CMHO should be immediately informed to ensure that the treatment starts on priority at government or private hospital,” he said.The CM said regular patients are suffering as some hospitals have been dedicated to only to treat Covid-19 patients. The private hospitals should fulfil their responsibility but some are not doing so and the health department has issued notices to them. “Strict action will be taken against hospitals which deny treatment. It is the moral and social responsibility of private hospital to provide treatment to patients approaching them,” he said.Rajasthan has recorded 1,576 cases of Covid-19 so far.The government also decided to boost manpower in the fight against Covid-19 as it gave appointment letters to 9000 ANM and GNM from 2018 recruitment.Gehlot who also interacted with a five-member central team through video-conference, emphasised on a centralised procedure for the procurement of testing kits, ventilators, PPE and other medical equipment by the central government.He said that the centre should procure the equipment and make available to the states so as to avoid competitions among states.“The rapid testing kit results are inaccurate and it is a matter of concern.A research team of SMS medical college and Rajasthan University of Health Sciences is examining it. The further course of action in context of the rapid testing kit will be taken after the response from the Indian council of medical research and report of the research team,” said Gehlot.He also raised the issues of migrant labours, demanded a relief package by the central government to all the states, packages for reviving business and for social security of people among others. The central government should announce a relief package for states without any further delay, he reiterated.Earlier in the day, the Centre asked states to suspend rapid testing for Covid-19 for the next two days, following complaints from at least two states that the antibody testing kits were returning erroneous results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-rajasthan-deploys-400-opd-vans-to-treat-other-diseases/story-snZIRGYQjE0SaCULPYcMXO.html
21-04-2020||India||Team of scientists begin work on ways to revive Indian economy after Covid crisis||A team of Indian scientists associated with an autonomous technology think tank under the department of Science and Technology is busy preparing a white paper charting the course for the revival of Indian economy after the coronavirus pandemic gets over, says a Tuesday release from government of India’s press information bureau department.The while paper aimed to strategise on the revival of post-Covid 19 Indian economy will be prepared by the experts of The Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) “by virtue of its mandate of thinking for future,” says the government release.The white paper focuses on Make in India initiatives, the commercialisation of indigenous technology and reduction of imports in a post-coronavirus India.“This document would mainly focus on strengthening Make in India initiatives, commercialization of Indigenous technology, developing a technology-driven transparent Public Distribution System (PDS), efficient rural health care delivery, reduction of import, adoption of emerging technology domains like AI, Machine Learning, Data Analytics and many more,” says the document.The white paper will soon be ready for submission to the decision-making authorities of the Government.Indian economy, like the rest of the world, is suffering due to the outbreak of the pandemic which is said to be the trigger for the worst recession seen since the great depression during the 1930s.India’s economic growth forecast has been cut down drastically by the IMF for the current fiscal at 1.9%, however, it predicts a robust revival in the economy by the next fiscal. The government has already begun relaxing the strict lockdown restrictions for a gradual resumption of some commercial activity—mainly in the rural sector and farming—which potentially allows for the resumption of 60% of the economy, says Nomura Holdings Inc. However, the output for the year started April 1 is likely to shrink by 0.4% compared with the growth of 4.6% the previous year. There are also concerns over labour shortages that could last for as long as six months and loss of jobs that could extend to 40 million before the end of the year, says a livemint report.Almost all sectors including manufacturing, trade, transport, tourism, education, healthcare have been hit and the government feels that the virus containment strategy also has a big role to play on the overall economic impact on the economy.The government has announced a fiscal relief package worth 1.7 lakh for individuals and businesses and the RBI has also undertaken steep rate cuts to ease the liquidity pressure on lenders and borrowers. The finance minister has promised to do more in the coming days while allowing the non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies, and microfinance institutions to function from April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/team-of-scientists-begin-work-on-ways-to-revive-indian-economy-after-covid-crisis/story-Z7yTOq1RI8kRwQWp0vSaQK.html

If report is Covid-19 negative, natural process as per law to be adopted.”The guidelines also prescribed the disinfection and decontamination of the aircraft according to approved procedures. The vehicle used for carrying the body will also have to be disinfected as also the tarmac area where the body is kept while drawing sample and during sealing.Under the SOP, airlines will provide the detailed list of passengers and crew to the APHO for further surveillance by the IDSP for next 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-issues-sop-for-bringing-back-remains-of-covid-19-patients/story-Cw8U4PcFEAc69tZUGuvztJ.html
21-04-2020||India||Lockdown exemptions: Centre exempts prepaid mobile charging shops from lockdown||The home ministry has clarified that prepaid mobile recharge utilities have already been exempted from the national lockdown provisions enforced to contain the spread of coronavirus in the country. An official communication signed by the secretary of home ministry Ajay Bhalla also adds that food processing units and caregivers of senior citizens are also exempted from the restriction of movement imposed through the lockdown restrictions.The letter has been addressed to chief secretaries of all states and Union territories and it says that the clarification is being issued in response to certain queries received in reference to exemptions to specific services within the categories that are already allowed under the previous orders issued by the Central government.The Centre had announced fresh guidelines listing exemptions from the second phase of lockdown on April 15, which was modified twice on April 16 and April 19.The MHA missive adds that the exemptions are granted only on the condition of maintaining social distancing measures in offices, workshops, factories and other establishments.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe communication refers to permission granted for the resumption of select business activity with the aim to restart up to 40% of economic activity. Farm and agriculture sector has been given complete exemption from lockdown measures along with rural employment generation projects and other enterprises that employ daily wagers. A senior home ministry official confirmed that positive reports on resumption of these activities had been received. The second phase of lockdown ends on May 3.The home ministry has been consistently communicating on implementation of the lockdown measures with the states. It has also constituted central teams that are visiting states to monitor the implementation of strictures post April 20 when select relaxations came into effect. It had earlier cautioned West Bengal government for not following the Centre’s directives and allowing for a gradual easing of restrictions, considered to be counterproductive to the containment efforts.

21-04-2020||India||JD (U), BJP seek action as NDA leaders embarrass Nitish Kumar by defying lockdown||There was more embarrassment for the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar on Tuesday after it emerged that a Janata Dal (United) MP had broken lockdown norms and drove down from Delhi a week ago.Ahead of the news of JD (U) MP from Purnia , Santosh Kumar driving from Delhi, BJP MLA from Hisua, Anil Singh had created a furore by driving to Kota in Rajasthan to bring back his daughter three days ago.The antics of the two NDA leaders defying lockdown have not gone down well with either the JD (U) or BJP and both parties have demanded action against errant leaders.The state parliamentary affairs minister Sravan Kumar of the JD (U) on Tuesday demanded from the top leadership of both the parties, the BJP and the JD (U), to take cognizance of the breach of lockdown norms.“If action is taken against officials, the BJP leadership also should take action. I also expect that JD (U) leadership will also take note of travels by party MP and seek clarification from him. After all they are the public representatives,” said the minister.The BJP also echoed similar sentiments. “Bihar government under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar and deputy CM Sushil Modi is working seriously and tirelessly to enforce lockdown and help the citizens. No one is allowed to violate the rules and regulation of the Lockdown. Our government will look into the matter in a very neutral manner, if anyone is found guilty of breaking the accepted official procedure of travel during lockdown. Everyone must abide by the rules and strictly follow the system,” said BJP spokesperson, Nikhil Anand.The Purnia MP did not respond to repeated calls made by the HT. However, a close associate of the MP, who is not authorized to speak to the media said that the MP came a week back and distributed ‘relief materials to needy. “After that he went into quarantine,” he said.This, incidentally, is not the isolated case of ‘preferential treatment to VIPs’ during lockdown. On April 11, a similar pass was issued to former ward councillor of Muzaffarpur by local administration to bring back his daughter from Kota. Muzaffarpur DM Chandrashekahar Singh accepted that “certain passes were issued under special circumstances during the first phase of lockdown.’These cases of lockdown violation at a time when the government has been maintaining that it will not evacuate thousands of students from Bihar stranded in Kota, has given the opposition an opportunity to attack Nitish Kumar.“Only students of lesser mortals will remain stuck outside state while the CM will give special relief to specials. How long these dual policies of the government continue? It seems that CM is not concerned with migrants and students stuck up elsewhere,” said leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.On Tuesday, Speaker of Bihar assembly requested Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who represents Kota parliamentary constituency to ensure proper care of students stranded in Kota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jd-u-bjp-seek-action-as-nda-leaders-embarrass-nitish-kumar-by-defying-lockdown/story-6Q8f8OsKXRoHsQBLxAKD3J.html

21-04-2020||India||Focus inward for military needs in post-Covid-19 world, say top Army officials||India must turn focus inward for its military needs in the post-Covid world and make every effort to cut dependence on imported military hardware that could not only become cost prohibitive but also hard to come by in the coming years, three senior military officers said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity.The armed forces will have to get rid of their traditional appetite for imported weapons and equipment, and work in harness with the domestic industry to guarantee self-reliance in defence, said the officers with direct knowledge of the military’s modernisation goals.Despite pursuing the Make in India programme vigorously to reduce military imports, the country was the second-largest arms importer in the world over the last five years, according to data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute last month.“Indigenisation with Make in India as the dictum can no longer be a mere slogan. If the coronavirus crisis has energised us to produce ventilators, personal protective equipment and other gear for our healthcare workers in a matter of weeks, the focus in the coming times should be on fueling a new wave of innovation in the defence sector,” said the first officer cited above.Imports account for 60-65% of the country’s military requirements and it has signed contracts worth billions of dollars during the last decade for a raft of weapons and systems, including fighter jets, air defence missile systems, submarine hunter planes, attack helicopters, heavy-lift choppers and lightweight howitzers.“This is the time for us to look inward. The local industry is willing to support indigenisation, although it may not be able produce the best weapons and equipment. But if given the opportunity, it will reach global standards over time. It requires the full support of the armed forces. The temptation to import hardware will have to be resisted,” said the second officer cited above.From warships, fighter jets to air defence systems and helicopters, modern artillery gun systems to ammunition, the domestic industry has demonstrated that it has potential to contribute to building a stronger military, the second officer pointed out. One of the key responsibilities assigned by the government to the department of military affairs, headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, is to promote the use of indigenous military equipment in the armed forces.“After the 2016 Uri strike, the armed forces scrambled to fill worrying gaps in their arsenal, including ammunition. We can’t allow this to happen. Encouraging the domestic industry will help us get more bang for the buck and ensure we are not in dire straits in times of conflict,” said the third officer cited above.He added a robust indigenous defence industry would allow the armed forces to cut costs by holding lesser stocks of weapons and ammunition because production and supplies could be ramped up when required.“Storage in itself is cost prohibitive because high-grade weapons and ammunition require special storage conditions, including air conditioning. Round-the-clock security of large ammunition and weapon storage depots also adds to the cost,” he stressed.The draft Defence Production Policy-2018 visualises India as one of the top five countries in the aerospace and defence sectors in the coming years, with defence goods and services accounting for a turnover of Rs 1.7 lakh crore by 2025. It also seeks to drastically reduce India’s dependence on imported military hardware over the next five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-inward-for-military-needs-in-post-covid-19-world-army-official/story-KebRctf22AY6buVe41TpyJ.html
21-04-2020||India||Palghar lynching: NHRC demands answers from Maharashtra police in four weeks||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a notice to Maharashtra top cop over Palghar lynching case in which three people including two Hindu ascetics were killed, allegedly in the presence of police on April 16, 2020, during the national lockdown.A press release on Tuesday from the human rights body said Maharashtra DGP has been asked to submit a detailed report within four weeks which should also include action taken against the culprits and the relief offered to victims’ kin. “The death of three persons in such a cruel manner by the unruly mob that too during the countrywide lockdown, under extra vigil by the administration and police, amounts to gross violation of the right to life of the victims,” the NHRC notice said.The victims identified as 70-year-old Kalpavruksha Giri, 35-year-old Sushil Giri—both Hindu sadhus-- and their driver Neelesh Telgade, were lynched last Thursday in Gadhchinchale village, 110km from Palghar. The victims were reportedly attempting to go to Gujarat to attend the last rites of their religious guru but were attacked by a mob that apparently mistook them for child-lifters.A video of the incident went viral on Sunday, where unarmed policemen were seen watching the incident without making any intervention.The incident led to a political controversy with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacking the Shiv Sena led state government for alleged negligence and cover-up claiming its handling of the incident was political as it involved Hindus.The NHRC notice also cites media reports to question alleged police inaction.“The video of the attack on the deceased persons went viral, on 19.04.2020, which showed that police personnel were also present when the victims were being attacked,” the NHRC communication on the matter said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has warned against communalisation of the incident and he was backed by NCP chief Sharad Pawar who said it was not the time for settling old political scores. Also Read : ‘No time to settle political scores’: Sharad Pawar on Palghar lynching blameUddhav said swift action had been taken in the case with arrests of over 100 suspects including five key accused. He added that two policemen had also been suspended for dereliction of duty.

21-04-2020||India||Testing, quarantine more effective than lockdown to check Covid-19, suggests epidemiological model||Extensive testing to identify asymptomatic individuals and quarantining those diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with continued social distancing - not a lockdown alone - is the sole effective strategy to contain the pandemic in India, recommends the first India-specific epidemiological model for Covid-19’s spread in the country.“Lockdowns are not very effective, especially India-wide lockdowns, because the disease will inevitably flare up again after the lockdown ends,” said Gautam Menon, professor of biology and physics, Ashoka University, Delhi. “We stress that a comprehensive testing and quarantining regime is the only real long-term solution, until a vaccine is found.”Termed as INDISCI-SIM, the first detailed state-level epidemiological model for India has been developed by scientists from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science at Bengaluru and Ashoka University under the banner of the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 – a voluntary group of more than 400 scientists.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.On Tuesday, principal scientific advisor to the government of India K VijayRaghavan in his reaction to INDISCI-SIM tweeted, “Thanks all involved. These are useful analyses and are being looked at carefully along with other inputs.”The model involves nine different detailed compartments – susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, mild symptomatic, severely symptomatic, hospitalised, recovered and dead - and compares each stage with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown, quarantining and expanded testing to drawn an inference on propagation of the disease.“This is possibly the most vigorous model with several built complexities that can be further broken down to state, city or district levels,” said Bhalchandra Pujari, Centre for modeling and Simulation, SPPU. “In case of the virus and depending on a person, the patient may take one of these nine paths. Our model demonstrates how one phase of a typical population will travel from one compartment to another.”For instance, the window of recovery is highest for tested asymptomatic individuals followed by mildly symptomatic, while it’s the least for severely symptomatic and critical.“Model simulations do not quantify the economic costs of the lockdown,” said Pujari. “Extension or not of the lockdown after May 3, India must increase testing capacities faster than the propagation of the disease. Opening up transport pan-India is not a good idea as per our model.”Menon said INDISCI-SIM is the most detailed and versatile among current models for the disease’s trajectory in India.“We plan to release an on-line tool in which anyone can test different scenarios for themselves, including policy makers and other researchers. The program will also be made publicly available,” added Menon.Subsequent versions of the model will incorporate district level description, in addition to differing health care capacities across different regions and their implications for disease spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-quarantine-more-effective-than-lockdown-to-check-covid-19-suggests-epidemiological-model/story-SIOXB8SzEHugmI0D3bOXoN.html

21-04-2020||India||Covid-19: Harvests see staggered sales under lockdown||The coronavirus lockdown has made life harder for farmers during the ongoing harvest season as authorities enforce new rules to stagger crop sales in the usually chaotic mandis, or agricultural markets, where it is easy for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to spread.Social distancing rules have doubled the time and labour required to clear harvested stocks, say farmers in Punjab and Haryana, two of the country’s largest producers of foodgrains.Cultivators are in the middle of winter-sown harvesting. Two key winter crops being harvested now, wheat and oilseeds such as mustard, account for nearly three-fourths of seasonal farm incomes.Authorities in Haryana and Punjab, two food-bowl states, have started issuing coupons or permits to farmers for ferrying grains to markets, which are being run with fewer staff. These trade stamps are being issued to farmers through commission agents, who act as intermediaries in the supply chain.Farmers in these states with harvests must move their grains on specified dates and at specified timings to contract sales at markets regulated under the Agriculture Produce Market Committee Act.“Earlier, it was easy to harvest field after field. Now, you can’t harvest all of your crop at one go. There’s no storage space on my farm,” Jaipal Singh Nain of Haryana’s Mukarpur village said, pointing to what he calls is a “trolley limit” imposed by the authorities.Officials are permitting no more than 50-60 quintals (100kg each), nearly as much as a tractor-pulled trolley or carriage can hold, Nain said.Farmers said they did not mind practising social distancing, but want governments to compensate them. “Two days of rain last week has spoiled nearly 25% of my wheat. The government should announce higher bonuses for wheat,” said Nirmal Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Muktsar.Labour costs have doubled because farmers are now being required to first hold the harvested crops before transporting them to the state-regulated markets on specified dates.Punjab is looking to harvest nearly 14 million tonnes of wheat, as India eyes a bumper harvest of the winter staple. The state has set up over 3,500 market yards to eliminate crowding, while Haryana has set up nearly 2,000.Since procurement, which refers to the government’s buying of the produce at federally fixed minimum support price, is staggered, both Haryana and Punjab will extend the date by which operations will be wrapped up, an official, requesting anonymity, said.“Of total wheat sown in 31 million hectares, 63-67% has already been harvested in the country,” the official said.Experts say they expect kharif or summer sowing to begin around the usual third week of June. “Completion of sowing of paddy may take longer time though through the transplantation method under which the crop is first planted in nursery beds before saplings are moved to larger fields,” said Arun Sundaresan, an agricultural scientist with Gromore, a hybrid seed manufacturer.Farmers with power tillers and mechanised farms should see the least disruptions to sowing, he said.Winter pulses were sown in 16 million hectares, official estimates show. Of these, harvesting has been completed for gram, lentil, urad, mung and field peas, the official cited above said. Sugarcane harvesting has been also been completed in states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harvests-see-staggered-sales-under-lockdown/story-Qv20ckg9ApoJQngwDNDPQN.html

21-04-2020||India||New study suggests men take longer than women to recover from Covid-19||A new analysis of Covid-19 patients admitted in the isolation ward of a Mumbai hospital, and three families who tested positive for the virus, has found that men have a delayed viral clearance compared to women patients -- or, simply put, men test positive for the virus for a longer time than women.The analysis does not mention if men also remain symptomatic for a longer time.The yet-to-be-published paper uploaded in MedRxiv, a preprint server for health research papers, suggests that high expression of ACE2 (an enzyme the Sars-Cov-2 virus uses to enter the body) in the testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may be playing a role in viral persistence among male patients.The study was conducted by 10 scientists from the Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Mumbai; Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York; Department of Microbiology, Topiwala National Medical College and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Mumbai, involved 68 patients -- 48 men and 20 women, with a median age of 35 -- admitted to Kasturba Hospital with infectious diseases. seven members of three families tested positive.Swabs collected at the time of diagnosis were tested using the Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method and subsequent swabs were collected at approximately 48 hour intervals until they tested negative. The median time for testing negative for male patients was six days, compared to four days for women, the study said.“ACE2 was determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that cause Covid-19). High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males,” the paper concluded.To be sure, the theory is still to be validated.“It is true that ACE2 receptors are present in the testicular cells and the virus may be binding there and staying for a longer time. But this is the only paper which is saying this could be the reason. At the moment, we cannot generalise,” said Dr Shobha Broor, the former head of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) department of virology, who has read the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-study-suggests-men-take-longer-than-women-to-recover-from-covid-19/story-cBslLC5ry4HP9gWJYtuF2J.html
21-04-2020||India||Coronavirus Update: Kejriwal brings half of Delhi under free ration scheme||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kerjiwal on Tuesday promised free ration to additional 30 lakh poor residents in the capital who do not have ration cards till the time they continue to reel under the economic impact of the global pandemic. The announcement took the total number of beneficiaries under the free ration scheme to 1 crore-- almost half of the city’s total population. Kejriwal didn’t specify the period till which the temporary relief will last but added that the provision was part of his government’s effort to provide the residents with food security during the outbreak. “As long as the impact of coronavirus lasts and the poor are unable to earn their bread, we will ensure their food security. We have a plan in place. 71 lakh people have already been given 7.5 kg of rations. Government has now decided to distribute free ration to another 30 lakh people,” he said. He said the decision to include another 30 lakh people was taken on Tuesday. The AAP government, he said, also decided to provide a kit to all beneficiaries containing items of daily needs besides the ration. “Every family with ration card and also those with e-coupons will be given a basic kit of provisions of daily needs including cooking oil, spices, pulses, sugar, salt, soap etc, along with their ration for the month of May when distribution begins at the end of April,” Kejriwal said.In another welfare measure aimed to cover several other temporary migrant workers who may not figure in the above two categories of the poor people, Kejriwal announced a food coupon scheme, which he said will be delivered through the people’s representative of the state.Under the coupon scheme, every MP and MLA representing the city-state will be given 2000 food coupons each to be distributed among the temporary migrant workers, who do not have either ration cards or e-coupons. The food coupons will make them eligible for receiving 5 kg of free ration. Delhi has 70 MLAs- 62 from AAP and 8 from the BJP—and 7 MPs—all from the BJP. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Providing the latest official figures, Kejriwal said that a total of 2081 coronavirus positive cases were reported in Delhi till Monday night. Over 20% of total patients—431 in absolute numbers-- have recovered so far while 47 people have lost their lives due to the virus. The number of active Covid-19 cases in Delhi stood at 1603, he said.Kejriwal said that 80% of all deceased were over 50 years of age and 83% of all the coronavirus casualties had co-morbidities.“Those with co-morbidity make 83% of all coronavirus fatalities. Coronavirus worsens an existing medical condition like sugar, heart, cancer etc. Elderly people must be taken good care of and they must maintain social distancing measures,” he said.For Coronavirus Live Updates||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-kejriwal-brings-half-of-delhi-under-free-ration-scheme/story-7mxskbvzFKdFL6Ahk3kxSN.html

Train runs over them||Two labourers, who had sat down to have breakfast on a railway track, were run over by an incoming freight train at around 8am on Tuesday in Chhattisgarh’s Koriya district. The victims were walking back to their native villages in Surajpur district amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown enforced to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Police said the incident took place between Udalkachhar and Darritola railway stations under Koriya district.City superintendent of police (CSP), Manendragarh, Karn Kumar Uike, said that the victims, Kaleshwar Rajwade (21) and Gulab Rajwade (20) along with two other workers started walking from Pendra-Marwahi-Gaurela district on Monday for their native villages in Surajpur district, located around 130km from Pendra, along the railway tracks.“The workers decided to walk along the railway track, as no transport service was available due to the ongoing lockdown. They walked through Monday night and reached a spot between Udalkachhar and Darritola stations on the Anuppur-Ambikapur rail route, located around 80km from Pendra. The victims were eating their breakfast on the railway track, while the other two workers had gone to fetch water. The victims didn’t see the incoming freight train because of a curve on the track. They were run over at around 8am on Tuesday,” said CSP Uike.The other two workers informed the police and later the victims’ bodies were sent for post-mortem examination.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel expressed grief over the workers’ death and instructed the district authorities to provide necessary assistance to the family members of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-labourers-on-way-home-on-foot-run-over-by-a-freight-train-in-chhattisgarh/story-Az2ZWt7lOLaU9Z4O07MtYP.html

These kits were supposed to be standardised by medical colleges and kept at -20 degrees Celsius, without which they would give inconclusive results,” said Shanta Dutta, director of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) here.“It appears that neither the state-run medical colleges standardised the kits, nor did they maintain the right temperature. But as the testing needs to carry on, these will now be replaced by kits from the National Institute of Virology in Pune.”Standardisation is the process in which a kit is checked whether it is giving correct results before it is put to use for testing samples.NICED, part of ICMR, is a research institute under the Union health ministry and the regional virus research diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) for eastern India.“In Kolkata, we have already replaced around 2,000 kits at IPGMER (Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research). We have received some requests from the School of Tropical Medicine to get their kits replaced. They are being replaced by kits from NIV in Pune, which are pre-standardised,” Dutta said.In a string of tweets, the Mamata Banerjee government, which has been criticised for its low rate of Covid-19 tests, accused the ICMR and NICED of providing defective testing kits.“The apparently defective test kits supplied by ICMR-NICED, Kolkata, are resulting in a high number of repeat/confirmatory tests and causing delays and other attendant problems at a time when we are batting a pandemic,” the state health department tweeted on Sunday.The state government also tweeted there were no problems earlier when the testing kits were received directly from the NIV in Pune. Recently, supplies to government laboratories in West Bengal have been routed through NICED.Responding to the state government’s tweets, Dutta said: “Earlier, when kits were required in smaller quantities, they were imported, standardised and then distributed by NIV in Pune. But when the demand started rising, ICMR imported the kits and sent them directly to 16 regional hubs, including NICED in Kolkata.“The kits were then distributed to state-run medical colleges, where they were required to be standardised. But this is not being done because of lack of time and technical know-how. That’s why sometimes these kits are giving inconclusive results.”A few days ago, Dutta had said that NICED wasn’t getting enough swab samples from the state government for testing.Till April 21, the state tested 6,182 samples. There are currently 274 active Covid-19 cases in the state and 15 people have died so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-starts-replacing-defective-covid-19-test-kits-with-standardised-ones-from-niv/story-0f7FHidVqxS5SCOGnTXraM.html

Yogi could not attend the funeral due to the nationwide lockdown and the last rites were conducted by the deceased’s youngest son Mahendra Bisht. The mortal remains of 90-year-old Bisht reached his ancestral village in Pauri Garhwal on Monday evening in an ambulance from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, where he succumbed earlier in the day after undergoing treatment for the past three months.The UP chief minister had made it clear yesterday that he would not attend the funeral of his father as he was duty-bound to stay in the state while a national lockdown to fight coronavirus was in place.Anand Singh Bisht once worked with the Uttarakhand forest department as a range officer and used his knowledge of the area and the people very well as a social worker after retirement.Rawat paid tributes to the departed soul at Phoolchatti in Pauri Garhwal district and consoled the bereaved family.“The loss of social worker like Anand Singh ji will always be remembered by the state. The work done by him towards society will always be remembered. May God gives strength to the bereaved family to bear this loss,” said Rawat.Ritu Khanduri, a legislator from Yamkeshwar block in Pauri Garhwal from where Bisht hailed, said that despite his old age, Bisht’s enthusiasm for helping people never saw any decline.For Coronavirus Live Updates“I had known him for the past three years and he was like a father figure to me. From meetings to inaugurations of schools and colleges, helping children study better, I would always see him working for society,” said Khanduri.Sharing an anecdote, she said, “Once there was a programme at a school in the block, and there was a one-kilometre steep walk downhill.

21-04-2020||India||Puducherry’s lockdown exit plan depends on Tamil Nadu. Chief Minister explains||Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy says he will lift the lockdown only after assessing the situation in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. In an interview, he says that tourism will not be allowed in Puducherry for the time being and the Union Territory will implement the odd-even scheme for the movement of vehicles even if the lockdown is lifted. Edited excerpts:Q: Out of the seven coronavirus cases in Puducherry, only three are active now. How did you manage that?A: We had announced the lockdown on March 23 and sealed the border with Tamil Nadu. We had around 6000 foreign tourists from February 22 to March 20. Around 20% of them were staying on the day of the announcement of lockdown and 80% had already left. They were staying in around 300 hotels across Puducherry. These included those who stayed at Auroville. So, we identified around 550 people who came in contact with the tourists in hotels and other places and put them in quarantine. I also announced a prison term of one year for anyone violating the restrictions. We have been able to contain the pandemic through these measures despite the situation in neighbouring Tamil Nadu going beyond anybody’s imagination. The Prime Minister also told me you are a lucky person.Q: Are you satisfied with the Central assistance?A: Except rice, nothing has been given. I had also informed the Prime Minister that we have not been given the GST compensation for four months. We are yet to receive any additional grants. Besides, the arrears of the seventh pay commission haven’t been paid to us yet.Q: Are you allowing some economic activity in the UT?A: We have allowed agricultural activities, movement of foodgrains, harvesting, sowing, and opening of fertiliser, seeds and pesticide shops. We wanted to start government and unfinished construction but we are careful as far as industrial activity is concerned.Q: Will you lift the lockdown completely on May 3?A: Even if the Central government decides to lift it, we will take a call depending on the local conditions. But much depends on the situation in neighbouring Tamil Nadu where the number of coronavirus cases is significantly increasing every day. If the situation is serious there, we will not lift the lockdown. But whatever call we take will l be a well thought out one.Q: But what is your exit strategy whenever you decide to lift it?A: We will not allow any tourism in Puducherry for the time being. Similarly, we will not open our border with Tamil Nadu. We will go for odd-even formula in allowing movement of vehicles. We will allow two wheelers first and then four wheelers depending on the situation. As far as schools and colleges are concerned, the online classes have already started. We have told the government offices that only 33% of the staff will be allowed to come to work on a day, the officials will have to follow strict social distancing norms, use masks and sanitisers. Strict procedure will be followed in industries too. We have instructed that only 33% of the total capacity should be run, all buildings must be sanitised, employees should be from nearby places, they should go for health check-ups every day and insurance cover should be provided to them. We have told the industry to go slow and in a staggered manner. If any industry is found violating these norms, we will seal it.Q: What led to the fresh tussle between you and the L-G?A: The Central government announced 5kg of wheat or rice to every poor under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana. When we wanted to distribute free rice and wheat to the poor people, the L-G [Kiran Bedi] stalled it. She directed that instead of rice or wheat, money should be given to them. She even raised the issue during her video conferencing with President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu. But I got the letter from union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan saying that besides rice or wheat we also have to distribute dal. I also complained about it to the Prime Minister with whom I spoke a day after his video conference with chief ministers on April 11. I told him that she is not allowing us to distribute free rice to the poor as provided by the central government. Moreover, I told him that we have not been provided with any financial assistance so far. The Prime Minister said he will look into it. I also spoke to home minister Amit Shah and complained to him as well. The L-G is also blocking distribution of free rice to APL [above poverty line] families during the lockdown period. I now have written to the central government about this also.Q: Did the Prime Minister and the home minister give any assurance to you in this regard?A: The Prime Minister heard it and the home minister assured me that he will talk to her (Kiran Bedi).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-the-situation-is-serious-in-tn-we-won-t-lift-the-lockdown-in-the-ut-on-3-may-puducherry-cm/story-IJ16jksbaPxK27DXb2qApN.html

Why no district from Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat is part of the list?” O’Brien, who is party’s Rajya Sabha member, asked.Two teams from the union government landed in Kolkata on Monday to visit seven districts to review implementation of the lockdown and moves taken by the health administration.

Krishna district with 83 positive cases, Chittoor with 53 cases and Kadapa with 46 cases have also been causing concern for the authorities.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.The health department has attributed the increasing number of cases to increase in the number of tests being done in the state in the last few days. In the last 24 hours, as many as 5,022 samples have been tested. A total of 35,755 samples have been tested since the epidemic broke out.Quoting the central figures, an official spokesman from the chief minister’s office said Andhra Pradesh stands at the top in terms of tests being conducted for Covid-19. “As against the national average of 290 tests per million people, AP is at the top of the list with 715 tests per million,” the spokesman said.Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy told officials to focus on the districts like Kurnool and Guntur which reported high incidence of Covid-19 particluarly after the return of Tablighi Jamaat members from a congregation in Delhi last month.The chief minister held a video conference with district collectors and Muslim religious leaders on the measures being taken to contain Covid-19.

21-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Covid-19 rapid testing kits use suspended for two days due to ‘errors’||Country’s premier medical research body at the forefront of efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 on Tuesday asked states to suspend rapid testing for the disease for the next two days, following complaints from at least two states- West Bengal and Rajasthan-- that the exported antibody testing kits were returning erroneous results.ICMR’s top scientist Dr Gangakhedkar said that in the next two days, eight ICMR institutes will carry out field tests using the rapid testing kits in different states for validation purposes and to find out if certain batches of the kits are faulty, following which feedback will be provided to states and the general public.“We received a complaint from one state yesterday that rapid kits were leading to lesser detections, so we took feedback from three states today,” said Dr Gangakhedkar.“We are learning that the positive samples of RT-PCR are showing too much variation (when tested by rapid kits) in the range of 6 to 71%,” he added, referring to the percentage of successful detection made by the rapid testing kits in positive cases.ICMR expert said this amount of variation was not good and it needed to be investigated. However, he added that some discrepancies were expected since the virus was new.“New tests show variation as the 1st generation ELISA is in the crude form, which needs to be refined, but these findings will not be overlooked,” he said.West Bengal was among the first states to complain about poor accuracy of the rapid testing kits distributed to states through ICMR network. Rajasthan, too, on Tuesday decided to suspend testing after complaining of a high rate of inaccuracy. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe ICMR expert said the rapid test kits were tested in Delhi before they were sent out to states and had shown 71% accuracy. He added that its accuracy percentage was growing with the passage of time as Covid-19 antibodies taken seven days to build. Gangakhedkar said that the issue could be raised with firms supplying the antibody testing kits if they were found to be malfunctioning.The rapid testing kits return results within minutes and are considered crucial for expanding testing capacity and for the containment strategy.

21-04-2020||India||Covid-19: CISF to go for contactless frisking of passengers at airports, Delhi metro||The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is preparing new standard operating procedures (SOPs) for operations at airports and the Delhi Metro after the lockdown that are expected to include contactless frisking and fewer passengers in each coach.The SOPs will also include use of the Aarogya Setu app to identify Covid-19 patients passing through security gates, officials familiar with developments said.For CISF personnel, who come in direct contact with hundreds of thousands of travellers every day at metro stations and airports, the force has plans for them to sanitise their hands after every two or three travellers. Personal protective equipment (PPE) will be provided to all personnel and X-ray machines and other equipment will be regularly sanitised, the officials said.CISF director general Rajesh Ranjan told HT: “Essentially, we want to make sure our men and commuters are protected from Covid-19 to the best possible extent without compromising on safety. We are looking at changing the process for access to airports and metro stations.“The SOPs are in the final stages and will be sent to the civil aviation ministry and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) soon.”Ranjan added, “We are exploring the use of contactless frisking as much as we can. However, it will not be possible to make it fully contactless and pat-down searches will depend on person to person.”Business outlets within metro stations, such as food stalls, will have additional access control for their personnel while CISF personnel will be informed about safety measures they have to follow, both while on duty and after going back to their barracks.An interesting aspect of CISF’s new SOP for the Delhi Metro is the reduction of passengers in each coach by at least half so that distancing norms are followed. Each coach usually has about 50 to 60 people during rush hours.At airports, another official said, the CISF is considering suggesting to the government that passengers be asked to download the Aarogya Setu app before coming to the airport for a colour-coded risk analysis for identifying Covid-19 patients. All CISF personnel across the country have already downloaded the application.Passengers will also be asked to sanitise their hands at pre-embarkation security check points and in the security hold area.The paramilitary force is likely to advise airlines to provide small bottles of hand sanitiser to passengers once they pass the security hold area since CISF doesn’t allow liquids to get across at airport security check points.The SOPs pertaining to queues and distancing, use of PPEs, gloves and masks will also be followed in government facilities where CISF is deployed.The force is augmenting its stock of face-masks, gloves, alcohol-based sanitisers and PPEs so as to have sufficient numbers available for an initial period of three months.Apart from this, almost all 349 units of CISF across the country are distributing face-masks, sanitisers, dry soaps, dry rations or cooked meals to the underprivileged in surrounding areas while maintaining proper hygiene and distancing, said CISF spokesperson Hemendra Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cisf-preparing-new-sops-for-checks-at-airports-delhi-metro/story-TQ6pOYOKXxcuaWg1L6j6OP.html
21-04-2020||India||Plea in Supreme Court seeks exemption for advocates from paying monthly rent for their rented office spaces||A plea filed before the Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday stated that lawyers, who have been struggling to make their both ends meet because of lack of income due to the ongoing nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), be exempted from the payment of monthly rent for their office spaces till the restrictions are lifted.The petitioner, advocate Aljo Joseph, who is an advocate-on-record at the apex court, cited that courts have not been functioning since the lockdown – initially enforced for 21 days on March 25 and then further extended till May 3 – came into effect. Most lawyers are facing an acute cash crunch, as they earn their livelihood on a case-to-case basis, he said.“The majority of the advocates have not been able to earn any money during this lockdown period. They are finding maintaining their office premises without any income for months a Herculean task,” the petition, filed through advocates Sriram Parakkat and Sachin Sharma, said.Joseph submitted that though many state governments and the Centre have announced schemes for benefit of the poor and the needy to tide over the economic crisis triggered by Covid-19, no such financial aid has been offered for lawyers’ benefit as yet.“The government ordered several directives and declared a moratorium and financial assistance to different sectors and class of people. But no policy has been announced by the government to support the hardship faced by the professionals, especially lawyers, to date,” the plea said.Lawyers, the petition claimed, are left with no other option but to pay monthly rent for their office spaces even when they have neither work nor income.“The government must issue a directive that the advocates and other professionals are exempted from paying monthly rent of their office premises during the lockdown period,” the petitioner urged.The case is yet to come for hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-plea-seeks-exemption-for-advocates-from-paying-monthly-rent-for-their-rented-office-spaces/story-GQV8VuWAZJbHQMgjs1irjJ.html

21-04-2020||India||Pakistan removes nearly 4,000 names from terror watch list||Pakistani authorities have removed almost 4,000 names from a terror watch list, including nearly 1,900 names that were struck off since early March, according to a US-based tech firm that tracks watch lists globally.While Pakistan’s National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) maintains a list of banned terror groups, separate lists of proscribed terrorist individuals are maintained by authorities in the country’s four provinces.The terror watch list of Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province that has a sizeable presence of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), was analysed by California-based Castellum.AI for a report posted on the firm’s website on Sunday.At its peak in October 2018, Punjab province’s “proscribed persons data” or terror watch list had about 7,600 names, according to a report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Castellum.AI said in its report that some 3,800 names had been removed from this list “without explanation or notification to the public”.The report further said that since March 9 this year, Pakistani authorities had removed some 1,869 names from the list. Of these, 1,069 names were struck off between March 9 and March 27, and about 800 were removed subsequently. All these names were placed in a “denotified” list, a term used in Pakistan to signify an official removal from a watch list.Castellum.AI contended LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhi, one of the alleged masterminds of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, was among those whose names were removed from the list. However, this couldn’t be independently confirmed.Moreover, Castellum.AI cited the removal of a terrorist named Zaka-ur-Rehman from Zhob in Balochistan for the reference to Lakhvi in its report, claiming the name was an alias. However, Lakhvi hails from Okara in Punjab, where he was born and is not known to have operated in Balochistan.Reports in the Pakistani media last week said names were removed from the terror watch list because it had “bloated” up to 7,000 names with multiple inaccuracies, such as the names of dead individuals, Afghan nationals, and names of untraceable persons.Castellum.AI said there was also no explanation on NACTA’s website as to why about 3,800 names were removed from the terror watch list since October 2018. It said it was also not clear “why Pakistan publicly maintains the Denotified List if the individuals on it are dead or their listings have multiple inaccuracies”.In February, Pakistan was given four months by the FATF to fully implement a 27-point action plan to counter terror financing and money laundering after the country failed to meet repeated deadlines to complete the programme. The FATF said Pakistan had so far delivered only on 14 of the points in the plan.However, reports have suggested that Pakistan may have got a reprieve because of the Covid-19 crisis, with the multilateral watchdog putting off a review of the country’s performance till October.“It is possible that these delistings are part of Pakistan’s efforts to implement FATF’s action plan, but not announcing removals or the reasons for them poses many challenges. FATF standards call for transparency in listing procedures,” Castellum.AI said in its report.“Transparency supports due process for affected individuals and facilitates compliance. Obligated entities within Pakistan, as well as financial institutions who process Pakistan-related transactions globally, need clarity to effectively comply with AML/CFT (anti-money laundering/counter-financing of terror) laws and regulations,” it added.Pakistan should clarify if individuals moved from the proscribed to denotified list are still a threat, state the reason for a list change, and identify the reason an individual was listed in the first place, Castellum.AI’s report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-removes-nearly-4-000-names-from-terror-watch-list/story-QVBsEDdLj1IK8dBVSx0dQJ.html

She is not showing many symptoms also. We tried combination drugs several times,” said Pathanamthitta district medical officer Dr N Sheeja. She said she has sought the advice of the state medical board in this regard.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.She was admitted to the hospital on March 10 after she came in contact with a family which returned from Italy. The family infected eight others. Three-member family came to their home in Kerala’s Ranni on February 29 on a three-week leave and attended many functions before testing positive a week later and transmitted the disease to many others.“She doesn’t have other health problems now. Though she is asymptomatic she can transmit the disease to others. In Kozencherry government hospital we are planning to transfer her to Kottayam medical college hospital if the next result also turns positive,” said one of the doctors treating her. The late onset of the disease has now emerged as another worry for overworked health officials. In Kozhikkode (north Kerala) a person returned from Dubai on March 18, tested positive at least 29 days after he was exposed to the virus.The World Health Organization (WHO) had prescribed a 14-day incubation period for coronavirus but Kerala had extended it to 28 days to ensure that an asymptomatic person or a patient is disinfected completely.In Pathanamthitta a girl student, who travelled in a compartment in which some Tablighi Jammat members were also travelling, tested positive 22 days after her trip. Under observation she remained asymptomatic throughout but turned positive when her observation period was about to end. She was asymptomatic even after she tested positive on April 6, said doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-kerala-woman-tests-positive-19-times-after-42-days-in-hospital/story-mEfxaVkCBBLPl6ZvhFSjMN.html

He said it should not have happened and called it an isolated incident. The responsibility to remain united in the time of crisis is on each and everyone of us, he added.Pawar was referring to the incident on April 16 night when three men from Kandivali in neighbouring Mumbai were travelling to Surat in a car. The vehicle was stopped and the trio was beaten to death with sticks by a mob on suspicion that they were thieves.It later emerged that the sadhus — 70-year-old Swami Kalpvriksha Giri and 35-year-old Sushil Giri — belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were on their way to Gujarat to attend the last rites of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced a high level probe by the Criminal Investigation Department. “The incident has nothing to do with the novel coronavirus. Whatever happened was unfortunate and should not have happened. It is condemnable. It happened due to misunderstanding. The state government and police acted swiftly. Over 100 people found involved in the primary investigation were arrested and put behind bars the very next day,” said the NCP chief in a video interaction with people.“But a picture is being created that Maharashtra’s law and order is in a bad shape and resignations are being demanded over an isolated incident. I personally feel political struggle and whatever games have to be settled can be done at a proper time, but this is not the right time for all this,” the veteran leader said without naming anyone.He said that all need to be united in the fight against this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-time-to-settle-political-scores-sharad-pawar-on-palghar-lynching-blame/story-0ZapxHyY3BwUusgR3BgcIN.html

Previously, 15 cases were detected on April 3 and 18 on April 5, most of them from Bhubaneswar.Follow coronavirus latest updates here.On Monday night, five more people including a 12-year-old boy were tested positive in Balasore town which is now emerging as a Covid-19 hotspot. All five are family members of a 58-year-old man who had tested positive on April 18.Odisha health and family welfare department officials said the 10 workers of Jajpur and Bhadrak districts who had tested positive were working in West Bengal and had returned to Odisha in the last 28 days evading the lockdown by travelling in small vehicles or goods trains and other means.Chief spokesperson of state government on Covid-19, Subroto Bagchi, said 24 of the 79 cases in Odisha had travel history to West Bengal where the number of Covid-19 cases is rising sharply. In Kolkata, 54 new cases were reported on Monday.Five people from Bhadrak, aged between 48 years and 66 years, had slipped through the Odisha-Bengal border between March 28 and April 9. Quarantined in their homes, they were all asymptomatic till they tested positive on Monday. Another five people of Jajpur district, aged between 28 years and 64 years, working as labourers in Howrah and Burrabazar area, too had returned from Kolkata in the last 28 days.Jajpur district collector Ranjan Das said one of the five Covid-19 patients detected in Bhadrak had travelled with five people from Jajpur in a van while they were returning from Kolkata on March 29. As the five got down at Sathipur on March 30 morning, the district collector appealed to residents of villages situated adjacent to Sathipur to inform the officials if anyone with travel history to Kolkata had reached the villages after March 30.“Most people from West Bengal are clandestinely trying to sneak into the villages. It’s not possible for the state administration and police to keep watch on every village. So the grampanchayats are extremely important in detection of potential Covid cases,” a health department press release said.A senior police official said though every effort is being made to seal the Odisha-Bengal border, many people were crossing over into the state in ambulances. Though all modes of passenger transport services have been suspended for over a week, a large number of people have been entering Odisha by smaller roads connecting the two states through private vehicles like cars, auto-rickshaw, mini-buses and trucks.“We have little way of knowing how many of them are genuine. Instead of going to hospitals in Kolkata, many of the patients from Bengal’s Midnapore district are flooding AIIMS Bhubaneswar and SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. They may prove to be the greatest source of infection,” said the official.An AIIMS official said in the last one week, the number of patients from Bengal has gone up.With more and more people from Bengal entering Odisha through numerous roads, Odisha’s Director General of Police Abhay visited the state’s border with Bengal in Balasore and Mayurbhanj districts on Tuesday to oversee its sealing. Odisha has 38 villages that share the border with Bengal. Of the 38 villages, 35 are in Balasore and rest are in Mayurbhanj district.A two-year-old tribal girl in Balasore district was among the 18 who tested positive on Monday, making her the youngest Covid-19 patient in the state. The girl in Nilagiri block was running fever and had a cold following which she was taken to the district headquarters hospital in Balasore where her swab sample was taken. Officials said they were intrigued by the girl’s case as she did not have any travel history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-second-time-odisha-records-18-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-10-have-a-bengal-link/story-uULenB2MH7u87ttcOt00jN.html

We propose to recognize and honour the valiant work being done by our Covid warriors. The state would treat them as martyrs,” said Patnaik, adding that a detailed scheme of awards will be instituted and given on national days.The CM said families of all government personnel (medical and others) who die during Covid-19 will continue to receive full salary till the date of retirement. Warning against any discrimination and harassment of the doctors and other health workers employed in the containment effort, Patnaik said any act against the doctors and the health workers is an act against the State.“If any act that will disturb or dishonour their work, very strict criminal action will be taken including invoking the provisions of NSA,” he said, referring to the attack on an ASHA worker in Nayagarh district, who was left scalded after a man poured hot gruel on her face during an awareness session on the spread of the virus.Last month, Odisha government had floated an advertisement to recruit around 8000 doctors, nurses, paramedics and multipurpose health workers, pharmacists, laboratory technicians and radiographers offering them lucrative amount to join the battle against the pandemic. To boost the morale of the health care staff, chief minister Naveen Patnaik also announced advance payment of 4-months salary to doctors, paramedics and workers engaged in health services in the State.The announcement came on the day when three doctors and 19 nurses working in a hospital in Jajpur district were sent into institutional quarantine after coming in contact with Covid-19 positive persons while treating them in the OPD. On Monday, 5 labourers of Jajpur district aged between 28 years and 64 years, working in Howrah and Burrabazar area of Kolkata had tested positive, 2-3 weeks after returning from there.“The recent confirmed cases had come in direct contact with some doctors & paramedical staff at the medical outdoor ward. So we have put all of them in quarantine. All their family members have also been advised to remain in home quarantine,” said Jajpur district collector Ranjan Kumar Das.Though Odisha did not have any positive cases for consecutive 3 days till April 19, on April 20 there were 18 new cases taking the total number of positive cases in the State to 79. Of the 18 new cases on Monday, 10 were due to the influx of people from Bengal defying lockdown. Revenue divisional commissioner (eastern) Anil Samal, who is camping in Balasore district that shares a large part of its border with Bengal, said around 2,800 people have trespassed into the Balasore from neighbouring States in the past two months.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“We’ve received information that people have trespassed into Balasore from WB through unauthorised ambulance rides and by crossing adjoining farmlands with WB border. Appropriate action will be taken against them for violating lockdown guidelines,” said Samal, who had a meeting with State DGP Abhay at Balasore today.The RDC said around 700 people who have returned from West Bengal and other neighbouring States have registered themselves. “Those who have returned in the last 14 days are being identified and placed under quarantine. Sample testing of these persons will be done on a priority basis. There are many other WB returnees who did not register, may be out of fear. So we have directed the local authorities and police to trace all these people and compulsorily put them in the government quarantine facility. Those violating private quarantine guidelines would be shifted to government centres,” he added.For Coronavirus Live Updates||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-state-funeral-and-martyr-status-for-odisha-covid-warriors-cash-and-job-for-families/story-SOfOz3bDqwlwTkmxJ9VkNO.html

In a statement issued in response to Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) comments about minorities in India, the minister said, “Secularism and harmony is not political fashion but it is perfect passion for India and Indians. This inclusive culture and commitment has united the country with fabric of unity in diversity.”Naqvi said the constitutional, social and religious rights of all the citizens, including those of minorities, is India’s constitutional and moral guarantee. “Traditional and professional bogus bashing brigades are still active in conspiring to spread misinformation. We should remain cautious of such evil forces and we need to work united to defeat their nefarious misinformation propaganda,” the minister said.He also urged people to observe Ramzan, which begins this week, inside their homes so that the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19 can be checked.The OIC had on Sunday urged India to take “urgent steps” to protect the rights of its minority Muslim community and stop the incidents of “Islamophobia” in the country.Reacting to it, Naqvi said, “We are doing our job with conviction. The prime minister, whenever he speaks, he talks about the rights and welfare of 130 crore Indians. If somebody cannot see this, then it is their problem. India’s Muslims, its minorities, all its sections, are prosperous and those people trying to vitiate this atmosphere of prosperity, they cannot be friends of Indian Muslims.”He also said that India is “a heaven for Muslims and minorities”. The social, economic and religious rights of Muslims are more secure and stronger in India than in other countries, Naqvi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/secularism-harmony-not-political-fashion-but-passion-for-us-minister-naqvi-on-oic-statement/story-knrKwrOyZQWeJjzVTvFZGO.html

We are investigating the matter, the official said.West Bengal has so far reported 12 deaths and 330 cases of COVID-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-withdraws-defective-covid-19-test-kits-consignment-from-bengal-after-complaint/story-IRxWtjrq2reX6GMyDZfczK.html
21-04-2020||India||Rs 70,000 cr Covid-19 package for power firms; cabinet approval expected soon||The government is working out a Rs 70,000 crore financial package for the power sector that is battling to stay afloat amid plunging cash inflows, sharp drop in bill collections and unchanged tariffs that are bleeding their balance sheets.Power tariff collections, the primary revenue source for distribution companies (Discoms) that carry electricity to homes, factories and the corporate towers, have fallen by nearly 80 percent in the last monthly cycle, top government officials told Hindustan Times.The nationwide lockdown has put a hard stop across India’s broader economy as factories have remained shut, construction activity suspended, and restaurants and shops, other than those selling essentials, closed since March 24.Despite a fast approaching summer with temperatures pushing 40 degree centigrade in many areas across the north-western plains, peak power demand has fallen sharply as economic activity remains restricted to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Current power consumption has dropped to 125 gigawatts as compared to 165-168 gigawatts in April 2019, triggering a dramatic collapse in discoms’ bill collections.Most discoms, officials said, have reported revenue collections that are equivalent to about one-fifth of their average collections last year, mirroring the fiscal brittleness of India’s power sector.From about Rs 55,000 crore that a discom used to earn during a 30-45 day cycle last year, the average collections during the last 30-odd days have fallen to about Rs 12,000 crore.The Union power ministry will now seek to fast-track a Rs 70,000 crore financial package that will aid the beleaguered power companies to navigate this difficult period.The package, which could be taken to the cabinet for approval as early as next week, is likely to offer a moratorium and restructuring of debt repayment by power companies spread over an eight-year period, officials said.A revision in the tariff structure, which will allow power companies to charge higher rates from consumers, is also a possibility after economic activity gathers pace and companies gradually start scaling up operations.The power sector has been hard hit with the lockdown since the producer has to pay for a fixed charge to keep the generation going despite much lower consumption.The Centre is looking to introduce several reforms including limiting cross-subsidies where industrial consumers pay a higher rate to enable discoms to keep rates of domestic consumers low.Thermal power companies that account for 70 percent of India’s power generation have had to put up with the system of paying for coal in advance and stocking these up by paying high railway freight rates despite falling demand, denting their cash position.“The last issue is being resolved through a Usance letter of credit or deferred payment of credit,” a power ministry official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-70-000-cr-covid-19-package-for-power-firms-cabinet-approval-expected-soon/story-QJpV5trLmebMW9NEnl0ZnO.html

Kaziranga is the biggest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world and is home to around 2,400 members of the species.“The calf got separated from the mother and was found roaming around Deopani area close to the national highway. When we got the information from the nearby villagers, we went and rescued it around 11:00 am on Sunday,” said P Sivakumar, park’s director.“We tried to locate the mother but weren’t successful. Since there was a threat to the calf from tigers or other animals, we sent it to the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC),” he added.Located at Borjuri village near the national park, the CWRC is the only facility in India where orphaned or injured wild animals are hand-raised or treated before returning them to the wild.Every year, the centre handles several baby rhinos, elephants etc. that are rescued during the annual floods that submerge most areas of the park.In the meantime, officials at Kaziranga have started looking for the mother who could be searching for her missing calf.“We have engaged our people in the Deopani area to trace the mother as she should be in that particular location. There are around 50 rhinos in that area. Without knowing the exact mother, we can’t release the calf into the herd as there is a possibility of an adult rhino attacking it,” said Sivakumar.Baby rhinos are extremely attached to their mothers who are very protective of them. The babies stay with their mothers for around three years before venturing on their own.“Since the baby is very small, it must have been suckling. As there is a threat to it if it’s left in the wild, it is better for it to stay at the CWRC till the mother is found. It’s a challenging task, but personnel at the centre are experienced and well-equipped to handle such babies,” said Bibhab Talukdar, founder of Guwahati-based wildlife NGO Aaranyak.Though the exact reason for the calf’s separation is not known, Talukdar said as a survival tactic. Sometimes mothers ‘run away’ from the baby to protect it when an adult male in heat approaches her, he said. “The calf is a male weighing around 70 kilograms. It was very dehydrated and weak. Its treatment and care are underway. Hopefully, we will be to feed it prepared milk using a bottle from Tuesday,” said Rathin Barman, in-charge of CWRC.Usually, the CWRC deals with orphaned or separated baby rhinos during the annual floods, but it rarely deals with such cases during the rest of the year. Last year, the centre had taken care of 5 rhino calves during floods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baby-rhino-gets-separated-from-mom-in-assam-s-kaziranga-efforts-underway-to-reunite-both/story-RT07x0Xy0cIzG8q25FCpbO.html

But in the span of about 29 days, the state has registered as many as 1485 Covid-19 cases with 76 of them dead and as many as 26 of its 52 districts affected.Madhya Pradesh has emerged as one of the worst managed states in the country during the period with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan blaming the then Congress government for the present situation in the state.Also read: What you need to know todayAt the same time, Indore has become one of the major hotspots in the country, prompting the central government to send a team on Monday to the city to assess and manage the situation.“To become a one-man army, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan put in peril the lives of 7.50 crore people of Madhya Pradesh.

So we have decided to stop the tests for now and sought guidance from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR),” Sharma said a day after the tests were stopped.On Friday, Rajasthan became the first state in the country to start rapid antibody tests after it received 10,000 kits for carrying out such testing. On the same day, 52 people were tested using the kits and all the results were negative.Sharma said doctors of the medicine and microbiology department at SMS Medical College used the rapid testing kits on positive patients to study their efficacy but were dissatisfied with results.“They advised us to stop the tests,” he said, adding the government will now await guidance from ICMR.“We have told them that we followed all the protocols for the rapid tests as set by ICMR,” Sharma said.The rapid antibody test is not a confirmatory test as antibodies may not immediately develop in a Covid-19-positive case and those may remain in cured patients.The confirmatory test for Covid-19 continues to be the RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test.Rajasthan has so far recorded nearly 1,500 infections and 14 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rajasthan-stops-rapid-antibody-tests-seeks-guidance-from-icmr/story-QHMRM6WI6kCTpOA2UIhmNI.html

21-04-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 lockdown, Delhi breathes cleaner air as PM2.5 drops to 35||Amid the coronavirus lockdown, countries across the globe have reported a significant drop in air pollution and witnessed improved air quality. According to the World Air Quality Index, countries like the United States, Spain, Italy, China, France, Mexico and the UK have reported a drop in the level of NO2 levels in April as compared to the same period last year. The most significant improvement in air quality was seen in New Delhi. Amid the lockdown, India’s national capital reported a drop in its NO2 levels. Nitrogen dioxide or NO2 is a gas emitted by motor vehicles and factories mostly and therefore, a drop in its level was indicative of reduced human activity outside the home amid the coronavirus lockdown.As per an analysis by experts at the nonprofit Center for Science and Environment, days after the coronavirus lockdown was put into force on March 25 in India, the level of particle pollution dropped by nearly 60% in New Delhi.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the air quality in the national capital on Tuesday (April 21) was recorded in the ‘satisfactory’ category with PM10 at 68 and PM2.5 at 35. The overall Air Quality Index in the national capital hovered around 68, as mentioned on the SAFAR website on Tuesday. This is a sharp drop in air pollution for the national capital which usually records ‘poor’ to ‘sever’ level of air quality with the AQI ranging between 100 to 300 and even higher in colder months. It is even predicted the air quality may touch “good” level in the national capital. “The overall Delhi AQI is the satisfactory category on 21st April morning as forecasted. The SAFAR model suggests AQI likely to improve further towards the lower end of the satisfactory category (may just touch good category) for 22nd April,” the website mentioned. Just a couple of months back in February, the pollution level in the national capital was deteriorating. The overall air quality in the first week of February stood in the “very poor” category with the Air Quality Index (AQI) docking at around 300, SAFAR has reported. But experts worry the clean air and unsullied skies are not here to stay once the lockdown is lifted. Selected business and economic activities resumed across the country on April 20. While the Delhi administration decided to provide no relaxation in lockdown restrictions in the national capital, some neighbouring states lifted few curbs.Experts fear that a return to the pre-lockdown situation, where factories resume operations and vehicles jam the roads again, pollution levels will rise again.“Currently, we have clean air due to the lockdown but this respite is short term. After the restrictions are lifted and human activities start, there will be a sudden rise in air pollution,” TK Joshi, member, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) task force on air pollution and health told HT’s business publication Mint.  PM10 and PM2.5 are particles (particulate matter) present in the air that are classified as pollutants and can harm human health. PM10 is particulate matter 10 micrometres or less in diameter while PM2.5 is particulate matter 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-spurs-drop-in-air-pollution-across-the-globe-experts-say-relief-could-be-short-term/story-nOmiaE9H0DaWXTfh23crlJ.html
21-04-2020||India||Through sea and forests: How workers are trying to reach home amid lockdown||Millions of workers and other people have been stranded across India since a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24. Many have shown unprecedented grit and determination to return home despite restrictions on travelling.Around 1.5 million workers were stopped and kept in shelter homes and camps set up by state governments across India, where they got food at least twice a day.Many workers in cities such as Mumbai and Surat protested, demanding permission to return to their villages as they had no money. But some workers defied government orders and took different ways to reach homes. HT looks at five ways the workers took to reach their villages.Water routeOn Monday morning, a group of 27 migrant workers from Andhra Pradesh and Odisha returned to their villages using the sea route from Chennai. They pooled in whatever money they had to buy a boat for Rs 2 lakh and decided to travel along India’s eastern coast as travel by road was not allowed during the lockdown. Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrita Kulange said these workers, including 10 from Odisha, had gone to Chennai a few months ago to work in local factories.“After the lockdown was announced and their factories shut down, these labourers could not get transport to come back. They decided to pool their money to buy a fishing boat for Rs 2 lakh, in which they decided to escape,” said Kulange. However, these 27 workers, who landed at Donkuri, have been booked under the Disaster Management Act for violating lockdown norms and put in quarantine, said a police officer of Srikakulam district.On Sunday, 191 migrant workers were arrested in Guntur district of Telangana when they were found travelling in a boat on the Krishna river to reach their destination. Each worker paid Rs 500 to the boat-owner, who promised he would ensure they reach their villages, police said.Walking through forestsThe death of a 12-year-old girl in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur after she walked about 100 km over three days revealed that hundreds of workers from Telangana, Odisha and Maharashtra are returning to their villages in Maoist-affected Bastar region through dense forests. The girl was part of a group of 13 migrants who were returning to their village from a chilli farm in Telangana’s Mulgu district, where work was suspended because of the lockdown.The workers began walking from Telangana’s Perur on April 15, and the girl named Jamlo Madkami died of stress (not Covid-19) on reaching Chhattisgarh on April 18. The other 12 workers have been put in quarantine.Police officials said there were reports of tribal people walking back from Odisha and Maharashtra through the dense and tough terrain of Chhattisgarh’s forests, which are being verified by different police stations. “The workers took a forested route to reach their village because of the closure of roads due to the lockdown,” said Bijapur’s chief medical officer, BR Pujari.Cycling homeOn April 1, Mahesh Jena, like many other workers in India, set off on an unusual journey by cycling back to his home in Odisha’s Jaipur district from Sangli in Maharashtra, a journey of 1,700 km. As there was a rumour that factories would remain closed for at least five months, Jena said: “Everyone was very scared. How we will earn? How will we eat? How will we pay room rent? No one said anything to us about how we will survive, whether we will be paid.”On his way back, Jena saw crowds of migrant workers on foot. “I did not think of anything more. I did not think about food or water, or whether the cycle would last,” he said. Determined to reach home, Jena cycled an average of a little more than 200 km a day and reached his village on April 8.On April 1, another worker named Arif made an arduous bicycle journey from Mumbai to Jammu to see his ailing father, who had suffered a stroke. He was helped by CRPF’s Madadgar helpline to complete his journey in about eight days.Many other workers have cycled shorter distances to reach home. Radheshyam Patel was among a group of 50 workers who cycled from Gujarat’s Ahmedabad to Rajasthan’s Dungarpur district, a distance of 150 km. “Since no buses were available, we decided to cycle back home,” Patel said. Similar reports were received from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.Stuffed in vehiclesOn Sunday, Telangana Police found three students hiding in a milk tanker at Pondugula check-post. They were on their way to Singarayakonda in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh from Miryalaguda in Telangana. Nalgonda district’s superintendant of police PV Ranganath said each student paid Rs 1,000 to get back to their villages.On March 28, around 10 workers were found hidden in a milk tanker in Thane district of Maharashtra, travelling back to their villages in Rajasthan. They were detained at Talasari in Palghar district of Maharashtra along the Gujarat boundary, PTI news agency reported. The migrants chose this method as regular transport was not available.In another incident, 32 workers, including women and children, were caught packed into a truck like sardines and covered by a tarpaulin at Lucknow’s Gomti Nagar on April 2. They were travelling in the truck with a Delhi registration number to their villages in violation of the lockdown, police said. Vijay, who identified himself as the leader of the group, said, “We managed to enter Uttar Pradesh, despite the border being sealed because we knew alternative routes to sneak in. We managed to reach Lucknow with great difficulty. We somehow managed to come this far and now are not too far from our destination.”All of them were from Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh. Similar reports of workers hiding in trucks and pick-up vans were received from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.Ambulance A couple from Tripura travelled 3,213 km from Tamil Nadu in an ambulance to reach their home amid the lockdown last Saturday. They had gone to Chennai on March 20 and got stranded because of the lockdown. As the lockdown was extended, the couple decided to return home on April 15 and reached Agartala on Sunday night. “It was quite difficult to stay at hospital and bear the high cost. We needed to defer our daughter’s marriage, which was supposed to be on May 8,” said Chanchal Majumder, who had taken his wife to Chennai for treatment for a brain tumour.Majumder, a retired government official, spent Rs 1.4 lakh for the journey in an ambulance and travelled almost non-stop, zipping past seven states. They bought food from whatever shops were open. The couple has now been put in institutional quarantine at Udaipur in Tripura. “After they came here, we immediately shifted them to institutional quarantine. They didn’t meet anyone, not even their daughter. I have visited them. Both are fine now,” said Gomati district magistrate TK Debnath. Earlier, a couple from Nepal travelled from Chennai in an ambulance to reach the India-Nepal border in West Bengal, where they were put in quarantine. A police officer, who declined to be named, said the Nepalese couple paid Rs 2 lakh for the ambulance with a curfew pass. The couple told police that people on the way provided them food during their 2,300-km journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-foot-on-cycles-in-a-boat-how-desperate-people-are-trying-to-reach-home-amid-lockdown/story-srfOdlp47tnvazxAH3tHLM.html

The family lost a 44-year-old female member on March 30.Although no new cases have been reported in the district that shares its borders with Bhutan, Sikkim and Darjeeling, locals in Kalimpong, especially those who are old and unwell, are facing discrimination.Ghatani, a resident of Mungpoo in Darjeeling district, fell ill on Saturday and her family members took her to Rambi community block primary health centre the next day. The doctor referred her to Kalimpong district hospital but the health centre allegedly denied an ambulance. After much persuasion, an ambulance took the patient up to Chitray, 14 kilometres away from Kalimpong. The patient was taken to the Kalimpong hospital in a car provided by a social worker named Jyoti Karki. The old woman was admitted at 1 pm and she died at 8 pm on Sunday.Bimal Ghatani, one of the sons of the deceased, said “Had we been able to admit her in Kalimpong hospital on time she might have survived. Precious hours were lost in search of an ambulance.”Bimal, who is a carpenter, said “At Mungpoo, local people have made it clear that those who took my mother to Kalimpong cannot return home. They have been told to stay in quarantine for 14 days.”Last week, eight-year-old Dishan Khati - a resident of Tirpai in Kalimpong - had fever, cough and signs of pneumonia. On April 15, a doctor in Kalimpong referred him to a private nursing home in Siliguri saying that all arrangements had been made and the nursing home was one of those authorized to treat Covid-19 patients.Yasaka Khati, the child’s father who runs his family by driving cars, said, “Though the government is saying that ambulance in cases like these will be provided for free, I was forced to take my son to Siliguri in my vehicle as the driver of a government ambulance demanded Rs 1500.”“That was not all. The nursing home authorities refused to admit my son and even policemen did not help. We took my son to the state-run North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH). There, we had to wait for long hours before my son got admission. But we were not happy with the arrangements,” Khati said.“On April 16, we took my son back to Kalimpong hospital. The boy is doing fine now,” said Khati.   On April 15, Sujata Sherpa, a pregnant woman from the Algarah area in Kalimpong was referred to a Siliguri hospital by the Kalimpong district hospital for a USG test. Sujata and her husband, Sangey Sherpa, went to Siliguri district hospital. Sangey said, “The moment the hospital staff came to know that we were from Kalimpong, they started behaving differently and told us to go to NBMCH at night. At NBMCH, the staff refused to get my wife admitted as she was bleeding. We were asked to return the next day. We were so helpless that we had to spend the night of April 15 in a church in Siliguri,” said Sherpa. The USG was done the next day and the couple returned home with the help from social workers. Dr CK Chettri, block medical officer of Rambi said, “The family of Ghatani never sought the government ambulance.” Jyoti Karki, whose car was used by the Ghatanis, said, “People of Kalimpong are facing social discrimination in other areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kalimpong-s-only-covid-19-hit-family-triggers-panic-discrimination-in-north-bengal-hills/story-LQ2aGfawtnjP7Bhbfw6peP.html

21-04-2020||India||Adivasi MLA, who was once a Maoist, treks through Telangana forests to deliver ration to the tribals||Danasari Anasuya (49), a Congress lawmaker, who represents Telangana’s Mulug assembly constituency, a Scheduled Tribe (ST) reserved seat, tweeted on Tuesday: “When I was crossing this area (Tupakulagudem village, north of Warangal in undivided Andhra Pradesh, near the Godavari river that separates neighbouring Chhattisgarh), it took me back to my old days. That time gun in my hand, now rice and vegetables that I distributed among 12 remote tribal villages.” Anasuya was a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Jana Sakthi, a splinter group of the present-day outlawed CPI (M-L), in the 1990s. Her name --- she was known as Seethakaka in her dreaded Maoist gun-wielding avatar ---spelled terror for the local feudal lords, but she was popular among the poor tribals in Etur Nagaram forests abutting Chhattisgarh. She laid down her arms to join the mainstream in 1994 and became a politician a decade later.Now, Anasuya, who is still fondly called Seethakka by her fellow tribals, is travelling from one adivasi village to another extending a helping hand amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown, which was initially enforced on March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3, to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. She is organising the basic daily necessities for the tribals, who are used to subsistence existence, such as food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc. “Most of the tribals are oblivious to the goings-on in the outside world. They have no concept about Covid-19. All that they know is that weekly markets and shops are close and they are not allowed to travel to adjoining villages to buy the essential commodities,” Seethakka told Hindustan Times.She went to Mulug on March 23 before the lockdown was enforced, where she came to know about the deplorable plight of the tribals after some local youth drew her attention to them. “Some of my party colleagues and I quickly pooled in money and bought rice, dal and other commodities and distributed them among 100 tribals. The following day another 100 adivasis sought my help. This made me realise the intensity of the problem. I’ve decided to stay put in my constituency to help these hapless people till the crisis blows over,” she said.She is travelling to every nook and cranny of the forests for over three weeks on whatever mode of transport is available. “Some villages are accessible, where I could travel by jeeps, cars and even auto-rickshaws. But some are only accessible by tractors and bullock carts,” she added.The feisty rebel-turned-politician did not hesitate to trek for several kilometres, crossing streams, and rivulets, to reach some of the inaccessible villages while carrying food grains and vegetables for the tribals.“I made a long trek to Tupakulagudem village, located on the banks of Godavari river, last week,” she said.Anasuya is adept at negotiating the inhospitable terrain, as her Koya tribal roots stand her in good stead in this moment of reckoning. “I have no problem in locating these tribal hamlets and assessing the villagers’ needs. I don’t take my security personnel along with me on my journey to these villages because I know that the tribals are scared of them,” she said.Anasuya has also been creating awareness about Covid-19 among the illiterate tribals such as the need for social distancing and wearing masks. “Initially, they fobbed me off and wanted to shake my hands as a mark of gratitude and respect. But I explained to them the need for social distancing. They have understood its importance and are cooperating with us,” she said.There is a pattern in her daily life since March 23. She travels from one village to another and usually clocks around 60 odd kilometres. “I have lunch with the villagers and return to Mulug by evening. I’ve been to each and every village more than once. I’ve told the villagers to get in touch with me, should they fall short of essential commodities. I’ve promised them that I’d be there the next day with the supplies,” she added.Anasuya joined the armed rebellion at a tender age of 14 when she a Class IX student in Mulug, which those days used to be part of undivided Andhra Pradesh’s Warangal district. In retrospect, she joined the call of arms because Jana Sakthi was one of the major left-wing extremist groups in the region. She proved her mettle and in two years was elevated as a “dalam” (squad) leader in the party’s ranks and had few narrow brushes with death during close encounters with security forces in the dense forests.However, she got disillusioned with the extremist movement because of a leadership crisis in Jana Sakthi and surrendered in 1994 while responding to the government’s amnesty plea. Later, she graduated in law from Warangal and became a lawyer. She became active in women’s issues and in 2004 joined the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in the presence of the party president, N Chandrababu Naidu.She became a member of the Andhra Pradesh assembly in 2009 from Mulug constituency but lost from the same seat in 2014 after the formation of the separate state of Telangana. In 2017, she quit the TDP and joined the Congress. She wrested Mulug in 2018 December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adivasi-mla-who-was-once-a-maoist-treks-through-telangana-forests-to-deliver-ration-to-the-tribals/story-Gs5fN0877GTI6RNQfqNYbO.html
21-04-2020||India||‘You helped foreigners, now let migrant workers go home’: Gehlot to PM Modi||The Uttar Pradesh government’s move to evacuate its students from Kota in Rajasthan during the Covid-19 lockdown has brought the other states under pressure to act and ensure early return of their stranded migrant workers. Except Bihar, many states such as Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Assam and Jharkhand have now approached the Rajasthan government to facilitate the return of their stranded students and are making the necessary arrangements for their travel back home. Apart from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand too has taken back its students.The move has triggered demands for the passage of migrant workers stuck in different states to their respective native places.Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said he spoke to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday and told him that his state has a different problem than others.“A large number of Rajasthanis, including migrant workers, shopkeepers, private employees, small businessmen are stuck in Assam, North East, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra and other states. They are feeling frustrated and desperately want to go back to their homes and meet their family members,” he told Hindustan Times.Gehlot said he told Shah that if the Centre allows them to return to their homes, only then they would be eager to go back to their work places in different states once the lockdown is lifted.“They will feel satisfied after meeting their family members and happily go back to states where they worked once the lockdown is withdrawn,” he added.The Rajasthan chief minister said the Centre should have given at least five days to the migrant workers and others to go back to their homes like it had allowed the flights before enforcing the restrictions.He said Shah has assured him that the Centre will soon take a call on the issue. “The home minister told me that he will inform me about the government’s decision tomorrow,” added Gehlot.The Opposition parties, led by the Congress, had expressed concerns over the plight of migrant workers who were forced to take a long walk back to their villages due to the nationwide lockdown enforced to contain the coronavirus pandemic.The political parties had urged the Centre to allow a one-time state transport services be made available to the migrant workers to enable them to go back to their homes.Gehlot said he would request Prime Minister Narendra Modi that when his government can help in the evacuation of foreigners stranded in India and get back the Indians stuck abroad, he should also facilitate the return of migrant workers and others, including five lakh Rajasthani citizens, to their homes as nearly a month had passed since the restrictions were enforced.“Once they are in right frame of mind after meeting their family members, they would be able to resume their activities and play a major role in the revival of economic activities once the lockdown is lifted,” he said.Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren told Hindustan Times that he would request a special train from the Centre to transport migrant workers and others from different states back to their homes.Officials in Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh said they are inundated with calls from residents, mostly students seeking help to return to their states.An official in Himachal Pradesh, speaking on the condition of anonymity said, after the coronavirus outbreak the state had sealed its borders to ensure there is no movement of people or commercial vehicles though arrangements had been made for passage of those in need of critical care or other emergency reasons.“There are many students in places such as Rajasthan and Chandigarh and they have been calling to get them back to the state. Since there is a countrywide lockdown and movement is barred, we will have to take a call on the best way to deal with the situation,” said the official quoted above.In Madhya Pradesh too, the issue of bringing back students and migrant workers from adjoining states is being discussed.An official privy to the developments said the issue of working out the details of how to arrange for transportation of students and workers was raised at a meeting of the task force set up recently.Amitabh Kundu, distinguished fellow, Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said the government should formulate ways for allowing the workers to commute during the lockdown by issuing electronic passes.He said these passes can be issued for travel in buses that can be easily sanitized and allowed outside the hotspots. “Companies can provide small payment to the state for each vehicle to meet the additional cost of the supervision and management. Employees opting for commutation though self-driven cars can also be provided e-permits,” he said.Earlier this week, the Centre issued guidelines for movement of workers within a state following the decision to ease restrictions in non Covid-19 hotspots to resume economic activities.While inter-state movement of workers during the lockdown has been prohibited, MSMEs, construction and agriculture activities outside the containment zones, have been permitted from April 20.As per the order, migrant labourers in relief and shelter camps will have to be registered with the concerned local authority and their skill mapping will have to be carried out to find out their suitability for various kinds of work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-states-under-pressure-to-bring-back-migrant-workers/story-E5O7mgeukoO1RDANBDMAWO.html
21-04-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 crisis, Rajasthan hit by shortage of automatic RNA extraction kits||Even as Rajasthan conducts more tests per million population than the national average for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), its biggest testing centre – SMS Hospital in Jaipur – is hit by a shortage of automatic RNA extraction kits. This has reduced the testing capacity to half and the state had to send 4,000 samples to a Delhi lab on Sunday to clear the backlog, said a top health official on Monday.The Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing process for Covid-19 requires a Viral Transport Medium (VTM) kit to take the sample to a lab. The process requires an RNA extraction machine, automatic or manual, to extract ribonucleic acid, and an RT-PCR machine where the extracted RNA is amplified to study the viral load to confirm the presence of Sars-CoV-2.The VTMs and kits for RT-PCR machines are provided to the states by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) but the RNA extraction kits, which are proprietary items, have to be procured by the states from the manufactures of the machines.SMS Hospital has automatic RNA extraction machines from Easymag (France), Qaigen (Germany), Maxwell (US) and Perkin (US), said Rohit Kumar Singh, state additional chief secretary, medical and health department. These companies also provide kits to European and American labs, resulting in a delay in supply to Indian labs.Rajasthan government has proposed central procurement of these kits by the Government of India for their availability to states.“On Sunday, we had kits to last us three days. We have placed orders for 150,000 kits from these four companies. In the meantime, we decided to send 4,000 samples to a private lab in Delhi to clear the backlog,” Singh said.According to the 9 pm bulletin released by the state health department on Monday, 8,057 samples were under process at SMS Hospital.Currently, RT-PCR testing for Covid-19 is being done in 7 out of 14 government medical colleges in Rajasthan. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Jodhpur, also has a testing lab. The seven medical colleges include SMS Medical College in Jaipur whose associate hospital SMS Hospital is the only lab with automatic nuclear extraction machines; the remaining do it manually. Rajasthan’s testing capacity is 3,000 samples a day.The state government is ramping up its testing capacity to 10,000.

In this difficult time, as an immediate help, I give Rs 1 lakh from the CM Relief Fund and Rs 4 lakh from the voluntary grant. Bijapur Collector has been instructed to investigate the matter & report,” the CM tweeted.Madkami, who went to Perur in Telangana’s Mulgu district along with 13 migrant workers to pluck chilly, died in the jungle after reaching Chhattisgarh on April 18. She was about 50 kilometers from her village. Madkami and the others, including her uncle, began their long walk back home on April 15.Also read| Covid-19 lockdown: States under pressure to bring back migrant workersBijapur collector KD Kunjam said the girl’s post-mortem was done on Monday and the body was handed over to the family.“On April 20, after the report of the blood sample sent to Jagdalpur Medical College was found negative for the coronavirus, post-mortem was done by the district hospital in Bijapur. The body of the deceased was handed over of family members,” said the press release.On Monday, Bijapur chief medical health officer (CMHO) RS Pujari said electrolyte imbalance could have caused the girl’s death though he pointed out that the exact reason could not be ascertained immediately.Also read: Kalimpong’s only Covid-19 hit family triggers panic, discrimination in north Bengal hills“Since she travelled on difficult terrains for three days, she could be facing muscle fatigue which could led to some imbalance. Secondly, as per the people who were walking with her, she fell from a hillock and sustained injuries also,” Pujari added. An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said hundreds of workers have returned to their homes on foot from Telangana through dense forests since the lockdown was imposed in March and extended last week until May 3. “The forest routes are surrounded by Maoist-affected areas. Hence no one can monitor their movement,” said a police official involved in anti-Maoist operations, who did not want to be named.The lockdown triggered an exodus of migrant workers from bigger cities in March as tens of thousands of them left jobless because of the curbs imposed to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic began leaving for their homes on foot. This prompted the Centre to direct the states and Union territories to seal their borders and ensure the migrant workers are taken care of in shelter homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-1l-aid-for-kin-of-c-garh-girl-who-died-during-walk-back-home-from-t-gana/story-HeApvcYBe3eclb30q6YEpL.html

21-04-2020||India||‘Unilateral decision’ to send team ‘undesirable’; their movement wouldn’t be allowed: Mamata tells PM Modi||On a day when Bengal recorded a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases with 54 people testing positive, the Mamata Banerjee government locked horns with the Centre. Banerjee-led Bengal administration got upset with Centre’s move of sending two inter-ministerial teams to inspect various aspects of the state’s battle against the virus, including the measures of the health administration and the implementation of the lockdown.While chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said that the state would not allow the central team to move freely until their intention became clear to the state administration, chief minister Mamata Banerjee shot a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that Centre’s ‘unilateral decision’ was ‘undesirable’, alleging ‘breach of established protocol’. In her letter, Banerjee stated that Bengal enforced lockdown even before the Centre had announced it.I urge both Honb’le Prime Minister @NarendraModi Ji & Home Minister @AmitShah Ji to share the criterion used for this. Until then I am afraid, we would not be able to move ahead on this as without valid reasons this might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism. (2/2)“I would like to bring to your kind notice that today the Union Home Minister spoke to me over the telephone at about 1 pm regarding the visit of the inter-ministerial central teams to my state. Unfortunately, the teams had already landed in Kolkata airport by AI special cargo flight 1701 at 10.10 am, i.e. much before our telephonic conversation. The order dated April 19, 2020, from the home ministry addressed to the chief secretary also reached just 30 minutes before the teams arrived. While I appreciate the pro-activeness shown by the central government in sending their teams to West Bengal, the same was done without prior intimation and hence is a breach of established protocol,” Banerjee wrote in her letter.She alleged that while as per the home ministry’s order the state government was supposed to provide the logistical arrangements, the central teams kept the state in the dark and approached central forces such as the Border Security Force (BSF) and Seema Suraksha Bal and had started making their movements without consulting the state.“As an established procedure, it is expected that the central team should have first taken a briefing from the state government officials prior to going for the field visits,” the letter read.Banerjee alleged that the order from the home ministry mentioned “number of violations of lockdown measures” and said that “these observations are devoid of any facts and do not lend any credibility to the claim.”According to her, “selection of districts (for the central team’s visit) and observations made unilaterally are nothing but a figment of imagination and unfortunate.”The chief minister reminded the prime minister that West Bengal had “pro-actively announced the lockdown before it was announced by the central government”, and that the state extended the lockdown up to April 30 even before the Centre announced an extension of the lockdown on April 14.“I am sure you will kindly agree that such unilateral action on the part of the central government is not desirable at all,” she wrote in her letter.Banerjee also took to social media and posted on Twitter, “We welcome all constructive support & suggestions, especially from the Central Govt in negating the #Covid19 crisis. However, the basis on which Centre is proposing to deploy IMCTs in select districts across India including few in WB under Disaster Mgmt Act 2005 is unclear. I urge both Honb’le Prime Minister @NarendraModi Ji & Home Minister @AmitShah Ji to share the criterion used for this. Until then I am afraid, we would not be able to move ahead on this as without valid reasons this might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism.”Incidentally, the Centre had earlier written twice to the state, alleging a lax implementation of the lockdown, a charge that was echoed by senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in the state as also by the Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.The chief secretary, however, said on Monday, “We are going for a strict lockdown in containment areas of Kolkata and Howrah.” At some places in Kolkata and Howrah, the administration has deployed combat forces to ensure the lockdown is enforced strictly.Two inter-ministerial teams, one led by Apurva Chanda, additional secretary, department of defence and the other led by Vineet Joshi, additional secretary, ministry of human resource development, reached the state on Monday. They are to inquire about 7 of the state’s 23 districts. One team is to visit the districts in north Bengal and the other in south Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unilateral-decision-to-send-team-undesirable-their-movement-wouldn-t-be-allowed-mamata-tells-pm-modi/story-1ftB9EJg4hR8dz0BZrPfdJ.html

The sprawling premises of the old secretariat and the Vishweshwaraiya Bhavan in state capital Patna came alive shedding the ghostly silence that had prevailed there for nearly a month.In Fatuha block, on the outskirts of Patna, the numerous brick kilns restarted production.However, these relaxations come with strict rules to be followed to ensure that the coronavirus disease doesn’t spread. The police personnel stationed at the gates of the secretariat, which houses many government department, were allowing entry only to those who were carrying identity cards.“Others requiring entry into the premises would need to furnish a permission granted by a competent authority. None will be let in, though, if found to be running a temperature during screening,” an inspector told news agency PTI.The police personnel also carried out thermal screening of every occupant inside cars and two-wheelers entering the premises.Department heads also said they were strictly following guidelines like mandatory wearing of face masks and only one-thirds of the total workforce being assigned duty on a single working day, reported PTI.At the brick kilns, workers were seen maintaining a safe distance from each other and ‘gamchas’ or sari pallus wrapped around their faces.The contractors said they are ensuring that social distancing norms are followed and in case a worker is found suffering from symptoms like fever or cough, health department authorities will be alerted.In many parts of Muzaffarpur, enthusiastic residents came out on the streets in large numbers, prompting the local administration to step in with the warning that the lockdown was very much in place and overcrowding could lead to them being booked under the Disaster Management Act and relevant IPC sections.Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said with the easing of restrictions work would start on 40,000 projects which would provide employment to over a million daily wage earners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-bihar-spent-the-first-day-of-covid-19-lockdown-relaxation/story-UZCVNYRtwa0QteOnQAWAZI.html
21-04-2020||India||10 of 13 Covid-19 positive cases in Odisha has Bengal connect; alert sounded||With 10 people from Bhadrak and Jajpur districts with travel history to Kolkata testing positive for Covid-19 on Monday, Odisha recorded 18 such cases on a single day. This forced the Naveen Patnaik government to rush rapid response teams there to oversee measures to contain the spread of the virus while asking people with travel history to West Bengal during last 28 days to quarantine themselves at home.Eighteen Covid-19 positive patients were detected in Odisha till late Monday night, taking total number of cases to 79. Previously, 15 cases were detected on April 3 and 18 on April 5, most of them from Bhubaneswar. On Monday night, five more people, including a 12-year-old boy, were tested positive in Balasore town that is now emerging as a Covid-19 hotspot. The five are family members of the 58-year-old man of Balasore who had tested positive on April 18.Odisha health and family welfare department officials said the 10 workers of Jajpur and Bhadrak districts, who had tested positive, were working in West Bengal and had returned to Odisha in the last 28 days evading the lockdown by travelling in small vehicles or goods train and other means. Chief spokesperson of state government on Covid-19, Subroto Bagchi, said 24 of the 74 cases in Odisha had travel history to West Bengal, that has of late become a hotspot. In Kolkata, 54 new cases were reported on Monday.Five people from Bhadrak, aged between 48 years and 66 years, had slipped through the Odisha-Bengal border between March 28 and April 9. Quarantined in their homes, they were all asymptomatic till they tested positive on Monday. Similarly, another five people of Jajpur district, aged between 28 years and 64 years, working as labourers in Howrah and Burrabazar area, too had returned from Kolkata in the last 28 days.Jajpur district collector Ranjan Das said one of the five Covid-19 patients detected in Bhadrak had travelled with five people from Jajpur in a van while they were returning from Kolkata on March 29. As the five got down at Sathipur on March 30 morning, the district collector appealed to residents of villages situated adjacent to Sathipur to inform the officials if anyone with travel history to Kolkata had reached the villages after March 30 morning.“Most people from West Bengal are clandestinely trying to sneak into the villages. It’s not possible for the state administration and police to keep watch on every village. So the grampanchayats are extremely important in detection of potential Covid cases,” a health department press release said.A senior police official said though every effort is being made to seal the Odisha-Bengal border, many people were crossing over to Odisha in ambulances. Though all modes of passenger transport services have been suspended for over a week in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, a large number of people have been entering Odisha by smallers roads connecting the two states through private vehicles like cars, auto-rickshaw, mini-buses and trucks.“We have little way of knowing how many of them are genuine. Instead of going to hospitals in Kolkata, many of the patients from Bengal’s Midnapore district are flooding AIIMS Bhubaneswar and SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. They may prove to be the greatest source of infection,” said the official. An AIIMS official said in the last one week, the number of patients from Bengal have gone up.With more and more people from Bengal entering Odisha through numerous roads, Odisha DGP Abhay today visited the Odisha-Bengal border in Balasore an Mayurbhanj district on Tuesday to oversee the police arrangements of sealing the border. Odisha has 38 villages that share the border with Bengal. Of the 38 villages, 35 are in Balasore and rest in Mayurbhanj district.Meanwhile, in Balasore district, a two-year-old tribal girl tested positive, making her the youngest Covid-19 patient in the state. The girl in Nilagiri block was running fever and had cold following which she was taken to the district headquarters hospital in Balasore where her swab sample was taken. Officials said they were intrigued by the girl’s case as she did not have any travel history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-of-13-covid-19-positive-cases-in-odisha-has-bengal-connect-alert-sounded/story-0V6wGI4kMuVzdJUTM3xyWK.html

Don’t come out of your houses without reason. The fast can be observed at home too. Prayers too can be done alone at home. Please don’t ask neighbours to join you,” Imam Mufti Mukarram Ahmed said in his public appeal.The Ramzan will begin on April 23 (Thursday).Another prominent Muslim body Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind too appealed to Muslims on Monday to adhere to the lockdown guidelines and perform all religious rituals during Ramzan staying inside their homes.Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani urged Muslims to offer prayers, including special ‘Taraweeh’ prayers, during Ramzan at home rather than in mosques.“In view of deadly Covid-19 that has caused death and destruction all over the world, medical experts have suggested that social distancing is only option to break the chain of spread of this dangerous virus,” Madani said.The nationwide lockdown, which was from March 25 till April 14, has been extended to May 3 by the government to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease Covid-19.Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi last Thursday had directed state waqf boards to ensure strict implementation of the lockdown and social distancing guidelines during the holy month of Ramzan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stay-at-home-pray-at-home-during-ramzan-shahi-imam-of-delhi-mosque-urges-muslims/story-WGCQYS5j72qvpXkCINsFDP.html
21-04-2020||India||‘Data manipulated’: Congress targets BJP govt over variation in Covid-19 numbers in Madhya Pradesh||The government data on Covid-19 patients show variations in as many as 18 districts out of the 26 in Madhya Pradesh in the past three to four days, prompting the public health experts to demand an inquiry into it and Opposition Congress to attack the BJP government.As on Sunday evening, as per the state government’s health bulletin, Madhya Pradesh had 1,407 Covid-19 patients in 26 districts, out of whom 72 had died. There are 52 districts in Madhya Pradesh. As per the state government’s data, Ratlam in Malwa region had 12 cases of Covid-19 on April 17. It went up to 13 on April 18 but it declined to nine on April 9. Similarly, Khargone in Nimad region had 39 patients on April 17 and it increased to 47 the next day but later it came down to 43 on April 19.Ujjain, another district in Malwa region registered 30 cases on April 16. There was addition of one patient to the list the next day. But suddenly the number came down from 31 to 23 on April 18 and again it rose to 31 the next day.In tribal dominated Dhar district in Malwa region, the number of patients shown in the bulletin on April 16, 17, 18 and 19 was 6, 10, 24 and 21 respectively. In Alirajpur, another tribal dominated district, there was just one patient on April 17. The number went up to five on April 18 but came down to three on April 19.In Morena in Gwalior-Chambal region, there were 14 cases on April 17. In the next day’s state government bulletin, the number was shown as 13 but it went up to 16 in April 19 bulletin. Gwalior has a similar story. It had six patients on April 17, but came down to two the next day and again rose to six on April 19.There are similar variations in the number of Covid-19 cases in Indore, Chhindwara, Barwani, Betul, Sheopur, Khandwa, Raisen, Dewas, Shajapur and Mandsaur.More interesting is the case with Satna district. Two Covid-19 positive cases in Satna were shown in the bulletins from April 14 to April 16 but then the disstrict disappeared from the list.In none of the variations the government issued any clarification as to why the numbers decreased or any district’s name was dropped from the list of Covid-19 affected districts. Public health experts say since the government is providing cumulative figures of Covid-19 patients every day the figure will either increase or remain stagnant but it can’t decrease. There can be decrease in the number only in such situations when any person’s sample test report is found incorrect later or any patient’s name is added to any other district. But in such situations the government is expected to clarify this which didn’t happen. Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “A clerical error can happen in the data of a few districts and can be understood but such variations in data of about 70% of the Covid-19 districts is beyond comprehension. This is a serious issue as the same data are used to analyse the situation prevalent in the country by World Health Organisation (WHO), government of India and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). A transparency in data means effective management of the situation.”He said that many times the data of the districts released at the district level differed from the state bulletin and thus it led to confusion as to what is the real situation about the Covid-19 patients. Also, the state bulletin is expected after the districts provide their data to the state headquarters at about 4 pm but there were occasions as on Sunday itself when the state bulletin was released at 2 pm. “Collection and compilation of data, its accuracy and its timings of release are as important as measures being undertaken to control the situation. Hence, an inquiry should be conducted as to why so much variations in the data and who is responsible for the same,” he said.State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja alleged, “Since the BJP government has failed in controlling the situation it has started manipulating the data. It corroborates our stand that the government has miserably failed in protecting people of the state.”“It was a clerical error,” said Commissioner, Health Services, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai.Additional chief secretary, Health department, Mohd Suleman said, “Variations in data come after reconciliation between lab and district data. Repeat samples and rejections need to be factored in.”A health department official who didn’t want to be named said, “The state bulletin reflects the data received from the districts. Hence, there might have been variations in the data received from the districts. As far as Satna is concerned since the two persons who tested positive over there belong to Indore Satna’s name was deleted from the list later.”State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “There is a possibility of some minor changes when the entire state’s data are collected but there is no possibility of any irregularity in it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-manipulated-congress-targets-bjp-govt-over-variation-in-covid-19-numbers-in-madhya-pradesh/story-KQakkvQXK5LbxeRMTNXpNL.html

They went to Chennai on March 20 and got stranded there after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced lockdown in the country from March 25.The couple started the journey from April 15 and reached Agartala on Sunday night from where they went to their residence located at Udaipur in Gomati District, nearly 50 kilometres from Agartala. “We went to Chennai for medical check-up of my wife on March 20. But we got stranded there due to the lockdown. As the lockdown was extended for second time, we decided to return back to our place at any cost. It was quite difficult to stay at hospital and bear other charges. Also, we need to defer our daughter’s marriage that was supposed to be on May 8,” Chanchal Majumder told the reporters after reaching Agartala.Accordingly, they booked an ambulance from the hospital and they spent Rs 1.40 lakh for the travel, he told.After they landed at Udaipur, they were taken to an institutional quarantine.

21-04-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh Cabinet likely to be constituted today, expansion after Covid-19 lockdown ends||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is likely to constitute his cabinet on Tuesday afternoon, almost a month after he was sworn-in for the fourth time, said a high ranking official in the state government.A Raj Bhavan official said the ministers would take oath at 12 noon on Tuesday in a simple function in presence of certain selected BJP leaders and bureaucrats. The media would be kept at bay.“There was no talk about formation of the cabinet till night but some development took place late night and we were informed about the cabinet formation and ministers taking oath on Tuesday,” he said. A BJP leader familiar with developments said, “There may not be more than 5 to 7 ministers initially. The cabinet may be expanded later when lockdown restrictions are lifted on May 3.”Chouhan took oath as the chief minister on March 23. Since then he was facing flak from the Opposition and on social media for running his government without a cabinet and working particularly without a health minister while the Covid-19 situation continued to worsen in the state. Chouhan held discussions with the senior party leaders in Delhi in the past few days about the size of and faces in the cabinet, said the BJP leader quoted above.When Chouhan assumed office, coronavirus was rearing its head in the state with only seven cases registered in two districts. But in the span of about 29 days, the state has registered as many as 1,485 Covid-19 positive cases with 76 of them dead and as many as 26 of the total 52 districts affected.Madhya Pradesh has emerged as one of the worst-managed states in the country during the period, and Chouhan has blamed previous Congress government for the present situation in the state. Indore has emerged as one of the major Covid-19 hotspots in the country, prompting the central government to send a team on Monday to the city to assess and manage the situation.Senior Congress leader and former leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh said on April 10, “To become a one-man army chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan put in peril lives of 7.50 crore people of Madhya Pradesh. The CM is busy in his branding and publicity instead of protecting people of the state from Corona. In Madhya Pradesh situation is going from bad to worse.”Later, Congress’ Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha in a letter to the President of India urged him to impose a President’s rule in the state if Chouhan fails to constitute his cabinet.He wrote again to the President, jointly with senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Monday to reiterate his demand.State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “Like media I also hear about the cabinet formation. I can’t comment on the same. As far as Congress allegations are concerned these are politically motivated. They must understand that a chief minister delegates his powers to ministers. Hence, it can’t be said that there is no health minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-cabinet-likely-to-be-constituted-today-expansion-after-covid-19-lockdown-ends/story-AZZKHUCxzRUTNodMp259RJ.html

21-04-2020||India||Police have to be a part of Covid-19 containment strategy, says expert||As India grapples with the Covid-19 crisis, the government has categorised areas based on the spread of the disease. There are hotspots, which have been turned into containment zones, where no movement in allowed.Experts have lauded the government’s decision to announce a lockdown to contain the spread of the disease and deploy a containment strategy in hotspots. The police are very important part of that strategy, said Shamika Ravi, Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Ravi said that both in cases of maintaining the lockdown and in the scenario where it is lifted, the police are needed.“When we say calibration, basically it means that we have identified the hotspots. These hotspots require a kind of confinement and containment strategy. But beyond these hotspots, we know that there are approximately 320 districts which are untouched,” said Ravi.“Given the interdependence across districts, movement of people and goods and services, we are not going to return to 100 per cent till the entire country is free. But it will help a lot if we begin to lift the lockdown in an informed way, at least in those places which seem to be unaffected,” she said.“Then there are those areas which are in the middle - there are cases but those are not spreading. But one thing is clear, all this is law and order situation. The police have to be a part of the containment strategy,” added Ravi.Explaining it further, she said, “There are serious externalities for others around you, and for the economy. It requires a heightened sense of public responsibility. That’s where effective containment will require local administration to really mobilise all the manpower that is available.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-have-to-be-a-part-of-covid-19-containment-strategy-says-expert/story-ctgmc8yqA834UkmKmDgPAN.html

I will continue to pursue further legal remedies as advised by my lawyers. I am also disappointed with the media narrative which states that I must face trial in India for a fraud of Rs 9000 crores.Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing on Monday dismissed his appeal, upholding the Westminster Magistrates Court’s December 2018 ruling that concluded that Mallya had a prima facie case to answer in Indian courts for charges of financial offences.Mallya tweeted: “I am naturally disappointed with the High Court decision. I will continue to pursue further legal remedies as advised by my lawyers. I am also disappointed with the media narrative which states that I must face trial in India for a fraud of Rs 9000 crores”.“I must draw attention to paragraph 6 of the judgement which is available to the public. Please note that the allegations against me and others are specifically and only related to three tranches of borrowing from IDBI Bank for a total of Rs 900 crores in 2009”.“This loan was subsumed along with loans from other Banks within the Master Debt Recast Agreement of 2010. Following the DRT order for the payment of approximately Rs 5000 crores by way of Principal and Rs 1200 crores by way of unapplied interest making a total of Rs 6200 crores”.“The Banks have already recovered in cash a sum of Rs 2500 crores which is 50 percent of the Principal amount. I have repeatedly offered to pay the Banks in full but, sadly to no avail”.According to the Crown Prosecution Service representing India in UK courts, Mallya has 14 days to apply to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal against Monday’s judgement. If he does not appeal, he will be removed to India within 28 days thereafter. If he appeals, the removal will await the outcome of that application.Secondly, he could approach the European Court of Human Rights, since the UK remains under its jurisdiction until December 31 under the terms of the Brexit transition period. His team has previously alleged in court that he faced a risk to human rights if sent to India. The legal threshold for remedy on both options is high.Vijay Mallya extradition case timeline--- March 2, 2016: Arrives in London from India.--- February 21, 2017: India’s extradition request certified by Home secretary.--- April 18, 2017: Arrested and bailed.--- April 24, 2017: Indian passport revoked.--- May 2, 2017: Resigns as member of Rajya Sabha.--- June 13, 2017: Series of case management and extradition hearings in the Westminster Magistrates Court.--- December 10, 2018: Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot clears extradition and sends file to home secretary.--- February 3, 2019: Home secretary orders extradition to India.--- April 5, 2019: Judge David of the high court of England and Wales refuses permission on papers to appeal.--- July 2, 2019: In an oral hearing, Judge Leggatt and Judge Popplewell allow permission to appeal on the ground that the Arbuthnot was wrong to conclude that India had established a prima facie case against Mallya.--- May 11-13, 2019: Judge Irwin and Judge Laing hear appeal.--- April 20, 2020: Appeal refused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disappointed-vijay-mallya-to-pursue-legal-remedies-after-losing-appeal-against-extradition-to-india/story-oHa53o41YxVDBFTduJVx7I.html
21-04-2020||India||Govt considers demand by media||The Information and Broadcasting ministry has agreed to radio operators making deferred payments of their license fee and referred to the finance ministry, demands of the print media industry for a reduction of customs duty on newsprint.According to a senior government official, the demands of broadcasters and the film industry in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown enforced to combat it have also been flagged to the finance ministry. “The I&B ministry has received a series of requests and it has acted on them keeping in mind the situation. One of the demands of the radio industry has been deferment of license fee dues. Therefore, we have allowed the payments due for the months of April, May and June to be made in the next quarter,” said the official.The print media, which has seen advertising dry up has also been hit hard by disruption of circulation –– from unfounded fears of newspapers carrying the virus. It has sought relief on the 5% customs duty on the import of newsprint.“The issue has been referred to the finance ministry for its consideration since this involves financial implications. Recently, the customs duty was brought down from 10% to 5%. The demands of the broadcasting sector and the cinema industry too have been flagged to the finance ministry ,” added the official.On March 24, the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) wrote a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman emphasising that while newspapers were going above and beyond the call of duty to spread awareness in the face of the global pandemic coronavirus, they were themselves in grave danger of turning sick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-considers-demand-by-media/story-phfIDlOLFHS6TkBd5fSZjJ.html
21-04-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This is the story of seven states: Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.It is a dated story, but not too old – dated midnight Sunday, April 19, just before parts of India opened up for some business activities. At the time, these seven states accounted for 77.44% of all coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients and 81.89% of all Covid-19 deaths in the country.They were also the only states at the time with an infection count exceeding 1,000. Andhra Pradesh (647 cases on Sunday) and Telangana (858) look likely to join them, but it is safe to say that the six states named in the first instance are key to India’s ability to halt the spread of Covid-19.The only other concern is West Bengal , which is a clear straggler among large states in terms of testing (56 tests per million population based on Sunday’s data), but we will revisit the state when there’s better data coming out of it.Here’s a quick snapshot on how the seven states compare on key parameters.Madhya Pradesh’s number of cases for the preceding 24 hours is low because the state put out only one bulletin, in the middle of the day on Sunday.With the caveat that the timeline of infections in each of the seven states is different – many of the infections in Gujarat, for instance, are recent; most of those in Tamil Nadu relate to people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat’s March congregation in Delhi, and promptly reported to the local health department when a call went out – there are some clear trends.With the exception of Uttar Pradesh, which is a laggard, and Madhya Pradesh, which is on the border, the other five states all test more than the national average (309 tests per million). A previous time series analysis by Hindustan Times showed that in general, across states, the number of cases increased with the number of tests (although the proportion of those testing positive didn’t necessarily increase, and actually decreased in most). As states test more, that article reasoned, they are likely to find more people infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 (including many asymptomatic ones).Even the most aggressive testers among these states have clearly not reached a level where the discovery rate is consistently falling. For instance, Maharashtra conducted 4,555 tests on Sunday. It also discovered 552 new cases on Sunday. The two aren’t related because the tests for the 552 found infected on Sunday were likely carried out on Saturday or Friday, but clearly the discovery rate isn’t dipping. It seemed to be in Tamil Nadu, where only 49 cases were discovered on Saturday and 56 on Friday, but 105 were on Sunday (a day when 5,744 tests were conducted in the state). As these and other states expand their testing this week, this will be the number to track: daily infections per tests conducted.The other number to keep track of is the death rate (Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan are doing a good job of keeping it below the national average of 3.2%). Tamil Nadu’s performance isn’t a surprise (the other two are) because the state has always had a good health care system. It also leads in terms of recoveries – 27.8% compared to the national average of 16.52%. This too is a good number to track – as on Sunday, 2,852 people of the 17,252 infected had recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-6SNav4G28FxZrAeRxzcmiN.html
21-04-2020||India||Years after going down to Bollywood heroes, former screen villain Dan Dhanoa defeats Covid-19 in Brazil||While being on a ship anchored thousands of miles away from home with no countrymen around for company, getting infected by the coronavirus can only come as a catastrophe for any sailor. Not so for Bollywood villain-turned sea captain, Dan Dhanoa. The 61-year old, who shared the screen with Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna, Dharmendra and a galaxy of stars in about 100 movies in the 1980s and 90s, was struck by Covid-19 on board his oil and gas exploration ship, moored more than 150 nautical miles (477 km) off Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro, and more than 14,000 km away from his home and family in Chandigarh. But unlike the bad guys he played in Mard, Shahenshah, Tridev, Karma, or, the prophetically titled Jaan ki Baazi (Gamble of Life) who went down to the ‘heroes’, Dhanoa was not going to let the deadly virus defeat him. “Sure, I was worried that I’m in a foreign country and don’t speak Portuguese, the local language,” Dhanoa told HT on a video call from a hotel room in Rio, where he is recuperating in quarantine after spending 17 days in hospital. “But I’m a mariner. And having steered giant oil tankers for years, I’m trained to look ahead.”The Doon School alumnus said that he had been on the ship for 16 days before catching the infection. “I suspect it was some service vendor, possibly an asymptomatic carrier, who brought the virus on board. I am told that 18-20 people tested positive, after I was hospitalized,” said Dhanoa.He broke the news only to his wife, actor and acclaimed Kathak dancer, Nandita Puri, and asked her not to tell anyone. “My mother is 94 and all my relatives are old. I did not want panic back home. Nandita stood by me like the Rock of Gibraltar,” said Dhanoa.The sailor said that his phone and laptop were taken away, when he was in the ICU. Since he had to go offline, he asked his wife to tell people on his social media pages that there was a glitch in Internet connectivity on board the ship.“After getting discharged on April 17, I finally made a series of video calls to my mother and the family, and told them what happened,” said Dhanoa, whose chiseled features helped him bag many modelling offers in the 80s.“I have to wait for international flights to resume operation and the lockdown to be lifted in India. I am dying to spend time with my family and my dogs. I enjoy my lovely tropical garden and the birds that nest there. I want to see my collection of art and antiques,” he said, naming vintage marine artefacts and artworks by members of the Tagore family, Jamini Roy, Ganesh Pyne and other famous names, among his collection. Dhanoa noted that the symptoms of the infection were strange. “I had a running nose just for a day, and the next day I started getting a headache and fever. Initially, only my forehead would ache. I thought my sinuses were playing up, but the pain started shifting all over my head. It was like a cluster headache with pin pricks that would make me twitch.”“No cough nor shortness of breath, but my appetite died and I started feeling weak. Also, there was stiffness in my chest and lower back. That’s when I asked to be evacuated ashore on a chopper,” said Dhanoa. “I had fever and felt pin-pricks in my head. It’s important for people to be aware of the many different symptoms of the disease, go for tests and isolate themselves,” he added.“At the hospital, the swab test results arrived after four days. They found that my breathing was affected. A CT scan showed fibrosis in around 10-15 per cent of my lungs. I was rushed to the ICU for a week, before being shifted to a normal quarantine ward. Now, I have to remain in this hotel for two weeks, to get my strength back,” said the veteran sailor.Staying in touch with his wife posed a huge problem for Dhanoa during his time in the ICU. But he found a way out. He would give the nurses his wife’s WhatsApp number, using the few Portuguese words he knew to communicate with them. “I would write notes in English on pieces of paper, the nurses would photograph the notes and send them to Nandita, who would reply and keep up my spirits,” said Dhanoa, adding that the hospital staff took good care of him.“I have always been physically fit. Even at this age, I have normal blood pressure. However, in 2017, I had a combined attack of dengue and chikungunya, a few days after I returned home from Brazil. There was haemorrhage in my blood vessels. I lost my hair - which has grown back now - and my eyesight deteriorated. Still, I somehow pulled through,” said Dhanoa.The former screen villain believes that Indians have stronger immune systems because they live on basic home-cooked, mostly vegetarian food and avoid junk food. “Indians will do better in this crisis,” Dhanoa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/years-after-going-down-to-bollywood-heroes-former-screen-villain-dan-dhanoa-defeats-covid-19-in-brazil/story-aWVyCKWl3yKDznf3hA2B0J.html
21-04-2020||India||‘Few tested positive’: Tablighi chief’s comeback on Jamaat spreading Covid-19||The chief the Tablighi Jamaat, Maulana Saad, tells Hindustan Times in an interview through his lawyer that he is willing to cooperate with the police, and that no illegal activity took place at the Markaz building, which is the biggest Covid-19 hot spot in India. Edited excerpts:Is it true that you organised Ijtema without permission?Do not confuse Ijtema with normal day-to-day activities and religious programmes held in Markaz Nizamuddin. Ijtema is generally a large congregation which is held in open public spaces for which proper permissions are taken from the concerned authorities. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Markaz Nizamuddin is basically a masjid namely Bangle Wali Masjid, where normal religious sermons are given on a daily basis throughout the year. Being a masjid, I don’t think there is any requirement to seek permission to give sermons or to have other religious discourses within the building.Is it true that you’re not supporting the police investigation?This is completely misplaced. We have always maintained that it is necessary to cooperate in every manner with the authorities; this has been our history of a hundred years. It is out of question that there would be no support to the investigating authorities. So far whatever notices we have received from Delhi Police have been duly replied to.Why are you silent about the accusations against you?As advised by doctors, I was in self-quarantine, with the police aware of the fact and my whereabouts. We are not experts of social media or the optics of building a narrative, so it may not have reached all, but I immediately addressed Tabligh members, wherever they are, to come forward and cooperate with authorities in the measures they are taking to eliminate the Covid risk, whether it’s quarantine, isolation, or testing.Also read: ED slaps money laundering case against Tablighi Jamaat chiefAlso Watch | ‘Not absconding’: Tablighi Jamaat chief’s lawyer on ED money laundering case What about the alleged unaccounted foreign funding to the Jamaat? ED has registered a case against you in this regard.This is completely baseless and false. We take pride in the fact that no illegal activity has ever happened at Markaz and we shall always keep it that way. We are yet to receive any notice in this regard; all such accusations exist only in the media. I am sure that I will be able to give a satisfactory explanation for any such accusation, but for that, I should first be aware of what is the allegation, if any.Some foreign jamaatis are charged of violation of visa regulations because they travelled on tourist visas. Why did the Markaz allow it to happen?People have been coming to our country in this manner for decades with the same set of permissions, and the authorities have never pointed this out as an issue. We always report the presence of foreigners in Markaz Nizamuddin to police authorities; this has been the practice for decades. In my limited understanding, I fail to see how it would amount to a violation of the visa rule. Markaz neither invites any foreigner nor does it sponsor any visa for foreigners. Is the Markaz responsible for the spread of the disease in India?It’s unfortunate that a few members have tested Covid positive, but an overwhelming majority of TJ members have tested negative too; does that make Markaz “responsible for the disease”? You must also constantly ask this question to yourself -- when was the first Covid case reported in India; and what actions were taken? How many other places saw much larger gatherings during late February and all throughout March, and can they be held responsible for disease?Also read: 2 relatives of Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad test positive for Covid-19You knew about Covid; why did you not cancel the event?There was a pre-scheduled event in March for which participants had started arriving from far-off places. Till late February, and even middle March, everything was going on as normal. As soon as the janta curfew took place, we discontinued the programme and evacuated the participants.Several Muslim leaders are demanding a ban on the Jamaat.I don’t know about any such demand. I would like to say that I’ve been informed that in some cases, where patients who had tested positive for Covid-19, and have since recovered, their plasma can be used for treatment. I urge my friends from TJ who have been successfully treated to donate their plasma to patients of any caste or religion who are still fighting this disease.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/few-tested-positive-does-that-make-us-responsible-for-covid-tablighi-jamaat-chief/story-CIaa8TeQthaJ0x3qR6DLoM.html

Travelling over 500 km the group of 27 reached the sea beach at Donkuru village close to the Odisha-Andhra border.Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrita Kulange said the 27-member team of migrant labourers including 10 from Odisha had gone to Chennai to work in local factories there a few months ago. “After the lockdown was announced and their factories shut down, these labourers tried hard to go back to their homes. But in the absence of any transportation, they were stranded. After a few days they started to run out of their savings. They decided to pool in money so as to buy a fishing boat for Rs 2 lakh in which they decided to escape,” said Kulange.Though the initial plan was to anchor at Pati Sonapur beach, 10 km from Berhampur town of Ganjam district, they decided to anchor near the beach at Donkuru as a majority of the labourers were from Andhra Pradesh. Soon after they anchored close to the Donkuru village they were taken to a quarantine centre in Rajampuram and Sompeta in Srikakulam.The Srikakulam police said cases have been lodged against the 27 for defying lockdown. “These men will be tested for the coronavirus at the end of the 14 day quarantine period,” said circle inspector Vinod Babu of Srikakulam.Officials said as the migrant labourers were from the fishermen community, they had no trouble at sea. “They had rice and other grocery items in the twin engine fishing boat. As they had mobile phones with them, navigation was not an issue,” said an official of Srikakulam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-reach-home-amid-lockdown-27-migrants-from-odisha-andhra-escape-in-a-boat/story-uoLeZi6XF0oF1CBpDOMFbO.html

The family lost a 44-year-old woman member on March 30.Although no new case has been reported in the district that shares its borders with Bhutan, Sikkim and Darjeeling, Kalimpong ‘s residents, especially those who are old and unwell, are facing discrimination.Ghatani, a resident of Mungpoo in Darjeeling district, fell ill on Saturday and her family members took her to Rambi community block primary health centre the next day. The doctor referred her to Kalimpong district hospital but the health centre allegedly denied an ambulance. After much persuasion an ambulance took the patient up to Chitray, located 14 km away from Kalimpong. The patient was then taken to a Kalimpong hospital in a car provided by a social worker, Jyoti Karki. The old woman was admitted at 1 pm and she died at 8 pm on Sunday.Bimal Ghatani, one of the sons of the deceased, said “Had we been able to admit her in Kalimpong hospital on time she might have survived. Precious hours were lost in search of an ambulance.”Bimal, who is a carpenter, said “At Mungpoo, local people made it clear that those who took my mother to Kalimpong cannot return home. They have been told to stay in quarantine for 14 days.”Dr C K Chettri, block medical officer of Rambi said “The family of Ghatani never sought the government ambulance.”Jyoti Karki said, “People of Kalimpong are facing social discrimination in other areas.”Last week, eight-year-old Dishan Khati, a resident of Tirpai in Kalimpong had fever, cough and signs of pneumonia. On April 15, a doctor in Kalimpong referred him to a private nursing home in Siliguri saying that all arrangements had been made and the nursing home was one of those authorized to treat Covid-19 patients.Yasaka Khati, the child’s father who is a driver, said, “Though the government is saying that ambulance in cases like these will be provided free I was forced to take my son to Siliguri in my vehicle as the driver of a government ambulance demanded Rs 1500.”“That was not all. The nursing home authorities refused to admit my son and even policemen did not help. We took my son to the state-run North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH). There, we had to wait for long hours before my son got admission. But we were not happy with the arrangements,” Khati said.“On April 16, we took my son back to Kalimpong hospital. The boy is doing fine now,” said Khati. On April 15, Sujata Sherpa, a pregnant woman from the Algarah area in Kalimpong was referred to a Siliguri hospital by the Kalimpong district hospital for an USG test. Sujata and her husband, Sangey Sherpa, went to Siliguri district hospital. “The moment hospital staff came to know that we were from Kalimpong, they started behaving differently and told us to go to NBMCH at night. At NBMCH, the staff refused to get my wife admitted as she was bleeding. We were asked to return the next day. We were so helpless that we had to spend the night of April 15 in a church in Siliguri,” said Sherpa.The USG was done the next day and the couple returned home with help from social workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kalimpong-triggers-covid-19-fears-in-north-bengal-hills-after-one-family-tested-positive/story-4dL7M6sevlFcLmtuOs8zbJ.html
21-04-2020||India||How a Chhattisgarh minister’s tweet could save Andhra govt millions of rupees||A tweet by the Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo declaring that his state had purchased 75,000 rapid testing kits from a South Korean firm has sparked off a huge row in Andhra Pradesh after it turned out that the state government had paid twice as much for the testing kits than its neighour. Furious, the Andhra Pradesh government which had placed the order on April 7, has told the company to match Chhattisgarh’s price.If Andhra does get the same price, it could end up saving Rs 78 million.Andhra Pradesh had placed an order with the supplier, SD Biosensors Pvt Ltd, Korea, for two lakh rapid test kits. According to this deal, the government would pay Rs 730 per kit excluding GST. For 2 lakh kits, it comes to about Rs 146 million.When the first consignment of one lakh kits reached the state government via a special Air India flight on Friday, there were photo-ops at Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s camp office. He received the first testing kit, and even had himself tested. One lakh #Covid19 rapid test kits imported from South Korea in a special flight, were launched by Hon'ble Chief Minister @ysjagan at the camp office in Tadepalli, today. These test kits give results within 10 minutes & are expected to ramp-up testing in Andhra Pradesh.#Covid_19 pic.twitter.com/4LplO3de2k“These test kits give results within 10 minutes and are expected to ramp-up testing in Andhra Pradesh,” the chief minister’s office tweeted soon after along with a couple of photographs.The uproar in Andhra Pradesh came the next day when Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo tweeted that his government was procuring 75,000 high quality rapid testing kits at Rs 337 excluding GST.“The rate we have been able to close at is the lowest in India,” he said. The minister credited the South Korean Ambassador in India Shin Bong-Kil, the Indian Ambassador in Seoul Sripriya Ranganathan and the central government for help in closing the deal. We are procuring 75,000 high quality rapid testing kits at a benchmark price of ₹337 + GST from a South Korean company based in India, which has proven to be the lowest bidder. The rate we have been able to close at is the lowest in India. (1/2)Andhra Pradesh’s opposition Telugu Desam Party quickly rushed to allege a scram.“How could we pay Rs 730 for the same test kit which the Chhattisgarh government had bought for Rs 337? Can you please explain, whether it is called commission or third-party payment or J-tax (Jagan tax)?” asked senior TDP legislator Gorantla Buchaiah Chowdary.Andhra Pradesh Medical Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd managing director V Vijaya Rama Raju promptly served notice on th South Korean company’s local dealer Sandor Medicaids for the huge price difference.In his notice, the state-run firm underscored the contract conditions that empowered the government to recover the price differential “if any instance comes to the notice of the government that the above medical items are supplied at a lower price than price quoted now”.“As such it is informed that, the payment will be made as per the Chhattisgarh Medical Services Corporation Limited rate of Rs.337 per each kit excluding GST for the supplies made to the Government of Andhra Pradesh,” the notice said.Deputy chief minister and health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas insisted that the state had been transparent about the entire deal. “The purchase was made from the lowest bidder and the entire transaction was done according to the guidelines framed by the Centre, he said.Health commissioner K Bhaskar suggested that it was possible that the price difference could be linked to the fact that Andhra imported the rapid test kits directly from South Korea, while Chhattisgarh bought them from the local franchise of the South Korean company“When we had placed an order, the Korean company’s Indian unit did not have the permission from ICMR to supply rapid test kits,” he said, adding that in the coming days, the price of rapid test kits could come down to even Rs 50 per kit.Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy reviewed the action taken at a meeting on Monday and complimented officials for moving swiftly to save public funds, a state government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-minister-s-tweet-sets-up-row-in-andhra-pradesh-but-might-save-millions/story-34ZF76uAInwskfkDjGiDxM.html

The villagers alleged that a local resident sustained a bullet injury but the authorities said police did not open fire. Local people said that 60-year-old Haidar Ali, a resident of Tin Chula tea estate in Kalchini community block, was admitted at the Aayush Hospital at Tapsikhatta in Alipurduar 1 community block. The hospital has been earmarked for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The hospital authorities, however, did not comment on the incident.“Ali was admitted on Sunday morning and he died at night. Though his swab sample was sent for a test the report did not arrive till Monday night,” said a police official who did not wish to be identified.“Four people, including members of the dead man’s family, have been quarantined as a precautionary measure,” he added. When police took the body for burial to Salkumar Haat near the bank of Torsa River, local people gathered at the spot and protested. They attacked the men in uniform and ransacked many police vehicles. Two vehicles were also set on fire.Amitava Maiti, Superintendent of Police, Alipurduar district, said, “We have filed cases against some local people. One police officer has been shifted to a private hospital in Siliguri. His condition is stable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cops-injured-in-clash-with-villagers-over-burial-of-covid-19-victim/story-GolSZxtGx9lXYsOHnKP7pO.html
21-04-2020||India||Covid-19:Contenders to get funding for corona vaccine, therapy efforts||The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (Birac) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) announced on Monday that they have selected 16 projects -- spanning vaccines, drugs and technologies -- for funding under the Covid-19 research consortium.The selected projects will get funding support on a case-by-case basis and assistance in navigating the regulatory environment.  Among the research projects selected are those involving the development of two novel vaccines by two of India’s leading vaccine and pharmaceutical manufacturers – Cadila Healthcare and Bharat Biotech. Both are in the preclinical stage.Internationally, at least three vaccine candidates have entered human trials and 67 others are in preclinical stages.The vaccine by Cadila that has been selected by Birac uses recombinant DNA technology. The company has also been working on another vaccine candidate that uses reverse genetic technology to create a virus with weakened potency but similar to the Sars-Cov-2 strain to produce an immune response.The other vaccine candidate selected for funding has been developed by Bharat Biotech; it uses an inactivated rabies virus as the vector or transport of a genetic sequence of Sars-Cov-2 so as to produce an immune response. Bharat Biotech has also been working on another vaccine that uses the nasal flu vaccine backbone to deliver genetic material of the virus to produce immune response.Apart from the novel vaccines against Covid-19, Birac will also support the efforts of Serum Institute of India to conduct phase III trials in humans of a vaccine originally intended for tuberculosis, developed by the Berlin-based Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology.“The consortium will provide financial support to the projects, but apart from that we will also support them in any way they want, be it jumping through regulatory hoops, helping in sourcing raw materials and imports, or connecting them to others in the industry,” Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of the department of biotechnology and chairperson of Birac, said on Monday. Apart from supporting the vaccine candidates, Birac has also brought in the National Institute of Immunology to develop a framework for evaluating the vaccines.“All vaccine candidates that are being developed need to be evaluated in the pre-clinical stages and the NII will help in understanding the need of the manufacturers and developing various models for the same,” said Dr Swarup. DBT is the nodal department for all Covid-19 vaccine development effort in the PM’s task force.Another project selected is that of the Hyderabad-based OncoSeek Bio Pvt Ltd, which will develop a lung organoid model in the lab to test drugs, therapeutics, and vaccines.“We create cell culture models of various diseases -- we call it creating a disease in the dish. For the Covid-19 project we will use lung cells that can be infected and then used to study the drugs and vaccines. This can replace animal models for preclinical testing,” said Suresh Poosala, founder and CEO of the company.Among therapies, the consortium has selected Virchow Biotech Pvt Ltd for commercial scale production of purified immunoglobulin or virus-fighting antibodies from people who have recovered from Covid-19.The consortium has also selected seven rapid and RT-PCR based diagnostic tests. The manufacturing of these will be supported at Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ), which will also help in scaling up ventilator technologies.“The DBT-BIRAC research consortium is an excellent way to bring together researchers and industry towards priority research and biotechnological solutions,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and one of the members of the science and tech group set up by the principal scientific adviser (PSA) .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-contenders-shortlisted-for-india-s-corona-vaccine-effort/story-y0CIeRlHqWcD4j4qBw7QZN.html
21-04-2020||India||India has 11 million coronavirus warriors: Govt database||India has at least 3 million medical professionals and roughly 8 million others who can be drafted for disease containment work such as contact tracing, according to the Union government’s stocktaking of human resources that can be deployed if the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak grows.The exercise comes amid worries that a runaway epidemic could overwhelm India’s health care system, much like it has in the United States and parts of Europe, prompting experts and authorities to consider an all-hands-on-deck scenario. India has one doctors for every 1,457 of its population, which is lower than 1:1,000 ratio recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The US has an average of 2.54 doctors for every 1,000 of its population. The resources in addition to the health staff will be deployed for tasks such as supervising quarantine facilities, surveillance of contacts, and to help authorities implement lockdown measures. “We don’t just need doctors, but also non-medical professionals who can be quickly trained to manage other aspects of the Covid-19 situation. There is need for manpower to manage the lockdown effectively, and now that there is relaxation of curbs, local authorities will require people to maintain social distancing in banks, ration shops, check on people whether they are observing infection control practices publicly, etc,” said Arun Panda, secretary, ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), who heads the special group of bureaucrats responsible for augmenting human resources and capacities. “The civic bodies will also need people to manage movement of people and other things. This is an attempt to have everything at the click of a mouse for the convenience of everyone,” Panda added. A dashboard, available on covidwarriors.gov.in, accounts for doctors and nurses as well as dentists, auxiliary health staff, Ayush practitioners, Asha and Anganwadi workers and those that belong to the uniformed youth groups such as NSS and NCC.For the exercise, the government collaborated with several ministries, councils, NGOs and civil society groups to gather details. “The idea behind a dashboard was for people to quickly figure out where the need was to deploy people, and which was the nearest place where manpower was in excess that could be transported to the other place where it was required more. You can see it all in real time,” said Panda.The data on the website lists resources by state.For quick training of these personnel, the MSME ministry has also come up with about 105 training modules that can be readily accessed at anytime.“There are web modules created to teach, for example, bio-medical waste management, how to dispose personal protection equipment, infection control and hygiene practices, etc. These have been created in a quick, easy-to-learn format,” the secretary said. “We have gone as granular as we could be and it is a work in progress because it will be updated on a regular basis and can be utilised even after the outbreak has subsided. These are people who are willing to work, and can be utilised later on as well,” he added.Experts in the field say it helps to have an exact knowledge of manpower at hand in an outbreak situation so that the workforce can be accordingly deployed.“Doctors, nurses and paramedics are one part of it but the other, and more important, part is to ensure preventive measures are put in place effectively so that cases do not go up. At such places we need volunteers, who can go to villages and towns to help local administrations in ensuring people strictly follow the government directive. There is a large number of people who would want to work, and to have an exact idea about them is great,” said Dr KK Talwar, former head of PGI Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-11mn-covid-warriors-govt-database/story-WQtuZXgnCEVDZcQdKYC7qO.html
21-04-2020||India||Don’t dilute curbs: Centre to states||The Centre has termed the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation “especially serious” in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other areas while forming six ground teams to assess the situation and issue directions, even as it warned all states against diluting national lockdown rules, weakening India’s response to the crisis, and compromising the country’s public health. Some states conditionally lifted select restrictions of the lockdown – in place till May 3 – after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last week that curbs could be relaxed in places outside “containment zones” and potential hot spots to revive economic activity.On Sunday evening, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla asked all chief secretaries to strictly follow the lockdown guidelines. He separately wrote to the Kerala chief secretary against watering down the restrictions after the state allowed opening of restaurants and bus travel in cities, and small industries in urban areas. Kerala was preparing to issue an order to roll back the decision, an official said on condition of anonymity.The Centre’s warning to Kerala and all other states and Union Territories (UTs) came amid specific communications to Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to red-flag violations and issue specific instructions on controlling the outbreak.The Union home ministry told the four states that incidents of violence against health workers, complete violation of social distancing norms outside banks, public distribution system (PDS) outlets and markets, and the movement of private and commercial vehicles with passengers in urban areas have been reported.“After analysing the prevalence of such violations in major hot spot districts, it is clear to the central government that the situation is especially serious in the above mentioned areas and expertise of the Centre needs to be used,” a statement released by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) said on Monday.These violations pose a serious health hazard, both for the population of these districts and others in the country, the home ministry said. It also pointed to the Supreme Court’s March 31 observation that states are expected to faithfully comply with the directives and orders of the Centre in letter and spirit.After analysing the prevalence of such violations in major hot spot districts, it is clear to the central government that the situation is “especially serious” in Mumbai and Pune (Maharashtra), Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Kolkata, Howrah, East Medinipur, North 24 Parganas, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri (West Bengal), the home ministry said.The Centre said six inter-ministerial central teams (IMCTs) will visit the identified areas in the four states within the next three days to make spot assessments and recommend remedial measures in a report to the central government.While Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot did not comment on the IMCT visit, he tweeted on Monday to urge people in the state not to violate lockdown rules.Commenting on the central teams visiting Madhya Pradesh, additional chief secretary, health, Mohd Suleman said: “The team is meeting officials. I am yet to speak to them.” There was no immediate response from Maharashtra officials on the Centre’s plan.The IMCTs will assess the compliance with and implementation of lockdown measures, supply of essential items, preparedness of the health infrastructure and hospital facilities, safety of medical professional and the conditions of migrant workers housed in relief camps.They will also assess the movement of people outside their homes, maintenance of social distancing measures and the availability of test kits and personal protective equipment in these areas, plus a few others in West Bengal, and submit a report to the Centre, according to the statement.While two IMCTs each have been formed to assess the ground situation in West Bengal and Maharashtra, one team each will travel to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Orders have been issued to the chief secretaries of the four states on the exercise.The five-member teams comprise officials from the ministries of health and consumer affairs and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 590 and the number of cases climbed to 18,500 in the country on Monday, according to data compiled from states.There are 4,666 confirmed coronavirus cases in Maharashtra of which 232 people have lost their lives. Mumbai has 3,032 cases.In Madhya Pradesh, out of the 1,485 cases, 74 people have succumbed to the disease. There were 82 containment zones in the city on April 10, which have since gone up to 167. Indore has the highest such zones in the state. Indore, with 897 patients, has reported the sharpest spike in the number of cases over the past few days.Rajasthan has so far reported 1,535 cases of which 25 people have died. In West Bengal, there have been 339 confirmed cases and 12 people have died due to the infection. However, the state of 91.2 million people has tested only 5,469. After the home ministry’s communication, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked the Centre to give valid reasons for the deployment IMCTs. “We welcome all constructive support and suggestions, especially from the Central government in negating the COVID-19 crisis. However, the basis on which the Centre is proposing to deploy IMCTs in select districts across India including a few in WB under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is unclear,” she tweeted.“I urge both Honb’le Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji and Home Minister Amit Shah Ji to share the criterion used for this. Until then I am afraid, we would not be able to move ahead on this as without valid reasons this might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism,” the CM added.The orders, signed by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla in his capacity as the chairperson of the National Executive Committee under the Disaster Management Act, also said that the ministry of civil aviation will provide to the IMCTs air transportation from New Delhi as their deployment is for an essential purpose.The state governments will have to provide logistical support to the IMCTs; equip them with PPEs; and extend all cooperation for their visits to local areas, including providing documents and records as requested.Separately, the Centre warned the Kerala government over its decision to allow opening of restaurants, bus travel in cities and opening of MSME industries in urban areas, saying it amounted to dilution of lockdown guidelines and also the Supreme Court observation.The Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left government in Kerala said there was some “misunderstanding” due to which the Centre had objected to dilution of the lockdown protocol for controlling Covid-19.In a communication to chief secretaries of state governments and Union territory administrations, Bhalla said some states and UTs were issuing orders allowing activities that were not allowed as per the guidelines issued by the home ministry under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.States and UTs can take stricter action than what is mentioned in the guidelines but cannot dilute or weaken them, the ministry said on Monday.Home ministry joint secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said the home secretary wrote afresh to the states as some of them were issuing certain guidelines that amounted to “diluting” the lockdown leading to “severe repercussions to health” of the citizens.“MHA is regularly monitoring the lockdown situation in the country. Wherever lockdown is being violated we (MHA) are taking adequate action in coordination with state governments,” she said at a daily briefing.Writing this letter became important, she said, as in some states facilities were being allowed which were not permitted under the MHA guidelines.On Monday, senior officials of the central and state governments went back to work as public offices reopened nearly a month after restrictions were enforced. In its revised guidelines, the home ministry had mandated that deputy secretaries and above ranks of the Union government were to rejoin offices while up to 33% of junior officers could be called in according to a department/ministry’s requirement.

21-04-2020||India||Hot March a bit colder in India||Last month was the second hottest March since 2016 globally but India was among a few countries to record below-average temperatures. The average global land and ocean surface temperature for March was 1.16 degrees C above the 20th-century average, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in a statement on April 13. NOAA is a US commerce department agency that focuses on the conditions of the oceans, major waterways, and the atmosphere.The 10 warmest months of March have been since 1990. March 2020 was also the 44th consecutive March and the 423rd consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th-century average, according to NOAA.India in March recorded a mean temperature of 24.92 degrees C, -.29 below normal. The maximum average temperature was 31.083 degree C (-0.769 degree C below normal). The average minimum temperature of 18.75 degrees C was 0.2 degree C below normal, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).NOAA’s temperature anomaly map shows India recorded below-average temperatures in March (1 to 2 degrees C below normal) along with parts of Africa and North America. India also recorded below-normal temperatures from January to March while parts of Europe, Russia, Central Asia experienced record heat in March.“This is mainly because of a high number of western disturbances (WDs)and rains in March which led to cooler temperatures,” said IMD’s director general M Mohapatra.In April, back-to-back WDs have led to higher than normal rains in many parts of India and prevented the rise in maximum temperatures. Between March 1 and April 20, northwestern and central India recorded 46% and 137% excess rains. There were six WDs in March and four so far in April against a normal of two to three. At least two more WDs are expected on April 23 and 27. WDs are storms that originate over the Mediterranean region and bring rain.Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll said while global temperatures were at a record high during the first quarter of 2020, temperatures in India were generally cooler than average, except in the southern peninsula. “IMD-IITM forecasts indicate that this may continue until the end of April. Beyond that, global agencies indicate normal average temperatures during May-July. This may be due to conditions in the Pacific as there is no coherent sign of an El Niño developing during early summer. El Niño, if present, can trigger heatwaves over the Indian subcontinent,” said Koll. El Nino is a weather phenomenon characterised by warm ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that is sometimes associated with drought in the subcontinent.Heatwaves have so far been recorded only in parts of central Maharashtra and Vidarbha in April. But this is likely to change in May. “Our climate models are indicating that May and June will have above-normal temperatures and heatwave conditions. They may not be the hottest on record but would definitely be above average,” said Union earth sciences ministry secretary M Rajeevan.Mohapatra said they had forecast above-average temperatures for March-April and May, which did not happen. “March and April both have been cooler but from the models, it seems like temperatures will rise moderately in May pulling up the average temperature for the season,” said Mohapatra.The April-May-June season is likely to be warmer than normal in most parts of the country, according to IMD’s seasonal outlook released on March 30. The IMD had forecast the same for March-April- May but the forecast has not been accurate so far.The frequency of heatwaves is also likely to be slightly above normal during the season, according to the outlook. Regions likely to have average maximum temperatures of 0.5 to 1 degree C above normal include eastern and western Rajasthan, western Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Konkan and Goa, central Maharashtra, Marathawada, north and south interior Karnataka, coastal Karnataka, Rayalaseema, and Kerala. This would mean a rise in heat-related health complications and deaths. Gandhinagar’s Indian Institute of Public Health director Dilip Mavlankar said above-normal heatwave could mean extremely difficult conditions for people living in small houses in the Covid-19 containment zones. “We have to monitor those in slums in very small units especially if their movement is restricted. Additional water should be diverted by municipalities to these areas to deal with the heat and for hand washing. In the West, water is rationed from swimming pools or gardens to deal with heat episodes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-hottest-march-a-bit-colder-in-india/story-KgoWf4z0yWskKtbcknvmeL.html
21-04-2020||India||Country consuming 13% more data during lockdown: Reports||India’s internet consumption rose by around 13% since three days before the nationwide lockdown was put in place to check the spread of Covid-19, according to telecom ministry data that showed Indians consumed an average of 308 petabytes (PB) of data daily for the week beginning March 22. According to the department of telecom, which collated reports from service providers, the daily average consumption in this period was 9% higher than 282PB data used on March 21 (the day the janta curfew was announced) and 13% more than the daily average of 270 PB seen in the previous week. The change reflected how people consumed more streaming content and logged on to work from home, which was also captured in how data demand from residences rose as compared to commercial areas.The consumption, Department of Telecommunications (DoT) figures show, peaked on two days -- March 22 and March 27 -- when 312 PB of data was used. On March 26, 311 PB of data was consumed. The lockdown, announced on March 24, began on March 25. On March 22, India observed a voluntary, one-day curfew.Since the first week, however, consumption has now stabilised around the 300PB mark.The data in one PB is equivalent to 500 billion pages of standard printed text.Andhra Pradesh and Bihar saw some of the steepest increases, by 12% in both states. In Maharashtra, where data consumption was highest among all states under the lockdown period, the increase was 7%. The government said that the increase was within its capacity. “We have the capacity to handle a spike of 20% without any duress. We optimised the fibre optics network and have not yet reported a breakdown,” said a DoT official, asking not to be named. The consumption, the official added, rose lower than it would have since many streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix decided to downgrade video quality. Rajan Mathews of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said around the third week of March, operators recorded a 30% jump in traffic with most of it from people streaming videos. The decision by media companies to disable high-quality video and optimise bandwidth usage helped networks meet the increased demand, Mathews said, adding that the operators also pressed into service unused cell towers. “With the consumption moving to residential places, the challenge was that these areas resist installation of cell towers. We worked with the government to ensure that of 800 unused cell towers in metro cities, 730 were made functional,” said Mathews. A third factor that helped, according to Mathews, was operators being allowed to carry out maintenance work. “Complaints of cuts in fibre optic cables were about 100 a day on an average, this fell down to 6-7 a day,” he said. Rajesh Chharia of the Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) said that while the strain has not increased, internet service providers should be allowed to share infrastructure. He said that it’s a long-term demand, which is awaiting the Centre’s nod. “If the infrastructure of a provider is full, they may be allowed to overload it with the infrastructure of another to spread the network. This will ensure uninterrupted services,” said Chharia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/country-consuming-13-more-data-during-lockdown-reports/story-gNndbeigunb7HOQw7nEceL.html
21-04-2020||India||Covid-19 not the last pandemic, world has to build resilience||Covid-19 is not the first, nor will it be the last , of high-impact, rapidly spreading pandemics to cause disruption and death on a large scale, upend economies, and roil society. Pandemics are emerging with higher frequency and becoming increasingly difficult to contain because of a convergence of several global ecological, political, economic and social trends, including population growth, urbanisation, economic integration, faster travel, migration and climate change, experts say.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has already infected 2.4 million people and killed at least 165,000, is the second most devastating pandemic after the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed an estimated 50 million people in 11 months between 1918 and 1919. The Spanish flu also hit India hard, with the country recording its only dip in the decadal population growth rate between 1911 and 1921, when the population fell by 0.31%. This was the only decade since 1901 to date when the country’s population did not increase, according to Census of India data.“Epidemic-prone diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Ebola, Zika, plague, yellow fever and others, are harbingers of a new era of high-impact, potentially fast-spreading outbreaks that are more frequently detected and increasingly difficult to manage,” said The World At Risk 2019 report by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB). The report was authored by 15 global scientists and public health leaders, including India’s principal scientific advisor, Dr K VijayRaghavan.The World Health Organization (WHO) tracked 1,483 epidemics in 172 countries between 2011 and 2018 and in 2019, warned that another H1N1 2009-10 influenza-like pandemic was inevitable. But instead of an influenza, what is causing havoc is a novel coronavirus, severe forms of which have had limited human-to-human transmission in the past.The novelty of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Civid-19, and the secrecy China has maintained around it have fuelled persisting rumours about the virus being a bio-weapon that accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan city, where the outbreak started. Scientists, however, have used genetic material of Sars-Cov2 to establish its natural origin. “Our analyses clearly show that Sars-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,” according to an analysis published in the journal Nature Medicine on March 17. Sars-CoV-2 is very closely related to Sars-CoV, but the overall genetic structure is distinct from the known coronaviruses and most closely resembles viruses found in bats and pangolins that had not been known to cause humans any harm. “If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness in human,” said the Nature Medicine study, dismissing conspiracy theories about the lab origin of the virus.So, what makes Sars-CoV-2 different? A study of the genetic template revealed that the spike (S) proteins that cover the virus and give it its characteristic crown-like appearance, have evolved to target a receptor on the outside of human cells called ACE2, which is a key regulator of blood pressure and immunity, among others, and is found on the outer surface of cells in human lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.What makes Sars-CoV-2 lethal is the ease with which it spreads and the severity of disease caused by it. There are seven coronaviruses that infect humans, of which Sars-Cov, Mers-CoV and Sars-CoV-2 can cause severe disease; the other four coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E) cause mild cold-like symptoms.Where did the virus come from? Coronaviruses jumped from civets in Sars and camels in Mers. In the case of Sars-CoV-2, it was most likely a bat, which transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal (most likely a pangolin), from where it spread to humans.Understanding whether the viruses’ pathogenic abilities (abilities to cause disease) evolved in animals before it started infecting humans, or occurred in humans after it jumped from its animal host, will help determine how frequently such pandemics will occur in the future. “The chances of similar outbreaks are lower if the virus infects humans and then evolve its highly pathogenic properties. The virus is not mutating fast, which offers hope for a vaccine,” said Dr NK Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.There have been thousands of outbreaks in India over the past five years, ranging from annual ones like influenza (H1N1 and H3N2), acute encephalitis syndrome, chikungunya, dengue and measles, to rarer ones like Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur forest disease (monkey fever), nipah viral disease, scrub typhus, and zika virus disease, among others, according to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme under the ministry of health & family welfare.The only way to contain health emergencies is to build infrastructure to test, contain and treat. “I believe the coming reality for the world will be one where we are always defending against this enemy. A kind of fire brigade is needed in place, and within that defence, then have the recovery of social interaction and economic activity but done in a way that keeps us all as safe as much as possible,” Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s special envoys on Covid-19, told Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-not-the-last-pandemic-world-has-to-build-resilience/story-bOrpRseqzhDgTjvxStRFzK.html
21-04-2020||India||Cong panel to give Centre MSME revival plan soon||The newly-created Congress consultative committee, headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, met for the first time on Monday and discussed the revival of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, smooth crop procurement and the issue of stranded migrant labourers due to the nationwide lockdown to contain the deadly coronavirus disease.After the meeting, the opposition party reiterated its demand for immediate direct cash transfer of Rs 7500 in all Jan Dhan, pension and the PM-Kisan scheme accounts to enable the poor and the needy sustain themselves during the lockdown period.Giving details of the meeting, former union minister Jairam Ramesh said the Congress panel will prepare a detailed plan for revival of MSME together with steps to ensure smooth procurement of wheat, mustard and gram besides resolving the pressing issue of stranded migrant workers and submit it to the central government in a day or two.Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday formed the consultative committee under the chairmanship of the former Prime Minister to deliberate on current matters, including those related to the Covid-19 outbreak, and formulate the party’s views on various issues.The 11-member group also comprises former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, general secretary in-charge organisation KC Venugopal and former union ministers P Chidambaram, Manish Tewari and Jairam Ramesh.The other members of the group are technology and data cell chairman Praveen Chakravarty, spokespersons Gaurav Vallabh and Supriya Shrinate, and social media department head Rohan Gupta.Ramesh said the panel will meet every other day to discuss the important issues faced by the country due to the pandemic.“We have worked out a very concrete MSME revival package which we will submit to the central government in a day or two,” Ramesh said, addressing a news conference through video conferencing.He said both the former Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi insisted that absolute priority be given to the MSME sector, which has social and economic importance and is the second largest employer after agriculture.Ramesh said the Congress will also make positive recommendations to the government to ensure smooth crop procurement and resolution of the problems of stranded migrant workers.He said the party once again urged the government to transfer Rs 7500 to all Jan Dhan accounts, all pension accounts of the elderly, differently abled and widows, and also those under the PM-Kisan scheme.“I am sure a compassionate and a responsible government can find funds to provide for the vulnerable,” he said when asked if the country has funds of this nature to spare.“It is the matter of priorities. It is absolutely essential for the survival of tens and thousands of people who need immediate assistance to tide over the crisis,” added Ramesh.He said the Congress will keep giving constructive suggestions to the government and hope it will take those positively. Rahul Gandhi too had also advocated constructive support to the government in his press conference last week.“We need to work with the government in these difficult times with a positive mindset. We are extending our hand for constructive cooperation and hope the government will come down from its pedestal and accept our positive suggestions. We are giving these suggestions on behalf of the people of India,” Ramesh said.The panel in its next meeting will discuss the lockdown exit strategy after May 3. Ramesh also alleged that the Centre was busy “destabilising” the Madhya Pradesh government and was “caught napping in preparation for managing” the Covid-19 pandemic as a result of which the action got delayed.“The government did not act on time while dealing with the crisis and was busy in toppling the government in Madhya Pradesh. The government only woke up on March 23 but this is no time to play politics,” he said.Separately, a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) has been called on Thursday to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown situation. The meeting will be held through video-conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-panel-to-give-centre-msme-revival-plan-soon/story-4r8UI5RB2sQjgE8THq9d5L.html
21-04-2020||India||China urges India to review FDI move||China on Monday asked India to revise what it described as a “discriminatory” change in foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations aimed at preventing opportunistic takeovers of Indian firms amid the Covid-19 crisis.The Indian government brought China under the ambit of regulations preventing such takeovers and acquisitions on Friday, with authorities saying any Chinese investments would now require the government’s approval. The revision of the FDI policy came close on the heels of China’s central bank buying a 1.01% stake in HDFC in the first quarter of 2020.“We hope India would revise relevant discriminatory practices, treat investments from different countries equally, and foster an open, fair and equitable business environment,” Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement that was Beijing’s first formal response to the tweak in India’s FDI regulations.Ji said the “additional barriers” set by India for “investors from specific countries violate WTO’s principle of non-discrimination, and go against the general trend of liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment”.The Chinese side also contended the changes in India’s FDI rules “do not conform to the consensus of G20 leaders and trade ministers to realise a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open”.There was no immediate response to Ji’s remarks from Indian officials although people familiar with the matter said the Indian government couldn’t allow vulnerabilities created by the Covid-19 pandemic to be exploited by any country, including China.One of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity: “A pre-emptive action was needed to protect Indian assets from hostile acquisitions and takeovers -- particularly start-ups that have little money power. The necessity is not just felt by India, but many other countries, including powerful G20 nations which have expressed serious concerns about Chinese designs.”The person added: “The actions of Chinese investors, with tacit backing from their government, are not fair business as usual. Hence there is a need to protect our domestic interests.”The people said there was no bar on the entry of Chinese firms into India or investments by them, but all proposals will have to go through the government.“This is not just targeted at China but all countries that share borders with India. It is surprising why China is so perturbed, if it believes in ethical business,” the person cited above said.Earlier, only investments from Pakistan and Bangladesh required the Indian government’s approval for security reasons. Without naming China, an order issued by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) on April 17 said the scope of the policy has been widened to cover all neighbouring countries that share a border with India.Ji noted that China’s cumulative investment in India exceeded $8 billion as of December 2019, “far more than the total investments of India’s other border-sharing countries”. She added, “The impact of the policy on Chinese investors is clear.”The revision of the foreign investment policy by the DPIIT will make it “much difficult for companies from countries sharing land border with India, including China, to invest in the country”, Ji said.Ji contended Chinese investments have “driven the development of India’s industries, such as mobile phone, household electrical appliances, infrastructure and automobile, creating a large number of jobs in India, and promoting [mutually] beneficial and win-win cooperation”.She also noted that Chinese enterprises were actively making donations to help India fight Covid-19 and sought to urge India to create a “favourable investment environment” that would help drive recovery after the pandemic.“Where companies choose to invest and operate depends on the country’s economic fundamentals and business environment. Facing the economic downturn caused by Covid-19, countries should work together to create a favourable investment environment to speed up the resumption of companies’ production and operation,” Ji said.The Indian government’s tweak in FDI rules followed concerns that Chinese firms, including its mammoth state-run companies, could take over Indian companies at a time when their valuations and finances have taken a massive hit because of the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic that originated in Wuhan nearly four months ago.Anil Talreja, partner and leader of the consumer business practice at Deloitte India, said: “Such restriction is warranted at least during the time India Inc recovers and stands on its feet again. This shield would also apply to companies in the consumer retail and automotive {businesses} where FDI was otherwise under the automatic route.”Shardul Shroff, executive chairman of the law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, said: “This variation on FDI being subjected to government scrutiny will help India monitor its FDI which could be directed to acquisitions and takeovers of Indian entities at low valuations, at least in the course of the pandemic, through government route only.”According to the DPIIT’s order, “an entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route”. The order also requires the government’s approval for transferring ownership of an Indian company to any “existing or future” foreign investor belonging to the countries that share a border with India.Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar share borders with India, but there are some exemptions for Nepal and Bhutan-based entities.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on April 12 cautioned the government against takeover threats. “The massive economic slowdown has weakened many Indian corporates making them attractive targets for takeovers. The government must not allow foreign interests to take control of any Indian corporate at this time of national crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-urges-india-to-review-fdi-move/story-6MwNBz5C0ELwmQ12wL5XFL.html
21-04-2020||India||Farmer beaten by police for violating curbs dies in MP||A 50-year-old farmer on Monday succumbed to injuries at a hospital in Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur three days after a group of policemen allegedly thrashed him for violating the lockdown imposed to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Banshi Kushwaha’s family said he was returning home after feeding his cattle on Friday at Tilhari village when policemen attached to the Gaura Bazar police station intercepted him and beat him for breaking the lockdown. Assistant sub-inspector Alok Singh, head constable Mukesh Patariya and constables Rakesh Singh, Guddu Singh, Brijesh and Ashutosh have been suspended for allegedly assaulting the farmer. In a statement before he was removed from his post, Jabalpur police superintendent Amit Singh said the policemen thrashed the farmer after they had gone to Tilhari following information regarding some gambling there. He added Kushwaha was unnecessarily beaten despite “my repeated instructions in the past that nobody be subjected to beating and only legal action should be taken”. He added their act “sullied the image of the police department. Hence, they are hearby suspended forthwith”.In a video made available by his family, Kushwaha is purportedly heard saying the policemen asked him about the gambling. “They asked me if I knew anyone [involved in gambling]. I said no. Then they got down... and started beating me badly. I fell unconscious and was carried home by some people.”The farmer’s brother, Dharmu Kushwaha, said it is a case of murder and the policemen must be booked for killing his sibling.A doctor at Jabalpur’s City Hospital, where the farmer was admitted, who did not want to be named, said there were injury marks on his body. “There appeared to be internal injuries too.”Jabalpur collector Bharat Yadav said he has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. “A sub-divisional magistrate has been deputed to conduct the inquiry into the incident,” he said. The probe is expected to be completed within 30 daysNo arrests had been made in the case as police were yet to register a first information report. Madhya Pradesh police chief Vivek Johri said prima facie the policemen have been found guilty. “Any further action against them will be based on the inquiry report.”Siddharth Bahuguna will replace Amit Singh as the Jabalpur police superintendent. Amit Singh has been shifted to police headquarters in Bhopal as assistant inspector general of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-beaten-by-police-for-violating-curbs-dies-in-mp/story-OmKgIWTjEJznd6FRtD6rLK.html
21-04-2020||India||J&K journalist booked under UAPA over post||The J&K Police have invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against a Srinagar-based photojournalist in Kashmir for allegedly uploading ‘anti-national posts’ on her social media.The cyber cell of J&K Police said that they have registered a case against the woman under Section 13 of the UA (P) Act and 505 of the IPC at Cyber police station on Saturday.The Kashmir Press Club condemned recent cases of harassment and summoning of journalists by police in the Valley. “The female photojournalist was summoned to Cyber Police Station, Air Cargo in Srinagar on April 18. However, after the Kashmir Press Club and Directorate of Information intervened, police dropped the summon order,” a statement read.J&K PDP termed it a systematic pattern of assault on freedom of expression. National Conference said that freedom of expression was never so curtailed.Police, in a statement, said that the Cyber Police Station, Kashmir, received information through reliable sources that a Facebook user is frequently uploading anti-national posts with criminal intention. “The posts can provoke public to disturb the law and order and glorify anti-national activities. The cyber police called her to police station not Air Cargo Complex,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/woman-photojournalist-booked-for-uploading-anti-national-posts-on-social-media/story-KW9Em4WKpsUIHxEMJqpoTP.html
21-04-2020||India||Behind new shield for Indian firms from China, a worrying trend and Ajit Doval||The government’s decision to insist on regulatory oversight of Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) is an attempt to ring-fence India’s capital hungry startup and tech trailblazers being swallowed up by cash rich investors from the dragon country, many of which may enjoy tacit state support.Over the weekend (April 18), the department of promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) tweaked rules, making FDI by any entity of a country, which shares land border with India” subject to government approval.The move may impact investments from countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Bhutan and more importantly China.Not surprisingly, Beijing is the only country to have responded to the Indian decision, describing it discriminatory. Ji Rong, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy asked India to “revise discriminatory practices” and “treat investments from different countries equally”.Until now, a non-resident entity or a foreign investor could invest in India, subject to FDI rules, except in sectors/activities which are prohibited. However, countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan could invest only after government approvals and only in select sectors.Also Watch | Chinese threat amid Covid impact: Why India changed FDI rules But the Covid-19 crisis has dramatically transformed the business landscape across the world, with many Indian startups and tech companies seeing their valuations slump.This raised concerns about companies selling off stake at a discount as they scramble to stay afloat in an uncertain economic environment.The influence of Chinese investment in India’s startups have been growing. The statistics are telling.According to a recent study by Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations, a foreign policy think-tank, 18 of the 30 Indian unicorns (companies valued at more than $1 billion) have a Chinese investor.“This means that China is embedded in Indian society, the economy, and the technology ecosystem that influences it,” the report said. “Unlike a port or a railway line, these are invisible assets in small sizes – rarely over $100 million – and made by the private sector, which doesn’t cause immediate alarm”.Gateway House has identified over 75 companies, with Chinese investors concentrated in e-commerce, fintech, media/social media, aggregation services and logistics. A majority – more than half – of India’s 30 Indian unicorns (start-ups with valuation of over $1 billion) have a Chinese investor.These include storied names such as PayTM, Oyo, BigBasket, Ola, PolicyBazaar and Delhivery among others.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has been flagging concerns over Chinese dominance in India’s booming tech space over the last few years, particularly pointing out worrying possibilities of Beijing’s state-funded apparatus controlling startups here through opaque corporate structures.Top government sources told Hindustan Times that the national security planners believed that firewalls were needed as India and China had many outstanding disputes and legacy issues.These primarily related to the unresolved 3,488 kilometre-long boundary dispute apart from Beijing using Islamabad as a proxy to hit at New Delhi on all fronts including keeping Jammu and Kashmir on a permanent boil.Until the spread of Covid-19, Raisina Hill was not warm to the idea of government oversight on Chinese FDI, with a strand of thought dominating that such a move could affect FDI inflows into India. Besides, it was felt that it could unsettle the fragile equilibrium in India-China bilateral relations, sources pointed out.The institutional knowledge of economic affairs, commerce and industry as well as ministry of external affairs relegated such a policy proposal change to the back burner.The Covid-19 outbreak provided an opportunity to Modi 2.0 to operationalize the FDI changes, with the proposal now enjoying bi-partisan support within India’s security and policy brainstrust.The Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Modi cleared the policy on April 17 with total support from Home Minister Amit Shah. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.That this was an idea whose time had come hit home on February 1, when the government realised that there was hardly any Indian company that was manufacturing either personal protective equipment, ventilators or masks that the whole world is shopping for in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.Concessions to Chinese imports had also virtually pushed manufacturing out of the country including production of the much-needed critical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).There have also been concerns within the government that its signature “Make in India” initiative, first launched in 2014 to turn India into a manufacturing powerhouse, was being severely impacted by the allowances that had been extended to China.China is India’s largest bilateral merchandise trading partner, but the balance of trade is heavily tilted in favour of Beijing.Total India-China bilateral trade stood at USD 95.7 billion in 2019, with a deficit of USD 58 billion in favour of Beijing.The total Chinese FDI investment as per industry is USD 6.2 billion in India.The latest move is part of a series of steps that the government has taken since the start of this week after Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) said that People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had raised its stake in the home lender from 0.8% to 1.01% in the March quarter through open market purchases.This led many to voice concerns that India’s systemically-important companies could be vulnerable to creeping take over from foreign investors, aided by dropping valuations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-new-shield-for-indian-firms-from-china-a-worrying-trend-and-ajit-doval/story-KAGe4jNbqYffGLEfXtHvnN.html
21-04-2020||India||Amid confusion over lockdown rules, industries look at Bengal govt to restart production||With no directives addressing problems faced by individual sectors, industries willing to resume production in West Bengal in a controlled manner from April 20 stared at unanswered questions on Sunday even as their counterparts in other states made elaborate plans.Asked by the state government to resume work with 15% workforce, the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) on Sunday asked all mills to send online applications to authorities for starting operations on Monday. The notice was issued on Sunday by Debasish Roy, IJMA’s director-general. Roy did not say whether the top body of the jute industry was ready to resume production from Monday.“We are awaiting permission from the government,” Raghavendra Gupta, IJMA’s chairperson, said on Monday morning.IJMA members, however, said they were willing to restart work and follow safety guidelines but 15% workforce would lead to losses because so few people cannot run all machines. According to IJMA, West Bengal has 69 jute mills that employ 250,000 people. “The state government should understand the technical aspects. Only the IJMA can decide how many workers are needed to run a mill effectively,” Tapan Sen, the national general secretary of the Centre for Trade Unions (CITU), the labour arm of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said.The bakery industry in the state has been affected badly with around 10 to 12% of the 2500 companies operating on a restricted scale, claimed Ariful Islam, chief executive of the West Bengal Bakers’ Association.“Bakers in Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai told us that they are operating without any hindrance. In Delhi, bread is even being supplied by the government among other relief materials,” Islam said.“On one hand, we are being asked to operate as part of essential service while on the other, vehicles transporting bread are being stopped on highways for allegedly breaking lockdown norms. Today, for example, two vans were stopped in Howrah. This has been happening ever since the lockdown started,” Islam said on Sunday afternoon.“How can we resume operation? The ones that are operating are supplying products only to the local areas. We have written to the Kolkata Police commissioner and director-general of the state police,” said Islam.CITU’s Sen said that a part of the steel industry kept operating with a fraction of the workforce as furnaces cannot be shut down during the lockdown. He said firing steel furnaces and reaching the required temperature once they have cooled down are expensive and lengthy processes.“The Durgapur Steel Plant was among many that did not stop operation. The steel sector should not have much problem resuming production but workers will face trouble reaching their workplace with public transport suspended,” Sen, a former member of the Rajya Sabha, said.“With people in many areas affected and certain zones marked red, keeping public transport suspended is also a situational compulsion,” Sen added.A cabinet minister, who did not wish to be named, said he was not aware whether the government will meet representatives of various sectors or issue any order on Monday.An employee of a logistics company that runs Amazon’s sorting centre at Dankuni sad they have been handling only essential materials wearing protective gear, including personal protection suit and face shield. “We were ready to handle non-essential goods as well but a circular was issued by the Union home ministry on Sunday saying supply of these by e-commerce companies will remain prohibited,” the employee said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-confusion-over-lockdown-rules-industries-look-at-bengal-govt-to-restart-production/story-mE5lrX3gtm52ApdGT2faBM.html
21-04-2020||India||India’s internet consumption up during Covid-19 lockdown, shows data||India’s internet consumption rose by 13% since the nationwide lockdown was put in place to check the spread of Covid-19, according to telecom ministry data that showed Indians consumed 308 petabytes (PB) or 308,000 terabytes (TB) of data daily on an average for the week beginning March 22.According to the department of telecom, which collated reports from service providers, the daily average consumption in this period was 9% higher than 282PB data used on March 21 (the day the janta curfew was announced) and 13% more than March 19, when consumption was 270 PB. The change reflected how people consumed more streaming content and logged on to work from home, which was also captured in how data demand from residences rose as compared to commercial areas.The consumption, DoT figures show, peaked on two days -- March 22 and March 27 -- when 312 PB of data was used. On March 26, 311 PB of data was consumed. The lockdown, announced on March 24, began on March 25. On March 22, India was put under a voluntary, one-day curfew.Since the first week, however, consumption has now stabilised around the 300PB mark.The data in one PB is equivalent to 500 billion pages of standard printed text.Andhra Pradesh and Bihar saw some of the most drastic increase – it rose by 12% in both states. In Maharashtra, where data consumption was highest among all states under the lockdown period, the increase was 7%.The government said that that increase was within their capacity. “We have the capacity to handle a spike of 20% without any duress. We optimised the fibre optics network and have not yet reported a breakdown,” said a DoT official, asking not to be named. The consumption, the official added, rose lower than it would have since many streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix decided to downgrade video quality. Rajan Mathews of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said around the third week of March, operators recorded a 30% jump in traffic with most of it from people streaming videos. The COAI wrote to OTT sites to downsize their content. The decision by media companies to disable high-quality video and optimise bandwidth usage helped networks meet the increased demand, Mathews said, adding that the operators also started using unused cell towers. “With the consumption moving to residential places, the challenge was that these areas resist installation of cell towers. We worked with the government to ensure that of 800 unused cell towers in metro cities, 730 were made functional,” said Mathews. A third factor that helped, according to Mathews, was operators being allowed to carry out maintenance work. “Complaints of cuts in fibre optic cables were about 100 a day on an average, this fell down to 6-7 a day,” he said. India’s consumption rates have seen a steady increase over the last few years. Nokia’s annual Mobile Broadband India Traffic Index (MBiT) report says that there was a whopping 47% jump in the overall data traffic in India in 2019. This translates to 11 GB a month per user, and is driven by 4G consumption. SpeedTest, a site that analyses internet access performance across the globe, in its latest report on tracking COVID-19’s impact on speeds around the world which was updated on April 15, showed a 6% decline in fixed line speeds and 18% in mobile speeds when compared to the week of March 2. As per the report, India’s current broadband speed is an average of 36.17 mbps and mobile download speed is 9.67 mbps. While the report put India behind countries like China, Austria, Japan, Israel and UAE, in terms of mobile and fixed broadband performance, it was ahead of countries like Italy, France, Germany, and Canada. Rajesh Chharia of the Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) said that while the strain has not increased, internet service providers (ISPs) should be allowed to share infrastructure. He said that it’s a long-term demand, which is awaiting the Centre’s nod. “If the infrastructure of a provider is full, they may be allowed to overload it with the infrastructure of another to spread the network. This will ensure uninterrupted services,” said Chharia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-internet-consumption-up-during-covid-19-lockdown-shows-data/story-ALcov1bP8uWYO9N2TbpPlK.html
21-04-2020||India||Coronavirus update: In Madhya Pradesh, Assam, chartered planes ferrying samples||A Beechcraft B 200 aircraft, which was otherwise used as official transport by the chief minister and governor of Madhya Pradesh, has become a key element to the state’s fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to people familiar with the matter.Starting this week, the six-seater plane -- operated by pilots wearing hazmat suits -- is being used to carry test samples between big cities in the state and New Delhi to enable Madhya Pradesh go beyond its own testing capacity of 1,200 a day for the Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19.“We realized that some coronavirus patients were dying in MP just after three-four days of hospital stay,’’ said Mohammed Suleiman, an IAS officer who last week took charge of the state health department. “We realized that they were coming too late. So we decided to step up testing and that’s why we need to send extra samples to ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) in Delhi.’’In its third trip on Saturday, the Beechcraft carried 1,663 samples from Bhopal to Delhi, where they were taken to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Earlier in the week, 1,200 samples were carried from Indore to the national capital.”ICMR and NCDC have kindly agreed to test 1,400 samples of MP state daily,’’ said the commissioner of the health department, Nishant Warwade. “The strategy is to send samples of all suspects for testing so that no one remains untested.”Madhya Pradesh is not the only state to take the aerial route to enhance its testing capacity. While it has its own state plane, Assam has been using chartered planes to ferry samples at a time when all commercial and private flights were suspended following the imposition on March 25 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of a 21-day national lockdown, which has not been extended till May 3.The Assam government has also been hiring these planes at the cost of 70,000-90,000 rupees per hour to get supplies from the ICMR offices in Kolkata. “We’ve been using a chartered plane since the beginning of the lockdown,’’ said Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. “We need to not just ferry samples for testing but also procure medical supplies from Kolkata, so we are using the plane on a daily basis.’’ While the exact number of samples that Assam has sent were not available, Sarma said they have been using it daily since the lockdown.The chartered services is also sometimes being used to ferry medical personnel from one district to another, Sarma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-madhya-pradesh-assam-chartered-planes-ferrying-samples/story-rA24gaRlIS2tRCeMwtNT4L.html
21-04-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Govt sets up national vaccine task force||The central government on Sunday constituted another national task force on vaccine development and drug testing having representatives from the ministry of Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) among others as members.The main job of this task force will be to work as a bridge between academia, research institutions, and international collaborations in the field of drug testing and vaccine development.“We are contributing towards drug research as there are many herbs known for their medicinal properties. It is a collaborative effort with CSIR, ICMR etc,” said Ayush secretary Rajesh Kotecha. The other members will be from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), department of science and technology (DST), department of biotechnology (DBT), council of scientific and industrial research (CSIR), defence research and development organisation (DRDO), directorate general of health services (DGHS) and drug controller general of India (DCGI).“This task force will monitor the progress, not just in India but globally, happening in the field of vaccine development and drug trials. They will create a clinical cohort for long-term follow-up of people for achieving a better understanding of disease management. Bio specimens will be collected as part of the exercise, which will be different from the usual sample collection, for further drug and vaccine trials,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry.The task force will be co-chaired by principal scientific advisory to the government of India, K Vijay Raghavan, and member (health) Niti Aayog, Dr Vinod Paul.The DBT will be the central coordinating agency for vaccine development, and will focus on identifying different pathways in ensuring that work towards vaccine development is expedited. The partial lockdown relaxation that will be given after April 20 will not be applicable to hot spot areas from where clusters or large outbreaks of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have been reported.“The states have been given a free hand to impose further additional measures according to local requirements as the local administration will be in a better position to take a call, depending on the conditions on the ground,” said Agarwal.The state governments are also scaling up efforts to create more dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and health centres. As of now, there are a total of 2,144 hospitals and health centres meant only for Covid-19 patients, of which 755 are big hospitals and 1,389 are Covid health centres for mild or asymptomatic patients.There are now 54 districts from 23 states and Union territories that have not reported fresh cases during the last 14 days. Apart from the previous list, 10 new districts have been added.The districts newly added to the list are Gaya and Saran in Bihar; Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh; Fatehgarh Sahib and Rupnagar in Punjab; Bhiwani, Hisar, and Fatehabad in Haryana; and Cachar and Lakhimpur in Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-sets-up-national-vaccine-task-force/story-AfXpEnE6854EenhTwQ7zNJ.html
21-04-2020||India||Spruce up your home||Being is quarantine is bringing out the creative side in most of us. From painting and cooking to tidying up and organising our living spaces, we’ve done it all. And now, with the lockdown extended further, why not push the envelope and invest our time in something more liberating and a tad bit permanent? We all love our homes, and there’s something about the comfort that it provides that is not found elsewhere. How about sprucing up your lining pace to make it even more comfy and personalised. While isolation might seem a little overwhelming, you can use that little extra time to brighten up the setting around you. With just a few items, put together in quirky ways, the same monotonous space can be transformed into a mood-booster. Saloni Khosla, head of interior design, Pepperfry, Ali Baldiwala, partner in Baldiwala Associates — professional consultants in interior design, and Gita Ramanan, co-founder at Design Cafe, share some easy DIY ideas to add some buoyancy to your abode. 1.Make those walls a canvas – If you’re bored of looking at the monochromatic, austere wall of your bedroom, then make those walls pop. Add some colour by adorning your bedroom or study wall with a woven rug or an old silk sari, making for a bright tapestry. Wall stencilling is probably the most effective way to add colour and vibrancy to your walls without the cost of hiring a professional. All you need is stencils in different shapes and spend your afternoon displaying them creatively. Chequered patterns add plenty of life and style to the room. A friendly hack to the pocket and eye!2. Personalise accessories - And if you’re looking to mix family time with this DIY décor, you can even try some personalised wall art. Embellish some cardboard or a bedsheet with the signature handprints of your family members and display it on the walls of your hallway. 3.Turn your utility items into décor - Too much clutter and no rack to organise? Fret not, bring out the old ladder and utilise it as a clothes stand to help you maintain a pristine abode. You can stack up the clothes in a colour co-ordinated fashion and jazz it up with some fairy lights or artificial climbers. 4.Repurpose and refashion - Lend an industrial touch to an old vase by splashing some peppy colours and warping it with a metallic wire. Fill it with some dry sticks or paper flowers and place it on the coffee table as a centrepiece. Alternatively, you can take old glass bottles and re-purpose them for to create an elegant vase. Paint them in a monochromatic neutral tone and adorn them with lace or petite ribbons to add a touch of dainty finesse. 5.Go crazy with cloth - Spread some colour around! For a special family meal, you can make your dining table bright by dyeing your table napkins in vivid acrylic paints. 6. Plants - if you have plants around, just tucked in corners of your home, get them placed in better spots. Greens always uplifts one’s mood. If you have indoor plants place them around in ways you can always see them.7. Declutter - we tend to hoard things. It’s human nature to save that one piece for a rainy day. It’s time to prioritise things you need and let go of the ones you don’t. This will not only make your space look more refined and neat but also will help you maintain a sort of cleanliness and hygiene in general. Getting rid of the mess and extra items on bed side tables, study desks, dining tops etc. allows one’s mind to think better and makes you more efficient. Also cleaning is therapeutic for most, so must try.8. Throw in the real ‘You’ - Now that this house you have invested so many months into, is yours, so it should look like it is yours. All the travel souvenirs you have, the hobbies you have given a form to must find their place in your new home. It not only adds originality to your home but also adds to the grandeur and ambience. See? It’s easy-peasy. Small tricks with a big impact, that is what they are. So, the next time your builder, carpenter, designer gives you a hard time, just resort to these itty-bitty tips and convert your sweet home to something that everyone envies!Recycling is the name of the gameThe living room is where we might be spending most of our time, and it’s good to add a little zing and colour to our sofas for a new look. Dimple Ahuja, creative director, Studio Malabar, says, “You can do this by using your old Benarasi, Patola or embroidered dupattas, colourful saris or eye-catching printed stoles. You can display them either on the sides, one half of the sofa or just at the back rest. You can experiment with the placing as per your likes to enhance your sofa. If you have a round-table, you can use a bright printed scarf placed in the square format along with a plant at the centre (maybe a small money plant) placed in red, blue, green pottery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/spruce-up-your-home/story-vcNx6Whcr2Oz4bindfJHrJ.html
21-04-2020||India||Rapid testing may begin on Thursday for those in high-risk areas||India is likely to start rapid antibody testing on Thursday, with people in high-risk areas (containment zones), “large migration gatherings” and evacuation centres expected to be the first to get undergo this simple blood test that checks the presence of antibodies created by the body to fight the Sars-Cov-2 virus.The country’s apex biomedical research organisation, ICMR, on Saturday released an advisory on how and where rapid test kits can be used. At the same time, the number of conventional RT-PCR tests being done have increased, with the total test utilisation capacity going up from 10% to about 50% in the past two weeks, according to government documents.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe National Task Force constituted to review the testing guidelines did not ease its parameters, and did not open antibody tests to the private sector, despite recommendations from a high-level technical experts committee that wanted these tests to be available to “everyone at risk”, including those outside hot spot areas. “We are expecting the kits to arrive by Wednesday, and after that the Union health ministry will take a call on where all to deploy these kits in the field,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology and communicable diseases division, Indian Council of Medical Research.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 toll hits 100; Delhi tally 503“The government’s primary focus has been places from where large number of cases is being reported, large gatherings and evacuation centres. Another focus area for which our experts recommended rapid testing is for patients suffering from influenza like illness (ILI) with an objective to be used as a more effective monitoring tool in these areas,” said Luv Agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health, during Sunday’s media briefing.“These will be our criteria for distributing the kits once we get the supply,” he added.According to home ministry data, there are about 28,000 relief camps set up across the country that houses close to 1.25 million migrant workers. The government is also planning more evacuation fights from UK and other places to bring back stranded Indians. “This is the category of people that falls under those who need rapid testing. At this stage this group is our primary concern and extended it for all is not on the cards. There is a task force that is constantly evaluating the situation, and will take a call as and when required ,” said a senior health ministry official.Also Read: Shortage of safety equipment crippling states’ Covid-19 containment effortsThere are also about 20 existing and 22 potential hot stops that state governments are currently tracking.Unlike the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that detects the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in throat and nasal swabs to diagnose a current Covid-19 infection, rapid antibody tests indicate if a person has been infected in the past and has developed immunity to the virus.Experts say they can also be used as a screening test for the infection -- antibodies typically show up a week after the infection.The simple blood test (samples can be collected by just a finger prick) which takes 15-20 minutes to give results, identifies people who were infected at least a week before the test, and also those who were infected but never diagnosed, helping map undetected infections and giving the correct extent of the spread of the disease.Some states such as Kerala are procuring the antibody kits on their own for surveillance purposes.“We are expecting delivery of Rapid Test kits (blood based) for use in response to Covid-19 situation. ln this regard, National Task Force deliberated with experts for ascertaining use of these rapid test kits. Draft of the suggested algorithm was also discussed in detail with technical experts from the ministry and inputs were included in the final version which is feasible for implementation in the field conditions...,” wrote secretary Department of Health Research, Dr Balram Bhargava to health secretary Preeti Sudan.In his letter, Dr Bhargava also spoke about how the overall testing for Covid-19 using real-time RT PCR was increasing (up to 50% capacity as against 10% when), and that close to 130 government laboratories would approach their full capacity soon.ICMR has been evaluating the rapid test kits, and has already validated seven testing kits, and also put up a list of kits that have CE-IVD (European Union) approval that can be used“India has taken a decision to use antibody tests which could be a game-changer. The currently used test (PCR) tells us who are currently sick. We are seeing only the tip of the iceberg. These antibody tests are expected to be very economical, simple and give results within 15-20 minutes. It is being used for contact tracing in some countries. Indian health system has lot of experience in doing such tests, like the ones for dengue, chikungunya, so it will be easy to ramp up the screening. It’s a great tool for surveillance, and building up epidemiological data,” said Lalit Kant, senior infectious disease expert.Dr Sanjeev Khosla, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Microbial Technology, which is one of the government labs identified for Covid-19 testing, said: “ ICMR’s initiative to involve all government-accredited labs is a welcome step… would increase the testing rate among suspected patients. In the initial phase the institute plans to prepare to carry out 50 to 100 samples daily, and the capacity can be ramped up subsequently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-testing-may-begin-on-thursday-for-those-in-high-risk-areas/story-7mxjRmkBdA4MX6kreejVSP.html
21-04-2020||Editorials||The oil opportunity for India||The price of Texas oil futures fell below zero dollars per barrel on Monday. In theory, and for a fleeting moment, an empty barrel of crude oil was worth more than a full one. This was a symbolic milestone, a consequence of a lack of storage and quarter-end fire sales rather than a stable market situation. Oil price futures have recovered, but only to their still absurdly low band of $20 to $25 a barrel. Brent crude price, the relevant one for India, continues to stay in the low $20’s. All of this reflects the enormous mismatch between global supply and demand. There was already a surplus of oil before the coronavirus pandemic. After the outbreak and the continuing economic retrenchment, the world is awash with black gold. The recent, much-touted 15 million-barrel oil production cuts announced by various countries proved toothless in the face of a 30 million-barrel drop in demand. The brief fall of Texas oil prices into negative was a headline-catching symptom of the current problem of surplus. There have been other signs — the record 160 million barrels of oil stored on stationary tankers, and countries such as Nigeria being unable to sell sweet light crude at even $11. Natural gas prices have followed a slippery slope as well.As one of the world’s largest importers and a country repeatedly brought to its knees by crude spikes, India has always been happy when prices have crashed. But it has moved beyond the days when it looked at oil solely in terms of how much foreign exchange it could save. Today, it should look at how it can quickly enhance its strategic reserves to benefit from the falling prices; China, for instance, is doing just that. It should assure future supplies (this is a good time to enter into long-term contracts). And finally, it should also judge how the present oil crisis will affect, for better or for worse, its long-term energy strategy.New Delhi should keep a firm eye on its long-standing goals of promoting solar and wind energy, shifting more baseload power to natural gas, and shutting its most-polluting coal-fired power plants, but it is unlikely that even the most cost-effective of these will be able to match oil prices in the short and maybe even medium term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-oil-opportunity-for-india/story-UV075rtbvrq8J033eXjWaI.html
