No,” Trump said to reporters at the daily White House briefing on the Covid-19 epidemic. “But I don’t want to see a crooked election.”The US president mooted election delay in a tweet Thursday as an alternative to the use of mail-in voting in the November 3 elections, arguing it will lead to fraud and abuse. It is being considered by many states in view of the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic and some of them tried it in the primaries.Trump brought copies of news articles to the briefing about specific cases of problems facing mail-in voting in Democratic primaries in New York and New Jersey. “Mail-in ballots will lead to the greatest fraud,” he said.Subsequently, the election-delay tweet that was pinned at the top post on his Twitter feed for more than 84 million followers to see, had been taken down by the end of the day.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, made the point with a tweet quoting the constitution: “Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states:’The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States’.”And others, including many senior Republicans, pointed to the fact that elections had been held in the midst of even the most dire of times such as the Civil War, and World War I and the Spanish Flu epidemic in 1918.“Never in the history of the country, through wars and depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again this November 3,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told a local TV stations in his home state Kentucky.Kevin McCarthy, the top top Republican in the House, told reporters at a news briefing that “never in the history of the federal elections have we ever not held an election and we should go forward with our election”.Former President Barack Obama weighed in as well making a broader point of voting rights at the funeral of John Lewis, the civil rights leader who passed away last week. “Even as we sit here, there are those in power are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting – by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don’t get sick.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-want-to-see-crooked-election-donald-trump-retraces-steps-on-delaying-november-polls/story-07Kn1lX04IkHMVdobavv8M.html
31-07-2020||World||Anthony Fauci ‘cautiously optimistic’ about Covid-19 vaccine||Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist, told lawmakers Friday he is “cautiously optimistic” that a vaccine for Covid-19 will be available by the end of the year.“There’s never a guarantee that you’re going to get a safe and effective vaccine, but from everything we’ve seen now in the animal data, as well as the early human data, we feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this year and as we go into 2021,” Fauci said at a congressional hearing.The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci heads, is participating in five of the many projects underway in the United States as part of Operation Warp Speed, the federally supported effort to find a vaccine.One of these candidate vaccines, being developed by Moderna, went into Phase 3 clinical trial past Monday.“I believe, ultimately, over a period of time in 2021, if we have it, and I think we will have a safe and effective vaccine, that Americans will be able to get it,” Fauci went on to say.Asked about its distribution he said, “I don’t think that they will have everybody getting it immediately in the beginning. It probably will be phased in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-cautiously-optimistic-about-covid-19-vaccine/story-CQnyFJf2HTZ88romL7H7HN.html
31-07-2020||World||Nepal seeks talks with India as soon as possible on Kalapani border row||Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali on Friday called on India to start negotiations as soon as possible to resolve the border row over the Kalapani region, saying New Delhi hadn’t responded to several requests from Kathmandu for talks on the issue. Gyawali also described a tripartite agreement signed by India, Nepal and the UK in 1947 for the recruitment of Nepalese Gorkha soldiers as “redundant” and said Kathmandu would prefer to handle this issue bilaterally with the two countries. Participating in a webinar organised by the Nepal Institute of International Relations, the minister responded to a question on the border row with India by saying that the issue was one of the “unresolved questions left by history”. “We are still requesting India to start negotiations at the earliest so that the problems would not go to the streets,” he said. “Formal diplomatic engagement [on the issue] is extremely critical,” he added. Nepal had formally asked several times to start diplomatic negotiations to settle problems over the Kalapani region, and proposed dates for talks but there was “no timely response” from New Delhi, Gyawali said. Though New Delhi cited the Covid-19 pandemic as a factor for the talks not being held at the current juncture, India has had diplomatic engagements with countries such as Australia, China and the US in recent months, he noted. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Gyawali’s remarks. The border row over Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura became a major irritant in bilateral ties after India opened a new road to Lipulekh to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar. Nepal responded by publishing a new map that included the disputed territories. Nepal continues to be in touch with India on the issue through informal channels though no dates have been decided for talks, Gyawali said. He also acknowledged that the rest of the relationship with India “is okay” as critical supply chains were unaffected and India-funded development projects were carrying on. “We have been able to differentiate the boundary issue from other broader engagements and I think it is the right way to deal with a close neighbour,” he said. Referring to the tripartite agreement on the recruitment of Nepalese Gorkha soldiers in the armies of India and the UK, he said this was a “legacy of the past” and the pact “has become redundant”. “[The agreement] had created a lot of jobs in the past, but in the changed context, some of its provisions are questionable,” he said, adding Nepal would prefer to handle the matter bilaterally with India and the UK. Responding to a question about Nepal’s position on the India-China border standoff, Gyawali said: “Being a close friend and a close neighbour of both countries, we urge both nations to de-escalate the tensions, to start negotiations, to solve peacefully the problems, engage constructively to solve the problems and to play a bigger role for the betterment of both countries, the region and the globe.” “When the tensions escalate, naturally Nepal becomes very worried because it will create a bigger and wider impact in the region,” he said, adding it is important for India and China to continue their engagements to reduce tensions. Gyawali also said a recent virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan hosted by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi was focused solely on the response to Covid-19 and wasn’t an attempt to create a new sub-regional grouping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-seeks-talks-with-india-as-soon-as-possible-on-kalapani-border-row/story-wOA6Nn1VT7FFxruX829yPL.html
31-07-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine will be widely available, optimistic Fauci tells lawmakers||Once a coronavirus vaccine is approved as safe and effective, Americans should have widespread access within a reasonable time, Dr. Anthony Fauci assured lawmakers Friday.Appearing before a House panel investigating the nation’s response to the pandemic, Fauci expressed “cautious” optimism that a vaccine would be available, particularly by next year.“I believe, ultimately, over a period of time in 2021, that Americans will be able to get it,” Fauci said, referring to the vaccine.There will be a priority list for who gets early vaccinations. “I don’t think we will have everybody getting it immediately,” Fauci explained.But “ultimately, within a reasonable time, the plans allow for any American who needs the vaccine to get it,” he added.Under direction from the White House, federal health authorities are carrying out a plan dubbed Operation Warp Speed to manufacture 300 million doses of a vaccine on a compressed timeline.Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, said a quarter-million people have expressed interest in taking part in studies of experimental vaccines for the coronavirus.He said that 250,000 people have registered on a government website to take part in vaccine trials, which are pivotal for establishing safety and effectiveness. Not all patients who volunteer to take part in clinical trials are eligible to participate.Fauci was joined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Dr. Robert Redfield and Health and Human Services testing czar Adm. Brett Giroir.At a time when early progress seems to have been lost and uncertainty clouds the nation’s path forward, Fauci is calling on lawmakers — and all other Americans — to go back to public health basics such as social distancing and wearing masks.The panel, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, is divided about how to reopen schools and businesses, mirroring divisions among Americans. Committee Chairman Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said the White House must come up with a comprehensive national plan to contain the virus. Ranking Republican Steve Scalise of Louisiana said the Trump administration has plans already on vaccines, testing, nursing homes and other coronavirus-related issues.A rebound of cases across the South and the West has dashed hopes for a quick return to normal life. Problems with the availability and timeliness of testing continue to be reported. And the race for a vaccine, though progressing rapidly, has yet to deliver a breakthrough.Fauci’s public message in recent days has been that Americans can’t afford a devil-may-care attitude toward Covid-19 and need to double down on basic measures such as wearing masks in public, keeping their distance from others and avoiding crowds and indoor spaces such as bars. That’s echoed by Redfield and Giroir, though they are far less prominent.Fauci’s dogged persistence has drawn the ire of some of President Donald Trump’s supporters and prompted a new round of calls for his firing. But the veteran of battles against AIDS and Ebola has stuck to his message, while carefully avoiding open confrontations with the Trump White House.In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Fauci said he was “disturbed” by the flat-out opposition in parts of the country to wearing masks as a public health protective measure.“There are certain fundamentals,” he said, “the staples of what you need to do ... one is universal wearing of masks.”Public health experts say masks help prevent an infected person who has yet to develop symptoms from passing the virus to others. For mask wearers, there’s also some evidence that they can offer a degree of protection from an infected person nearby.Fauci said in his AP interview that he’s concerned because the U.S. has not followed the track of Asian and European nations also hit hard by the coronavirus.Other countries that shut down their economies knocked back uncontrolled spread and settled into a pattern of relatively few new cases, although they continued to experience local outbreaks.The U.S. also knocked back the initial spread, but it never got the background level of new cases quite as low. And the resurgence of Covid-19 in the Sunbelt in recent weeks has driven the number of new daily cases back up into the 60,000-70,000 range. It coincided with economic reopening and a return to social gatherings, particularly among younger adults. Growing numbers of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and deaths have followed as grim consequences.Nearly 4.5 million Americans have been been infected since the start of the pandemic, and more than 150,000 have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Fauci said there’s evidence the surge across the South may be peaking, but upticks in the Midwest are now a concern.“They’ve really got to jump all over that because if they don’t then you might see the surge we saw in some of the Southern states,” he told the AP.Though Fauci gets push-back from White House officials, other medical experts in the administration are on the same page when it comes to the public health message.Giroir, the testing czar, told reporters Thursday: “I think it’s very important to make sure that we all spread the public health message that we can control all the outbreaks occurring right now.”He said controlling the outbreaks will require people to wear masks, avoid crowded indoor spaces and wash their hands frequently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-will-be-widely-available-optimistic-fauci-tells-lawmakers/story-eQm1LQr3pO6J9RjVU99RRJ.html
31-07-2020||World||US imposes human rights sanctions on Chinese company, individuals||The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on a Chinese company and two officials related to the company for what it said were human rights abuses against Uighurs and other ethnic minority people in China’s Xinjiang province, the Treasury Department said.The move was yet another step in the deteriorating relations between the United States and China and came a week after US President Donald Trump closed the Chinese consulate in Houston, prompting Beijing to shutter the US consulate in Chengdu.Friday’s move blacklisted the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, also known as XPCC, along with Sun Jinlong, former party secretary of the XPCC, and Peng Jiarui, deputy party secretary and commander of the XPCC, “for their connection to serious human rights abuse against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang,” the Treasury said in a statement.The Treasury identified the company as a paramilitary organization in the Xinjiang region that is subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party and “enhances internal control over the region by advancing China’s vision of economic development.”Washington’s action freezes any US assets of the company and officials and generally prohibits Americans from dealing with them. The Treasury also issued a license on Friday, authorizing certain wind down and divestment transactions and activities related to blocked subsidiaries of the XPCC until Sept. 30.The new move comes three weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on the autonomous region of Xinjiang’s Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, a member of China’s powerful Politburo, and three other officials. Chen was described as the highest ranking Chinese official that the United States has sanctioned.The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is a quasi-military group created in 1954 and initially made up of demobilized soldiers, who spent part of their time in military training and the rest turning the region’s arid land into farms.Civilian members from eastern China later joined the corps, and it now numbers 3.11 million people, or more than 12% of the region’s population. It is almost entirely made up of Han Chinese in a region that is home to the Muslim Uighur people.Experts have said the group is like a “state within a state” and has established new cities in the region with schools and universities and jurisdiction over police and courts.China denies that Uighurs are unfairly marginalized, and says it is addressing underdevelopment and lack of jobs in heavily Uighur areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-human-rights-sanctions-on-chinese-company-individuals/story-icf5IGMvMhGBaNJJ7j72LM.html

Iran later responded by slowly abandoning nearly every aspect of the agreement, though it still allows U.N. inspectors access to its nuclear sites.Trump has maintained that the deal needs to be renegotiated because it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program or its involvement in regional conflicts. The other signatories to the nuclear deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have been struggling to keep it alive.Khamenei said the U.S. wants Iran to give up its nuclear program, defense facilities and regional authority at the negotiating table.He said economic sanctions imposed on Iran by the U.S. are a crime against Iran. “The sanctions are apparently against Iran’s ruling system, but (in fact) they are against the Iranian people inside.” He said Iranians suffering under the sanctions affecting the economy inevitably would stand up against the ruling system.A sharp rise in subsidized gasoline prices led to four days of unrest in cities and towns across Iran in November, in which Amnesty International said more than 300 people were killed in clashes with police and security forces.Tehran has yet to release any official statistics about the scale of the unrest, though in June the government acknowledged that security forces shot and killed protesters. A lawmaker said 230 people were killed in the anti-government protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-would-benefit-from-talks-iran-s-supreme-leader-says-won-t-negotiate-with-us/story-eDXoIIORw86GsR94YokngI.html
31-07-2020||World||Judge bans lawyers from identifying Epstein abuse victims||The judge presiding over the criminal case against a British socialite charged with recruiting teenage girls for financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse said Friday that her attorneys are not permitted to publicly identify accusers even if they’ve spoken in a public forum.“Not all accusations or public statements are equal,” U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan wrote in her ruling in the case facing Ghislaine Maxwell.“Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than simply making a public statement ‘relating to’ Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in this case.”She said the women “still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be safeguarded.”Prosecutors had asked Nathan to block Maxwell’s lawyers from publicly identifying the women unless they identified themselves as participants in the criminal case. Otherwise, prosecutors said, the women may be harassed or intimidated and become reluctant to cooperate with the government.Nathan’s order came hours after newly unsealed court documents provided a fresh glimpse into a fierce civil court fight between Maxwell, who was Epstein’s former girlfriend, and one of the women who accused the couple of sexual abuse.The documents released late Thursday were from a now-settled defamation lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s alleged victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre.Giuffre claimed in the suit and other litigation that Maxwell recruited her in 2000 to be a sexual servant to Epstein. She said the couple subsequently pressured her into having sex with numerous rich or notable men, including Britain’s Prince Andrew, U.S. politicians, wealthy entrepreneurs, a famous scientist and fashion designer.Maxwell, and all of the accused men, have denied those allegations for years.Among the newly released documents were emails Maxwell and Epstein exchanged in January 2015, when Giuffre’s allegations were getting a new round of media attention.One email, sent from Epstein’s email address but written in Maxwell’s voice, appeared to be a draft statement or set of talking points for Maxwell to use in defending herself. It said she had been the target of “false allegations of impropriety and offensive behavior that I abhor and have never ever been party to.”Responding to a Maxwell email a few days later, Epstein wrote: “You have done nothing wrong and I (would) urge you to start acting like it.” He suggested she go outside and hold her head high, “not as an (escaping) convict.”Epstein killed himself last summer while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was recently arrested on federal charges that she recruited at least three girls, including one as young as 14, for Epstein to sexually abuse in the 1990s. Prosecutors said she also joined in the abuse.Maxwell is jailed awaiting trial in New York.Many of the documents unsealed by the court Thursday had been available publicly before.They included a deposition in which Giuffre described the alleged abuse, and also answered questions about errors she’d made previously in telling her story, including originally telling a court she was 15 when she met Epstein, when records showed she was at least a year older.Giuffre over the years has told her story to the FBI, but no charges were brought based on her allegations and she is not one of the three alleged victims in the current criminal case against Maxwell.Two documents that were not released as scheduled Thursday were depositions Maxwell gave in the civil lawsuit in 2016.U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska had ordered them released, but Maxwell’s lawyers appealed her ruling to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.Her lawyers said they should be blocked because she now faces criminal charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-bans-lawyers-from-identifying-epstein-abuse-victims/story-LoyvQUV2Vc3QsTS944Uc1O.html
31-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Labour MP Virendra Sharma leads campaign to save Heathrow jobs||Senior Labour MP Virendra Sharma and over 25 other MPs have written to UK’s chancellor Rishi Sunak to support airports such as Heathrow, where tens of thousands of employees face redundancy due to steep fall in business due to the coronavirus pandemic.Heathrow has historically employed a large number of Indian-origin people, who over the years took up residence in nearby London suburbs such as Southall. Many of them face job losses with the aviation industry suffering a major hit.Sharma, who is MP for Ealing Southall, said: “Thousands face being made redundant because of falls in revenue for many businesses and certain industries almost completely drying up. Aviation is one of the hardest hit, almost no long haul routes are open and passenger numbers are down to tiny fractions compared to the start of the year.”The MPs wrote to Sunak that airports in England and Wales are expected to pay business rates as though they are functioning normally. Airports in Scotland and Northern Ireland have received support from their local governments, but those in England and Wales have not had such relief.The MPs wrote to the chancellor: “Under the current system while a business such as Tesco which has seen growth during Covid-19 has received £585 million in business rate relief, our airports have seen not a penny”.“We call on you to provide support to all English and Welsh airports in line with that afforded by Scotland and Northern Ireland. This will allow airports to continue to employ people, pay other taxes and support the Covid recovery we all so badly need”.Passenger numbers have fallen by 99% in some cases and more than 100,000 in the industry are facing the risk of unemployment. The aviation industry lost nearly £2 billion in the four-month period between March and June, which is equivalent to around £15 million each day, Sharma noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-labour-mp-virendra-sharma-leads-campaign-to-save-heathrow-jobs/story-ckoEyo6pWcS2B8TK70WyBL.html

Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. China recently staked claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhutan at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council and opposed funding to the project. Pompeo, during a Congressional hearing on Thursday, told the members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that “the actions are entirely consistent with what they have been signalling to the world for decades you might even argue since 1989, but certainly since General Secretary Xi came to power”. The Secretary of State said China has the desire to expand its power and reach. “They talk about bringing socialism with Chinese characteristics to the world. Claims that they have now made for real estate in Bhutan, the incursion that took place in India, these are indicative of Chinese intentions, and they are testing, they are probing the world to see if we are going to stand up to their threats and their bullying,” Pompeo said. “I am more confident than I was even a year ago that the world is prepared to do that. There’s a lot more work to do, and we need to be serious about it,” said the top American diplomat. In his testimony, Pompeo told lawmakers that India has banned 106 Chinese applications that threatened its citizens’ privacy and security. “Our diplomatic efforts are working and momentum is building to mitigate the threats that the Chinese Communist Party presents. All 10 ASEAN nations have insisted that the South China Sea disputes be settled on the basis of international law, including UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). Japan led the G-7’s condemnation of China’s national security law targeting Hong Kong,” he said. The European Union condemned the law too and also declared China a systemic rival to us, he said. At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Secretary General Stoltenberg has called to make China a greater part of that alliance’s focus. “We led a multilateral effort to ensure that the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organisation elected a director from a country that cared about intellectual property. “Our QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) -- the US, Australia, India, and Japan -- has been reinvigorated. We’ve worked hard at this. Our diplomats have done wonderful work. I’m very proud of the progress we are making. In addition to these multilateral efforts, Department of Justice is cracking down on Chinese intellectual property threats,” he said. The US has sanctioned Chinese leaders for their treatment of Uyghur minorities in Xinjiang province, imposed export controls on companies that supported, and warned US businesses against using slave labour in their supply chains, he said. The US has terminated special treatment agreements with Hong Kong in response to the Communist Party of China’s actions to deny freedom to the people of Hong Kong, he said. “We closed our consulate in Houston because it was a den of spies,” Pompeo added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-aggression-in-ladakh-claims-in-bhutan-indicative-of-its-intentions-mike-pompeo/story-kKJ4WnqtTi6jOW7E61vmQK.html

Official daily data on Thursday showed 846 new positive tests in Britain - the highest number of daily infections since June 28. The ONS said that between July 20-26 there were an estimated 4,200 new cases per day in the community, or 0.78 new Covid-19 infections per 10,000 people, up from an estimated 2,800 new cases a day the previous week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infections-on-the-rise-in-england-survey-shows/story-jEan0amwNK28MHxOO7ljMK.html
31-07-2020||World||PM Boris halts lockdown ease after new cases; curbs return in England||Curbs were re-imposed in north England on Friday and Prime Minister Boris Johnson hit the brake on further easing lockdown measures from August 1 after new figures showed a surge in new cases, but ministers insisted it did not mean a “return to lockdown”.Restrictions have been progressively eased in the UK in recent weeks following drop in deaths and cases from the peak in April-May. For example, in April there were more than 3,000 coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, but the latest figure is 87.As part of the easing, the government was to allow some cricket matches, casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks, indoor performances and pilots of large crowds in sports venues and conference centres under Covid-secure conditions from Saturday.But Johnson announced in a briefing from Downing Street that these will not happen for at least another fortnight. Wedding receptions of up to 30 people will also not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place.Health officials announced a return of restrictions on people mixing with other households in north England, including the Greater Manchester area, Pendle, Hyndburn, Burnley, Rossendale, Blackburn with Darwen, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Leicester city,Muslim organisations criticised lack of adequate notice while re-imposing the restrictions before Eid celebrations.Johnson said: “At every point I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional – that it relies on continued progress against the virus, and that we would not hesitate to put on the brakes if required”.“With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. On Saturday 1 August, you’ll remember, we had hoped to reopen in England a number of higher risk settings that had remained closed”.“Today, I am afraid we are postponing these changes for at least a fortnight. That means that, until 15 August at the earliest”.The new figures from the Office for National Statistics showed an increase in the number of people in England testing positive on a nose-and-throat swab in recent weeks. The figures show that about 1 in 1,500 people in homes in England are infected (roughly 36,000 people in total) with 4,200 new infections each day; the figures are up on last week, when it was estimated there were 2,800 new infections each day and that one in 2,000 people (28,000 total) were infected in homes in England.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “We’re constantly looking at the latest data on the spread of coronavirus, and unfortunately we’ve seen an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England”.“The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing. So from midnight tonight, people from different households will not be allowed to meet each other indoors in these areas”.“We take this action with a heavy heart, but we can see increasing rates of coronavirus across Europe and are determined to do whatever is necessary to keep people safe”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rising-covid-19-infections-in-uk-prompt-halt-to-lockdown-easing/story-qYbjJgogpSO8oGZxxVbVzM.html

Deaths in July rose at least 19% to over 152,000 total.The biggest increases were in Florida, with over 300,000 new cases in July, followed by California and Texas with about 250,000 each. Those three states also saw cases double in June. Cases also more than doubled in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, according to the tally.Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York had the lowest increases, with cases rising 7% or less.The United States shattered single day global records in July by reporting over 77,000 new cases on July 16. During the month, 33 out of 50 states had one-day record increases in cases and 19 set records for how much deaths rose in 24 hours, according to a Reuters tally.After a rapid acceleration in cases, the outbreak appears to be stabilizing in Arizona, Florida and Texas. Health officials are now concerned the outbreak has migrated to the Midwest from summer travel. The news that more states could be hard hit by the virus comes a day after the US gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, the nation’s worst economic performance since the Great Depression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-nearly-25-000-covid-19-deaths-in-july-cases-rise-by-1-8-mn/story-0mhv8UfmDDhUlintzBnJhK.html
31-07-2020||World||UK imposes new restrictions for 4 million amid coronavirus spread||Britain’s health secretary defended the government’s abrupt re-imposition of restrictions on social life across a swath of northern England on Friday, saying it was important to clamp down quickly on new outbreaks of Covid-19.Matt Hancock said that while it’s not the “sort of decision that anybody would want to take,’’ the government had no choice.“It is important to move quickly because the virus spreads and you’ve got to make sure you do everything you can do keep ahead of it,” he told Sky News.Under the new restrictions, people from different households in Greater Manchester, England’s second largest metropolitan area, have been asked to not meet indoors. The order also applies to the surrounding areas of Lancashire and West Yorkshire counties, affecting more than 4 million people in all.Hancock said data showed the coronavirus was being spread primarily between households.He told the BBC that “one of the terrible things about this virus is it thrives on the sort of social contact that makes life worth living.”Opposition politicians supported the latest move but criticized the government for announcing the restrictions in a tweet from Hancock late Thursday, just two hours before they came into force at midnight.Labour Party business spokeswoman Lucy Powell said the “bolt out of the blue” approach was “not the way to build confidence and to take people with you and maximize compliance with these steps.”The affected region has a large Muslim population, and the restrictions coincide with the Eid al-Adha holiday, where many people would normally gather in each other’s homes.Hancock said “my heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are.”“I’m very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams in fact, across the country who’ve been working so hard to find a way to have Covid-secure celebrations,” he said. “For instance, celebrating Eid in parks where there’s more space available and, of course, outdoors is safer than indoors.”The measures are the second batch of regional restrictions imposed to try to curb a second wave of the virus in Britain, following a stricter local lockdown in the central England city of Leicester. The government said restaurants, pubs, shops and hairdressers in Leicester could reopen from Monday, more than a month after they were closed amid a surge in cases.Britain’s official coronavirus death toll stands at just over 46,000, the third-highest total in the world after the United States and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-imposes-new-restrictions-for-4-million-amid-coronavirus-spread/story-k3qW1finNu08icPTbPPJQO.html
31-07-2020||World||WHO’s emergency panel reviews coronavirus pandemic||Six months after sounding its top alarm over the new coronavirus outbreak, the WHO’s emergency committee meets for a fourth time Friday to assess the raging pandemic.The World Health Organization grouping, comprising around 20 members and advisers, can propose new recommendations or amend existing ones.However, there is little doubt that the WHO will maintain the pandemic’s status as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) -- its highest level of alarm.At least 17 million people have caught the virus, more than 660,000 have died, and infections are still rampant.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has stressed that the UN health agency had declared a top-level public health emergency on January 30, when there were fewer than 100 cases and no deaths outside China, where the virus first emerged.The WHO has been sharply criticised for the length of time it took to declare a PHEIC.The United States, which accused the organisation of being too close to China, officially began its withdrawal from the organisation in July.The agency has also been criticised for recommendations deemed late or contradictory, in particular on wearing masks, or the modes of transmission of the virus.The WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said Thursday that the organisation had reacted immediately to the first signs of the pandemic, mobilising its forces to act and inform.Alongside her, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan said he had been surprised by how slowly some countries reacted.“We did focus in the early days of this crisis on really driving our technical and operational assistance to countries that we would traditionally feel that need that assistance,” he said.“If I could go back and change anything, I think we would have also been better served to be offering that operational and technical assistance to countries where I think we made some assumptions about capacities that existed,” he said.cf/rjm/ach||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-s-emergency-panel-reviews-coronavirus-pandemic/story-2OhkuQ8W6Jxi0oGrmvOX8M.html

The United States has signed a similar deal with Pfizer and BioNtech for 100 million doses for nearly $2 billion, which amounts to a $39 price tag for what is likely to be a two dose treatment course.There is no current vaccine for Covid-19. The disease has claimed 670,000 lives and upended economies, and there are over 150 vaccines in various stages of development against the still fast-spreading virus. BioNTech and Pfizer on Monday began a large, late-stage trial of their vaccine candidate to demonstrate its efficacy.Daiichi Sankyo Co is in discussions to provide supplies of a potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford for use in Japan.Assuming clinical success of the vaccines, Pfizer and BioNtech said they are on track to seek regulatory review for the vaccine as early as October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-get-120-mn-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-biontech/story-CdXK0RB0CqpAJKdQfL8yPN.html

31-07-2020||World||Supreme leader says Iran won’t negotiate with US||Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Friday his country will not negotiate with the United States because America would only use talks for propaganda purposes.The Trump administration has said it is willing to talk with Iran “with no preconditions,” but that the U.S. will continue its campaign of pressure against the Islamic Republic.In a televise speech marking the Eid al-Adha holiday, Khamenei said President Donald Trump would benefit from talks, saying Trump wants to “use negotiations with us for propaganda like negotiations with North Korea.” Khamenei was referring to talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong un.Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear accord between Iran and Western powers in May 2018. Iran later responded by slowly abandoning nearly every aspect of the agreement, though it still allows U.N. inspectors access to its nuclear sites.Trump has maintained that the deal needs to be renegotiated because it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program or its involvement in regional conflicts. The other signatories to the nuclear deal — Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia — have been struggling to keep it alive.Khamenei said the U.S. wants Iran to give up its nuclear program, defense facilities and regional authority at the negotiating table.He said economic sanctions imposed on Iran by the U.S. are a crime against Iran. “The sanctions are apparently against Iran’s ruling system, but (in fact) they are against the Iranian people inside.” He said Iranians suffering under the sanctions affecting the economy inevitable would stand up against the ruling system.A sharp rise in subsidized gasoline prices led to four days of unrest in cities and towns across Iran in November, in which Amnesty International said more than 300 people were killed in clashes with police and security forces.Tehran has yet to release any official statistics about the scale of the unrest, though in June the government acknowledged that security forces shot and killed protesters. A lawmaker said 230 people were killed in the anti-government protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-leader-says-iran-won-t-negotiate-with-us/story-ITdDorrWvRywrl8Nmllw3I.html
31-07-2020||World||400 Taliban prisoners to remain in custody, says Afghan president||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani dashed hopes Friday for a start to negotiations with Taliban insurgents, announcing the final 400 Taliban prisoners whose release is a prerequisite to start talks, will remain jailed. The announcement frustrates U.S. efforts to find an end to Afghanistan’s years of relentless war.Addressing the nation on the Muslim holy day of Eid ul Adha, Ghani said the 400 Taliban are convicted of crimes he has no authority to forgive. Instead, he will call a loya jirga — or traditional grand council of elders — to decide whether they should go free. He said the council would meet “shortly.”Ghani’s announcement was certain to delay the start of negotiations between the warring sides and frustrate Washington’s efforts to bring an early end to hostilities, even as they scale down their presence in Afghanistan.It also comes at the start of a three-day cease-fire announced by the Taliban for the Eid holidays.The prisoner releases were part of a deal the United States signed in February with the Taliban aimed at ending Afghanistan’s endless wars and sending U.S. troops home after nearly 20 years in Afghanistan, ending America’s longest war.That deal, touted at the time as Afghanistan’s best chance at peace in four decades, called for the Afghan government to free 5,000 Taliban held in jails across the country and the Taliban to free 1,000 government and military personnel. The releases were to be a sign of good will and a prerequisite to the start of negotiations between the warring sides.On Thursday, the Taliban concluded the release of the 1,000 they were holding, according to Taliban’s political spokesman Suhail Shaheen. He also said the insurgent group was ready to hold talks with Kabul’s political leadership within a week if the remaining Taliban still in jails in Afghanistan were freed.But Shaheen told The Associated Press the Taliban would not accept substitutes to the 5,000 Taliban on the list agreed upon during the one-and-a-half years of negotiations with Washington.Ghani in his speech said his government would free 500 Taliban who are not on the list saying it was a gesture of good will.In response to Ghani’s announcement, Shaheen called his administration “an obstacle to peace.”Shaheen told The Associated Press the Taliban freed 1,005 government personnel, militia members, military personnel and police. The last of the prisoners was freed Thursday.“We freed all of them as a good will gesture so that they may pass their Eid days with their families and also we announced the cease-fire in order to create a conducive atmosphere for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations,” Shaheen said. “But on the other hand the head of the Kabul administration, instead of removing hurdles in the way of peace and intra-Afghan negotiations, is creating ... hurdles and obstacles.”The U.N. had expressed hopes for a start to negotiations within weeks, suggesting they may have begun in July, and called on both sides not to squander an opportunity at peace.The U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Thursday issued a statement at the end of Khalilzad’s round of meetings with Afghan leaders in the capital repeating a call for an end to fighting and bloodshed and urged both sides to “seize this historic opportunity for peace.A meeting of the loya jirga would require weeks to collect elders from throughout the country and it wasn’t clear how they would be chosen or whether Ghani’s political opponent and the current head of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdulllah Abdullah supported the move.Abdullah was tasked with overseeing the peace talks with the Taliban as part of a power sharing deal with Ghani earlier this year following disputed presidential election results.There was no immediate comment from Abdullah to Ghani’s refusal to release the remaining Taliban prisoners._____Gannon reported from Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/400-taliban-prisoners-to-remain-in-custody-says-afghan-president/story-6eCPTV1SqiMn4DpxEh6WcM.html

31-07-2020||World||Final days of hajj and Eid festival impacted by coronavirus||Small groups of pilgrims performed one of the final rites of the Islamic hajj on Friday as Muslims worldwide marked the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday amid a global pandemic that has impacted nearly every aspect of this year’s pilgrimage and celebrations.The last days of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia coincide with the four-day Eid al-Adha, or “Feast of Sacrifice,” in which Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.The pandemic has pushed millions of people around the world closer to the brink of poverty, making it harder for many to fulfill the religious tradition of purchasing livestock.In Somalia, the price of meat has slightly increased. Abdishakur Dahir, a civil servant in Mogadishu, said that for the first time he won’t be able to afford goat for Eid because of the impact of the virus on work.“I could hardly buy food for my family,” Dahir said. “We are just surviving for now. Life is getting tougher by the day.”In some parts of West Africa, the price for a ram has doubled. Livestock sellers, used to doing brisk business in the days before the holiday, say sales have dwindled and those who are buying can’t afford much.“The situation is really complicated by the coronavirus, it’s a tough market,” Oumar Maiga, a livestock trader in Ivory Coast said. “We are in a situation we’ve never seen in other years.”The hajj pilgrimage has also been drastically impacted by the virus. Last year, some 2.5 million pilgrims took part, but this year as few as 1,000 pilgrims already residing in Saudi Arabia were allowed to preform the hajj.The Saudi Health Ministry said there have been no cases of the Covid-19 illness among this year’s pilgrims. The government took numerous precautions, including testing pilgrims for the virus, monitoring their movement with electronic wristbands and requiring them to quarantine before and after the hajj. Pilgrims were selected after applying through an online portal, and all had to be between the ages of 20 and 50 years-old.Just after dawn on Friday, small groups of pilgrims — masked and physically distancing — made their way toward the massive multi-story Jamarat Complex in the Saudi valley area of Mina. There, the pilgrims cast pebbles at three large columns. It is here where Muslims believe the devil tried to talk the Prophet Ibrahim, or Abraham, out of submitting to God’s will.Muslims commemorate the prophet Ibrahim’s test of faith by slaughtering livestock and animals and distributing the meat to the poor.During the last days of hajj, male pilgrims shave their heads and remove the terrycloth white garments worn during the pilgrimage. Women cut off a small lock of hair in a sign of spiritual rebirth and renewal.The hajj, both physically and spiritually demanding, intends to bring about greater humility and unity among Muslims. It is required of all Muslims to perform once in a lifetime.Sheikh Abdullah al-Manea, member of the Supreme Council of Senior Scholars of Saudi Arabia, used the hajj sermon Friday to praise the kingdom’s leadership for their “wise decision” to limit the number of pilgrims and protect human life.“We thank the positive role of Muslims around the world that have complied with the regulations of the country to protect them from the spread of this virus, which leads to the protection of Mecca and Medina,” the sheikh said.Around the world, Muslims gathered with relatives or remained at home to mark the start of Eid.In the Iraqi capital Baghdad, streets were largely empty due to a 10-day lockdown imposed by authorities to prevent further spread of the virus. Eid prayers in mosques were canceled.“We had hoped that the curfew would be lifted during the Eid period ... we were surprised that the lockdown period included the Eid holiday and more,” said Marwan Madhat, a Baghdad cafe owner. “This will cause losses.”Kosovo and the United Arab Emirates have also closed mosques to limit the spread of the virus.In Lebanon, Muslim worshipers prayed in mosques under tight security, despite a partial lockdown imposed Thursday that will continue through Aug. 10. Worshipers at the Mohammad al-Amin Mosque in the capital, Beirut, spilled onto the street outside to maintain social distancing rules.In Indonesia, home to the world’s largest population of Muslims, people were allowed to attend Eid prayers in mosques under strict health guidelines, including that they bring their own prayer mats and pray several feet apart from one another. Worshipers must wear masks and are not allowed to shake hands or hug.Authorities in Indonesia also ordered that meat be delivered door-to-door to the poor to avoid long lines.“This outbreak has not only changed our tradition entirely, but has also made more and more people fall into poverty,” said Agus Supriatna, an Indonesian factory worker who was laid off this year because of the pandemic.Muslim leaders in Albania and Kosovo called on people “to be careful” in their festivities to avoid transmission of the virus, including limiting family visits.A few days ahead of Eid, Alioune Ndong in Senegal said he did not know how he’d come up with the money for his family’s feast He called on Senegal’s government to help struggling families like his.“Covid-19 has drained my money,” said Ndong, a tailor based in the town of Mbour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/final-days-of-hajj-and-eid-festival-impacted-by-coronavirus/story-mwOWZaLf09XbI92NfUGSbJ.html
31-07-2020||World||France, Italy, Spain see startling coronavirus hits to economies||France, Italy and Spain reported precipitous contractions Friday for their coronavirus-battered economies, with the pandemic wiping out years of growth in a matter of weeks as the lockdowns closed shops, factories, and restaurants.The Spanish economy shrank by 18.5% in the April-June period from the previous quarter, the French economy nearly 14% and Italy 12.4%.The Spanish contraction was by far the sharpest slump since the country’s national statistics agency began collecting data. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain’s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.Spain in mid-March went into a more than three-month lockdown, bringing much economic activity to a halt, as Covid-19 cases and deaths surged. The lockdown ended June 21.In France, the startling plunge of 13.8% in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction in France’s worsening recession. The pain has been so damaging to jobs and industries that the government is talking down the possibility of another nationwide lockdown as infections tick upward again.France’s economy was already shrinking in the last quarter of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit with full force. For France and other major economies, it caused a head-spinning decline.“All the growth in GDP seen in the 2010-2019 decade has been wiped out in five months,” said Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services International. In Italy’s case, economists said it wiped out about 30 years of growth.As lockdowns have eased and many businesses reopened, there are hopes the recession will be short-lived, though an uptick in contagions in many countries remains a risk.France is faring worse than Germany, Europe’s largest economy, which on Thursday reported a 10.1% plunge in GDP during the April-June period as its exports and business investment collapsed. Germany’s drop was also the biggest since quarterly growth figures began being compiled in 1970, the official statistics agency said.In March, the health crisis prompted the French government to introduce what was one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, halting much activity in the second-largest economy of the countries that use the euro currency. In France, Covid-19 has now killed more than 30,000 people and infected more than 186,000.In releasing its morose figures Friday, Insee said the economic low point was in April, when only workers deemed essential were able to leave their homes. Activity started to pick up again from May as authorities began to ease lockdown restrictions, Insee added.Friday’s figures showed that the construction industry was among the hardest-hit in France, as worksites stood idle, with laborers forced to stay home.Locked-down families, many surviving on government handouts and job-preservation schemes, tightened their purse strings amid fears for jobs but also because shops were closed. Household spending plunged 11% in April-June, following a drop of 5.8% in the first quarter.Trade was also battered, as global lockdowns grounded flights, closed borders and factories, and threw transport into disarray. French imports, already down by 5.5% in the first quarter, shrank further in the second quarter, down 17.3%.The damage to exports was even more pronounced, down by a whopping 25.5% in the second quarter after retreating by 6.1% in the first quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-italy-spain-see-startling-virus-hits-to-economies/story-K4lYLSOTELcbhnJo8zNRMI.html

It was the largest drop on record.Spain, which suffered a severe virus outbreak that devastated its tourism industry, was the hardest hit with a 18.5% drop. Italy and Portugal were also hard hit but no country escaped. It was the biggest decline since the records started in 1995.The decline in Europe compares to a 9.5% quarter on quarter decline for the United States.European governments are countering the downturn with massive stimulus measures at the national and European Union level. EU leaders have agreed on a 750 billion-euro recovery fund backed by common borrowing to support the recovery from 2021.National governments have stepped in with loans to keep businesses afloat and wage support programs that pay workers salaries while they are furloughed. The European Central Bank is pumping 1.35 trillion euros in newly printed money into the economy through bond purchases, a step which helps keep borrowing costs low.The Spanish contraction was by far the sharpest slump since the country’s national statistics agency began collecting data. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain’s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.In France, the startling plunge of 13.8% in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown.

Last week, Australia launched a note with UN Secretary-General refusing China’s unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea,” he had told news agency ANI.The Australian government has rejected any claims by China that are not consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).In a veiled criticism of China, the envoy said Australia opposes any attempts to unilaterally alter status-quo as it only increases tension and instability.The US and Australian leaders had held a meeting in Washington on Tuesday where they expressed serious concerns about China’s “recent coercive and destabilising actions across the Indo-Pacific”.The meeting was held between US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defence secretary Mark Esper and their Australian counterparts Marise Payne and Linda Reynolds. They discussed about strengthening partnerships in the Indian Ocean region and discussed the key role India will play in defence cooperation.On Thursday, Pompeo said that US efforts to lead an “international awakening” against the Chinese government is working and the “tide is turning” as a result.

Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Vietnam’s health ministry on Friday reported 45 new infections in the city, marking the Southeast Asian country’s biggest single-day jump in cases since the beginning of the pandemic.The capital, Hanoi, has started mass coronavirus testing, shut bars and nightclubs, banned large gatherings, and urged tens of thousands of domestic travellers to report to authorities as the country scrambled to contain the fresh spread of the virus.Patient 428, a 70-year-old man who appears to have contracted the disease in Danang, died on Friday, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The 45 latest patients, aged between 27 and 87, are linked to three hospitals and two clinics in Danang, according to the health ministry, which overnight sent a special task force of health experts, along with more than 1,000 health workers, to the city to help handle the deteriorating situation there.The task force includes 65 health experts who had previously helped fight coronavirus at other epicentres in Vietnam, the ministry said. Authorities in Danang are building a 1,000-bed field hospital to ease the burden on the city’s hospitals, four of which are under lockdown following a series of cases there. The newly confirmed infections in Danang have lifted the total number of cases in Vietnam to 509.Some experts say Vietnam could be paying for complacency after its initial success stopping the virus, with normal service quickly resuming, facemasks used less and domestic travel activity surging. Danang had been inundated with visitors taking advantage of promotions to revitalise a tourism sector hurt by border closures and international flight bans designed to stamp out the virus.The current wave is traced to Danang, but the source is unclear.

Also Read: In China’s troop movements in Ladakh’s depth areas, a hint about its real planOver 300,000 scientists, engineers and technicians from more than 400 domestic institutes, universities and enterprises have been involved in Beidou’s development since the 1990s, official media reported Friday after President Xi Jinping commissioned the system at a ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People.The Communist Party of China (CPC)-ruled government approved the research and development of a space-based navigation and positioning system, aiming to mitigate the country’s heavy reliance on foreign networks – the US GPS system – in February 1994.The system was named “Beidou” after the Chinese term for the Big Dipper constellation.“By the end of 2019 in the Chinese mainland, more than 6.5 million road vehicles, 40,000 postal and express delivery vehicles, 80,000 buses in 36 major cities, 3,200 inland navigation facilities, and 2,900 marine navigation facilities had adopted the BDS, forming the world’s largest dynamic monitoring system for road vehicles,” the tabloid Global Times said in a report on Friday.Also Read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomIn late June, the final satellite to complete Beidou’s third-generation network was lifted by a Long March 3B carrier rocket at the Xichang satellite launch centre in the southwestern province of Sichuan province to be placed into a geostationary orbit about 36000 km above the Earth.According to state media, it was the 30th satellite to be launched as part of the third-generation series – 59 have been launched in all since the 2000s.“The civil signal from Beidou is no better than GPS or Galileo,” said Alexandra Stickings, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies, a Britain-based think-tank told Reuters news agency in June.India is developing its own navigation satellite system called the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System.“IRNSS is an independent regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500 km from its boundary, which is its primary service area,” the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) says on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-its-beidou-system-now-fully-operational-to-challenge-us-s-gps/story-IfrxT8gHy0QUgBFHNX5F3H.html
31-07-2020||World||China logs 127 Covid-19 cases in last 24 hours, highest since early March||China on Friday reported 127 new coronavirus cases on the mainland for July 30, up from 105 the previous day, and the highest daily number since March 5 for locally transmitted cases of Covid-19 on the mainland.Like for the last several days, the highest number of cases among the 124 locally transmitted ones – 112 -- were from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), the northwestern province where China is carrying out controversial de-radicalisation programmes among the mostly Uyghur minority community including putting them in high-security camps.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Of the 112 patients, one was in the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and the other 111 were in the regional capital Urumqi, 30 of whom were previously asymptomatic cases, the NHC said.The remaining 11 cases were reported from Liaoning province, located in the northeast of China, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily report on Friday.Beijing is yet to share information about how the new infection cluster spread in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, which now has 526 cases.The NHC was quick to link the new outbreak in Liaoning’s Dalian city to a seafood company like it had done in Beijing when new cases broke out in June.Also read: What can explain the mystery of China’s Covid-19 numbers?The coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December where it was also linked to a seafood and meat market.Urumqi has tightened the management of personnel flow after clusters of new Covid-19 infections were reported.In principle, locals are required not to leave the city, if it is not necessary, official media reported.Non-locals, who have stayed in Urumqi for at least 14 days from July 17 onwards, must carry green health codes and proof of both negative results of a nucleic acid test and an antibody test, conducted within seven days before leaving the city, official media said.The city of Dalian, meanwhile, will undertake a second round of testing on residents in high-risk areas, following the resurgence of Covid-19.The city as of Thursday has 68 locally transmitted cases of the infection.More than 4 million samples have been collected for nucleic acid testing, health authorities said.“A total of 21,999 medics have been mobilised to conduct nucleic acid tests at 4,297 testing sites across the city, with 4.09 million samples collected by midnight Wednesday,” Zhao Lian, deputy director of the municipal health commission, said.As of Thursday, China has reported a total of 84,292 coronavirus cases and 4634 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-logs-127-covid-19-cases-in-last-24-hours-highest-since-early-march/story-LqtI2CE8mUnL6JRv86xNLL.html
31-07-2020||World||China-backed hackers targeted Covid-19 vaccine firm Moderna: US official||Chinese government-linked hackers targeted biotech company Moderna Inc, a leading US-based coronavirus vaccine research developer, earlier this year in a bid to steal valuable data, according to a US security official tracking Chinese hacking activity.Last week, the US Justice Department made public an indictment of two Chinese nationals accused of spying on the United States, including three unnamed US-based targets involved in medical research to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The indictment states the Chinese hackers “conducted reconnaissance” against the computer network of a Massachusetts biotech firm known to be working on a coronavirus vaccine in January. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Moderna, which is based in Massachusetts and announced its Covid-19 vaccine candidate in January, confirmed to Reuters that the company had been in contact with the FBI and was made aware of the suspected “information reconnaissance activities” by the hacking group mentioned in last week’s indictment. Reconnaissance activities can include a wide range of actions, including probing public websites for vulnerabilities to scouting out important accounts after entering a network, cybersecurity experts say. “Moderna remains highly vigilant to potential cybersecurity threats, maintaining an internal team, external support services and good working relationships with outside authorities to continuously assess threats and protect our valuable information,” spokesman Ray Jordan said, declining to provide further detail. The US security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide further details. The FBI and the US Department of Health and Human Services declined to disclose the identities of companies targeted by Chinese hackers. Moderna’s vaccine candidate is one of the earliest and biggest bets by the Trump administration to fight the pandemic. The federal government is supporting development of the company’s vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and helping Moderna launch a clinical trial of up to 30,000 people beginning this month. China is also racing to develop a vaccine, bringing together its state, military and private sectors to combat a disease that has killed over 660,000 people worldwide. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage A July 7 indictment released last week alleges that the two Chinese hackers, Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, conducted a decade-long hacking spree that most recently included the targeting of Covid-19 medical research groups.Prosecutors said Li and Dong acted as contractors for China’s Ministry of State Security, a state intelligence agency. Messages left with several accounts registered under Li’s digital alias, oro0lxy, were not returned. Contact details for Dong were not available.The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred Reuters to recent Chinese Foreign Ministry comments that said: “China has long been a major victim of cyber thefts and attacks” and its officials “firmly oppose and fight” such activities. The Chinese government has consistently denied any role in hacking incidents across the globe. The embassy spokesperson did not address specific questions sent via email. The two other unnamed medical research companies mentioned in the Justice Department indictment are described as biotech companies based in California and Maryland. Prosecutors said the hackers “searched for vulnerabilities” and “conducted reconnaissance” against them. The court filing describes the California firm as working on antiviral drug research and suggested the Maryland company had publicly announced efforts to develop a vaccine in January. Two companies that could match those descriptions: Gilead Sciences Inc and Novavax Inc .Gilead spokesperson Chris Ridley said the firm does not comment on cybersecurity matters. Novavax would not comment on specific cyber security activities but said: “Our cyber security team has been alerted to the alleged foreign threats identified in the news.” A security consultant familiar with multiple hacking investigations involving premier biotech firms over the last year said Chinese hacking groups believed to be broadly associated with China’s Ministry of State security are one of the primary forces targeting Covid-19 research, globally. This matches the description of the indicted hackers, as MSS contractors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-backed-hackers-targeted-covid-19-vaccine-firm-moderna-us-official/story-3M3o542iVAZpthBtdBSCUP.html
31-07-2020||World||Donald Trump may be only world leader to attend UN General Assembly session in person||US President Donald Trump is likely to travel to New York to attend the annual UN General Assembly session in September, the only world leader to address this year’s virtual high-level week in person, the US envoy to the UN said. “We’re hoping that President Trump will actually be speaking in person in the General Assembly. He will be the only world leader to be speaking in person,” US ambassador Kelly Craft said Thursday at a virtual briefing.Craft added that with the UN commemorating its 75th anniversary this year, “that makes it even more special that we really take the virtual and amplify it to be able to celebrate the 75th and obviously we’re going to be focused on human rights issues, on transparency, accountability because anytime during COVID where the American taxpayers have really stepped up on a personal level, it’s now.” For the first time in the UN’s 75-year history, the annual General Assembly session will be held virtually and Heads of state and government will not be physically attending the annual gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic.World leaders will submit pre-recorded video statements for the high-level week, the 193-member organisation had decided last week.US is the host country of the United Nations and there is a possibility that Trump could travel to New York to address the General Debate of the 75th session of the Assembly on September 22. The US is traditionally the second speaker at the debate after Brazil. This would be Trump’s final address to the General Assembly of the first term of his presidency before the US heads into elections in November and Trump could use the UN platform to highlight his foreign policy achievements while also tout his campaign agenda. In taking the decision for a virtual UNGA, the General Assembly had noted “with concern” the situation regarding the coronavirus pandemic and the “limitations recommended on meetings within the United Nations premises as precautionary measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.” The new format will mean that it will be for the first time in the world organisation’s 75-year history that Heads of State and Government and Ministers will not gather here for the high-level week that annually brings thousands of diplomats, government officials, civil society members and media persons from around the world to New York City.Addressing a virtual press conference in June, General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande had said that world leaders cannot come to New York for the annual UN General Assembly session in September because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“World leaders cannot come to New York because they cannot come as single individuals. A president doesn’t travel alone. We don’t expect therefore to have presidents here,” Muhammad-Bande had said.Farhan Haq, Deputy Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General, responding to a question on Trump addressing the UNGA session in person, said that the UN Secretariat will be in touch, through the Office of the President of the General Assembly, with the member states on their representation.“When it comes to it, we have made clear what the conditions in the building are, what the need is for a scaled back ceremony….the member states are aware that they have different options, including recorded messages, or in some cases, appearances. We trust and expect that all member states will abide by the need to keep the numbers low, and we’ll see what they do in terms of their preparations.” Haq added that the UN has made clear to all member states the need to keep the delegations’ number low during the high-level week. “There is an absolute upper limit of how many people we can safely accommodate, and all Member States have been made aware of that. How they will adjust is a matter ultimately of discussion between the Member States and the United Nations.” Along with the General Debate and 75th anniversary commemoration, key high-level sessions will also be held virtually at the UN.The Summit on Biodiversity will be held on September 30, high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women on October 1 and the high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons on October 2. Member states will submit their pre-recorded video statements for these high-level meetings as well.Each country would be encouraged to observe the time limit of 15 minutes in the General Debate that would include remarks in the Assembly Hall to introduce the pre-recorded video and the video itself.Muhammad-Bande has told Member States that with a view to limit the footprint and the number of people into the UN building, physical access and presence will be limited to one or, if the situation allows, two delegates in the General Assembly hall. Further, he said member states “are encouraged to move all side events to virtual platforms to limit the footprint and number of people in the UN building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-may-be-only-world-leader-to-attend-un-general-assembly-session-in-person/story-Xea344PDgZuKQVsTfxHciO.html
31-07-2020||World||India praises Canada for disavowing SFJ’s Punjab Referendum||India praised Canada for disavowing the Punjab Referendum 2020 organised by the secessionist group Sikhs for Justice or SFJ. India believes that in clearly disavowing the referendum the Canadian Government has set a precedent that should be emulated by other countries, particularly in the West.“Canada taking a lead is good start,” a senior official told the Hindustan Times, adding that the position was that this stand now “put pressure” on others to follow suit.Also Read: Faces of terror: Why India banned 9 Khalistan-linked terrorists in 5 countriesA spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, the country’s Foreign Ministry, stated in an email that “Canada respects the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of India, and the Government of Canada will not recognize the referendum.”Following this statement from Ottawa, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had also voiced the hope that other nations would also follow Canada’s example and reject the referendum.In effect, India is hopeful that a similar stance will emerge from other nations in the Five Eyes group, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. SFJ has also been active in other European nations like Germany and Italy.The Canadian position came even as contacts between New Delhi and Ottawa have increased since Trudeau came back to power in October 2019. Since then, he has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G7 summit and has recently spoken on the phone twice. The two foreign ministers, S Jaishankar and François-Philippe Champagne have been frequently in touch, most recently last week over the Covid-19 pandemic and coordinated efforts to tackle the outbreak. Similarly, Canada’s Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Mary Ng has been in regular communication with Commerce, Industry and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal. They spoke again on Wednesday on several issues including ongoing negotiations related to the Canada-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the Canada-India Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement.SFJ has already attacked the Justin Trudeau’s government for the stand and asserted it will go ahead with its plans in Canada and elsewhere.Its general counsel Gurpatwant Pannun in a statement said, “Canadian Sikhs will not let the Trudeau regime trump their right to peacefully express and propagate the political opinion of Khalistan by holding Referendum 2020. Trudeau government should find some other way to please India.”The Canadian statement appears to have rattled pro-Khalistani groups in Canada. A statement from the Shiromani Akali Dal Amritsar Canada attacked Hindustan Times’ reporting on this matter and said that the Indian Government has “admittedly started their phase 2 of its anti-referendum campaign to ensure any foreign Government do not recognize the results of the Sikh Referendum 2020”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-recognize-punjab-2020-referendum-india-praises-canada-s-bold-move/story-4LRpyrv5o38ygDcwrv9uGJ.html
31-07-2020||World||First-ever EU cyber sanctions hit Russian, Chinese, North Koreans||The European Union has imposed its first-ever sanctions over cyberattacks, slapping them on alleged Russian military agents, Chinese cyber spies and organisations including a North Korean firm.The six people and three groups hit with sanctions include Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency. EU headquarters blamed them in a statement for the 2017 “WannaCry” ransomware and “NotPetya” malware attacks and the “Cloud Hopper” cyberespionage campaign.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Thursday the sanctions “are a travel ban and asset freeze to natural persons and an asset freeze to entities or bodies. It is also prohibited to directly or indirectly make funds available to listed individuals and entities or bodies.” Four Russians identified as GRU members were accused of trying to hack the Wi-Fi network of the Netherlands-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, which has probed the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The 2018 attack was foiled by Dutch authorities.The GRU was also sanctioned for NotPetya, which targeted companies that do business with Ukraine and caused billions of dollars in damage globally, and cyberattacks on Ukraine’s power grid in 2015 and 2016.The two sanctioned Chinese nationals were accused of involvement in “Operation Cloud Hopper,” which the EU said hit companies on six continents, including Europe, through cloud services providers and “gained unauthorised access to commercially sensitive data, resulting in significant economic loss.” One of the two, Zhang Shilong, was indicted in the United States in December 2018 for his alleged role in the operation, which US authorities said at the time targeted a wide array of industries including aviation, biotechnology and satellite and maritime technology. Also sanctioned by the EU was the Chinese company Huaying Haitai, listed as Zhang’s employer.The North Korean firm sanctioned is Chosun Expo, which the EU said backed cyberattacks including WannaCry, the hacking of Sony Pictures and cyber robberies of Vietnamese and Bangladeshi banks.A leading US cybersecurity expert noted that the attempt to hack the chemical weapons group involved a rare physical visit to its organization’s facilities in The Hague, Netherlands.“The consistent use of physical human intelligence teams to supplement its intrusion efforts makes the GRU a particularly effective adversary,” said John Hultquist, director of threat intelligence at FireEye.“Sanctions may be particularly effective for disrupting this activity as they may hinder the free movement of this unit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-ever-eu-cyber-sanctions-hit-russian-chinese-north-koreans/story-uZCG87yfs8dZHNBifZQrJK.html
31-07-2020||World||Twitter says hackers broke into system by calling employees||Twitter Inc. revealed additional details about the highest-profile security breach in its history, confirming that hackers gained entry to its computer systems by reaching out to employees on their phones.In an update on its internal investigation, Twitter said the July 15 incident targeted employees using a phone spear phishing attack. By misleading workers and exploiting human vulnerabilities, the hackers were able to obtain credentials and access 130 accounts.Forty-five of those put out tweets -- including from the accounts of Barack Obama, Elon Musk and Bill Gates touting a Bitcoin scam -- and seven of them had their full set of Twitter data downloaded. Twitter had previously indicated that eight accounts had their data downloaded.Read more: Twitter’s Security Woes Included Broad Access to User AccountsBloomberg News reported this week that the attackers contacted at least one Twitter employee over the phone in an attempt to gain access to user-support tools. The company required employees to take an online security training course last week, which covered a number of phishing techniques including phone calls, people familiar with the matter said.The company continues to operate with “significantly limited access” to its internal tools and systems as a precautionary measure two weeks after the hack, the company said.“Until we can safely resume normal operations, our response times to some support needs and reports will be slower,” the company said in a series of update tweets. “We’re accelerating several of our pre-existing security workstreams and improvements to our tools.”As the US president’s go-to social media platform, Twitter bears additional responsibility for ensuring that its security protocols are robust. While Donald Trump’s account was not among those compromised in the July hack, his Democratic opponent in the upcoming November election, former vice president Joe Biden, was.Twitter’s latest communication acknowledges “how important each person on our team is in protecting our service. We take that responsibility seriously and everyone at Twitter is committed to keeping your information safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-says-hackers-broke-into-system-by-calling-employees/story-iHcori0G4lmeGQVcfOCpEN.html
31-07-2020||World||UK scientists to immunize hundreds with experimental Covid-19 vaccine||Scientists at Imperial College London say they are immunizing hundreds of people with an experimental coronavirus vaccine in an early trial after seeing no worrying safety problems in a small number vaccinated so far. Dr Robin Shattock, a professor at the college, told The Associated Press that he and colleagues had just finished a very slow and arduous process of testing the vaccine at a low dose in the initial participants and would now expand the trial to about 300 people, including some over age 75.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “It’s well tolerated. There aren’t any side effects,” he said, adding it was still very early in the study. Shattock, who is leading the vaccine research at Imperial, said he hopes to have enough safety data to start inoculating several thousand people in October.Since Covid-19 infections have dropped dramatically in Britain, making it difficult to determine whether or not the vaccine works, Shattock said he and his colleagues are also looking to test their vaccine elsewhere. “We’re looking very carefully at the pandemic, at the numbers where the hot spots are and talking to collaborators that have the facilities to do these kinds of studies,” he said. The Imperial vaccine uses synthetic strands of genetic code based on the virus. Once injected into a muscle, the body’s own cells are instructed to make copies of a spiky protein on the coronavirus. That should in turn trigger an immune response so the body can fight off any future Covid-19 infection. Earlier this week, the world’s biggest coronavirus vaccine study started in the United States, with the first of 30,000 planned volunteers getting immunized with shots created by the US National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain’s Oxford University, based on different vaccine technologies, began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. The World Health Organization has said multiple vaccine approaches are necessary for Covid-19, noting that the usual success rate for vaccine development is about 10 per cent. Shattock said there were numerous coronavirus vaccines now in clinical trials, and he predicted that at least some of them would prove to be effective. “We have 20 vaccines in clinical trials, (so) we can be pretty confident that at least two of those will work,” he said. “It really depends on how strong the immune response needs to be to provide protection.” Shattock said he was optimistic the Imperial vaccine would work, but must await the scientific data from the trial. “I’m just going to hold my breath and wait to see,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scientists-to-immunize-hundreds-with-experimental-covid-19-vaccine/story-TM2TTbJZkIh6o9elulzrvJ.html
31-07-2020||World||J&J starts human study of Covid-19 vaccine after promising monkey data||Johnson & Johnson on Thursday kicked off US human safety trials for its Covid-19 vaccine after releasing details of a study in monkeys that showed its best-performing vaccine candidate offered strong protection in a single dose.When exposed to the virus, six out of six animals who got the vaccine candidate were completely protected from lung disease and five out of six were protected from infection as measured by the presence of virus in nasal swabs, according to the study published in the journal Nature.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“This gives us confidence that we can test a single-shot vaccine in this epidemic and learn whether it has a protective effect in humans,” Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, told Reuters in a telephone interview.The drugmaker said it had started early-stage human trials in the United States and Belgium and would test its vaccine candidate in more than 1,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years, as well as adults aged 65 years and older.The US government is backing J&J’s vaccine effort with $456 million in funding as part of a spending spree aimed at speeding production of a vaccine to end the pandemic, which has infected millions and killed more than 660,000 people.Stoffels said prior tests of this type of vaccine in other diseases found that a second shot significantly increases protection. But in a pandemic a single-shot vaccine has a significant advantage, sidestepping a lot of the logistical issues involved in getting people to come back for their second dose.The company plans to take up the question of one or two doses in its phase 1 trial.Depending on those results, J&J plans to start large-scale, phase 3 testing with a single-shot regimen in the second half of September. Around the same time, the company will start a parallel phase 3 study testing a two-shot regimen of the vaccine, Stoffels said.“The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is exciting because it’s a single dose,” White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah Birx said in an interview with Fox News. Having one dose “show protection in monkeys like the other vaccines have shown with two doses does shorten the time period for development because your readout becomes 30 days quicker,” she said. J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26, or Ad26, to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, causing the body to mount an immune defense against the virus.In the monkey study, scientists from J&J and Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center studied seven different potential vaccines in 32 animals and compared the results to 20 control animals who got placebo shots.Six weeks later, all of the animals were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All 20 animals that received the placebo developed high levels of virus in their lungs and nasal swabs. In the best-performing candidate, which J&J selected for human testing, none of the animals had virus in their lungs and only one showed low levels of virus in nasal swabs. Lab tests showed they all had developed antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus after a single shot.“This study shows that even just a single immunization with the Ad26 vaccine leads to neutralizing antibody responses and robust protection of monkeys against Covid-19,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Beth Israel Deaconness who led the research in collaboration with J&J.J&J shares were up nearly 2% at $149.93 before the market open on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/j-j-starts-human-study-of-covid-19-vaccine-after-promising-monkey-data/story-jKd3A4kXUt1pweY0us9q1I.html

We have had good data so far. We need to show the efficacy in the clinical programme, but so far, so good,” chief executive Pascal Soriot said on a media call on Thursday.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAstraZeneca, Britain’s most valuable listed company, has already reached deals with countries to make more than 2 billion doses of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine and says it could be approved by the end of this year.The Anglo-Swedish company recently completed agreements with the United States, Britain, the European Union, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a public-private-charitable partnership based in Norway, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, another public-private partnership headquartered in Geneva.The deals cover 700 million doses.Also Read: Herd immunity far away, Covid-19 vaccine only option: Health ministryIt has also reached a licensing agreement with Serum Institute of India to supply low-and-middle-income countries and agreements with R-Pharm in Russia and SK Biopharmaceuticals Co Ltd in the Republic of Korea “to manufacture and export for other global markets.”Serum Institute, the Pune-based largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, has said it would start making the vaccine before the last order was received so that it could be ready in sufficient quantities by the time all permissions were granted.Soriot said the company was on track to make 2 billion doses of the vaccine at a few dollars a dose. It also concluded three more deals for distribution - should the vaccine work. The cost of making the vaccine is expected to be offset by funding from the governments.AstraZeneca also repeated its promise not to profit from the Covid-19 vaccine during the pandemic as it reported it was on track with late-stage trials for the treatment.Also Read: Deliberations being held to identify first group of people to receive Covid-19 vaccine: Officials“We felt, there (is) a time in life when companies need to step up and make a contribution. This is the kind of time in history when humanity, humankind is really threatened as a whole,’’ Soriot said, adding that a vaccine needed to be accessible to as many people as possible.Such promises were boosted by strong sales across its range of treatments during the lockdown.Sales jumped by 14% to $12.6 billion in the first six months of 2020 and were helped by strong trading in new medicines, as well as cancer and respiratory medication.Soriot said he remained cautious amid the uncertainty of the pandemic despite the good earnings. “If we have learned one thing with this virus, it is that it is unpredictable. And so we need to remain cautious,” he said. AstraZeneca also announced second quarter results that beat its sales and profit estimates, thanks to strong sales from a diverse product line-up.Also Read: Oxford vaccine shows protection against Covid-19 in monkeys: StudyAmong drugs with better-than-expected revenues, sales of respiratory drug Symbicort rose 12% to $653 million, about $90 million above consensus, while revenue from cancer drug Lynparza jumped 62% to $554 million.Newer drugs for diabetes, heart conditions and cancer, including its top-selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso, performed well in the quarter and AstraZeneca remains on track for a third consecutive year of growth.The company stuck by its 2020 outlook on Thursday and its shares were up about 3% at 88.6 pounds after product sales of $6.05 billion in the three months to June surpassed consensus of $6.01 billion. The figure excludes payments from tie-ups.Core earnings of 96 cents per share beat analysts’ expectation of 93 cents.

31-07-2020||World||‘Not in a position of conflict of interest’: Trudeau on WE Charity controversy||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asserted before the House of Commons Finance Committee that there was no conflict of interest involved in granting a nearly billion dollar contract to WE charity which had links to him and his family.Trudeau who appeared via videoconferencing before the committee said, “I was not in a position of conflict of interest,” as quoted by the outlet CBC News. In fact, he stressed that he had asked the public service, the Canadian bureaucrats dealing with the matter, to exercise due diligence because of the connections he personally had with the organisation WE Charity.Speaking in French, Trudeau told the Committee that he had “apologized because of the perception” of ties to his “family”. He said he “should have recused” himself from the Cabinet meeting where the decision was taken to give the contract to WE Charity. Trudeau appeared for about an hour-and-a-half for questioning by members of the Finance Committee and was followed by his Chief of Staff Katie Telford.The contract given to WE Charity was cancelled after furor erupted citing links between Trudeau, his family and WE Charity. His wife, mother and brother had been paid fees by the organisation several times.Trudeau denied knowledge of these activities. He said, “My mother and my brother are professionals in their own right who have engagements and have for many, many years, with many different organizations across the country, and I don’t have the details of their work experiences or expenses.”Trudeau also said he believed that the Canada Service Corps would be able to deliver the youth volunteership programme but was informed by the public service that it would not be able to scale up to deliver at that time.“In fact, they said if we wanted this program to happen, it could only be with WE Charity. The choice was not between providers. It was between going ahead with WE Charity to deliver the program or not going ahead with the program at all,” he added. The controversy has roiled Canadian politics in recent weeks and severely dented Trudeau’s popularity. He is also being investigated by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-in-a-position-of-conflict-of-interest-trudeau-on-we-charity-controversy/story-OGTYP7hEZCkuQ1B7DxN5VN.html

But I also don’t want to have wait for three months and then find out that the ballots were all missing and election doesn’t mean anything,” said the US President at a press conference.“Do I want to see a date change? No. But I don’t want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens,” Trump was quoted as saying by The Hill, referencing widespread mail-in voting.“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???” Trump had earlier said in a tweet.The US President, speaking of Covid-19 pandemic said this could have been stopped in China.“We can never ever forget the people whom we have lost. We will never forget what happened. This could have been stopped in China, they should have stopped it and they didn’t,” he said.The US President said the scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions.Trump while expressing grief over the passing away of Herman Cain, said: “Let me begin by expressing sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain. He was a very special person. Unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the ‘China virus’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-want-to-wait-for-3-months-and-then-find-out-ballots-were-missing-donald-trump/story-1F4E20h5Dey7DJmhwQR7sO.html

In retaliation, China ordered US to close its diplomatic facility in Chengdu.US State Department ordered China to close by Friday its consulate in Houston, Texas, over accusations that it engaged for years in massive illegal spying and influence operations in the US.The two countries have sparred over a range of issues in recent times -- China’s move to impose national security law in Hong Kong, its human rights violation in Xinjiang and territorial aggression in the South China Sea have all drawn fierce criticism from Washington.Terming China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as “central threat of our times”, Pompeo said: “Our vigorous diplomacy has helped lead an international awakening to the threat of the CCP. Senators, the tide is turning.”Also read: Pompeo cites LAC tension, says tide turning on ChinaThe US Secretary of State also talked of China’s move to impose draconian national security law in Hong Kong, which is said to be aimed at crushing dissent in the erstwhile British colony which saw massive protests last year.“In our hemisphere, Canada has stood firm against the Chinese Communist Party’s hostage-taking. Its three major telecom carriers have also banned untrusted vendors,” he said.“Belize and Haiti have denounced Beijing’s national security law targeting Hong Kong.

31-07-2020||World||Donald Trump, GOP suggest temporary fix for $600 jobless benefit||The White House and some of its Republican allies in the Senate are signalling they want to extend, at least temporarily, a $600-per-week expanded jobless benefit that has helped keep families and the economy afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic. The move looks to be too little, too late to prevent the lapse of the benefit officially on Friday. Republicans have been fighting to trim back the $600 jobless benefit in the next coronavirus package, but President Donald Trump and some Senate Republicans suggested they could accept keeping the full USD 600 benefit for now. Late-night talks were expected at the Capitol. “We want a temporary extension of enhanced unemployment benefits,” Trump said at the White House. “This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own.” He added: “It has to be substantial.” But Democrats have so far rejected a piecemeal approach, saying the next relief bill needs to move as a complete package. Before Trump spoke, top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell adjourned the chamber for the weekend while taking a procedural step that could allow voting on a potential compromise next week. Talks so far have yielded little progress. “I’m not very optimistic that we will have any kind of an agreement on a comprehensive bill in the near future,” said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. He said he even doubted a deal could be struck next week.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  Talks on the relief bill are at a standstill with few reasons for optimism despite sweeping agreement among Washington’s top power players that Congress must pass further relief in coming days and weeks. Trump is eager for another round of relief, and it’s also a priority for GOP allies like McConnell, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer. Democrats hold a strong negotiating hand, with Republicans badly divided over their own proposal. Raising the stakes, a bleak government report released Thursday said the economy shrank at a 33 per cent annualized rate in the second quarter of the year, a stark reminder of the economic damage afflicting the country as lawmakers debate the size and scope of new relief. “This jarring news should compel Congress to move swiftly to provide targeted and temporary assistance to unemployed Americans, employers, and state and local governments, and liability protections for businesses who follow public health guidelines,” said Neal Bradley of the US Chamber of Commerce, the powerful business group. But bipartisan talks have yet to reach a serious, productive phase. Democrats are playing hardball, insisting on a package that’s far larger than the $1 trillion-plus measure unveiled by McConnell on Monday. Thursday brought more tit-for-tat. “They won’t engage. Period,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate. “The Democrats are saying, my way or the highway.” Pelosi and McConnell have an extensive history, however. They often find ways to reach deals, though the process involves intense maneuvering and plenty of cross-talk. In an interview late Wednesday, McConnell showed a willingness to consider some Democratic priorities, like additional food aid. He and Trump have made plain they are intent on getting a bill. “The economy does need more help. We have divided government. We have to talk to each other,” McConnell said on the PBS NewsHour. “And we have to try to get an outcome.” Schumer continued his daily fusillade against McConnell and Republicans controlling the Senate, noting that McConnell “refuses to go in the room” and join the talks in person, instead transferring ownership of the talks to Meadows, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been a key architect of previous accords. “We’re trying to negotiate,” Schumer said. “Who’s holding things up?” In another signal that Republicans are preparing to yield on the USD 600 jobless benefit, Arizona Republican Martha McSally, who is facing a tough reelection race this fall, offered a one-week extension of the benefit on the Senate floor. Schumer blocked the move. Pelosi was dashing back to Washington after having travelled to Atlanta for the funeral of Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon. Pelosi’s office announced a meeting for Thursday night with the White House negotiators. Other stark differences remain between the $3 trillion proposal from Democrats and $1 trillion counter from Republicans. Money for states and cities is a crucial dividing line as local governments plead for help to shore up budgets and prevent deeper layoffs as they incur Covid-19 costs and lost tax revenue in shutdown economies. Democrats proposed nearly $1 trillion for the local governments, but Trump and Republicans are resisting sending the states and cities more cash. Instead, the GOP offers states flexibility to use $150 billion previously allotted for the virus on other needs. It’s clear that Democrats are trying to push an advantage in the negotiations because Republicans are so split over the prospect of additional government spending and jobless benefits. Among the issues sure to gather momentum is a Democratic demand for a 15 per cent increase in food stamp benefits. Trump has dismissed the GOP bill as “semi-irrelevant” since it leaves out so many Democratic items. Trump appears worried about the expiration of the $600 unemployment benefit boost as well as an expiring federal eviction moratorium on millions of rental units, potentially sending households into devastating turmoil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-gop-suggest-temporary-fix-for-600-jobless-benefit/story-3mKtAJBvNSJlOTCvMlQdVK.html
31-07-2020||World||New York City steels itself for Covid-19 to return in the fall||New York City has kept its Covid-19 infection rates low, but the risk of a resurgence looms over the Big Apple as fall approaches.The city has been a success story in combating Covid-19 since March and April, when the pandemic swept through its boroughs killing thousands of people. Yet the strategies that helped suppress the first surge -- dropping the infection rate to just 1% statewide -- will be tested as cooler weather pushes people together indoors.Melbourne, Australia, with 5 million people, offers a case in point. With the Fahrenheit dropping into the 50s, Melbourne has seen an upswing in cases, a foreboding indicator of how tough it may be for cities like New York to control infections as the mercury drops. With fall and winter approaching, it’s “inevitable” Covid-19 cases will tick up, said Ashish Jha, director of Harvard University’s Global Health Institute.“I am worried about complacency,” Jha said in an interview. “New York went through such a difficult few months, and I am worried that people are tired. A lot of people are looking at New York over the next six months and saying: ‘Could we possibly see a spike?’”New York’s success is seen as somewhat of a beacon for the rest of the country. If the city can keep its rate low as it reopens through the fall and winter, then epidemiologists say its efforts can serve as a model for other big cities nationwide.The city entered Phase 4 of the state’s reopening plan on July 20. Stores are open, though with capacity limited, and New Yorkers can enjoy outdoor dining at restaurants. However, indoor dining, bars and gyms remain closed while the wearing of masks, social distancing and aggressive hygiene practices are still being pushed as imperative.When the U.S. passed a grim milestone with more than 150,000 Americans having died from the pandemic, New York reported just 59 new cases citywide on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Florida and Arizona reported record death tallies.State ActionsThe state is already taking steps to head off any uptick. On Thursday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York is making $30 million available to counties to increase contact tracing as well as testing for the coming flu season, which generally hits in the fall and winter.Influenza will pose problems, he said, since symptoms will look like those of Covid-19. Tests must be done at the same lab facilities that already are busy conducting coronavirus testing, according to Cuomo. “That could affect the turnaround time on the Covid tests, so we want the counties to be ready,” he said.The city has also developed a testing and contact-tracing initiative called NYC Test & Trace Corps. Contact tracing is key in finding suspected cases, identifying clusters and isolating the sick. Though it must be paired with a quick turnaround for test results.“You’ve got to have testing in order to have contact tracing,” said Ted Long, executive director of NYC Test & Trace Corps. “Moving forward we’re going to watch like a hawk the turnaround times for each of the individual labs to figure out what we need to do to improve the turnaround times overall for the city.”Pooled TestingTaking advantage of available testing methods is a crucial strategy in containing the virus’ spread, said Lorna Thorpe, professor and director of the Division of Epidemiology in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone.For one, the city’s current infection rate of approximately 1%-to-2% is within the threshold for pooled testing, which is most effective in areas with very low infection rates. The strategy combines multiple tests together in a single batch. If the pool comes back negative every person in that pool is considered cleared. If the pool is positive, each sample will need to be tested individually.“Pooled testing is critically important to have in New York City,” Thorpe said. “To have the ability to do it, and to have the systems well designed to do it so that we can increase our testing capacity in particular populations as needed to be on top of the spread of the virus.”Quest Diagnostics Inc. was the first lab to gain emergency authorization for pooled testing this month. Laboratory Corp of America Holdings was approved for emergency use shortly after.Mass use of point-of-care rapid tests will also prove useful in containing the virus. The tests which can be processed on site without needing to be sent to a lab can yield results within 15 minutes. However, scaling production to meet the needs of a pandemic have been difficult and so far unsuccessful.“Ensuring that testing is widely available, making testing available and accessible to the groups that are at higher risk for infection,” and having a vigorous contact-tracing program are all crucial to avoid a new surge of the virus, Thorpe said.As the city moves into fall and winter, the public needs to acknowledge that in order to keep infection rates low, New Yorkers all need to accept that life has entered a new normal and keep protections like masks, and social distancing in mind.It is “highly unlikely” New York City will go through another lock down, according to Jha. “The level of mismanagement that you would need to have a city-wide lockdown like what happened in March is pretty substantial,” Jha said. But he added that it’s not out of the realm of possibility.While low case counts and improved testing capacity give New York a leg up in combating a potential second wave, residents must stay vigilant and not put their guard down or they could lose that advantage, according to Jha.“The most important thing is to not squander that by letting up too much and relaxing too much over the next couple of months,” Jha said. “You don’t want to go into the fall with rising infections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-steels-itself-for-covid-19-to-return-in-the-fall/story-yWErCe5G2CzOup7Ika4xNK.html
