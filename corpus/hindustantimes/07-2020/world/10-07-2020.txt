She added that if there is a need for summit talks, it is a U.S. need, while for North Korea, it is “unpractical and does not serve us at all.”Kim Yo Jong is seen as her brother’s closest confidant and has been recently confirmed as his top official for inter-Korean affairs. She is also the first vice department director of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee.She spoke as the U.S.’s top official on the Koreas is in Asia. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is in Japan after meeting South Korean officials in Seoul, where he accused a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator of being “locked in an old way of thinking.” His remarks indicated Washington won’t likely make concessions to resume the talks despite the North’s pressure.Trump and Kim Jong Un have met three times since embarking on high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018. But negotiations have faltered since their second summit in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capability.Some analysts believe North Korea, which is sensitive about potential changes in U.S. leadership, will avoid serious talks with the Americans for now before an eventual return to negotiations after the U.S. presidential election in November.Kim Yo Jong said that the diplomacy could be salvaged only by a reciprocal exchange of “irreversible simultaneous major steps.”“We would like to make it clear that it does not necessarily mean the denuclearization is not possible. But what we mean is that it is not possible at this point of time,” she said.North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan. Experts say Kim Jong Un sees the diplomacy as an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a full surrender of the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-trump-summit-unlikely-says-north-korean-leader-s-sister/story-CXZoPYb9xUnyk7UXfz9OnJ.html

A crucial meeting of the ruling Communist Party to decide the political future of Oli was postponed for the fourth time on Friday, citing floods in the country, amidst calls for his resignation over his style of functioning and anti-India statements. The meeting of the Nepal Communist Party’s 45-member powerful Standing Committee was scheduled to be held on Friday. But it was postponed for a week at the last moment. In his address to the nation, Oli said “such debates, discussions and differences are normal within a political party”. “I will assure all that I will make every effort to consolidate national unity, protect democratic republic and uplift national pride,” he said. “I will also commit myself to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity. My all efforts are directed towards saving the lives of the people and their property during the time of disaster,” he said. “The government under my leadership will not deviate from its duty to protect the people from disaster and hunger,” he said. At least 22 people have been killed in multiple landslides in Kaski, Lamjung and Rukum districts in the country’s western region. It is the fourth time that the crucial NCP meeting has been postponed. On Wednesday the meeting was postponed to Friday. Top NCP leaders, including former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, have demanded Prime Minister Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate.” The differences between the two factions of the NCP, one led by Oli and the other led by party’s executive chairman ‘Prachanda’ on the issue of power-sharing, have recently intensified after the prime minister unilaterally decided to prorogue the budget session of Parliament. The political future of 68-year-old Oli is now expected to be decided on July 17 during the Standing Committee meeting, amidst the growing involvement of Hou Yanqui, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, to save his chair. The Prachanda faction has the backing of senior leaders and former prime ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal. The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory. Later, Nepal updated the country’s political map through a Constitutional amendment, incorporating three strategically important Indian areas -- Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura. India termed as “untenable” the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal. India has handed over a diplomatic note to Nepal over the map issue, Nepalese media reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-make-every-effort-to-consolidate-national-unity-nepalese-pm-oli/story-eXwdYPlhSQNON3EcPjR47O.html

Harvard, for instance, is offering only online classes in fall and the order impacts its foreign students directly. It sued the ICE and its supervisory agency, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), on Wednesday, along with MIT.The University of California announced its plans to sue the administration on Thursday. It will seek a “temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief” to bar the administration from enforcing an order the US president, Janet Napolitano, called “mean-spirited, arbitrary and damaging to America”. She is a former DHS secretary.There are an estimated 200,000 Indians enrolled in US universities and some of them will be impacted by the controversial directive. Indian government has already raised the issue with the US at a very high level.India is the second largest source of international students in the United States, after China and before South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada. The US takes in around 1 million foreign students every year who are estimated to generate $41 billion worth of economic activity and supported 450,000 jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-to-challenge-trump-administration-order-on-foreign-students/story-55MnCxcwowh8cdXYoMjBbO.html

He is due to speak shortly before 9 p.m. (1800 GMT), his head of communications said.The Ottomans built minarets alongside the vast domed structure, while inside they added huge calligraphic panels bearing the Arabic names of the early Muslim caliphs alongside the monument’s ancient Christian iconography.The Russian Orthodox Church said it regretted that the court did not take its concerns into account when making its ruling and said the decision could lead to even greater divisions, the TASS news agency reported.Previously, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide and based in Istanbul, said converting it into a mosque would disappoint Christians and would “fracture” East and West.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Greece had also urged Turkey to maintain the building as a museum.But Turkish groups have long campaigned for Hagia Sophia’s conversion into a mosque, saying this would better reflect Turkey’s status as an overwhelmingly Muslim country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-s-prez-erdogan-says-hagia-sophia-becomes-mosque-after-court-ruling/story-vWhDBYy3HC6OOtXpwAifjP.html
10-07-2020||World||Who’s WHO? The World Health Organization under scrutiny||The World Health Organization (WHO) is back in the spotlight over its performance in the global fight against the new coronavirus after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration gave notice it would quit the body in a year’s time.Trump has accused the WHO of becoming a puppet for China during the coronavirus pandemic. The WHO said on Thursday it would set up an independent panel to review its handling of the pandemic and the response by governments.Here are main features of the WHO and its work:* What is it?The WHO is an agency of the United Nations set up in 1948 to improve health globally. It has more than 7,000 people working in 150 country offices, six regional offices and its Geneva headquarters. Its director general - currently the Ethiopian Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus - is elected for a five-year term. Tedros’ five-year term began on July 1, 2017.* What does it do?The WHO’s stated aim is “to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable”. It has no power to impose health policies on national governments, but acts as an adviser and offers guidance on best practice in disease prevention and health improvement.It has three main strands of work:- aiming for universal health coverage in every country- preventing and responding to acute emergencies- promoting health and wellbeing for all* What doesn’t it do?Like a lot of international institutions, the WHO suffers from false perceptions about its scope and resources.The WHO is not “the world’s doctor”: it does not provide treatment or conduct disease surveillance - although it does advise national and international authorities on those matters.It has no powers of sanction, and the information it collates and publishes is only as good as the data and expertise it gets from member states and its technical specialists.* Is every country part of it?The WHO has 194 member states: every country except Liechtenstein which is a member of the United Nations but not of its global health agency. They appoint representatives to The World Health Assembly, which convenes annually and sets WHO policies. These policies are implemented by the WHO’s Executive Board, composed of members technically qualified in health. * Who pays for it?The WHO’s member states provide funding via two routes: assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. The WHO’s budgets are biennial, spanning two years. Its 2020-2021 budget is almost $4.85 billion, up 9% from the previous two-year period.Assessed contributions are calculated on the basis of a country’s wealth and population, while voluntary contributions are often targeted by the donor at specific regions or diseases - such as polio, malaria, or infant mortality in poor areas.Philanthropic foundations and multinational groups such as the European Commission are also major donors to the WHO.The United States is the biggest overall donor and had contributed more than $800 million by the end of 2019 for the 2018-2019 biennial funding period. The Gates Foundation is the second largest donor, followed by Britain.* What are seen as its major successes and failures?The WHO is widely credited with leading a 10-year campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s and has also led global efforts to end polio, a battle that is in its final stages.In the past few years, the WHO has also coordinated battles against viral epidemics of Ebola in Congo and Zika in Brazil.In the current COVID-19 disease outbreak, while many have praised the WHO’s leadership, Trump has accused it of being China-centric and giving bad advice about the emerging pandemic.Trump announced a temporary halt to U.S. funding in April, prompting condemnation from many world leaders. The United Nations said this week it had received formal notification of the U.S. decision to leave the body next year.In the past, the WHO was accused of overreacting to the 2009-10 H1N1 flu pandemic and also faced widespread criticism for not reacting quickly enough to the vast Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 that killed more than 11,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-s-who-the-world-health-organization-under-scrutiny/story-IlzwPFJbyvbrpPpE8MVFfN.html
10-07-2020||World||Shortage of green cards is latest US immigrant barrier||Indians holding or applying for green cards face a new anti-immigrant obstacle from the United States government. The US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has scaled back the printing of the physical green cards which identify the holder as a legal permanent US resident.By law, US permanent residents are legally required to carry the credit card-sized identity cards “at all times” and must show them when applying for jobs and when travelling. Indians received 10% of all green cards issued in 2019 and are the second-largest group of existing green-card holders. But 53% of all green card applicants are from India, a figure that has kept rising each year. The USCIS contract with the private printing firm that produces green cards expired in mid-June, reported the Washington Post. The USCIS was supposed to take over the printing itself but the agency’s financial difficulties forced it to reduce its output. There are two printing facilities for green cards. One in Kentucky has shut down. The other one, in Missouri, is operating at reduced capacity. There is a 50,000 shortfall in green cards, the USCIS said in a statement. The agency has asked the US Congress for an emergency $1.2 billion loan or else “all agency operations will be affected.”Even existing green card holders must get new identity cards every 10 years or if the card has been damaged or lost. Normally, green cards are printed within 48 hours of an applicant’s residency being approved. While the Trump administration has taken a number of anti-immigrant steps recently, including suspending new H and L visas and requiring students who are taking only online courses leave the country, it is not clear the printing problem is deliberate. However, the USCIS’s financial difficulties are a direct result of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies. The agency is funded solely from the fees it earns from the services it provides. Thanks to President Donald Trump’s obsession with supposed immigrant fraud, much of the USCIS’s resources have been channelled towards trying to find such cases. This has led to the present financial crisis. The agency has reportedly warned that without the emergency funding it will have to reduce its workforce by three-quarters. The administration, says the Washington Post, has put up other bureaucratic hurdles to make life more difficult for immigrants including shutting down biometric data collection points and making intra-agency documents movement more difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shortage-of-green-cards-is-latest-us-immigrant-barrier/story-YhdOIkvDJ78c9ekzWm23ZL.html

He has been pointedly averse to it for himself while allowing experts the last word for others.Trump reportedly dropped his resistance to a mask or any face-covering at the “pleading” of aides, as the United States has continued to witness a surge in new infections, which went up by 63,247 over the past 24 hours to a cumulative 3.11 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Deaths climbed by 990 over the same time-span to 133,291.Also read: US will respond if Russia bounty reports are true, says PentagonPresident Trump, who is pushing the country to get past the epidemic, had attributed the spike to increased testing, contrary to the reason stated by health experts and scientists. Trump has also focused on declining mortality rates to make his case. Statistically, the percentage of people testing positive has been on a rise, along with soaring number of people getting hospitalised, especially in the southern and western states hit the hardest such as Texas, Florida, and California.For the first time, Trump will wear a mask during his Saturday visit to the Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, in the adjoining state of Maryland.“I’m going to Walter Reed to see some of our great soldiers who have been injured. Badly injured. And also see some of our Covid workers, people who have such a great job,” Trump said in an interview to Fox News Thursday. “And I expect to be wearing a mask when I go into Walter Reed. You’re in a hospital so I think it’s a very appropriate thing.”The American president declared his refusal to use a facial covering early in March, when his public health officials first recommended them as part of their plan to slow the spread of the virus. “I don’t see it for myself,” he had said then and has stood by it since, fanning a culture war around it.Also read: Why Americans are having an emotional reaction to masksSome conservative Americans have refused to wear a mask to register their independence from the state.

The company said the finding requires confirmation in prospective clinical trials.Gilead said it analyzed data from 312 patients treated in a late-stage study and a separate real-world retrospective cohort of 818 patients with similar characteristics and disease severity as in the study. Findings from the analysis of its late-stage study showed that 74.4% of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by Day 14 versus 59.0% of patients receiving standard of care, the company said. The mortality rate for patients treated with remdesivir in the analysis was 7.6% at Day 14, compared with 12.5% among patients not on remdesivir.Gilead shares were up nearly 2% at $76.14 in trading before the bell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-says-additional-data-on-remdesivir-shows-improved-clinical-recovery/story-kSeoDIso3OKZGOlVLQ63lM.html

India-trained medical professionals have long been part of the NHS.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in a virtual address to the India Global week 2020: “Covid-19 is a global challenge. And the UK has been proud to stand alongside India in its international response”.“As we have responded to this crisis, we have been privileged to have 25,000 Indian professionals working in our brilliant National Health Service here at home. We hugely value their contribution”.Speaking as part of the event that included ministers Matt Hancock, Tariq Ahmad and Lynn Truss, Raab thanked the Indian government for the UK being able to obtain vital supplies of paracetamol at the height of the crisis.It would be an “extraordinary achievement”, Raab said, if the human trial for a vaccine at the University of Oxford were to succeed and is produced on a mass scale at the Serum Institute of India. It would benefit not only the British and Indian people, but also make it accessible for the most vulnerable people across the world, he said.“As leaders in the international response, the UK and India have also co-authored the G20 Action Plan, providing an immediate package of $200 billion of global support to the most vulnerable countries around the world”.“Even before Covid, UK was India’s second biggest research partner. With our joint research estimated to be worth £400 million by 2021. And with India’s contribution to the recent GAVI vaccine summit, together we smashed the target for vaccine funding, with $8.8 billion raised”, Raab said.Foreign Office minister for South Asia Tariq Ahmad said: “There are few countries that share the people-to-people connections as the UK and India. This was demonstrated earlier this year when we repatriated more than 15,000 British people from India – the largest repatriation operation from a single country since the Second World War”.“As we adjust to the new post-Covid world in the coming months, I know that these people-to -people links will help future generations to build back better. The Living Bridge between our countries – on show at India Global Week – will grow back stronger,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-hails-indian-doctors-nurses-in-nhs-on-the-frontline-of-covid-19-treatment/story-pJI13G476txQnwziT9yuwM.html

The number of new cases rose on Thursday to a daily record of 1,962.According to a Tuesday report by Kazinform, the state news agency of Kazakhstan, the number of pneumonia cases “increased 2.2 times in June as compared to the same period of 2019”.The country implemented a lockdown on March 16 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic; restrictions were lifted in May but reimposed following an increase in cases.China, according to a Reuters report, is a major investor in oil- and metals-rich Kazakhstan and is one of the main markets for its exports, dominated by commodities. Kazakhstan also makes money from Chinese goods carried across its territory to Europe.The Kazakhstan’s foreign ministry had summoned the Chinese ambassador in April to protest over an article on a Chinese website saying the country was keen to become part of China, the ministry said.It was a rare move as the two countries avoid criticising each other.It was during a lecture at a university in Kazakhstan that President Xi Jinping had first talked about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), his ambitious inter-continental connectivity project, in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-denies-china-s-advisory-of-pneumonia-deadlier-than-coronavirus/story-QFdydbXmyt8XElpIng8MMO.html
10-07-2020||World||Homeland Security gets new role under Prez Trump’s monument order||Protesters who have clashed with authorities in the Pacific Northwest are not just confronting local police. Some are also facing off against federal officers whose presence reflects President Donald Trump’s decision to make cracking down on “violent mayhem” a federal priority.The Department of Homeland Security has deployed officers in tactical gear from around the country, and from more than a half-dozen federal law enforcement agencies and departments, to Portland, Oregon, as part of a surge aimed at what a senior official said were people taking advantage of demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd to commit violence and vandalism.“Once we surged federal law enforcement officers to Portland, the agitators quickly got the message,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation.The deployment represents somewhat of a departure for DHS, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and is primarily focused on threats from abroad and border security. During the Trump presidency, its focus has been largely on carrying out the president’s tough immigration agenda. Now it is in the role of supporting Trump’s law-and-order campaign, raising questions about overstepping the duties of local law enforcement.Portland Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis said his department did not request the assistance and did not coordinate efforts with the federal government amid often chaotic clashes that have ranged across several downtown blocks after midnight for weeks.“I don’t have authority to order federal officers to do things,” Davis said. “It does complicate things for us.”The DHS officers’ presence comes at an incredibly tense moment for Portland. After Floyd’s death, the city for days saw marches and rallies that attracted more than 10,000 generally peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters to the downtown area. The police took a “mostly hands-off approach” to those events because they were orderly, Davis said.Civil liberties advocates and activists have accused federal authorities of overstepping their jurisdiction and excessive use of crowd-control measures, including using tear gas and patrolling beyond the boundaries of federal property. Portland police are prohibited from using tear gas under a recent temporary court order unless they declare a riot.“DHS should go back to investigating the rise of white supremacist activity and actors who are seeking to cause violence against these peaceful protests, that is under the purview of the agency’s mission,” said Andrea Flores, the deputy director of immigration policy at the American Civil Liberties Union who was a DHS official during the Obama administration.Trump issued an executive order on June 26 to protect monuments after protesters tried to remove or destroy statues of people considered racist, including a failed attempt to pull down one of Andrew Jackson near the White House.The president has denounced the Black Lives Matter movement and protests calling for the removal of statues honoring racist figures, associating peaceful protests with the sporadic outbursts of vandalism and looting at some demonstrations. He referred to “the violent mayhem we have seen in the streets of cities that are run by liberal Democrats,” as well as the “merciless campaign to wipe out our history,” in his July 3 Mount Rushmore speech.Following the executive order, DHS created the Protecting American Communities Task Force and sent officers from Customs and Border Protection and other agencies to Washington, D.C., Seattle and Portland. Others were ready to deploy elsewhere if needed.Improving coordination among law enforcement agencies is part of DHS’s mission. It also oversees the Federal Protective Service, which guards federal government buildings around the nation.But the FPS doesn’t have the resources to respond to the kind of sustained attacks that have taken place in Portland and elsewhere on the margins of protests over the May 25 killing of Floyd in Minneapolis.Federal Protective Service Officer David Underwood was shot and killed outside a federal building in Oakland during a protest in May. Authorities charged an Air Force staff sergeant affiliated with the far-right, anti-government “boogaloo” movement with his murder.As local governments in Washington, D.C., and Portland have stepped back to allow space for peaceful demonstrations, the Trump administration has stepped up its effort against what the senior official called “opportunistic criminals.”Attorney General William Barr says there have been more than 150 arrests on federal charges around the country, with about 500 investigations pending related to recent protests. There were at least seven in Portland in recent days.Portland police officials say the cycle of nightly attacks, which have shut down much of the downtown, has been unprecedented. Early Thursday, a man in a SUV fired several times into the air as he drove away from protesters who had surrounded his car. “We’ve never seen this intensity of violence and focused criminal activity over this long period of time,” Davis said.Among the federal forces deployed in Portland are members of an elite Border Patrol tactical team, a special operations unit that is based on the U.S.-Mexico border and has been deployed overseas, including to Iraq and Afghanistan.BORTAC members, identifiable by patches on their camouflage sleeves, are mixed in with Federal Protective Service outside the courthouse. Others in the unit, which includes snipers, have been stationed in “overlook” positions on the courthouse’s ninth floor, where a protester in a black hoodie shined a green laser into the eyes of one of the officers on Monday, according to court documents.The night before, a BORTAC agent tackled and arrested a demonstrator suspected of pointing a laser at him and others from a park across the street from the courthouse.A former DHS official said BORTAC agents were viewed as “highly trained, valuable, scarce resources” and would typically be used for domestic law enforcement in extraordinary circumstances. “These units don’t normally sit around idle,” said the official, who spoke on condition anonymity because he no longer works at the agency, after serving under Trump and President Barack Obama, and is not authorized to discuss operations.“What did they get pulled off of in order to watch over statues?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/homeland-security-gets-new-role-under-prez-trump-s-monument-order/story-tHgY2W51FOaRUHgq1OPsSN.html

And to stay historically accurate, it will again be built with potentially toxic lead.That’s the verdict reached by French President Emmanuel Macron, the cathedral’s present-day architects and the general in charge of the colossal reconstruction project for one of the world’s most treasured landmarks.Macron, who wants Notre Dame reopened in time for the 2024 Olympics, had initially pushed for a contemporary touch atop the cathedral, prompting eye-catching proposals from architects around the world.But Macron came around to the traditionalists’ argument, and approved reconstruction plans for the 12th century monument that were presented Thursday, according to a statement from state agency overseeing the project.The plan includes recreating the 19th-century spire by Viollet Le Duc that collapsed in the fire, and “favors fidelity to the monument’s form and a restoration of the cathedral in its latest state,” the statement said.That means the state Notre Dame was in the afternoon of April 15, 2019, before fire broke out beneath its roof, toppling its spire, consuming the roof and threatening the rose-windowed twin towers that keep the cathedral upright.More than a year later, the structure remains unstable. It took nearly a year to clear out dangerous lead residue released in the fire and to get to the point where workers could start removing scaffolding that had been in place before the fire for a previous renovation effort. Actual reconstruction won’t start until next year.The reconstruction plan presented Thursday says it will replicate original materials “to guarantee the authenticity, harmony and coherence of this masterpiece of Gothic art.”Those materials originally include tons of lead, which is raising concerns among health and environmental groups. Toxic lead spewed by the fire forced schools in the area to close and prompted a lengthy, painstaking cleanup effort of the historic neighbourhood on an island in the centre of Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-s-notre-dame-cathedral-to-be-rebuilt-the-same-as-before/story-Eof3d9Z0k7aobnzV5Y1TYO.html
10-07-2020||World||Canadian charity says it paid PM Trudeau’s mother, brother; probe on||The controversy enveloping Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over a contract worth millions to a charity with links to his family has deepened with revelations about his mother and brother being paid by the organisation, local media reported on Thursday. Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion has already said he would probe the contract. The investigation, however, was later dropped by the government following uproar over Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire’s ties with the organisation WE Charity.According to a report from the outlet Canadaland, confirmed by others including CBC News, the charity paid Trudeau’s mother Margaret speaking fees totalling CA $ 312,000 while his brother Alexandre netted CA $ 32,000. Also, in its earlier avatar as Free The Children, the organisation is reported to have paid the Prime Minister’s wife an honorarium of CA $ 1400 in 2012 for making an appearance at a youth event.Controversy over the matter erupted when the government announced that WE Charity would administer the CA $ 914 million Canada Student Service Grant, while being paid CA $ 19.5 million for the purpose. As Trudeau and his wife’s connection to the organisation were revealed, the resultant outcry led to it withdrawing from the project.Trudeau later admitted to chairing a Cabinet meeting where the proposal was passed.Canadaland uncovered invoices that showed payments made by the for-profit arm of the organization, ME to WE Social Enterprise. Confronted with the evidence, the WE Charity acknowledged it paid a total of CA $ 312,000 to Margaret Trudeau via the Speakers’ Spotlight speaking bureau and she netted CA $ 250,000 for 28 events between 2016 and 2020.The House of Commons Finance Committee is also investigating the matter, after having passed two motions in this regard to extract information from the Prime Minister’s Office. The Operations and Estimates Committee has also announced a similar probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-charity-says-it-paid-pm-trudeau-s-mother-brother-probe-on/story-YtbMHLv9Gy45cMC7Enay5I.html

They are the first such bulletins issued since Superstorm Sandy struck the New Jersey coast in 2012, said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections.The storm was about 105 miles south of Ocean City, Maryland, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 2 am New York time Friday. It should clip New Jersey midday Friday before powering up the coast for New York and Long Island Saturday and weakening over Vermont.It will be the third storm to hit the US in 2020 and the record sixth system named so far this year.“Fay will bring a few areas of moderate flooding due to heavy rains, but the storm will likely not cause significant damage,” Masters said.From 3 to 5 inches of rain is expected across the Northeast, with some areas getting as much as 8 inches, the hurricane center said. Flash flood watches reach from Virginia to Massachusetts.While storms that hit in the Gulf of Mexico tend to crimp oil and natural gas supply, often sending prices higher, Fay will likely decrease demand due to power outages and slightly cooler conditions due to cloud cover, said Jim Rouiller, lead meteorologist at the Energy Weather Group LLC.Fay is moving over warm Gulf Stream waters and its top winds could reach 50 mph before it comes ashore. A storm becomes a hurricane when its winds reach 74 mph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-warning-issued-for-new-york-as-fay-looms/story-AmVOX3zj15DETA9Z3s4RgO.html

In her statement released through Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency, she called for major concessions from washing ton to keep alive the nuclear diplomacy.Kim Yo Jong is seen as her brother’s closest confidant and was recently confirmed as his top official for inter-Korean affairs.South Korea on Thursday asked Biegun to try to revive the talks with the North. He stressed during his meetings in Seoul that resuming the diplomacy with the North was important. But he separately accused a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator who had blamed the deadlocked talks on American hostility of being “locked in an old way of thinking.” Those remarks indicated Washington won’t likely make concessions to resume the talks despite the North’s pressure.Kim Yo Jong said “a surprise thing may still happen, depending upon the judgement and decision between the two top leaders” but that the US needed summit talks while Pyongyang did not.North Korea has demanded that the US lift international sanctions and provide a security guarantee if it’s truly committed to talks about the status of its nuclear weapons program.Some analysts believe North Korea, which is sensitive about potential changes in US leadership, will avoid serious talks with the Americans for now before an eventual return to negotiations after the US presidential election in November.Kim Yo Jong said that the diplomacy could be salvaged only by a reciprocal exchange of “irreversible simultaneous major steps.”The nuclear diplomacy has stalled since a second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in early 2019.___AP journalists Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul and Emily Wang in Tokyo contributed to this report.___Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-after-seoul-visit-reassures-japan-of-alliance/story-sUBUiJkzFbT38oqFUaGLoL.html
10-07-2020||World||Kazakhstan denies Chinese reports of pneumonia deadlier than coronavirus||Kazakhstan dismissed as incorrect on Friday a warning by China’s embassy for its citizens to guard against an outbreak of pneumonia in the central Asian nation that it described as being more lethal than the coronavirus. In a statement late on Thursday on its official WeChat account, the Chinese embassy flagged a “significant increase” in cases in the Kazakh cities of Atyrau, Aktobe and Shymkent since mid-June. On Friday, however, Kazakhstan’s healthcare ministry branded Chinese media reports based on the embassy statement as “fake news”.The ministry said its tallies of bacterial, fungal and viral pneumonia infections, which also included cases of unclear causes, were in line with World Health Organisation guidelines.“The information published by some Chinese media regarding a new kind of pneumonia in Kazakhstan is incorrect,” the ministry said.Kazakhstan, which imposed a second lockdown this week to rein in the pandemic, has a tally of almost 55,000 Covid-19 infections, including 264 deaths. The number of new cases rose on Thursday to a daily record of 1,962.On Tuesday, state news agency Kazinform said the number of pneumonia cases “increased 2.2 times in June as compared to the same period of 2019”.In its statement, the Chinese embassy had said pneumonia in Kazakhstan killed 1,772 people in the year’s first half, with 628 deaths in June, including Chinese citizens.“The mortality rate of the disease is much higher than that of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus,” it said. It is unclear whether the penumonia it referred to was caused by a virus related to coronavirus or a different strain.Kazakhstan’s health ministry and other health institutions were carrying out a “comparative study”, but no conclusions had yet been made, the embassy added.The Global Times tabloid run by China’s People’s Daily has said Kazakhstan’s foreign ministry “did not respond to questions about the Chinese embassy’s warning”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-denies-chinese-reports-of-pneumonia-deadlier-than-coronavirus/story-p1YwsJ8PEVBkaMsHp5WmmJ.html
10-07-2020||World||Did the world become more equal after the financial crisis?||The “elephant chart” has been the most influential graph of the past decade in economics.It showed that in the 20 years before the financial crisis, global income growth largely benefitted two groups of people: the middle classes of emerging markets, such as China, and the ultra-rich around the world. Meanwhile, the middle and lower classes of Western Europe and North America saw their incomes stagnate.This work — produced in 2013 by economists Christoph Lakner and Branko Milanovic using World Bank and other data — incensed the left around the world, sparking a debate over income inequality and the failures of capitalism and globalization. The dramatic rise in earnings of the top 1%, seen from 1988 to 2008, has since been blamed for the return of populism and protectionism and resulted in calls for radical policies such as sweeping wealth taxes.A new paper from one of the authors of what’s become known as the “elephant chart” suggests that things changed in the years immediately following the financial crisis. Milanovic, an economist at The Graduate Center at the City University of New York, has now looked at changes in income distribution from 2008 to 2013. His main finding is that global income inequality actually declined during this period.While the middle classes of the developing world continued to close the gap with the West, the ultra-rich across the globe saw a significant slowdown in income growth — particularly in the US and Germany. Contrary to hundreds of articles and books, the world became a more equal place in the aftermath of Great Recession.Milanovic has assembled a gargantuan dataset of household surveys, covering more than 130 countries in the world and around 95% of the world population. The breadth of the data helps explain why his work stops in 2013: Not all countries have statistical offices able to assemble more recent information on the incomes and consumption patterns of individual families.Analyzing changes in the income distribution, the author finds that global disparities plummeted after 2008. The world’s Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, fell from 66.4 to 61.6 in just five years, when taking into account differences in purchasing power across countries — a significant drop.The main driver of this convergence was a steep fall in inequality between richer and poorer countries: In particular, Asia’s economies powered ahead as Europe and the US stagnated, narrowing the gap between the Asian and Western middle classes. The median income in Asia rose by 76% between 2008 and 2013. In Western Europe, North America and Oceania, there was a mere 6% gain. And these figures are taking into account the differing costs of living.This trend of declining global inequality was already visible in the pre-2008 world. Yet, rather than celebrating the improvements in the lives of millions of Asians, left-leaning politicians and academics in Europe and the US preferred to focus on the right-hand tail of the distribution — the “trunk” of the “elephant” — which showed that the very rich had done much better than the Western middle classes.According to Milanovic’s latest data, the trunk, and therefore the elephant, may be no more. Taking into account global purchasing power differences, the top 1% of earners saw the lowest increase in income per capita between 2008 and 2013: a mere 6%. Conversely, those around the top 90th percentile in terms of income — which includes much of the European and North American lower and middle classes — saw gains of about 15%. Those around the middle of the global distribution saw income gains of about 60% over the same period.When the author redrew his curves without adjusting for purchasing power, and correcting for how the rich may under-report their incomes, he saw a slightly higher growth rate of income of the top 1%, but it still remained relatively small. In all analyses, the proportion of global income going to the ultra-rich fell between 2008 and 2013.The other striking result relates to inequality within individual countries. In theory, it is possible that while global inequality fell, individual countries became more unequal. But this was not generally the case. Milanovic finds that the overall Gini coefficient remained broadly stable between 2008 and 2013 in around 60% of the countries in his sample, while the remaining 40% were split between those that saw a decrease in inequality and those that saw it rise.Maybe the top 1% in each country still did well compared with everyone else? The data here were mixed too. In India, the years after the Great Recession favored the super-rich, who saw the biggest gains in income. Conversely, in the US, they were the worst-off: While most of the population saw their incomes rise by 5% over this period, the top earners saw a reduction of about 5% — though obviously from a much higher base. Of course, we don’t have the data to know what has happened since 2013, and we probably won’t for some time. The original “elephant curve” has also been subject to methodological critiques — one being that its results were too dependent on the different rates of population growth around the world. The same problems could apply to Milanovic’s new study.The current paper also does not look at wealth inequality, which some consider a more important measure of economic disparities though it’s much harder to study. And one can still argue that although inequality overall has declined, it remains far too high and requires radical solutions.Yet, Milanovic’s new findings deserve the same kind of attention as his old ones. The narrative around the global financial crisis and the rise of the top 1% will require some rewriting.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Ferdinando Giugliano writes columns and editorials on European economics for Bloomberg View.

10-07-2020||World||China cities declare flood ‘red alerts’ as extreme weather threats surge||Four cities along China’s Yangtze river have declared top-level flood warnings over the past two days after torrential rain triggered landslides and inundated roads and farmland, with parts of the river threatening to burst its banks.The “red alerts” in Xianning and Jingzhou in Hubei province and Nanchang and Shangrao in neighbouring Jiangxi highlight the country’s vulnerability to extreme weather from climate change and the risks of overdevelpment on flood plains, experts say.About 140 people are dead or missing from the storms, while China’s state broadcaster CCTV said on Friday that accumulated economic losses exceed 60 billion yuan ($8.6 billion).China has blamed unusual weather conditions, including humidity carried from the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, as the immediate cause, but it has also said long-term changes in climate patterns have made it more vulnerable.In June, rainfall was 13.5% higher than the seasonal average, according to official data. The country has experienced a 20% increase in incidents of heavy rainfall since 1961, the China Meteorological Administration has said.“The floods in southern China are consistent with an increase in extreme weather due to climate change,” said Liu Junyan, campaigner with the environmental group Greenpeace. “In many parts of China, we have seen dramatic changes in precipitation in recent decades, and as a result, flooding.”Highlighting the risks to China’s economy from global warming, a new study by researchers in Nanjing said economic damage from floods rose to $25.3 billion a year over 2006-2018, up nearly a third from the 1984-2018 annual average. Each 0.5-degree temperature increase would lead to a $60 billion rise in annual flood losses, they estimated. Flood plain risksWhile climate is a major factor, this year’s floods also expose the growing risks from overdevelopment in flood plains, said Ma Jun, director of the independent Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), which monitors China’s rivers.“The rainfall is high but it is not the highest,” he said. “The flooding is going to cause a lot more damage because of urbanisation and industrialisation, especially in low-lying places.”China has been vulnerable to floods throughout its history, with climate conditions made worse by human activities like deforestation, the reclamation of wetlands and the storage of water for power generation and irrigation.Beijing has in turn sought to engineer a solution to the problem, with giant dam projects partly designed to regulate water flows along the Yangtze, the longest river in Asia. The giant Three Gorges reservoir has been storing around 50,000 cubic metres per second of water this week, while discharging only 35,000 cubic metres per second in order to reduce the impact of floods downstream. It is now 3.5 metres higher than warning levels, according to the Ministry of Water Resources. Ma said China needs better urban planning - and increased efforts to build “sponge cities” capable of absorbing water - if it is to ease the rising long-term risks.“China has spent more resources building dams and reservoirs and flood controls, but they are not a panacea,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cities-declare-flood-red-alerts-as-extreme-weather-threats-surge/story-AIWcOnAfzCYYhqi6gNX1TP.html

10-07-2020||World||US sanctions top Chinese officials over Xinjiang abuses||The US sanctioned a top member of China’s ruling Communist Party and three other officials over human rights abuses in the western region of Xinjiang, a major escalation in the Trump administration’s increasingly tense rivalry with the country.The sanctioned individuals include Chen Quanguo, the Xinjiang party secretary who sits on the 25-member Politburo, as well as Zhu Hailun, party secretary of the Xinjiang Political and Legal Committee, and the current and former directors of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, the Treasury Department said Thursday.The US move is tied to the widespread detention of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, a policy that has been sharply criticized by top American officials as well as human rights groups. It comes amid soaring tensions between Beijing and Washington over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, China’s moves to quell dissent in Hong Kong and a debate over the use of Chinese technology by the US and allies.“The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its financial powers to hold human rights abusers accountable in Xinjiang and across the world,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.The decision also marks the first time the US has sanctioned a sitting Chinese official under the 2016 Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which gives the US broad authority to impose human-rights sanctions on foreign officials. Senior administration officials had been pushing for the sanctions for months but had been stymied by President Donald Trump, who fretted that they would complicate his US-China trade deal.Chen, seen as a rising star in the Communist Party, has become China’s point man for subduing ethnic unrest. During his earlier stint in Tibet, Buddhist temples were told to display Chinese flags and images of party leaders. His implementation of a vast police state in Xinjiang and demonstrations of loyalty to Xi won him a promotion in 2017 to the Politburo, and he may be considered for a spot on its supreme Standing Committee, which now has just seven members, in 2022.Given Chen’s rank in the party hierarchy, which is comparable to a member of the US cabinet, the move is also likely to infuriate President Xi Jinping’s government. Even though the sanctions were weeks in the making, the timing may be seen as deliberate because Treasury announced the move hours after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a major speech that called for better ties.China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday morning.“We’re in uncharted territory right now,” said Daniel Russel, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, who’s now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “There’s never been an administration that thought the pursuit of top-level party officials would end well for either side.”New PressuresThe US has ramped up pressure on China across many fronts in recent months, accusing it of covering up the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and reneging on promises to guarantee political autonomy to the former British colony of Hong Kong. The election campaigns for Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have sought to taint each other as weak in confronting Beijing’s leaders.This week Trump said the US was considering a ban of TikTok, the popular social media app owned by China’s ByteDance Inc. The US is seeking to limit US companies’ ability to do business with Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co., while Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has pushed for US pension funds to cut ties with Chinese companies. Senior officials have even discussed ways to undermine the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the US dollar, although that remains a remote possibility.“The Wang Yi speech is a game plan for restoring some stability in the relationship and it’s taken very seriously on the Chinese side,” said Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. “It would be nice if somebody could give some kind of response before we whacked them again.”Chen is the highest-ranking person to be hit with this kind of sanction in China, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. The latest sanctions shouldn’t be construed as last word, the official said, when asked if further measures are under consideration for the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, or XPCC.The US statement on Thursday cited the public security bureau’s use of “repressive tactics,” including “mass detentions and surveillance” against the region’s Uighur population.Trump aides weigh proposals to undermine Hong Kong’s dollar peg“The entity and officials are being designated for their connection to serious human rights abuse against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, which reportedly include mass arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious abuses targeting Uighurs, a Turkic Muslim population indigenous to Xinjiang, and other ethnic minorities in the region,” according to the statement.Although China is likely to object strongly to sanctions against a member of the Politburo, which oversees the running of the country, the sanctions likely won’t impact those targeted in any significant way. There’s little likelihood that the officials named have financial connections with the US The sanctions block access to accounts or businesses owned, directly or indirectly, by the people or the bureau. It also prohibits US persons from doing business with the sanctioned officials or entities.The move has “more symbolic significance than real impact,” said Zhou Qi, director of the Institute of American Studies at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. “If some of them were planning to send their sons and daughters to study in the US, there will likely to be some impact on them individually. But in the view of the general public in China, the sanctions may not be a big deal for China as a country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-top-chinese-officials-over-xinjiang-abuses/story-B7LV1duG3TQ3ge4bRR5McN.html

Even so, it risks adding to the perception the US is struggling to influence other countries. It follows Trump’s past denigration of African nations, while years of neglect of the continent by successive US administrations left the running to China.“Under Trump, the US has certainly lost its soft power in Africa,” said Mohamed Diatta, a researcher for the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies. “People on the continent don’t want to have anything to do with him.”Trump accepted Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi’s request in September to mediate the conflict with Ethiopia over a dam on the Nile, but his public praise for Sisi -- he once called him “my favorite dictator” -- signaled to African leaders that the US wasn’t going to be a honest broker. After it ended up with the United Nations Security Council, African nations are moving to wrestle back control of the process.The dispute is at a critical moment. Ethiopia has said it plans to start filling the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, the site of Africa’s biggest hydropower plant, within weeks. Egypt says the dam will deprive its citizens of the water they need to farm and survive unless there’s a firm agreement on the pace of its filling.Read more: Tussle for Nile Control Escalates as Dam Talks FalterIn a letter to the Security Council on June 29, Egypt vowed to “uphold and protect the vital interests of its people.” “Survival is not a question of choice, but an imperative of nature,” it said.In a conversation with a small group of delegates at a conference last month, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa disparaged Trump’s involvement.Over refreshments, he said the US leader would need to visit Africa to sort things out in person but wouldn’t, because it is a “shithole” -- a reference to Trump’s 2018 comments about the continent. Ramaphosa also said that instead of allowing the African Union, which he currently chairs, to resolve the deadlock, Sisi “went running to his master,” a reference to America. Ramaphosa’s spokeswoman Khusela Diko said she had no knowledge of the conversation.Trump’s handing of the issue has raised eyebrows in the US itself. He bypassed the State Department and asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to spearhead the talks, simply because Mnuchin was at the meeting when Sisi made the request, people familiar with the situation said. Experts say the intervention has turned what was essentially a technical dispute into a national security issue for three nations that depend on the river -- Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.Colin Thomas-Jensen, a senior adviser with WestExec Advisors and former Africa policy adviser to one-time US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, said the US handling of the dispute had been “clumsy” but added it was unfair to blame the Trump administration for how bogged down the issue has become.“The crisis over the GERD has been building for nearly a decade, and yet there’s been negligible international effort to construct a mediation process with multilateral support from countries with leverage over the parties, including China and the Gulf states,” he said. “Instead, the Egyptians have been forum shopping with the United States and others while the Ethiopians have dragged their feet.”Two people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US thought it was making headway through early February, when a proposal appeared to have tentative support from all sides. But the people said Ethiopian officials reversed themselves and declined to attend Feb. 28 talks in Washington, bringing the process to a halt.The administration remains committed to helping reach a deal, the people said, rejecting claims the US has thrown its weight behind Egypt. Each of the parties has griped at various points about the situation, they said.Both the African Union and Ethiopia have stressed to the UN that the AU needs to take the lead in resolving the dispute, despite years of failing itself to make progress. In the words of Ethiopia, “the Nile and the GERD are African issues that must be given African solutions.”Ethiopia and Egypt are longtime rivals in a high-stakes battle for control over the Nile, Africa’s longest river. Ethiopia is seeking to break what it sees as centuries of domination by Cairo, codified in so-called colonial-era treaties of 1929 and 1959. As far back the 1970s, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat warned of war should the dam get built.Egypt fears the dam’s 74 billion cubic-meter reservoir and associated 6,000-megawatt power plant would give control over its water supply to a regional and upstream rival. Over the years it has argued the dam’s design was unsafe, would put the downstream flow of water at significant risk, and had a needlessly large dam and reservoir.“A threat of potentially existential proportions has emerged that could encroach on the single source of livelihood of over 100 million Egyptians,” Egypt said in its letter to the Security Council. Ethiopia rejects Egypt’s claims.Egypt’s foreign ministry didn’t respond to further requests for comment.‘Meaningful Concessions’“Egypt’s intention by taking the dispute to the UN Security Council is to lump international pressure onto Ethiopia and force it to make meaningful concessions,” said Anthony Skinner, director for Middle East and North Africa at UK-based risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.Egyptian diplomats say Ethiopia’s claims of US bias are disingenuous and seek to distract from its refusal to cooperate with other Nile nations. They point to strong US backing for the current, reformist government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his efforts to end hostilities with neighboring Eritrea. Ethiopia received at least $881 million in financial assistance from the US in 2019, one of the highest levels worldwide.Still, a year and a half after the US got involved in the dispute, little has changed. It’s far cry from the pomp that greeted Trump’s involvement, with the World Bank joining the first US-mediated talks in early 2019.Another White House effort to wade into a thorny international dispute faced a setback last month. Kosovo’s leaders pulled out of US-brokered talks with Serbia scheduled for June 27 in Washington, after an international prosecutor in The Hague indicted President Hashim Thaci for war crimes in the former Serb province’s 1998-1999 war for independence.In the Nile dispute, on June 17 the White House put the onus on Ethiopia, urging the country to strike “a fair deal.”In response, Ethiopia took advantage of the fact that the AU chairmanship passed from Egypt to South Africa this year and asked Ramaphosa to get involved. The negotiations have now gone back to the AU, where several attempts years earlier to resolve the issue failed.“If the Security Council starts addressing developmental issues, outside of its mandate, it opens up a Pandora box and will be a stage for noise,” Ahmed told parliament on July 7.The latest moves have dimmed the chances of a US-brokered solution.“The US is no longer seen as an honest broker,” said Edward Hobey-Hamsher, a senior Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft. “Its role has come to an end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-entry-into-african-diplomacy-stumbles-over-nile-dispute/story-HCdxjLBhLJ1R9PIpMlalBO.html
10-07-2020||World||NCP standing committee is postponed yet again, Chinese power play in Nepal||The much-awaited standing committee meeting of Nepalese Communist Party (NCP) was postponed yet again for one week even as pressure is mounting on Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli within the party to demit office.According to sources based in Kathmandu and New Delhi, the standing committee meeting was ostensibly postponed on grounds of heavy rains, landslides and floods in different parts of the Himalayan Republic. It is understood that NCP Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda was against the postponing of the meeting till late last night but agreed in favour of postponement after he met top party leaders Madhav Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal.The postponement comes at a time when the Oli government has worked up the public sentiment yet again against India by citing a highly derogatory video by a private Indian news channel. While the cable TV operators pulled down some Indian TV channels in this response, the Oli government has virtually accused the Indian government for orchestrating the video clip and in turn rile up sentiments against New Delhi. “The safest bet for political survival in Nepal these days is to blame Indian government for all the wrongs. Everyone knows that Indian government does not exercise any influence over private media in India but this is a convenient political bullet to fire as it relieves pressure on PM Oli,” said a Nepal watcher.While Kathmandu is all up in arms against India, there is not even a word against Hou Yanqi, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, who is feted by all political leaders across ideological spectrum in the Himalayan nation. Tasked by Beijing to keep the NCP united at all costs, Ambassador Hou Yanqi met NCP Chairman Dahal on Thursday morning in a bid to keep PM Oli in power and the party united. It is understood that Dahal met Hou after a number of requests and meeting rescheduling from the Chinese side. “Dahal was avoiding meeting Hou despite repeated requests from the latter as he wanted the Chinese ambassador to gauge the mood of other party leaders like Nepal and Khanal as well as know Beijing’s aims and objectives,” said a senior NCP leader from Nepal.It is learnt that Dahal told the Chinese diplomat that she should convince PM Oli to demit office so that the Communist regime can be sustained for times to come in Nepal. He apparently told her that stepping down of Oli was the best and the last option to bring stability in the party and ensure long term healthy relations with China. On her part, Hou emphasised that Beijing’s main aim was to ensure the party does not break and that no NCP leader should rush towards that direction.However, the politics in Kathmandu as of now is headed towards binary option with either PM Oli quitting the post of co-chairman or PM or the party splitting between Oli supporters and detractors. Even though the political situation remains fluid, the massive clout or interference of China in Nepal politics is quite evident as Beijing is playing the politicians both overtly and covertly. This is something that should raise a red flag in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ncp-standing-committee-is-postponed-yet-again-chinese-power-play-in-nepal/story-ewxXjxErpvixuapN9BwTaM.html

Most of them are in prefectures on Kyushu, Japan’s third-largest main island.The damage has spread beyond Kyushu into central Japan’s scenic mountain villages known for hot springs and hiking.Search and rescue work continued in Kuma village, where nine people are missing and the effort has been delayed by deep floodwater and the risk of more mudslides. People isolated by the flooding are still being airlifted to safety.In the famous hot springs town of Yufuin in Oita prefecture, an innkeeper was found dead, and rescuers were searching for three of her family members still missing.Nearly 2,000 people were still stranded in 70 places, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. Rescue workers and the authorities have been in touch with most of those areas, though the extent of damage has not been fully known.The Meteorological Agency has issued evacuation advisories in Nagasaki and other areas on the Kyushu region due to continuing downpours. In all, more than 1.2 million people have been urged to evacuate, though it is not compulsory.The agency predicted up to 300 millimeters (11 inches) of rain on the southern island through Saturday.Suga urged residents in the affected regions to evacuate to designated facilities early and assured people that adequate virus safety measures are being used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-braces-for-more-heavy-rain-as-death-toll-due-to-floods-reaches-66/story-9HAGkuTKX6ZwNJA1dG1Q1J.html

The prompted a seven-hour search for the mayor in wooded hills, deploying more than 500 officers and rescue personnel, drones and sniffer dogs.It is one of the highest profile political deaths in South Korea since former President Roh Moo-hyun committed suicide in 2009 as police were investigating him and his family for suspected graft.Park, 64, was seen near a park in Seoul by surveillance cameras at 10:53 a.m. and was reported missing at 5:17 p.m., authorities said.Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency official Choi Ik-soo said in an early morning briefing that Park was discovered just after midnight on Friday by a rescue dog near a trail along a fortress wall in a mountainous area overlooking Seoul. He was found with his bag and phone, Choi said. He declined to comment on the cause of death but said police don’t suspect foul play. No will was found at site of the body’s discovery.Choi also said the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency had received a complaint on Wednesday about the mayor and that Park had been under investigation, without providing further details. National broadcasters SBS and KBS reported earlier that Park went missing after a staff member filed a sexual harassment claim against him this week.Seoul will install a memorial altar at its City Hall and Seo Jeong-hyup, a first vice mayor, is now its acting mayor. “I express my deep condolences to the citizens who may have fallen into sadness and confusion with sudden news,” Seo told a news briefing Friday.‘Unavoidable Situation’The mayor of Seoul -- a city of about 10 million people -- since 2011, Park was viewed as a contender to replace President Moon Jae-in when his single, five-year term ends. Both were members of the progressive Democratic Party, and the Seoul mayor is often considered the second-most powerful elected official in South Korea after the president.Park was re-elected to a four-year term as mayor in 2018 and had been a civil rights lawyer before entering politics, working on a landmark sexual harassment case and seeking justice for those who suffered under Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula.In recent months, Park was at the forefront of the country’s battle against the coronavirus.Seoul’s government had canceled his planned events for Thursday due to an “unavoidable situation” and that included a meeting that was to be held at 4 p.m., Yonhap and national broadcaster KBS reported.Born in 1956 and growing up in poverty, Park eventually became a student at prestigious Seoul National University. He took part in street protests against the authoritarian rule of former president Park Chung-hee, which led him to be arrested and expelled from one of South Korea’s top university in early 1970s.After finishing his studies at Dankook University, Park passed the national bar exam and eventually became a human rights lawyer.Park founded or oversaw several watchdog and philanthropic groups including People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, one of the largest liberal organizations that has fought for labor rights and reform of the sprawling chaebol conglomerates.(Updates with comments from acting mayor.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-s-missing-mayor-park-found-dead-after-massive-search/story-dT8diTkjSvkRAP3crBRTVP.html
10-07-2020||World||WHO promises ‘honest evaluation’ of how world handled Covid-19 pandemic||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday it was setting up an independent panel to review its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the response by governments.The announcement follows strong criticism by US President Donald Trump’s administration of the global agency’s role in the crisis - though the WHO said the review was not linked to the United States.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf have agreed to head the panel, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.“The magnitude of this pandemic, which has touched virtually everyone in the world, clearly deserves a commensurate evaluation, an honest evaluation,” Tedros told a virtual meeting with diplomats.The panel will provide an interim report to an annual meeting of health ministers in November and present a “substantive report” next May, he said.Trump has accused the WHO of being too close to China and not doing enough to question Beijing’s actions at the start of the crisis. Tedros has dismissed the suggestions and said his agency kept the world informed. Experts In May, Trump said the United States, the agency’s biggest donor, would pull out of the organisation unless there were real reforms, a threat he followed up on this week by giving a one-year notice of withdrawal.“The President has been clear that the WHO needs to get its act together. That starts with demonstrating significant progress and the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks with transparency and accountability,” a senior US official in Washington told Reuters on Thursday.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The WHO issued a statement saying the review was not linked to the United States and that its 194 member countries had asked in May for an evaluation of the global response. More than 12 million people are reported to have been infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and 548,429​ have died since the virus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown Law in Washington, DC, said the panel should not be “an inside job” driven by states close to the WHO, nor should it pander to what he called “Trump’s conspiracy theories”. “What is really vital is we have truly independent experts from a variety of disciplines that will honestly and frankly review the situation with COVID,” Gostin told Reuters.“Are they going to review China’s action, are they going to review WHO’s initial response to China, look at things like ... WHO’s power to independently verify states’ reports?,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-promises-honest-evaluation-of-how-world-handled-covid-19-pandemic/story-CiNd5eW3fwbjb2S2zQgzEM.html
10-07-2020||World||China warns citizens of ‘unknown pneumonia’ with higher fatality than Covid-19||The Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan has issued a warning about an unknown pneumonia sweeping through the central Asian country after more than 600 people died of pneumonia in June.In an advisory issued for its citizens living in the former Soviet Bloc country, the Chinese embassy said the new disease has a fatality rate “much higher” than Covid-19.Kazakhstan borders northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Also Watch | Covid death risk higher in elderly, men; Brazil press body sues BolsonaroThe “unknown pneumonia” in Kazakhstan caused 1,772 deaths in the first six months of the year, including 628 people in June alone, including Chinese citizens, the embassy said in a statement on its WeChat platform on Thursday.“The fatality rate of the disease is much higher than Covid-19,” read the embassy’s statement.It wasn’t immediately clear if Chinese officials had more information about the pneumonia or any specific reason to call it unknown: Kazakh media have only said it is pneumonia.Also Read: Kazakhstan denies Chinese reports of pneumonia deadlier than coronavirusIt was also not known if the WHO had been informed about the “unknown pneumonia”.“The Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan reminds Chinese nationals here to be aware of the situation and step up prevention to lower the infection risks,” the embassy statement said.According to Chinese state media, Kazakhstan’s healthcare minister said on Wednesday that the number of patients sickened by the pneumonia is two to three times more than those who have been infected with Covid-19.The country implemented a lockdown on March 16 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic; restrictions were lifted in May but reimposed following an increase in cases.President Kassim-Jomart Tokayev has said the country could be facing a second wave of infections.Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, said in a televised address on Wednesday that the situation was still serious, and it was too early to relax restrictions.He added the country was “in fact facing the second coronavirus wave coupled with a huge uptick in pneumonia cases”.Saule Kisikova, the health care department chief in the capital Nur-Sultan, told the news agency Kazinform: “Some 300 people diagnosed with pneumonia are being hospitalised every day.”China, according to a Reuters report, is a major investor in oil- and metals-rich Kazakhstan and is one of the main markets for its exports, dominated by commodities. Kazakhstan also makes money from Chinese goods carried across its territory to Europe.The Kazakhstan’s foreign ministry had summoned the Chinese ambassador in April to protest over an article on a Chinese website saying the country was keen to become part of China, the ministry said.It was a rare move as the two countries avoid criticising each other.It was during a lecture at a university in Kazakhstan that President Xi Jinping had first talked about the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), his ambitious inter-continental connectivity project, in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-citizens-of-unknown-pneumonia-with-higher-fatality-than-covid-19/story-j85OaOyFBuKI90UXM7yeXM.html

10-07-2020||World||Singaporeans begin voting with masks and gloves under Covid-19 cloud||Singaporeans wearing masks and gloves began casting their ballot on Friday under the cloud of the Covid-19 pandemic that is pushing the city-state’s economy towards its deepest recession and has made concerns over jobs the focus of the election.In power since independence in 1965, the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) is expected to carry Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to another comfortable, and probably final victory.The son of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding leader, Lee has held the premiership since 2004, but aged 68 he has already flagged his intention to step aside in coming years.Seen as a measure of approval for both the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis and the next generation of leaders, the poll results will be closely watched as even small shifts in the PAP’s popularity can lead to major policy changes.At one polling centre in a school on Friday, about 30 elderly people queued up before voting started and election officials were seen directing the crowd to wear masks and face shields.When concerns around immigration and jobs flared in 2011, the PAP polled a record-low 60% of the vote and tightened international hiring rules to address voters’ sensitivities.As the Asian trade and finance hub emerges from lockdown to face its deepest recession, these concerns are once again to the fore.“I think it’s ok to vote during a pandemic because the conditions aren’t that severe at this point and all necessary precautions are being taken,” said Malini Nathan, 42, a communications executive.“Issues I am concerned about are healthcare, job security and retirement,” Nathan said.Sample counts are expected soon after the close of polls at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) with final results due in the early hours of Saturday.Citizens have each been given a recommended voting window.SANITIZED There are just 2.65 million voters, and election organisers are counting on a fast, regimented and hygienic vote to minimise risks of coronavirus infections.Since easing a lockdown last month, the number of new daily cases crept back into double figures last week, excluding the migrant workers living in dormitories where infection rates have been far higher.Wearing masks is compulsory in public. And voters are expected to spend no more than five minutes in a polling station, where they will self-scan identity cards, sanitise their hands and pull on disposable gloves before receiving a ballot paper.Singapore is not the first country in Asia to hold elections during the pandemic - South Korea held parliamentary elections in April - but its mandatory ballot comes under strict conditions.Covid-19 patients and those under quarantine cannot vote, but a mobile polling team will bring the ballot box to the rooms of Singaporeans who have recently returned from overseas and are being isolated at hotels.The virus outbreak also constrained campaigning as candidates had to adhere to social distancing rules that limit groups to five, avoid shaking hands or fist bumping. Mass rallies - often attended by thousands - were banned. The city-state has one of the lowest Covid-19 fatality rates in the world, and initially earned widespread praise for its Covid-19 containment efforts.But subsequent mass outbreaks in cramped migrant worker dormitories stained that early success, and persuaded the government to keep schools and businesses closed for longer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singaporeans-begin-voting-with-masks-and-gloves-under-covid-19-cloud/story-pHlmKlVPxxd2RlC4VpboWL.html

10-07-2020||World||BlueLeaks: Germany seizes server hosting pilfered US police files||At the behest of the US government, German authorities have seized a computer server that hosted a huge cache of files from scores of US federal, state and local law enforcement agencies obtained in a Houston data breach last month. The server was being used by a WikiLeaks-like data transparency collective called Distributed Denial of Secrets to share documents — many tagged “For Official Use Only” — that shed light on US police practices. The data, dating back to 1996, include emails, audio and video files and police and FBI intelligence reports. DDoSecrets founder Emma Best said the data, dubbed “BlueLeaks,” comes from more than 200 agencies. It has been stripped of references to sexual assault cases and references to children, but names, phone numbers and emails of police officers were not redacted, said Best, who uses they/their pronouns. Best said that DDoSecrets obtained the data from an outside individual who sympathized with nationwide protests against police killings of unarmed Black people. Some of the files offer insights into the police response to those protests, they said. While hacking into computers and stealing data is a federal crime, US courts have consistently ruled that journalists may publish stolen documents as long as they are not involved in their theft. DDoSecrets says it is a journalistic organization that shares documents in the public interest. The documents came to light via a breach of Houston web-design company Netsential, which hosts portals for law enforcement agencies and “fusion centers,” state-run operations created after the 9/11 attacks to share threat intelligence with local and state police and private-sector partners. The prosecutor’s office in Zwickau, a German city near the Czech border, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the server was confiscated July 3 in the town of Falkenstein following a request from US authorities. The FBI declined to comment. A US Embassy spokesperson in Berlin did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. The Zwickau prosecutors’ statement said it would be up to German judicial authorities to decide whether to hand the server over to US authorities. It said it would not disclose the reason for the US request. Neither would a representative of Hetzner Online, the company that hosted the server. Best said they assume the seizure was related to the posting of the BlueLeaks documents. They said the files show “a lot of things that are entirely legal and normal and horrifying,” including police surveillance and police intelligence of dubious origin. Best said none were classified. The document dump helps expose “the United States’ overdeveloped police intelligence apparatus,” said Brendan McQuade, a criminology professor at the University of Southern Maine who has viewed the documents. The files do not include high-level intelligence but provide a window into the relationship between law enforcement at all levels, he said — one that he believes the FBI doesn’t want the public to see lest it ”add more fuel to the protests” against police brutality and racism in policing. Best said the files remain publicly accessible through more complicated means such as BitTorrent and the Tor network, both of which complicate censorship efforts. Best said the organization is now rebuilding its infrastructure for public access. “All they cost us is time,” they said. Shortly after DDoSecrets posted the data, Twitter permanently suspended the organization’s account for publishing links and images from the collection, citing a ban on the posting of hacked material. One US law enforcement agency affected by the breach is the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy. Its director, Judy Bradshaw, told The Associated Press the breach revealed names of students in academy courses and their drivers licenses, but no financial information. She said Netsential had scores of clients in law enforcement, where it was a strong niche provider. Netsential itself confirmed the breach in an undated statement on its bare-bones website and said it was assisting the investigation but would provide no further information “due to the sensitivity of client information.” Executives of the National Fusion Centers Association did not respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment on whether any sensitive investigations may have been compromised by the breach. But Maine State Police said in a statement on June 26 that the FBI was investigating and that affected bulletins may “contain identifying information, such as full name and date of birth of people under investigation by other law enforcement agencies.” It said they “may also involve individuals wanted for criminal activity.” DDoSecrets was created in late 2018 by Best, a journalist specializing in freedom-of-information petitions. It has worked on various investigations with established media organizations including the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and the US news organization McClatchy. Previous DDoSecrets releases include data on offshore Bahamas accounts used as tax havens, files hacked from Chilean police and data from a British provider of offshore financial services that has drawn comparisons, on a smaller scale, to the 2016 Panama Papers leak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blueleaks-germany-seizes-server-hosting-pilfered-us-police-files/story-JVCbRPANHcqbZyvxTcKuyI.html
10-07-2020||World||US will respond if Russia bounty reports are true, says Pentagon||Top Pentagon leaders told Congress on Thursday that reports of Russia offering Taliban militants bounties for killing Americans were not corroborated by defense intelligence agencies, but said they are looking into it and the US will respond if necessary. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said his military commanders heard initial reports on the bounties in January and he first saw an intelligence paper about it in February. While the threats were taken seriously, he said they have not yet been found credible. Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were testifying before the House Armed Services Committee on the role of the military during recent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd. Several House members asked about the Russian bounty reports. Milley said Russia and other nations have long worked against the US in Afghanistan, but the specific notion of bounties has not been proven. “If in fact there’s bounties directed by the government of Russia or any of their institutions to kill American soldiers, that’s a big deal,” he said. “I and the secretary and many others are taking it seriously, we’re going to get to the bottom of it, we’re going to find out if, in fact, it’s true. And if it is true we will take action.” The bulk of the hearing focused on the role of the National Guard soldiers during the civil unrest in support of law enforcement agencies. Esper said using the Guard was a better alternative than using active-duty forces as President Donald Trump had threatened. His stance is at odds with Trump, who had spoken of invoking the Insurrection Act in order to use active-duty forces on the streets of the nation’s capital during protests in late May and early June that included limited acts of violence, such as setting a fire in St. John’s Episcopal Church near the White House. Several active-duty units were put on alert but ultimately were not deployed in Washington. “Using active-duty forces in a direct civilian law enforcement role should remain a last resort, and exercised only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” Esper said, stressing that no active-duty military units engaged protesters or took a direct part in law enforcement in the District of Columbia or other places in the country. Esper and Milley, however, acknowledged there was confusion in the streets and it was often difficult to tell the difference between the Guard troops and the many law enforcement agencies who also had personnel in Washington. “You want a clear visual distinction,” said Milley, between “that which is military and that which is police.” And Esper said one thing officials are discussing is that the Guard loaned shields to law enforcement officers during the unrest. In the future, he said, they might want to cover the military police designation on the shields when they are loaned out, to make it clearer they are not military. Thursday was the first time Esper and Milley have testified before Congress since March 4, when they appeared to discuss the administration’s defense policy proposal. A few of the panel members were in the room, but many participated remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s push for an aggressive response to the civil unrest led to an extraordinary clash with Esper and Milley, who on June 1 accompanied the president when he walked from the White House to St. John’s Church on Lafayette Square, where he held up a Bible for photographers. That day, a National Guard helicopter was flown at extremely low altitude to help disperse protesters from the capital’s streets, prompting a Pentagon investigation into whether that was a proper use of military resources. Esper told the committee the Army has completed the helicopter probe and the results are under review. Esper drew Trump’s ire for telling a Pentagon news conference on June 3 that he opposed invoking the Insurrection Act to permit the president to use the armed forces to put down domestic civil unrest. Esper said he saw no need for such an extreme measure, a clear counterpoint to Trump’s threat to use force. Esper also had previously made known his regret at having accompanied Trump to the presidential photo opportunity in front of St. John’s on the day of the Lafayette Square confrontations. In his testimony Thursday, Esper alluded to his worry that the photo op episode could be seen as undermining his apolitical role. “As one of the country’s most respected institutions, we work to maintain the trust of the American people through our time-honoured commitment to our mission and core values, while remaining neutral and non-partisan in all matters,” he said. Milley in June expressed public regret that he also had been part of the scene with Trump. He said he had been wrong to stride in uniform with Trump after protesters had been cleared from Lafayette Square. Milley said his presence “created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.” “I should not have been there,” he told a National Defense University commencement ceremony.
