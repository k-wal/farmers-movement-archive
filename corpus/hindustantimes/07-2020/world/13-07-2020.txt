People may need boosting and one shot might not be sufficient,” she explains.The study is the first “longitudinal” research to have monitored antibody levels in patients and hospital workers for three months after symptoms emerged. The scientists drew on test results from 65 patients and six healthcare workers who tested positive for the virus, and a further 31 staff who volunteered to have regular antibody tests between March and June.“Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of Covid-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection,” notes the paper, which is yet to be peer-reviewed.The immune system has multiple ways to fight the coronavirus but if antibodies are the main line of defence, the findings suggest people could become reinfected in seasonal waves just like the common cold and other kinds of flu.“This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection,” the paper adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibody-immunity-to-covid-19-may-be-short-lived-uk-study/story-QnFEFmoVcsr4G6yj2OrnUK.html
13-07-2020||World||Body found in search of lake for ‘Glee’ star Naya Rivera||Authorities say a body has been found at the Southern California lake where “Glee” star Naya Rivera has been missing since last week. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Office says in a tweet that the body was found Monday morning at Lake Piru. There’s no information on whether the body has been identified but authorities plan an afternoon news conference. The “Glee” star disappeared July 8 after she took her young son out on a rented boat.A member of a team searching a Southern California lake for a missing TV star said Sunday that he’s confident his crew is getting a clearer idea of where in the lake to find her, a magazine reported.Robert Inglis of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office Search & Rescue Team told Us Weekly that Naya Rivera sent to a family member a picture of her 4-year-old son, Josey, in front of a cove before she disappeared July 8 after diving into Lake Piru.“There was a picture sent to a family member that showed the boy on the boat by a cove,” Inglis told the magazine. “We found where that cove was.”A time stamp on the photo shows it was taken 90 minutes to two hours before the boy was found alone on the pontoon boat, the magazine reported.Inglis told Us Weekly that the area where the photo was taken and the spot where the boat was found were starting points for authorities before the search was expanded.“We did send our dive members to those two locations and searched those extensively,” he told Us Weekly.Rivera remained missing as of Sunday night.Authorities said Thursday they believe Rivera, 33, drowned. Her son was found the boat.The boy told investigators that he and his mother went swimming and he got back on the boat, but “his mom never made it out of the water,” Sheriff’s Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said.Rivera began acting at a young age, but she rose to national attention playing a lesbian teen on “Glee,” which aired from 2009 until 2015 on Fox.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/body-found-in-search-of-lake-for-glee-star-naya-rivera/story-MXSe3RDl3aGdkhqjHifg1I.html
13-07-2020||World||More than 200 schools back lawsuit challenging Trump’s foreign student rule||More than 200 universities are backing a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s new restrictions on international students, arguing that the policy jeopardizes students’ safety and forces schools to reconsider fall plans they have spent months preparing.The schools have signed court briefs supporting Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as they sue U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in federal court in Boston. The lawsuit challenges a recently announced directive saying international students cannot stay in the U.S. if they take all their classes online this fall.A wide range of colleges and state and local officials are standing up to the policy, which faces mounting legal opposition. Massachusetts filed a federal suit Monday that was joined by Democratic attorneys general in 16 other states and the District of Columbia. Other suits have come from Johns Hopkins University and the state of California. The University of California system has said it will sue.A judge is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday in the case brought by Harvard and MIT. If the judge does not suspend the rule, colleges across the U.S. will have until Wednesday to notify ICE if they plan to be fully online this fall.The Department of Homeland Security and ICE have not yet responded to the suit.A brief filed Monday by 59 universities says the rule throws their plans into disarray with less than a month before some schools start the fall term. They challenged the policy’s legal grounds and say it forces schools across the nation to “choose between opening their campuses regardless of the public health risks, or forcing their international students to leave the country.”The group includes all of Harvard’s companions in the Ivy League and other prestigious schools including Stanford and Duke universities. They collectively enroll more than 213,000 international students.“These students are core members of our institutions,” the schools wrote. “They make valuable contributions to our classrooms, campuses and communities — contributions that have helped make American higher education the envy of the world.”The colleges are asking the court to block the rule as quickly as possible, saying it’s already being used to turn students away. Last Wednesday, a DePaul University student was prevented from entering the country after arriving in San Francisco, according to the filing. Harvard previously said one of its students from Belarus was turned away from a flight at an airport in Minsk last week.If the policy is upheld, schools could forced to reconsider their fall plans, the filing says. Princeton last week said first-year students and juniors could live on campus this fall, while sophomores and seniors would replace them during the spring semester. But that plan was based on the understanding that foreign students could continue remote learning from the U.S., the filing said.“Princeton now may be forced to reassess its plan, with just weeks to go before the fall semester, lest sophomore and senior international students be forced to leave the country — and potentially be unable to return for the spring,” according to the brief.A separate coalition of 180 colleges filed a brief saying colleges were “blindsided” by the policy. The group, known as the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, said it was a reversal of a March 13 directive from ICE that waived limitations around online education for foreign students “for the duration of the emergency.” They point to data suggesting that the number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. is higher now than it was in March.“All seem to agree the emergency remains ongoing, but ICE’s policy has inexplicably changed,” the group wrote.The directive also stands to hurt colleges financially, the group wrote. International students typically pay the highest tuition rates and rarely are eligible for scholarships. The alliance said many colleges risk losing millions of dollars over the policy, including Northern Virginia Community College, which estimates it could lose nearly $10 million in tuition from foreign students.A separate brief filed by the Princeton Theological Seminary says the policy would bring “crippling consequences” from a funding perspective. The seminary said its international ties include many foreign donors who would find the guidance “such a shocking affront that PTS’ relationships with those donors may never recover.”The suit is also being backed by 26 cities and counties that say the policy would damage their economies. Those range from New York City, which says international students contribute $3 billion per year to its economy, to Iowa City, Iowa, which says its 2,500 resident international students contribute millions of dollars a year.Briefs of support have also been filed by scientific associations, student governments, education unions and 71 higher education associations.Under the new rule, international students will be forced to leave the U.S. or transfer to another college if their schools operate entirely online this fall. New visas will not be issued to students at those schools, ICE said, and others at schools offering a mix of online and in-person courses will be barred from taking all of their classes online.It would apply even if an outbreak forces schools to shift classes entirely online mid-term, according to the guidance.The policy was issued the same day Harvard announced that its first-years would be invited to campus but that all undergraduate classes will be held online. The policy faces other legal challenges from California and Johns Hopkins University. Massachusetts’ attorney general has announced that she also plans to sue.The suit from Harvard and MIT argues that ICE issued the policy without offering any justification and without allowing the public to respond. It also says the agency is breaking from its March 13 promise to provide flexibility during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-200-schools-back-lawsuit-challenging-trump-s-foreign-student-rule/story-WCbhJq35llVfRI035DktTL.html
13-07-2020||World||Justin Trudeau apologizes for not recusing himself from decision||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Monday for not recusing himself from a Cabinet decision to award a contract to a charity his family did paid work for.Trudeau announced last month a grant for students having trouble finding work due to the pandemic.The almost billion-dollar program came under scrutiny after it was revealed that We Charity, an organization Trudeau’s family has worked for, was chosen to administer it. Trudeau’s wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined $300,000 Canadian (US$221,000) for speaking at a number of WE events.“I made a mistake in not recusing immediately from the discussions, given our family’s history. I am sincerely sorry for not having done that,” Trudeau said. “The mistake we made was on me. I take responsibility for it.”Trudeau said he knew his family worked with the charity, but said he was unaware of how much they had been paid.“I deeply regret that I have brought my mother into this situation. That is unfair to her,” he said.Canada’s ethics commissioner in investigating Trudeau over the matter. It is the third ethics investigation Trudeau has faced.Under pressure, the government and WE on July 3 terminated their deal, which had promised the organization up to $19 million Canadian (US$14 million). Students could volunteer up to 500 hours of work with community organizations to earn the maximum $5,000 Canadian (US$3,668) toward their postsecondary education costs.Canada’s federal ethics commissioner said Trudeau violated conflict of interest rules in 2016 when he vacationed over Christmas at the private Bahamian island owned by the Aga Khan. He was not sanctioned or penalized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-apologizes-for-not-recusing-himself-from-decision/story-W4AUmBvh5UQae61K30gqsM.html
13-07-2020||World||New York braces for searing temperatures as heat shifts north||The oppressive heat blanketing the southern U.S. from California to Florida should start to wind down Tuesday. Unfortunately for other parts of the country, it’ll be shifting north and east over the next two weeks.New York will likely see temperatures above 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) starting this weekend and continuing into next week, according to Bradley Harvey, a meteorologist with Maxar in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Washington will hit the 90s Monday and stay there through next week.“By next week the heat will be around full force” in the Northeast, said Paul Walker, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. “It looks like it could be around for a while,”The searing temperatures have already knocked off daily records across the country. Excessive heat warnings currently cover large parts of California, Arizona, Texas and Louisiana, with advisories filling in the gaps and extending the sultry reach of the hot spell to Florida, the National Weather Service said.In the past seven days, 750 daily heat records have been broken or tied, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. The temperature hasn’t dropped below 90 in Phoenix since July 7 and daily highs there have been 110 or more since July 4. Even Maine has seen record highs.“It’s bad when Maine gets in on it,” said David Roth, a senior branch forecaster at the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.Texas ElectricityOppressive temperatures are expected to spur record electricity demand in Texas Monday, with usage peaking at more than 75,000 megawatts at about 4 p.m. local time, according to the state’s grid operator. That would top last year’s record of 74,820 megawatts in August.The heat is now expected to swing north and east, entrenching the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast from July 18 to 27 with temperatures reaching 5 to 8 degrees above normal, Matt Rogers, president of the Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a note to clients.That will bring stress to corn and soybeans across the southern Midwest, including parts of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with Maxar.For much of the U.S., including New York and the Northeast, July is the hottest month. New York’s Central Park has reached 90 degrees four times so far this month. The average since 1869 is 6 days at 90 or above and the record is 20 days set in 1993, according to the National Weather Service.As the Northeast braces for more sweltering weather, the southern states are ready to put it behind them.“Today is apparently the peak of it,” said Roth. “Tomorrow will be slightly less bad.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-braces-for-searing-temperatures-as-heat-shifts-north/story-ITjFOLAKuF6JMLP9R0euXO.html
13-07-2020||World||Fact-check: Donald Trump team’s false comfort on schools, coronavirus||President Donald Trump’s aides are misrepresenting the record on kids and the coronavirus as they push for schools to reopen.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday inaccurately characterized what the chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said on the matter. A day earlier, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also was wrong in stating that the research shows there is no danger “in any way” if kids are in school.No such conclusion has been reached.Their comments came as Trump continued to spread falsehoods about a pandemic that is taking a disproportionate hit on the U.S. and is not under control.A look at recent claims and reality:SCHOOLSMcENANY: “Just last week you heard Dr. Redfield say that children are not spreading this.” — Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox and Friends”THE FACTS: No, Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC director, did not say that. He said officials don’t have evidence that children are “driving” infections at this point. But they have not ruled out that children spread the virus to adults.Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, said last week the government doesn’t have enough data to show whether and to what degree kids can infect others.The bulk of data has been collected from adults and particularly from those who were sick, leaving questions about children still unanswered, Birx said. She said children under 10 are the least tested age group.The officials did not reach a conclusion that “children are not spreading this.” Nor does the evidence prove that they are.The government has counted tens of thousands of children who have been infected with the virus and in some cases hospitalized. Overall, public health officials believe the virus is less dangerous to children than adults.___DEVOS: “There’s nothing in the data that suggests that kids being in school is in any way dangerous.” — Sunday on “Fox News Sunday.”THE FACTS: Not so. Like McEnany, DeVos is suggesting certainty where none exists as she urged schools to provide full-time, in-person learning in the fall even with community transmission of COVID-19 rising in many parts of the U.S.It’s premature to claim that there are no risks “in any way” seen in data. How significant a risk has not been established.The CDC in April studied the pandemic’s effect on different ages in the U.S. and reviewed preliminary research in China, where the coronavirus started. It said social distancing is important for children, too, for their own safety and that of others.“Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group,” the CDC study says.In May, the CDC also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but life-threatening inflammatory reaction in some children who’ve had the coronavirus. The condition had been reported in more than 100 children in New York and in some kids in several other states and in Europe, with some deaths.The agency’s current guidance for communities on the reopening of K-12 schools says the goal is to “help protect students, teachers, administrators, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19.” The guidance says “full sized, in person classes” present the “highest risk” of spreading the virus and advises face masks, spreading out of desks, staggered schedules, eating meals in classrooms instead of the cafeteria and “staying home when appropriate” to help avert spikes in virus cases.___VIRUSTRUMP: “Deaths in the U.S. are way down.” — tweet on July 6, one of at least a half dozen heralding a drop in daily deaths from the virus.THE FACTS: It’s true that deaths dipped as infections spiked in many parts of the country. But deaths lag sickness. And now, the widely expected upturn in U.S. deaths has begun, driven by fatalities in states in the South and West, according to data analyzed by The Associated Press.“It’s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday. He advised Americans: “Don’t get yourself into false complacency.”The new AP analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day rolling average for daily reported deaths in the U.S. increased to 664 on Friday from 578 two weeks ago, as deaths rose in more than half the states. That’s still well below the lethal numbers of April.“It’s consistently picking up,” said William Hanage, a Harvard University infectious diseases researcher. “And it’s picking up at the time you’d expect it to.”___TRUMP: “For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!” — tweet Thursday.THE FACTS: His notion that infections are high only because the U.S. diagnostic testing has increased is false. His own top public health officials have shot down this line of thinking. Infections are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down.It’s true that increased testing also contributes to the higher numbers. When you look harder, you’re going to see more. But the testing has uncovered a worrisome trend: The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country.That’s a clear demonstration that sickness is spreading and that the U.S. testing system is falling short.“A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,” says the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic.Americans are being confronted with long lines at testing sites, often disqualified if they are not showing symptoms and, if tested, forced to wait many days for results.___TRUMP on the coronavirus: “We have the lowest Mortality Rate in the World.” – tweet Tuesday.THE FACTS: This statement is wholly unsupported.An accurate death rate is impossible to know. Every country tests and counts people differently, and some are unreliable in reporting cases. Without knowing the true number of people who become infected, it cannot be determined what portion of them die.Using a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, you can compare the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases. That count shows the U.S. experiencing more deaths as a percentage of cases than most other countries now being hit hard with the pandemic. The statistics look better for the U.S. when the list is expanded to include European countries that were slammed early on by the virus but now appear to have it under control. Even then, the U.S. is not shown to be among the best in avoiding death.Such calculations, though, do not provide a reliable measurement of actual death rates, because of the variations in testing and reporting, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not meant to be such a measure.The only way to tell how many cases have gone uncounted, and therefore what percentage of infected people have died from the disease, is to do another kind of test comprehensively, of people’s blood, to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus. Globally, that is only being done in select places.___ECONOMYTRUMP: “Job growth is biggest in history.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Yes, but only because it is following the greatest job losses in history, by far.The U.S. economy shed more than 22 million jobs in March and April, wiping out nearly a decade of job growth in just two months, as the viral outbreak intensified and nearly all states shut down nonessential businesses. Since then, 7.5 million, or about one-third, of those jobs have been recovered as businesses reopened. Even after those gains, the unemployment rate is 11.1%, down from April and May but otherwise higher than at any point since the Depression.___TRUMP: “Economy and Jobs are growing MUCH faster than anyone (except me!) expected.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Not really. It’s true that May’s gain of 2.7 million jobs was unexpected. Economists had forecast another month of job losses. But most economists projected hiring would sharply rebound by June or at the latest July, once businesses began to reopen. The gains kicked in a month earlier than forecast.Now, though, coronavirus cases are rising in most states, imperiling the climb back. In six states representing one-third of the economy — Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, and Texas — governors are reversing their reopening plans, and the restart is on pause in 15 other states. Such reversals are keeping layoffs elevated and threatening to weaken hiring.___TRUMP TEAM ON BIDENTRUMP campaign ad, playing out a scenario where a person needing help calls the police in a Biden presidency and gets a voice recording: “You have reached the 911 police emergency line. Due to defunding of the police department, we’re sorry but no one is here to take your call.” The ad closes with the message: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”THE FACTS: Biden has not joined the call of protesters who demanded “defund the police” after Floyd’s killing. He’s proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.“I don’t support defunding the police,“ Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support tying federal aid to police based on whether “they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.”Biden’s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for “training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths” and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve.Specifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs.That adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement.Biden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime.Democrats, meanwhile, have pointed to Trump’s repeated proposals in the administration’s budget to cut community policing and mediation programs at the Justice Department. Congressional Republicans say the program can be effectively merged with other divisions, but Democrats have repeatedly blocked the effort. The program has been used to help provide federal oversight of local police departments.Despite proposed cuts, Attorney General William Barr last month said that the department would use the COPS program funding to hire over 2,700 police officers at nearly 600 departments across the country.___VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Biden “said that he would, quote, absolutely cut funding for law enforcement.” — remarks Thursday in Philadelphia.REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE email: “In the wake of rioting, looting, and tragic murders ripping apart communities across the country, Joe Biden said ‘Yes, absolutely’ he wants to defund the police.” — email Wednesday from Steve Guest, RNC’s rapid response director.THE FACTS: That’s misleading, a selective use of Biden’s words on the subject.The RNC email links to an excerpted video clip of Biden’s conversation with liberal activist Ady Barkan, who endorsed Biden on Wednesday after supporting Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries. A full recording of that conversation, provided by the Biden campaign to The Associated Press, shows he again declined to support defunding police.Barkan raises the issue of police reform and asks whether Biden would funnel money into social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing to help reduce civilian interactions with police.Biden responds that he is calling for increased funding for mental health providers but “that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police” and that both approaches are needed, including more money for community police.Asked again by Barkan, “so we agree that we can redirect some of the funding,” Biden then answers “absolutely yes.”Biden then gives the caveat that he means “not just redirect” federal money potentially but “condition” it on police improvements.“If they don’t eliminate choke holds, they don’t get (federal) grants, if they don’t do the following, they don’t get any help,” Biden replied.“The vast majority of all police departments are funded by the locality, funded by the municipality, funded by the state,” he added. “It’s only the federal government comes in on top of that, and so it says you want help, you have to do the following reforms.”___BIDEN ON TRUMPBIDEN: “President Trump claimed to the American people that he was a wartime leader, but instead of taking responsibility, Trump has waved a white flag, revealing that he ordered the slowing of testing and having his administration tell Americans that they simply need to ‘live with it.’’ – statement Wednesday marking the rise in U.S. coronavirus infections to more than 3 million.THE FACTS: To be clear, the government did not slow testing on the orders of the president.Trump at first denied he was joking when he told a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally on June 20 that he said “to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please’“ because “they test and they test.” Days later he said he didn’t really mean it.In any event, a succession of his public-health officials testified to Congress that the president never asked them to slow testing and that they were doing all they could to increase it. But testing remains markedly insufficient.___Associated Press writers Mike Stobbe and Nicky Forster in New York and Lindsey Tanner in Chicago contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fact-check-donald-trump-team-s-false-comfort-on-schools-coronavirus/story-KeQdsZbz1Qa2nY9Y3IbmaP.html
13-07-2020||World||Time to make masks mandatory? It’s not just a US debate||Amid pervasive backsliding on social distancing, Britain and France are weighing whether to require people to wear masks in public places.Scientists say the two countries’ governments should have done so ever since they started easing lockdowns — like many other European nations did – instead of exposing their populations to the risk of infections from mass dance parties and summer vacationers who think there’s no longer anything to worry about.Whether to make masks mandatory isn’t just a matter of debate in the United States, where infection rates are still climbing fast.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged U.K. residents Monday to wear face coverings in shops and other tight indoor spaces — but stopped short of making it compulsory.Critics have accused Johnson’s government of failing to provide clarity on mask-wearing in the days since he began backtracking on its previous advice that suggested face covers were not necessary. After the prime minister then was photographed wearing one in a shop, government ministers appeared on TV urging personal choice in the mask issue.Meanwhile, France’s government said Monday it’s considering requiring masks in all indoor public places amid signs of a small rise in confirmed virus cases – and a big drop in public vigilance. French scientists have pushed for such a requirement in recent days as families crisscross the country for summer vacations, but the government has remained cautious.Local mayors have already started requiring masks, notably in the Mediterranean city of Nice, where images of thousands of people dancing at an outdoor DJ performance this weekend provoked nationwide concern.Elsewhere in Europe, where the virus curve largely flattened out months ago, most governments made masks mandatory as soon as they started reopening their economies, requiring their use in shops and other indoor public spaces and on public transportation. Some nations have imposed mask requirements as new outbreaks emerged in recent days or weeks.Britain and France, which have reported some of the world’s highest numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths, took a more relaxed attitude, recommending masks but not requiring them.At least until now.“As the virus comes down in incidence and we have more and more success, I think face coverings are a kind of extra insurance we can all use to stop it coming back and stop it getting out of control again,’’ Johnson said. “To be absolutely clear, I do think that face coverings do have a real value in confined spaces and I do think the public understands that.”Mask requirements could help the government get the country back on track from the severe downturn — in March and April alone, the U.K. economy shrank 25%. Many economists think unemployment could more than double to over 3 million this year, levels last seen in the 1980s.Speaking with reporters during a visit to the London Ambulance Service, Johnson said people “should start to think about getting back to work” if their employers have made their workplaces safe against the coronavirus.Pressed on whether masks should be mandatory, Johnson replied, “We will be looking at the guidance. We will be saying a little bit more in the next few days.”In France, restaurants, schools and many businesses reopened weeks ago. While mask use and social distancing were relatively widespread during the country’s strict home confinement period and initially after it ended, many French people have since returned to the old normal — forgoing masks, resuming cheek-kissing and gathering in crowded cafes.While scientists were divided on mask use early in the pandemic, new knowledge about the virus has changed that.“A number of new studies and systematic reviews have persuaded most researchers and public health officials that they should be worn, including those who were skeptical a few months ago. Growing evidence on potential airborne transmission of the virus adds to the case for face coverings,” University of Edinburgh public health professor Linda Bauld said. “Suggesting it is ‘good manners’ to wear one is insufficient.”In the streets of Paris, many — but not all — welcomed the idea of requiring masks.The French government “should’ve made it mandatory indoors right away” like in neighboring Spain and Italy, said 50-year-old Paulo Lorenzo, who says he usually wears a mask when he leaves the house. “Now it’s going to be a bit complicated.”However, Tiago Rodriguez, 23, thinks wearing a mask should be a personal choice. “We shouldn’t be forced to wear something if we don’t feel comfortable with it or if we have trouble breathing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-to-make-masks-mandatory-it-s-not-just-a-us-debate/story-moStVAI5z2U5X2vTEPtq8H.html

Africa has the most as a percentage of the population, UN researchers found, with nearly 20% of the continent’s people undernourished. That compares to 8.3% in Asia and 7.4% in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the report.With progress in fighting hunger stalled even before the pandemic, the report’s authors said that Covid-19 “is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems’’ - defined in the report as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food.The UN agencies said a “staggering” 3 billion people or more can’t afford to acquire the food needed for a healthy diet.More most be done, including “ensuring all people’s access not only to food, but to nutritious foods that make up a healthy diet,” they said.As a result of the pandemic, food supply disruptions, lost livelihoods and the inability of people working abroad to send remittances home to their families mean it is “even more difficult for the poorer and vulnerable populations to have access to healthy diets,’’ the UN agencies concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-could-push-tens-of-millions-into-chronic-hunger-un-report/story-QbTMqrxX4tfmR0IWgt4gtM.html
13-07-2020||World||Journalists’ role crucial in Covid-19 pandemic: UK||The police, law officers, ministers, editors and journalists unions came together in the UK for the first meeting on Monday of a new committee to make sure journalists can operate without fear of violence or abuse, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Officials said that recent events in the UK such as attacks on journalists reporting on protests and threats to members of the press in Northern Ireland have exposed the fact that those who play an important role in the democratic process are not always safe.The committee, called the National Committee for the Safety of Journalists, brings together representatives from government, journalism, policing, prosecution services and the civil service to work in collaboration to make sure that journalists are free from threats and violence.Minister for media and data John Whittingdale said: “The UK has been at the forefront of the global campaign for media freedom but it is also essential that we protect the safety of journalists at home”.“The rise in misinformation during the pandemic has highlighted once again the valuable role played by journalists working for reputable news organisations who produce accurate and balanced high-quality journalism. We must do all we can to ensure that they can carry this out free from threats and intimidation,” he said.Members of the committee include representatives of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Crown Prosecution Service, Reporters without Borders, Society of Editors, the BBC’s head of Newsgathering, National Union of Journalists (NUJ), and campaign group Index on Censorship.Observers of the committee’s process include UNESCO, BBC World Service, International Federation of Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists.Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary, said: “Attacks on journalists are on the rise in the UK and around the globe. Increasingly the press is harassed and singled out for attack while doing their job”.“Unfettered journalism is a vital part of our democracy and the NUJ looks forward to working with the committee to protect a free media and end the impunity of crimes against journalists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-role-crucial-in-covid-19-pandemic-uk/story-3eNoALjZFZ1eDWtpKSSIaM.html
13-07-2020||World||World hunger worsening amid coronavirus pandemic; nearly 690 million people hungry: UN report||Nearly one in nine people in the world are going hungry, with the coronavirus pandemic exacerbating already worsening trends this year, according to a United Nations report published Monday.Economic slowdowns and climate-related shocks are pushing more people into hunger, while nutritious foods remain too expensive for many, contributing not only to undernourishment, but to growing rates of obesity in adults and children.“After decades of long decline, the number of people suffering from hunger has been slowly increasing since 2014,” read The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World annual report.Beyond ensuring enough food, food must be nutritious, the study underlined, citing costly “health and environmental consequences” of sub-par diets. Nearly 690 million people, or 8.9 percent of people around the globe, are hungry, the UN found. That number rose by 10 million people in just one year to 2019, and by 60 million in the past five years, found the study, which said eradicating hunger by 2030 - a goal set five years ago - will be impossible if trends continue.By 2030, over 890 million people could be affected by hunger, or 9.8 percent of the world’s population, it estimated. Five United Nations agencies co-authored the report: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Last year, the report estimated over 820 million hungry, but estimates were recalculated following revised data from China for prior years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-hunger-worsening-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-nearly-690-million-people-hungry-un-report/story-cthWjYMJgrKPAMiT40eWaO.html
13-07-2020||World||Taliban kill 11 in assault on Afghan intelligence compound||Taliban insurgents launched a complex attack on an intelligence compound in northern Afghanistan on Monday that began with a suicide bombing and killed at least 11 intelligence agency personnel, officials said.The attack took place in Aybak, the capital of the Samangan province. Sediq Azizi, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said another 63 people were wounded in the attack and the ensuing clashes.A suicide bomber struck the compound, followed by two insurgents who opened fire. Both were killed in the gunbattle, Azizi said. The blast from the initial bombing could be heard miles (kilometers) away and damaged several nearby buildings.Abdul Khalil Musadiq, a provincial hospital chief, said many of those wounded were civilians, including children.The Taliban claimed the attack. The insurgents have continued to regularly target Afghan security forces despite signing a peace agreement with the U.S. in February that was intended to pave the way for an end to decades of war.On Sunday, the Taliban attacked checkpoints in the northern Kunduz province, killing at least 14 Afghan security forces, according to Esmatullah Muradi, a spokesman for the provincial governor.The Taliban said they were behind the attacks but claimed government forces fired mortar shells in response, hitting civilian homes — a claimed dismissed by the Defense Ministry.The Taliban and government forces have been trading blame over a recent surge in violence across Afghanistan — even as efforts continue to try and bring about the start of direct peace talks between the government and the insurgents.President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack in Samangan and accused the Taliban of trying to strengthen their hand ahead of any negotiations.The Taliban accuse government forces of targeting them in their homes, with their families bearing the brunt of those operations. The government says the insurgents continue to attack security forces and civilians.___Associated Press writer Tameem Akhgar in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-kill-11-in-assault-on-afghan-intelligence-compound/story-aaM854P7c2J2ctYoabsdwJ.html
13-07-2020||World||Coronavirus in 2 foreign arrivals raises alarm in Thailand||Health authorities in Thailand are seeking to trace the contacts of two recent foreign arrivals in the country who were infected with the coronavirus and may have violated quarantine rules.The two cases, an Egyptian military officer and the 9-year-old child of a diplomat from Africa, surfaced as Thailand marked seven weeks with no local transmissions of the coronavirus. With few foreigners allowed to legally enter the country, all other recent cases have involved Thai nationals repatriated from abroad.That recently arrived foreigners were cleared for entry despite testing and quarantine procedures meant to keep them isolated has caused concern as Thailand considers how and when to reopen on a larger scale to foreign tourists.The state Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration announced Monday that a member of an Egyptian military team that made stopovers last week at U-Tapao airport in eastern Thailand tested positive for the disease.The Egyptian group arrived in Thailand via the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan on the night of July 8 and flew to Chengdu in China and back on July 9.They were tested for coronavirus on July 10 and that same day members of the group visited several public locations, including a mall, in Rayong, the province where U-Tapao airport is located.By the time the results of the infected man’s test were processed on July 11, the Egyptian team had departed for home.Thai health authorities said they are tracing any contacts the Egyptian might have had during the visit, but have not announced any specific locations. The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that Rayong’s governor has ordered the floors of the hotel where the Egyptian delegation stayed to be sealed, and two hotel staff who delivered room service to them to be quarantined.The announcement of the case drew criticism on social media, both for the apparent laxity in enforcing isolation rules, and for failing to let the public know where the infected Egyptian visitor may have been.The announcement of the Egyptian case came after the daughter of a foreign diplomat who came with her family from Sudan tested positive for the coronavirus. The family left Sudan on July 7 and reportedly tested negative on arrival in Bangkok, but she was retested after showing symptoms and then tested positive.The family had been staying in a condominium in Bangkok where health authorities will now investigate any possible spread of the disease. Diplomats, unlike ordinary foreigners entering Thailand, do not have to stay at state quarantine facilities, but the rules guiding their quarantine condition are not detailed.Thailand in early April banned scheduled passenger flights from abroad, but last week began allowing in foreign visitors on a controlled basis, limiting entry to those with existing family or work ties to the country, students, technical experts for businesses, investors and specially invited VIPs.The number of foreign visitors allowed into the country each day is limited to 200, and they are supposed to travel on repatriation flights bringing Thai citizens home. All returnees, foreign and Thai, are subject to varying degrees of quarantine.Thailand has had 3,220 cases of the coronavirus, including 58 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-2-foreign-arrivals-raises-alarm-in-thailand/story-OAcHIUhijjOL47qLKDD6XI.html
13-07-2020||World||Italian banks most exposed to coronavirus-hit sectors, risking capital||Italian banks have the highest portion of loans to industries suffering the most from the coronavirus pandemic, making their capital buffers more vulnerable to any deterioration in asset quality.Credito Emiliano SpA, Banco BPM SpA, BPER Banca SpA and Unione di Banche Italiane SpA top the list of more than 100 European banks exposed to industries badly hurt by the crisis, according to a research conducted by Eric Dor, director of economic studies at the IESEG School of Management in Lille, France.“Loans to depressed sectors by several Italian banks are more than four times larger than their CET1 equity, so their capital would be wiped out if 25% of their loans default,” Dor said in a phone interview. The sectors suffering the most are wholesale and retail trade, construction, manufacturing, accommodation and food service, as well as transportation and storage, according to the research.A 10% depreciation of the loans to the vulnerable sectors would hit capital ratios very hard at Credito Emiliano, Banco BPM, BPER, and UBI, according to the research, which cites data from the European Banking Authority.RCI in France, Bankinter SA in Spain, Piraeus Bank SA, Eurobank SA and Alpha Bank AE in Greece and Hamburg Commercial Bank in Germany are the most exposed in their respective countries.While some of the banks are protected by fairly high capital levels, some have a much smaller margin of error. Those include Credito Emiliano, Banco BPM, BPER Banca, Bankinter and Piraeus Bank, according to the research.“Some banks may need to be recapitalized in such a scenario, but I think this is a manageable situation, because most of the largest lenders are well capitalized after the cleanups of recent years, and are able to face a big increase of loan loss provisions,” Dor said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-banks-most-exposed-to-coronavirus-hit-sectors-risking-capital/story-gJQft3ixXLt3qM1FFhGLIK.html

13-07-2020||World||China buying ‘practically zero’ Chilean salmon after Covid scare||Chinese demand for Chilean salmon is “practically zero” after Beijing raised concerns about Covid-19 risks in imported seafood, according to industry group Salmon Chile.Even though Chinese officials indicated there were no official restrictions on Chilean salmon, consumers in the Asian nation remain wary after authorities initially traced an outbreak of the virus to a chopping board used by a seller of imported fish.Those fears are set to grow after the detection this week of Covid-19 in Ecuadorian shrimp, Salmon Chile President Arturo Clement said. Most authorities and health experts say there’s no evidence that food can transmit the virus.“There has been a psychosis with the issue, therefore Chinese demand went to zero and hasn’t recovered,” he said in an interview Friday. “There’s confusion in the market, which causes people to stop consuming seafood.”Some shipments that Chilean producers had already sent to China are stuck there, while others were redirected to other markets. China typically buys about 40,000 tons of Chilean salmon a year, making it the South American country’s fifth largest customer, trailing the U.S., Japan, Brazil and Russia.Brazilian and Russian demand for Chilean salmon has also dropped in the pandemic, with prices sinking and producers facing losses, he said. U.S. demand is the one saving grace.“In the end, the only open market we have is the U.S., which is far bigger, but that has put enormous pressure” on prices, he said.Today, Chilean salmon farms are operating at 90% capacity after implementing a series of Covid-19 protocols. Still, volume in the first half of the year was 4% higher than the same period last year, Clement said. Chile is the second-largest producer of farmed salmon. Norway is the biggest.For Chilean producers, the second quarter was grim, with a 40% drop in prices signaling losses for all operators, he said. Fortunately, the industry is coming out of three or four good years, meaning farms are well positioned to absorb the blow, with a recent uptick in prices helping, Clement said.The Chilean salmon industry, which employs tens of thousands of people, has managed to keep Covid-19 cases to just two in farming centers and three at processing plants partly because it was already using masks, gloves and special clothing before the pandemic, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-buying-practically-zero-chilean-salmon-after-covid-scare/story-w3hMk7iPddqv1WSA0CoyOO.html
13-07-2020||World||China sanctions US officials including senators Cruz, Rubio over Xinjiang issue||China on Monday announced tit-for-tat sanctions against four US officials including senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials over the treatment of the Uyghur community in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.“China has decided to impose sanctions on four US officials and an institution who have acted viciously on issues related to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) as a reciprocal measure against relevant moves made earlier by the US,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Monday.The spokesperson said the sanctions are against senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, US Representative Chris Smith, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.Tenuous at the best of times, ties between the US and China have been frayed with the two countries at loggerheads, most recently over the origins of the coronavirus. The other contentious issues between Washignton and Beijing include an ongoing trade war, Taiwan, the South China Sea – where Washington has dispatched two of its super aircraft carriers, the status of Hong Kong, the tit-for-tat visa restrictions over Tibet and the human rights situation in the remote northwestern province of Xinjiang.Rubio and Cruz, both from President Donald Trump-led Republican Party, have sponsored legislation that would punish China’s actions in Xinjiang while Smith has been a vocal critic of China on issues ranging from Xinjiang to the coronavirus.“The US actions seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations and seriously damage Sino-U.S. relations,” Hua said at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.“China will make further responses based on how the situation develops,” she said without elaborating.Last week, Washington said the sanctioned Chinese officials included Chen Quanguo, the Communist party secretary of Xinjiang, and Zhu Hailun, who helped oversee policy in the province.The US sanctions also target Wang Mingshan, head of the Xinjiang public security bureau, and Huo Liujun, a former head of the bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-us-officials-including-senators-cruz-rubio-over-xinjiang-issue/story-TOuUu79aKrEKsNVBUUKUpN.html
13-07-2020||World||New uniform, easier UK visa norms from January 1: Priti Patel||A new points-based immigration system that treats EU and non-EU citizens alike and creates new routes for talent and healthcare professionals to come and work in the UK was confirmed in a ministerial statement by home secretary Priti Patel on Monday.The system will take effect from January 1, a day after the Brexit transition period ends on December 31. The statement confirms post-Brexit plans announced earlier by the Boris Johnson government, many of which are likely to be welcomed by Indian professionals.Chair of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) UK India Business Forum, Jim Bligh said: “Indian businesses welcome the UK’s new points-based immigration. It’s positive that the UK is seeking to attract highly-skilled nationals from across the world, regardless of nationality”.“Across all sectors, Indian businesses bring in highly skilled nationals from around the world to help UK plc grow and compete. From high tech to haute cuisine, engineering to drug design, a smooth, skills-focused immigration system should help Indian companies across the economy to flourish in Britain in the years ahead”, he added.The immigration routes described by officials as “new, simplified”, include a new Health and Care Visa for key health professionals will make it easier and cheaper for health professionals to work in the UK; a new graduate route opening in Summer 2021 will allow international students to stay in the UK once they have successfully completed their studies: students who have completed undergraduate and master’s degrees will be able to stay for two years and those who have completed PhD can stay for three years; and the Global Talent Scheme will allow highly-skilled scientists and researchers to come to the UK without a job offer.Patel said: “The British people voted to take back control of our borders and introduce a new points-based immigration system. Now we have left the EU, we are free to unleash this country’s full potential and implement the changes we need to restore trust in the immigration system and deliver a new fairer, firmer, skills-led system from January 1, 2021”.“Britain is open for business and ready to welcome the best and brightest global talent”, she added.The details announced by the Home Office are expected to give British employers the time to prepare and the new immigration system will be implemented in phases to ensure smooth delivery.The new system will require those applying via the skilled worker route to accrue points by meeting a number of relevant criteria, such as have a job offer at the appropriate skill level, the ability to speak English and meeting the salary threshold.The system will also expand the skills threshold. An applicant’s job must be at the minimum skill level of A-level or equivalent, rather than degree level under the current system. This will provide greater flexibility and ensure UK business has access to a wide pool of skilled workers, officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uniform-easier-uk-visa-norms-from-january-1-priti-patel/story-KkLrFXQJB2SmyAHj5XncPN.html
13-07-2020||World||In Egypt, volunteers make meals with love for coronavirus patients||Fatma Youssef stuffs rice, chicken or meat and vegetables into boxes spread on her dining table -- tens of them in the last few weeks. On some, she scribbles “Be well” in Arabic; on others, she writes “Together, we will get through this.”Youssef doesn’t know who will eat her food. Still, she says, she cooks it with love -- and purpose.She and other volunteers in Egypt hope the meals will help nurse quarantined coronavirus patients back to health and provide them with some respite. In different neighborhoods in Cairo and some other cities, they’ve enlisted to cook, donate food or make contactless deliveries to patients’ homes.“Good things come out of crises all the time,” said Youssef, 27. “I didn’t expect that there would be people who would drop everything to help others they don’t know, haven’t met and will not meet.”The effort took off in early June after Basma Mostafa, a 30-year-old journalist, wrote on Facebook that she was thinking of cooking nutritious meals for patients. She asked if someone would be willing to help with expenses or delivery or to connect her with those who are sick. She did not expect much.Messages flooded her inbox. Friends and strangers offered to pitch in. So, she decided to create the meals initiative.“I am amazed,” Mostafa said. “The idea exploded quickly probably because people felt alone ... and found something that says, ‘no, you’re not alone.’”Today, about 1,500 volunteers take part in the program, and thousands more have asked to join, Mostafa said. Others have created similar efforts in their neighborhoods, she added.The personal touch is the handwritten messages of support. Some are scribbled on heart-shaped notes or embellished with drawings of smiley faces.“We are all with you,” reads one. “Speedy recovery,” says another. After one volunteer wrote, “made with love,” it has become a favorite slogan.Mostafa said she got the idea of helping out when she was going through a particularly difficult time. “I thought that to alleviate my suffering, I can engage with the suffering of others and feel more for them,” she said. “I derive my strength and perseverance from the patients.”In their Facebook group, organizers offer two options: one with different categories for those wanting to help, another to request meals. Boxes are offered to patients, rich or poor, who are living alone or with other sick and quarantined family members.When some patients ask to pay for their meals, organizers encourage them to pay it forward instead by donating supplies after they recover, Mostafa says.Mai Ezzat says she was skeptical a stranger would make the trip to her home to deliver meals.The 20-year-old lives with her parents and two brothers. They all went into quarantine after her father contracted the virus, she said, and others showed symptoms. No one was able to go out to buy food. A volunteer brought cooked meals, vegetables and fruits to the family’s doorstep.The gesture made her feel like “there’s still good out there” and offered a morale boost, she said.Radwa Shalash, one of the organizers, says she is moved when patients who have received meals call to say they recovered.“I have seen people who are willing to volunteer everything they’ve got, literally,” she said. “It made me feel like if something happened to me, if I ever needed something, I would find many people -- so many people.”__Fam reported from Winter Park, Florida.__Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

13-07-2020||World||IMF says mideast loses $270B oil income amid coronavirus, recession||The Middle East’s energy producers are expected to earn $270 billion less in oil revenue compared to last year as the region’s economic heavyweight, Saudi Arabia, sinks deeper into recession amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Monetary Fund’s outlook released Monday.The international lender expects an overall economic contraction of 7.3% in Mideast oil exporting countries this year due to hits from the coronavirus outbreak and oil market turmoil. The contraction is 2% greater than the IMF’s initial projections in mid-April.“We are in a year like no other and therefore developments are very fast and coping with them is challenging for everyone,” Jihad Azour, director of the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia department, told The Associated Press.The IMF had projected in April that Saudi Arabia’s economy would contract by about 2.3% this year. It has since revised that figure downward, saying the kingdom stands to see economic growth shrink by 6.8% before climbing to around 3% growth next year.In addition to lower crude prices and cuts to production, Saudi Arabia stands to lose billions of dollars in revenue because the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca is suspended due to the pandemic. For the first time in Saudi history, the hajj pilgrimage this month, which drew 2.5 million people last year, will not include pilgrims from outside the kingdom.To raise state revenue, Saudi Arabia tripled taxes on basic goods and services this month, increasing value-added tax to 15%.While the IMF has for years been urging Gulf states to introduce tougher austerity measures, “we did not recommend the specific measure here” for Saudi Arabia, Azour said.He said the IMF’s overall recommendation now is that governments that can afford to do so should consider the risks of a second wave of coronavirus and introduce measures that shore up the economy and protect the livelihoods of people.Meanwhile, oil-importing Mideast countries, which include Egypt, Jordan and Sudan, are expected to see an overall economic contraction of 1.1%, nearly unchanged from the IMF’s April projections. The overall level of inflation in these countries, however, is expected to reach 10%.There are massive challenges across the region, including in Lebanon, where inflation has mushroomed to 56% over the past year and where the currency has lost nearly two-thirds of its value. The most current IMF forecast predicts a 12% economic contraction this year in the small Mediterranean country, which hosts large populations of Syrian and Palestinian refugees.The IMF has held more than a dozen meetings with Lebanese authorities over a $10 billion loan request. The IMF says it is still working to assess the country’s financial losses as different arms of the government offer diverging figures.Additionally, Iran is struggling to manage the outbreak of the virus there as officials refuse to impose lockdown measures that would further rattle its economy battered by U.S. sanctions. In a sign of just how dire the economic situation has become, Iran requested a $5 billion loan from the IMF this year — the first such request made by the country in nearly six decades.Azour said the IMF continues to look into Iran’s loan request, which the Trump administration has publicly opposed.“This (coronavirus) crisis highlighted the vulnerabilities that exist in the system,” Azour said, especially in countries where there are high levels of informal workers and youth unemployment.“We are calling for revamping social protection, improving access to social services, and also increasing the level of financial inclusion to help and support those who are vulnerable,” he said.Since the start of the year, the IMF has approved about $17 billion in emergency loans to countries in the Middle East and the wider region, including $5.2 billion for Egypt and nearly $1.4 billion for Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-says-mideast-loses-270b-oil-income-amid-coronavirus-recession/story-s9TbQzg9vihKUJ2ykb9mcP.html
13-07-2020||World||Vladimir Putin pushes back $400 billion development plan, blames Covid pandemic||Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to push back completion of an ambitious $400 billion investment and development program, blaming the economic havoc wreaked by the coronavirus epidemic.“I ask the government with the participation of the State Council to adjust the national projects within three months,” Putin said at a televised meeting Monday with ministers and officials. “We must proceed from their realities.”The projects that were meant to be completed by 2024 require adjustment because “we will have to work in conditions of stricter budget restrictions” due to the coronavirus, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told Putin. “It is possible to extend the time frame for achieving the national goals that you mentioned today to 2030.”Putin made the national projects the centerpiece of his election program for his fourth term when he won a landslide in 2018. He overhauled the government at the start of this year, installing Mishustin in place of long-serving ally Dmitry Medvedev, partly out of disappointment at the pace of progress in implementing the spending program designed to boost Russia’s sluggish growth and raise living standards.The Covid-19 crisis and the slump in oil prices within weeks after the new government’s appointment, however, has blown his plans off course as Russia battles to overcome the worst recession in a decade following a national lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.Russia’s budget has swung from a surplus in 2019 to a deep deficit this year, while the government envisages spending 8.7 trillion rubles ($123 billion) on an economic recovery plan over the next two years.While it’s unclear for now how much of the program may be delayed beyond the original deadline, Putin risks seeking re-election in 2024 without having fulfilled his promises to voters, after the July 1 referendum endorsing constitutional changes that may allow him to rule for two more terms until 2036.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-pushes-back-400-billion-development-plan-blames-covid-pandemic/story-jobYvtys9yo8Sd976l0feJ.html
13-07-2020||World||Ready or not: Election costs soar in prep for coronavirus voting||The demand for mail-in ballots is surging. Election workers need training. And polling booths might have to be outfitted with protective shields during the Covid-19 pandemic.As officials prepare for the November 3 election, one certainty is clear: It’s coming with a big price tag.“Election officials don’t have nearly the resources to make the preparations and changes they need to make to run an election in a pandemic,” said Wendy Weiser, head of the Brennan Center for Justice’s democracy program. “We are seeing this all over the place.”The pandemic has sent state and local officials scrambling to prepare for an election like few others, an extraordinary endeavor during a presidential contest, as virus cases rise across much of the U.S.Covid-related worries are bringing demands for steps to make sure elections just four months away are safe. But long-promised federal aid to help cash-starved states cope is stalled on Capitol Hill.The money would help pay for transforming the age-old voting process into a pandemic-ready system. Central to that is the costs for printing mail-in ballots and postage. There are also costs to ensure in-person voting is safe with personal protective equipment, or PPE, for poll workers, who tend to be older and more at risk of getting sick from the virus, and training for new workers. Pricey machines are needed to quickly count the vote.Complicating matters is President Donald Trump’s aversion to mail-in balloting. With worrisome regularity, he derides the process as rigged, even though there’s no evidence of fraud and his own reelection team is adapting to the new reality of widespread mail-in voting.“As cases of coronavirus in this country rise, it’s vital that all voters be able to cast their ballots from home, to cast their ballots by mail,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.A COVID response bill passed by the House in May contains $3.6 billion to help states with their elections, but the Senate won’t turn to the measure until late July. Republicans fought a $400 million installment of election aid this March before agreeing to it.But key Senate Republicans seem likely to support more election funding, despite Trump’s opposition, and are even offering to lower a requirement that states put up matching funds to qualify for the federal cash.“I’m prepared not only to look at more money for the states to use as they see fit for elections this year but also to even consider whatever kind of matching requirement we have,” said Roy Blunt, R-Mo., chairman of the Senate panel with responsibility for the issue. “We can continue to work toward an election that produces a result that people have confidence in and done in a way that everybody that wants to vote, gets to vote.”The pandemic erupted this spring in the middle of state primaries, forcing many officials to delay elections by days, weeks and even months. They dealt with poll worker cancellations, polling place changes and an explosion of absentee ballots.Voting rights groups are particularly concerned with the consolidations of polling places that contributed to long lines in Milwaukee, Atlanta and Las Vegas. They fear a repeat in November.As negotiations on the next Covid-19 relief bill begin on Capitol Hill, the final figure for elections is sure to end up much less than the $3.6 billion envisioned by the House. That figure followed Brennan Center recommendations to prepare for an influx of absentee ballots while providing more early voting options and protecting neighborhood polling places.Even before the pandemic, election offices typically work under tight budgets. Iowa Secretary of State Paul D. Pate, who’s president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said the group has been calling on the federal government to provide a steady source of funds, particularly to help address ongoing costs of protecting the nation’s election systems from cyberthreats.For Georgia’s primary last month, election officials spent $8.1 million of the roughly $10.9 million the state has received in federal funds. The money was used to send absentee ballot applications to 6.9 million active registered voters and print absentee ballots for county election offices. Some of it also was used to purchase PPE and secure drop-off boxes for counties.Meanwhile, the state elections division has seen a $90,000 reduction for the current budget year as Georgia — like the rest of the nation — deals with a decline in revenues due to the pandemic.The state’s remaining federal funds will be used to help cover the costs of developing an online system for voters to request absentee ballots, less expensive than sending ballot applications to every voter, and exploring whether installing plexiglass dividers around voting machines could allow more voters in a polling place at one time.In Colorado, a universal vote-by-mail state, the Denver election office has had to reduce its budget by 7.5%, nearly $980,000. Jocelyn Bucaro, Denver’s elections director, said the federal funds sent this year helped with purchasing PPE and other pandemic-related supplies.Iowa similarly spent its federal dollars on mail-in ballots and pandemic supplies, Pate said.Vote-by-mail veterans and vendors of the equipment, software, ballots and envelopes that will be needed in November say the window to buy them is quickly closing.“Right now, what I’m seeing in most places is just this kind of indecision. What are we supposed to be planning? Vote by mail or in-person or combination?” said Jeff Ellington, president of Runbeck Election Services, which prints ballots and the special envelopes used to mail them and supplies high-volume envelope sorters.“Decisions just need to be made so people can start to put a plan into place,” he said.BlueCrest, a Pitney Bowes spinoff, sells high-volume sorting machines that handle up to 50,000 ballot envelopes per hour. That’s the kind of crunch big counties can expect to face Nov. 3 in states including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Rick Becerra, a vice president at the company, said he’s been talking to officials. The machines average $475,000 each.“I tell them the time is now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ready-or-not-election-costs-soar-in-prep-for-coronavirus-voting/story-EdfAGddY3mXQJ9uaHXo3VO.html
13-07-2020||World||Worst floods in years hit China, 33 rivers flowing at levels highest in history||China on Monday issued flood alerts for 433 rivers in the country as torrential rain continued to wreak havoc in eastern, central and southern provinces, killing at least 141, rendering millions homeless and further battering a shrunk economy trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.At least 141 persons are missing or dead, dozens in mudslides triggered by heavy rainfall and overflowing rivers. Nearly 28,000 homes have been damaged, news agency Associated Press reported. Water levels in at least 33 of the 433 rivers crisscrossing several provinces have broken decades-old records, triggering fears that the current deluge could mimic the massive floods of 1998, which killed more than 3000 people and ruined the livelihood of millionsThe central Chinese province of Hubei and its capital Wuhan -- where the coronavirus disease outbreak first emerged late last year and was put under the most severe lockdown in China -- has witnessed some of the worst flooding with the Yangtze river flowing above the danger mark in the province. The province faces particular threat due to presence of numerous lakes and rivers, adding to the worsening levels of flooding. President Xi Jinping was quoted by the state media as saying that the “flood control situation was grim”.Parts of Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, the metropolis of Shanghai and Zhejiang are forecast to receive rainfall of 100 to 180 mm over the next three days, according to a statement on the website of the national meteorological centre (NMC).“Average rainfall reached 403 mm in the areas along the Yangtze river from June 1 to July 12, the highest level since 1961,” the official news agency, Xinhua reported on Monday.The direct economic loss until now has been calculated at 82.23 billion yuan or $11.76 billion, according to state media. Key tourist destinations in China’s south have sustained flood damage, compounding financial stress caused by the massive drop-off in numbers of visitors.The state-run tabloid, Global Times, headlined a report on the raging floods as “China faces flood catastrophe”.One of the worst hit provinces is eastern China’s Jiangxi province where authorities have implemented “war time” measures following the water level in the Poyang lake, the largest freshwater lake in the country, crossing the 22.5 metres or 74 feet-mark, for the first time since 1998.The water level in Taihu Lake, the country’s second-largest freshwater lake, has risen above the alert level for 15 consecutive days.China’s ministry of water resources (MWR) has raised the emergency response to flood control to Level 11, the second highest in the system.Hubei has raised the flood alert level to the highest.The emergency management ministry (EMM) was quoted by state media as saying on Monday that a total of 37.89 million people in 27 provincial-level regions were affected, 141 people were killed or missing and 28,000 houses have collapsed.A total of 2.25 million emergency evacuations have been made, the ministry said.In a statement released to the state media, Xi has said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and armed police troops stationed in flood-hit regions should actively participate in the rescue and relief work.China has entered the critical period for flood control, Xi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worst-floods-in-years-hit-china-33-rivers-flowing-at-levels-highest-in-history/story-Z7T4iaSqMkx6750jojHYjK.html

We are not driving the ambulances that will bring the ill to hospitals. We are not restocking grocery store shelves or delivering food door to door”.“But we do have money, lots of it. Money that is desperately needed now and will continue to be needed in the years ahead, as our world recovers from this crisis. Today, we, the undersigned millionaires, ask our governments to raise taxes on people like us. Immediately. Substantially. Permanently”.The signatories include Abigail Disney, Tim Disney and Mary Ford.Labour leader Keir Starmer has asked the Boris Johnson government to consider imposing wealth tax: “We are saying to the government, look at the idea of a wealth tax, we certainly support the principle that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the greatest burden.”The letter goes on to say: “The impact of this crisis will last for decades. It could push half a billion more people into poverty. Hundreds of millions of people will lose their jobs as businesses close, some permanently”.“Already, there are nearly a billion children out of school, many with no access to the resources they need to continue their learning. And of course the absence of hospital beds, protective masks, and ventilators is a painful, daily reminder of the inadequate investment made in public health systems across the world”.The millionaires say that a huge debt is owed to the people working on the frontlines of the global battle, adding that most essential workers are grossly underpaid for the burden they carry.“Our interconnectedness has never been more clear. We must rebalance our world before it is too late. There will not be another chance to get this right. Unlike tens of millions of people around the world, we do not have to worry about losing our jobs, our homes, or our ability to support our families. We are not fighting on the frontlines of this emergency and we are much less likely to be its victims”.“So please. Tax us. Tax us. Tax us. It is the right choice. It is the only choice. Humanity is more important than our money”, the letter adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tax-us-substantially-over-80-global-millionaires-solution-for-tackling-covid-19/story-HW9Qwuzh9i1nbFpr3SSYwI.html

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.The officials said there were casualties but they could not provide the number of fatalities as the fighting was still underway. A provincial hospital chief, Abdul Khalil Musadiq, said at least 43 wounded — mostly civilians, including children — were taken to hospitals in the area.Mohammad Hashim Sarwari, deputy chief for the provincial council, said the bomber targeted the intelligence service department in the provincial capital of Aybak. He said the blast was so strong it was heard miles away and damaged buildings and homes within a wide radius.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said the Taliban — who are active in the province and have recently stepped up attacks there — were behind the bombing.Samangan also has seen clashes between rival warlords in the area and some Islamic militants, mostly Uzbeks affiliated more with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.On Sunday, the Taliban attacked checkpoints in northern Kunduz province, killing at least 14 members of the Afghan security forces, according to Esmatullah Muradi, a spokesman for the provincial governor.In Imam Sahib district, the Taliban killed eight policemen, while in the Chardara district they gunned down three soldiers and three pro-government fighters, he said. Reinforcement were sent late on Sunday and fighting continued until Monday morning.The Taliban said they were behind the attacks but claimed that government forces fired mortars in response, hitting civilian homes — a claimed that was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense.The Taliban and government forces have been trading blame over a recent surge in attacks across Afghanistan — even as efforts continue to try and bring about the start of direct peace talks between Kabul and the insurgents.The Taliban accuses government forces of targeting them in their homes, with their families bearing the brunt of those operations. Kabul, meanwhile, has accuse the Taliban of stepping up attacks against both civilians and the security forces.___Associated Press writer Tameem Akhgar in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-car-bombing-in-north-afghanistan-causes-casualties/story-EbK4tOcBD3RnERa62aCQ4O.html

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying disclosed what she called “corresponding sanctions” against US Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, US Representative Chris Smith, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.The commission monitors human rights and the development of the rule of law in China and submits an annual report to President Donald Trump and Congress. “The US actions seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations and seriously damage Sino-US relations,” she told reporters during a daily briefing. “China will make further responses based on how the situation develops.” Hua did not elaborate on what the sanctions entail, but Washington’s measures against Chinese officials, including the Communist Party secretary of the troubled western region of Xinjiang, include freezing of US assets, US travel and prohibiting Americans from doing business with them.UN experts and activists say at least a million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centres in Xinjiang. China describes them as training centres helping to stamp out terrorism and extremism and give people new skills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trades-sanctions-with-us-over-uighur-muslims/story-83uo8yihTAFwCRxDmC2nrJ.html

Preliminary results of the trial are expected to be released by the end of September, the university said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pub-cluster-adds-to-second-wave-coronavirus-fears/story-rKy4nMf6u54Xp11KxuubKJ.html

Glenmark Pharmaceuticals had launched FabiFlu last month at a price of Rs 103 per tablet.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage In a regulatory filing Glenmark announced a price reduction of 27 per cent for FabiFlu. The new maximum retail price (MRP) is Rs 75 per tab, it said. “The price reduction has been made possible through benefits gained from higher yields and better scale, as both the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and formulations are made at Glenmark’s facilities in India, the benefits of which are being passed on to patients in the country,” the filing said. “Our internal research shows us that we launched FabiFlu in India at the lowest market cost as compared to the cost of Favipiravir in other countries where it is approved. And now we hope that this further price reduction will make it even more accessible for patients across the country,” Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Senior Vice President and Head – India business Alok Malik said. Further, the company has commenced a post marketing surveillance (PMS) study on FabiFlu to closely monitor the efficacy and safety of the drug in 1,000 patients that are prescribed with the oral antiviral, as part of an open label, multicenter, single arm study, the filing added. “We expect this post marketing surveillance study to shed more light on the drug’s clinical effectiveness and safety in a large cohort of patients prescribed FabiFlu,” Malik added. On June 20, Glenmark announced that it received manufacturing and marketing approval from India’s drug regulator for FabiFlu, making it the first oral Favipiravir-approved medication in India for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19. Glenmark has also completed the phase 3 clinical trial with Favipiravir (FabiFlu) in mild to moderate Covid-19 patients in India. The trial results will be available shortly, the company said. Glenmark is also conducting another phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two antivirals drugs Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a combination therapy in moderate hospitalised adult Covid-19 patients in India. Shares of Glenmark Pharma were trading 1.34 per cent lower at Rs 421.00 apiece on BSE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/glenmark-pharma-cuts-price-of-covid-19-drug-by-27-percent-to-rs-75-per-tablet/story-qwttX4EOcz3FrWBHSYkIsJ.html

The province’s capital Wuhan was the epicenter of China’s virus outbreak, which appears to have largely been contained.The floodwaters have inundated towns across southern and central China and prompted emergency workers to shore-up embankments and dig channels to release overflow. Flood surges on 433 rivers have exceeded the warning level and 33 of them hit record highs, Zheng said. Apart from the Yangtze, other major rivers systems and lakes have been rising, including the Yellow River in the North, the Zhujiang in the south and Taihu, China’s largest freshwater lake just west of Shanghai.Flooding in some areas last week forced the rescheduling of portions of the crucial four-day national college entrance exams that had already been delayed for a month because of the coronavirus outbreak.Key tourist destinations in China’s south have sustained flood damage that is compounding financial stress caused by the massive drop-off in numbers of visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-141-dead-or-missing-in-flooding-since-june/story-TK0YkMeZkPewTzQtQlvyAM.html

About half were concerned about the city’s status as a global finance centre and the erosion of the high degree of autonomy it was promised 23 years ago.Other major concerns cited were data security, talent drain and retaliatory measures by other governments. The prospect of extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, was considered a “game changer” by about 46%, with 17% saying it wasn’t.About 49% said the law would have a negative impact on their business, while some 13% said it would have a positive impact. Some 30% considered moving capital, assets or business out of Hong Kong in the medium-to-long term, while 5% said they consider doing so in the short-term.More than half of the respondents said they felt less safe about living and working in Hong Kong. Also about half said they personally considered leaving the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-us-firms-in-hong-kong-concerned-about-security-law-says-report/story-DM56l4coj6nf2HOV1oMaaM.html

Italy has recorded 34,954 deaths and 243,061 cases. Mexico trails the United States, Brazil and the UK in total deaths.While Italy appears to have tamed the virus, the pandemic is showing few signs of easing in Mexico, where the government has faced criticism for reopening its economy too soon.Lopez Obrador said he was briefed on the pandemic this past week and was optimistic.“The report is positive, good. The conclusion is that the pandemic is going down, that it is losing intensity,” he said in a video message.Lopez Obrador also backed Hugo Lopez-Gatell, Mexico’s deputy health minister and coronavirus czar, after criticism of his handling of the crisis. Lopez-Gatell has kept revising his projections for total fatalities and as recently as June forecast up to 35,000 deaths through October. In early May, the estimate was 6,000.The coronavirus death toll per million residents in Mexico, whose population numbers about 120 million, is the 16th highest in the world, according to data by research firm Statista.But Mexican officials say the true toll is likely much higher due to limited testing. A Reuters analysis of funeral-home data in May indicated a toll more than double the reported figures.Several former officials have criticised Lopez Obrador’s administration for its management of the epidemic.Former Health Minister Salomon Chertorivski, who held the post from 2011 to 2012, said on Thursday the government had reopened the economy before meeting globally established criteria for doing so. He added that Mexico might need to impose a new lockdown.“There are three fundamental variables: a reduction in the last 14 days in the numbers of contagions, reduction in recent days in the number of deaths, and reduction in the number of hospitalized people,” Chertorivski told Mexican newspaper Reforma. “None of those three parameters were achieved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-surpasses-italy-to-post-world-s-fourth-highest-coronavirus-death-toll/story-gvpC9dXZZKUTqBR5bTXW9J.html

On Sunday, the country reported over 61,000 cases, a third straight daily rise.As of Sunday, over 3.2 million infections were recorded with more than 134,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melania-trump-posts-video-of-herself-wearing-mask/story-UzWkcze2aaeHEYgR9urpoN.html
13-07-2020||World||21 injured in fire aboard ship at Naval Base San Diego||Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries in an explosion and fire Sunday on board a ship at Naval Base San Diego, military officials said.The blaze was reported shortly before 9am on USS Bonhomme Richard, said Mike Raney, a spokesman for Naval Surface Force, US Pacific Fleet.Seventeen sailors and four civilians were hospitalized with “non-life threatening injuries,” Raney said in a brief statement. He didn’t provide additional details.Previously, officials said at least one person was treated for smoke inhalation.The cause of the fire was under investigation. It wasn’t immediately known where on the 840-foot (255-meter) amphibious assault vessel the blast and the fire occurred.The flames sent up a huge plume of dark smoke visible around San Diego.San Diego is the Bonhomme Richard’s home port, and the ship was undergoing routine maintenance at the time of the fire.About 160 sailors and officers were on board, Raney said — far fewer than the thousand typically on the ship when it’s on active duty.All crew members were accounted for, said Admiral Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations.“We are grateful for the quick and immediate response of local, base, and shipboard firefighters aboard USS Bonhomme Richard,” Gilday said in a statement.The 23-year-old ship has the capacity to deploy and land helicopters, smaller boats and amphibious vehicles. Because of its age, a fire could be particularly destructive, especially if it reached the engine room and other tight spaces with machinery, said Lawrence B. Brennan, a professor of admiralty and international maritime law at Fordham University in New York.“The heat of a fire of this nature can warp the steel, and that can be a major problem for any ship,” said Brennan. “On an older ship, it’s even more of a problem.”Two other docked ships, USS Fitzgerald and USS Russell, were moved to berths away from the fire, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/21-injured-in-fire-aboard-ship-at-naval-base-san-diego/story-o1qqrGZCs2Htox9Ay7rBGL.html
