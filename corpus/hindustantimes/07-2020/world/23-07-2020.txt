The injured were rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital.District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ) Deputy Medical Superintendent Dr Qaiser Abbas Bangash said that at least 17 injured, including a child, were brought to the facility, Dawn newspaper reported.One injured person was in critical condition and being shifted to the Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar, the paper quoted Bangash as saying. Earlier, authorities had said that 20 people were injured in the incident.Parachinar is the capital city of Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Soon after the blast, security forces and rescue teams reached the spot.Security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the region is known for sectarian clashes between Sunnis and Shias.The residents blocked the main highway and staged a protest against the bombing in front of Parachinar Press Club.Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the blast, saying “terrorists seek to target citizens and leave Pakistan in the grip of terror.” Kurram district is considered one of the most sensitive tribal areas of Pakistan as it borders three Afghanistan provinces. It has witnessed scores of attacks and kidnapping for ransom incidents during the last decade.In 2017, nearly 132 people were killed and 460 others wounded in five militant attacks in Parachinar.In previous years, militants had carried out 11 bomb attacks that killed over 500 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/17-injured-in-bomb-blast-at-open-air-market-in-northwest-pakistan/story-Lv8zOLz58pGNCWtiGwvxXP.html

And, the regular movie-lovers know it,” Tan Zheng said.On the SIFF screenings, Tan said: “Cultural exchanges are conducive to the development of bilateral ties”.In January, just days before theatres shut down because of the outbreak, the official news agency, Xinhua had reported about the box office of “Sheep without a Shepherd”.“The Chinese mainland box office sales of thriller film “Sheep Without a Shepherd” shot past 1 billion yuan (about 144 million U.S. dollars)…” a Xinhua report said, adding: “A remake of Indian thriller ‘Drishyam’ the film tells of a man trying to cover up his daughter’s killing of a police officer’s son”.At SIFF, besides Ghosh’s “Raahgir” and Jha’s “Pareeksha”, two other movies to be screened are Arati Kadav’s “Cargo”, a rare sci-fi movie from India, and a Bangladesh-India joint production “Debris of Despair”, by Indian director Indranil Roychowhdury, who had earlier directed the critically acclaimed “Phoring”.The two others to be shown are Pratik Thakare-directed Annual Day and Gitanjali Rao-helmed “hand-painted animation movie “Bombay Rose”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-indian-films-at-shanghai-festival-as-drishyam-s-chinese-remake-top-box-office/story-RgSsANiS4ESDDCsblgLP4J.html
23-07-2020||World||President Trump orders ‘surge’ of federal troops to crime-hit US cities||President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a “surge” in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers to cities, mostly ruled by Democrats, struggling with spiraling cases of violent crimes.Trump has projected himself as a “law and order” president and struggling in polls against his presumptive Democratic rival Joe Biden, he has fallen back on portraying a grim and scary situation of lawlessness that he is committed to addressing.“This rampage of violence shocks the conscience of our nation, and we will not stand by and watch it happen; can’t do that,” President Trump said at a White House event, accompanied by his top federal law enforcement officials, such as Attorney General William Barr, acting head of homeland security Chad Wolf and FBI director Christopher Wray.“Today, I’m announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime.In New York City, over 300 people were shot in the last month alone, he said, which was a 277% -- “at least” -- rise over the same point a year ago. Murders have spiked 27% in Philadelphia and 94% in Minneapolis compared to the same period in 2019. “Perhaps no citizens have suffered more from the menace of violent crime than the wonderful people of Chicago -- a city I know very well,” Trump said.Chicago will be the first recipient of additional federal enforcement personnel under the “surge”, which is taking place as part of the justice department’s recently launched “Operation Legend. Other cites targeted include Portland, Oregon, where federal agents are already on ground to protect federal properties from anti-racism protests (but the surge is not about the protests, but rising violent crimes); and Albuquerque, New Mexico.Chicago officials have said they welcomed federal help but cautioned against federal agents operating on their own, and not under the guidance of local officials.But New York mayor was more forthright. “It is clear that the president’s proposed actions threaten the safety of New Yorkers, the rights of New Yorkers and the fundamental principles of our nation’s constitution,” Mayor Bill de Blasio wrote in a letter to Attorney General Barr.Two days ago, Portland mayor Ted Wheeler called for federal agents to leave. “They’re not wanted here. We haven’t asked them here. In fact, we want them to leave,” he told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-orders-surge-of-federal-troops-to-crime-hit-us-cities/story-9i67j3BhP7nf1wZ8fhEj6N.html
23-07-2020||World||US senate panel paves way for TikTok ban for federal workers||As the Trump administration mulls a broader ban on Chinese apps along the lines of India, a US senate panel on Wednesday approved a bill barring federal employees from downloading and using TikTok, one of them, or replacement applications developed by its parent company ByteDance.Titled “No TikTok on Government Devices Act”, the legislation said, “No employee of the United States, officer of the United States, Member of Congress, congressional employee, or officer or employee of a government corporation may download or use TikTok or any successor application developed by ByteDance or any entity owned by ByteDance on any device issued by the United States or a government corporation.”In the escalating rift between the US, China, President Donald Trump has not ruled out shutting other Chinese missions here following the closure of the consulate in Houston. “As far as closing additional embassies, it’s always possible,” he told reporters. The senate legislation on TikTok was introduced by Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri who has also moved other measures against China including one to make Beijing pay for the Covid-119 epidemic. The TikTok bill was passed by the committee on homeland security for consideration of the full senate and it is set become law as the House of Representative passed a legislation earlier this week, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act 2021, the defense budget, that proposed to do the same, bar federal employees from using TikTok.Though Hawley introduced his TikTok bill in march, America has moved rapidly towards outlawing TikTok and other Chinese apps after India banned 59 of them June-end including US browser and WeChat saying their user data were being mined and profiled by “elements hostile to national security and defense of India”.A 2017 Chinese law forces these and other Chinese companies to cooperate with the government in intelligence matters.Shortly after the Indian ban, Secretary of State mike Pompeo said the United States was considering a similar measure, specific to TikTok. He later said a broad review was underway not only of TikTok but other Chinese apps and devices.The United States has barred Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE from participating in its rollout of the 5G network and lobbied other countries to join in a burgeoning global boycott of these companies.TikTok spokeswoman Jamie Favazza said the company’s growing US team has no higher priority than promoting a safe app experience that protects users’ privacy. “Millions of American families use TikTok for entertainment and creative expression, which we recognize is not what federal government devices are for,” she said, as reported by Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-paves-way-for-tiktok-ban-for-federal-workers/story-tWaqwgmJKodwyOvvoY0VjJ.html
23-07-2020||World||China cites ‘malicious slander’ as US orders closure of Houston consulate||China said “malicious slander” is behind an order by the U.S. government to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, and maintained Thursday that its officials have never operated outside ordinary diplomatic norms.Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the order to close the consulate “violates international law and basic norms governing international relations,” and “seriously undermines China-U.S. relations.”“This is breaking down the bridge of friendship between the Chinese and American people,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing.The order this week to close the consulate, one of China’s six missions in the United States, is seen as escalating tensions between the world’s two largest economies while President Donald Trump steers blame and punitive measures against China ahead of the November U.S. election. Beijing has said it would take action in response, although Wang gave no details on Thursday.Relations between the sides have nose-dived in recent months over the conronavirus pandemic as well as disputes over trade, human rights, Hong Kong and Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea.In its statement on the closing of the consulate, the State Department alleged that Chinese agents have tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system statewide and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.Wang said there was no basis to that claim.“This is completely malicious slander,” Wang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cites-malicious-slander-as-us-orders-closure-of-houston-consulate/story-7nZ1RVNFD9ialWPSNjRrKO.html

It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases. It took another 43 days to reach 2 million and then 27 days to reach 3 million. It has only taken 16 days to reach 4 million at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.The federal government, state governors and city leaders have often clashed over the best way to tackle the pandemic, leading to a confusing patchwork of rules on issues like mask wearing in public and when businesses can open.President Donald Trump recently shifted his tone. He had been previously been reluctant to wear a mask himself but this week encouraged Americans to wear masks and recently appeared in public for the first time with a face covering.Of the 20 countries with the biggest outbreak, the United States ranks second for cases per capita, at 120 infections per 10,000 people, only exceeded by Chile.With over 143,000 deaths, or 4.4 fatalities per 10,000 people, the United States ranks sixth globally for the highest deaths per capita. It is exceeded by the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France.Globally, the rate of new infections shows no sign of slowing, with the disease accelerating the fastest in the United States and South America, according to the Reuters tally, based on official reports.Brazil registered a new daily record for confirmed coronavirus cases on Wednesday, pushing the total confirmed cases across Latin America past 4 million.Brazil has the second-largest outbreak in the world, with more than 2.2 million people testing positive and nearly 83,000 deaths.India, the only other country with more than 1 million cases, reported almost 40,000 new cases on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-2-600-new-coronavirus-cases-every-hour-as-total-approaches-4-million/story-Z4WRoZlbbdscetacedIqsN.html
23-07-2020||World||Xi’s own campaign to stay in power pits China against the world||Less than four months before the US election, President Donald Trump has made his tough China policy a centerpiece of his campaign to stay in power.Over in Beijing, President Xi Jinping is similarly preparing for China’s own leadership contest in 2022. While the country’s 1.4 billion citizens don’t get a vote, public sentiment still matters when it comes to how much support Xi can muster from senior Communist Party leaders for his indefinite rule.A crucial pillar of that support has been Xi’s personification of standing “tall and firm” in the world, an image he’s brandished by strongly asserting claims in the South China Sea, spending billions to upgrade military hardware and tightening Beijing’s grip over Hong Kong. While that’s generated nationalism that has buoyed his support, helping make Xi the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, it’s also set China on a collision course with the rest of the world.China has “almost created a dynamic where it has to be externally assertive in order for the party to maintain control domestically, so there’s almost a kind of impulse of clashing with the interests, values and sensitivities of other countries,” said Rory Medcalf, a professor at the Australian National University who wrote “Indo-Pacific Empire: China, America and the Contest for the World’s Pivotal Region.”“It’s almost as if the way Xi Jinping has rewired the Chinese system, it can’t help it -- it can’t help itself,” he added. “That is obviously very damaging for China’s interests in the long run. It’s actually very damaging for all of us.”‘Real Resistance’The deterioration of U.S.-China ties -- the closure of the Houston consulate was the latest in a long string of tit-for-tat action -- is just the tip of the iceberg. In recent months, more countries have spoken out against Chinese actions in places like Hong Kong and Xinjiang. And China’s diplomats, eager to please party leaders, have sparred with countries ranging from the U.K. and Australia to India and Kazakhstan.A new purge with the Communist Party ranks may explain why officials are so eager to demonstrate their loyalty. Quishi Journal, the party’s official magazine, published excerpts from Xi’s speeches this month saying the party leadership should be embodied in “every aspect and every link” of society. An accompanying editorial called Xi the “ultimate arbiter.”“His campaign to remain in power at the 20th Party Congress has definitely started,” said Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. “There is very likely some real resistance under the surface in the system, and 2022 will be very interesting. I don’t think it’s a slam dunk.”The biggest question looming over Chinese politics is when Xi, 67, will step aside after breaking with succession practices set up after Mao’s fraught tenure. He has pledged to transform China into a leading global power by 2050, with a thriving middle class, strong military and clean environment.In recent weeks, Xi has sought to weed out dissent among China’s security forces. The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the party body that oversees the country’s police, prosecutors and courts, announced an “education and rectification” campaign to “thoroughly remove tumors” from the justice system. Its top official compared the campaign -- set to last through 2022, when Xi’s term as party leader expires -- with a political purge that consolidated Mao’s paramount position more than 75 years ago.Xi also placed the People’s Liberation Army reserve forces under direct control of the central government and Central Military Commission, changing a rule whereby they reported to both the PLA and local government. And he took steps to silence critics of his government’s response to the pandemic while attaching top priority to “safeguarding the regime’s security.”Perfect StormWhile China’s citizens aren’t going to rebel against Xi, a “perfect storm” scenario in which a Covid-19 upsurge forces another lockdown, Chinese stocks crash and countries pressure companies to withdraw investments could lead to splits in the leadership, according to Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies. That’s dangerous for Xi, he said, because of the precedent he set by jailing former security chief Zhou Yongkang after he retired from the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s most powerful body.“He knows that he’s got a lot of enemies, and the enemies are not dissidents,” Tsang said. “The enemies are within the top echelon in the Communist Party.”Right now there’s no reason to think Xi is facing any imminent threats. While his government’s initial handling of the pandemic generated widespread dissatisfaction, Xi’s subsequent ability to reduce cases and restart economic activity helped mitigate the damage -- and compared positively with the responses of countries like the U.S., where the virus is still running rampant.China’s economy has also continued to expand, even if growth rates weren’t as impressive as during his predecessor’s watch. Economic data released in July suggest the country is back on the path to recovery, even though the figures showed worrying trends such as a decline in retail sales and a drop in investment by private companies. Xi this week urged companies to innovate and pledged to further open the economy, saying China will “stand on the correct side of history.”“His position is much more secure than any time before largely because of his success, from the Chinese perspective, in containing coronavirus,” said Cheng Li, director of the Brookings Institution’s John L. Thornton China Center. “We should not underestimate his capacity and his popularity.”Disputes SurgingAlthough gauging public opinion in China is always difficult due to strict censorship, a Harvard University study released this month showed that satisfaction rates among Chinese citizens in 2016 had increased markedly across all levels of government compared with 2003, with officials seen as “as more capable and effective than ever before.” It found that citizens respond positively and negatively to measurable changes in their well-being, which could be a “double-edged sword.”“While the CCP is seemingly under no imminent threat of popular upheaval, it cannot take the support of its people for granted,” it said.Without democratic elections, the Communist Party’s roughly 200-member Central Committee nominally elects the party leader and lawmakers pick the president -- titles both held by Xi. In reality, leadership positions are hashed out behind the scenes among various factions, a process that starts several years before the Party Congress and remains largely a black box to outsiders.Whereas a decade ago it was possible to see the government as a separate entity, under Xi the party has become paramount, said Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Center. That has contributed to a surge in border disputes flaring up at the same time, he said, as promoting nationalism has become more important than creating new diplomatic links.“In a way that would be less necessary in more prosperous times,” Mitter said.Xi’s consolidation of power has made him at once more secure and more vulnerable, with any missteps like the initial response to Covid-19 providing an opening for any rivals to pounce, said Tsang from SOAS University of London. On the world stage, he said, Xi’s administration is “picking fights with everybody.”“When you’re running it as a strongman, you really cannot afford to show any signs of weakness,” Tsang said. “And this is what we have with Xi Jinping.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-s-own-campaign-to-stay-in-power-pits-china-against-the-world/story-5McDwzKAjiS9OLgAjwjkmO.html
23-07-2020||World||China launches first independent Mars probe, calls it ‘Questions to Heaven’||China on Thursday launched its first independent Mars probe, a milestone in the country’s ambitious space programme which aims to have a space station by 2022. If successful, the probe, named Tianwen-1 - which in Mandarin means “Questions to Heaven” - will join an international community of explorers on Mars, comprising the US, Europe, Russia, India, and soon the UAE which launched a mission to the red planet on July 20.The launch was planned for years but comes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which China seems to have brought under control, and the worst floods it is experiencing in decades – the launch carries a show of strength for the international community especially the western powers.Also read: Security agencies red-flag Chinese fronts in education, not just power and telecomChina’s first Mars probe Yinghuo-1 launched in 2011 had failed. Yinghuo-1, launched in November 2011, two years later than originally planned from Kazakhstan on a Russian spacecraft, crashed into the Pacific Ocean in 2012.On Thursday, Chinese official media reported that a Long March-5 rocket, the country’s largest launch vehicle, carried the 5-tonne spacecraft from the Wenchang Spacecraft launch site on the coast of southern China’s Hainan province at 12:41 pm.“About 36 minutes later, the spacecraft, including an orbiter and a rover, was sent into the Earth-Mars transfer orbit, embarking on an almost seven-month journey to the red planet,” the China National Space Administration (CNSA) was quoted by official news agency, Xinhua.The Mars mission is named Tianwen-1 from a poem written by Qu Yuan (about 340-278 BC), a leading poet of ancient China. “The name signifies the Chinese nation’s perseverance in pursuing truth and science and exploring nature and the universe,” said the CNSA.The Mars rover, which is expected to work on Mars for at least 90 Mars days (more than three months on Earth), will carry out patrol exploration and research on geomorphic landforms of Mars, Bao Weimin, an academic with the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Xinhua in June.“A safe landing on Mars is the most difficult and risky part of the mission and the lander carrying the rover will be slowed down through four steps,” said Bao who is also the director of the Committee of Science and Technology under the CNSA. The whole landing process will take about seven to eight minutes, Bao had said.Last November, China had successfully mounted an experiment simulating the process of a probe hovering, avoiding obstacles and descending to land on Mars. In January 2019, China’s Chang’e-4 probe landed on the far side of the moon, making it the first spacecraft to touch down on the part of the moon, which is never visible from earth. China had lauded India’s Mars mission when it was launched in 2014.The successful mission to Mars was not only India’s pride but also that of Asia, China had then said, adding that it was a landmark in the world of space exploration.“We congratulate India on the Mars satellite entering orbit (of the planet) successfully,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, had said in 2014.“This is the pride of India and the pride of Asia and a landmark progress in humankind’s exploration of outer space. So we congratulate India on that,” Hua had added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-first-independent-mars-probe-calls-it-questions-to-heaven/story-5wedpH0NsLN4cpQzZhb64K.html

It is encouraging. There is de-escalation, tensions seem to ease,” Sir Philip Barton, British High Commissioner to India, said at a press briefing on Thursday.Both the countries started the process after the face-of in Galwan Valley, in which India lost 20 soldiers and China suffered undisclosed number of casualties.There have been a series of meetings since the June 15 incident.India and China remain committed to “complete disengagement” which is an “intricate process” and “requires constant verification”, the Indian Army had said in a statement last week.Limited disengagement had started after at least six rounds of meetings both at the miltary and diplomatic levels.Defence minister Rajnath Singh visited Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir last week where he said that the ongoing negotiations with China should help resolve the ongoing border dispute but he couldn’t guarantee to what extent the situation would be resolved, in another confirmation of the complex nature of the ongoing military and diplomatic negotiations between the two nuclear powers.The government had said ahead of Singh’s statement that the complex disengagement process with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is specifically aimed at preventing “face-off situations”, and any unilateral attempts to change the status quo on the disputed border won’t be accepted.However, sources aware of the situation on the border said that India and China have lately failed to make a breakthrough in reducing border tensions, and the disengagement process at some points of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) has virtually halted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/encouraging-uk-welcomes-steps-taken-by-india-and-china-to-ease-border-tensions/story-7fzq2mzgrNvlrBI79k5gEK.html

In 2019, thanks to a massive scale-up, WFP and partners were able to reverse the deterioration in the worst hit areas of Yemen.” Yemen’s conflict has killed more than 100,000 people and created the world’s worst humanitarian disaster, with more than 3 million people internally displaced and two-thirds of the population reliant on food assistance for survival.Donor countries recently cut back on aid to Yemen amid the coronavirus pandemic and also due to concerns that the aid might not be reaching intended recipients in territories controlled by the Iran-backed Houthis.“Yemen is again on the brink of a major food security crisis. ... Unless we receive the funding we need now, we won’t be able to do the same this time,” said Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen.She said the UN agencies faced the similar situation 18 months ago, but they were “generously funded” and “prevented a famine.” Some 24 million Yemeni people, which is 80% of the country’s entire population, require some form of assistance or protection, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA. And 75% of UN programmes for the country, covering essentially every sector, from food to health care and nutrition, have already shut their doors or reduced operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-food-shortages-in-war-torn-yemen-warn-un-agencies/story-h99vlgAqskWYkgpos2lQtM.html

According to CNN, the US government is looking for a Chinese scientist accused of visa fraud.According to federal prosecutors quoted by CNN, the scientist Tang Juan is hiding in China’s consulate in San Francisco. Juan is a researcher who focuses on biology, the CNN reported.She has been accused of lying about the connection with the Chinese military in order to get entry into the US, the CNN further reported. She was charged with visa fraud on June 26.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is assessing that Tang is in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco.This is a latest blow to China after the US said on Wednesday that it had given China 72 hours to close the consulate “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information”.The decision marked a dramatic escalation of tensions between the world’s two biggest economies amid fresh accusations of Chinese espionage in the United States and calls by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a new global coalition against Beijing.China’s embassy to the United States described the move to close the Houston consulate as a “political provocation” and called on Washington to “immediately revoke” the decision. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying wrote on Twitter that China would “surely react with firm countermeasures”. The Global Times, an English-language tabloid run by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper, also accused US President Donald Trump of playing politics. ​”The November presidential election is driving Washington mad,” it said.(With agencies inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-chinese-researcher-lined-to-military-hiding-in-san-francisco-consulate-report/story-9nj3POipwDb5OWrNgjRTNN.html

We condemn the attack and support an investigation,” Khalilzad wrote on his Twitter page on late Wednesday, reported Sputnik.Airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan killed 45 people, including civilians and Taliban fighters, local officials said on Wednesday.Ali Ahmad Faqir Yar, governor of Adraskan district in the eastern Afghan province of Herat, said, “Forty-five people had been killed so far in airstrikes by security forces in the Kham Ziarat area. Taliban were among those killed and at least eight civilians were among the dead”.The diplomat also slammed the Taliban Islamist movement for recent attacks that also resulted in many civilian deaths.“The Afghan people want an immediate start of peace negotiations and a settlement that is in their best interest. More graves will not bring negotiations forward. Rather than setting the process back, we urge all sides to contain the violence, protect civilians, and show necessary restraint as the start of intra-Afghan negotiations is so close,” Khalilzad added.Under the US-Taliban peace agreement which was signed in Doha on February 29, up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners should be released by the Afghan government ahead of the intra-Afghan negotiations.The process has not been completed yet.Despite the February agreement, the situation in Afghanistan has remained volatile with sporadic attacks both by the Afghan forces and the Taliban, on each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-condemns-deadly-airstrikes-in-afghanistan-s-herat-province/story-HxAmlwicc5kX9Qgn7z6ECP.html

Gennady Zyuganov, in a column, attacked “capital globalism” and claimed that the mandatory vaccination plan is a “ploy by so-called globalists to implant chip in every human being so that their movements could be monitored”.Gates said he wants to bring the coronavirus pandemic to an end and hoped that the theory dies down as people get the facts.Gates and a foundation led by him and his wife Melinda are working to find a vaccine for Covid-19. In February, the foundation had announced that it is donating US $100 million to vaccine research and treatment efforts.Meanwhile, GSK and CureVac, backed by Gates, are work on developing up to five so-called mRNA-based vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases. mRNA vaccines use ribonucleic acid (RNA), a chemical messenger that evokes an immune response when injected by instructing cells to make proteins that mimic pathogens.The approach, also being deployed in experimental Covid-19 vaccines by BioNTech and partner Pfizer and Moderna, is yet to be approved in any therapy.Tech giant Google had recently said that it will prohibit websites and apps that use its advertising technology from running ads on “dangerous content” that goes against scientific consensus during the coronavirus pandemic. Examples of content that will not be allowed to make money from ads include debunked conspiracy theories, such as the notion that the novel coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab as a bioweapon, that it was created by Microsoft founder Bill Gates or that the virus is a hoax, Google said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-it-dies-down-bill-gates-on-theory-claiming-he-is-planning-to-implant-chips-via-covid-19-vaccine/story-JWHGHxSvhBARCE89pHbUQM.html
23-07-2020||World||Hong Kong records highest single day spike of 102 Covid-19 cases||Hong Kong reported a record 102 new local virus cases on Wednesday as the city’s “most severe” situation since the pandemic began prompted health officials to expand virus-protection measures.Of the additional local cases, more than half were unlinked to previous cases, according to data from the city’s health department on Wednesday. The Asian financial hub has been caught off-guard by the sudden eruption of infections, with the number of untraceable cases signaling that hidden chains of transmission are widespread.“Hong Kong’s epidemic is at the most severe moment,” Sophia Chan, secretary for food and health, said in a briefing Wednesday. “I urge all citizens to stay in their homes and stop unnecessary outings.”Officials said on Wednesday that imported cases numbered 8, out of a total of 113 imported and local infections. On Thursday, the Hong Kong government revised the number of imported cases to 11, making the number of local infections 102, not 105.Officials are quickly imposing the strictest rules yet after easing guidelines over the past month. Effective Thursday, mask-wearing requirements will be expanded to indoor public venues -- including malls, shops, supermarkets, markets and building lobbies, Chan said. The maximum fine will be HK$5,000 ($645). Currently, public transport passengers are already required to wear masks to curb the virus.Hong Kong will also extend a 14-day mandatory quarantine for those with travel history to mainland China, Taiwan and Macau to Sept. 7. The US and Kazakhstan were added to a list of high-risk regions, meaning inbound travelers who have been to those countries in the last 14 days must pass a virus test before boarding their flights.The government might further tighten virus-control rules if cases continue to surge, Chan said. The city has dismissed speculation that Hong Kong will be imminently locked down.Hong Kong is reeling from another wave of cases as outbreaks elsewhere in Asia are also raising alarms. Australia, once hailed as a success in containing the virus, hit a daily record for infections on Wednesday. Tokyo’s infections now total more than 10,000, as Japan’s capital struggles to stamp out new clusters. The flare-ups are a sobering reminder of the difficulty of eradicating the pandemic that has sickened almost 15 million people worldwide.The resurgence of cases in Hong Kong has been aggressive after a period that saw residents return to normal life. While the city reacted quickly to the epidemic earlier this year, implemented mask-wearing and social distancing, complacency set in as daily local cases dwindled to near zero in mid-April.In addition to the tighter new restrictions, the government is also scrambling to boost testing, quarantine and hospitalization facilities. But for now, it is avoiding a lockdown as it tries to keep the economy open.Lam Ching Choi, a member of Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s Executive Council and a doctor, said Hong Kong is seeking a strategy that balances public health, the economy and social acceptance in a city that has been rocked by anti-government protests. As a result, it isn’t aiming for zero cases, like mainland China is, through heavy lockdowns.Lam also noted the difficulty of shutting down restaurants, even though they are high-risk areas, because of the popularity of dining out in the city, with some families never cooking at home. Hong Kong restaurants currently must stop dine-in services by 6 p.m.“Our trust level is maybe the lowest compared with western countries because of the social events that happened this year,” Lam said in an interview. “So we must listen to our people and not affect their work, their daily lives – like shopping or visiting their family members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-102-covid-19-cases/story-5Kkuw8Vo5oGny2qnnPvvQN.html

23-07-2020||World||Mexico’s president downplays importance of wearing masks amid Covid pandemic||Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Wednesday downplayed the importance of wearing face masks during the pandemic, calling his treasury secretary’s assertion that using them would be a factor in reactivating the economy “disproportionate.”López Obrador had never been seen publicly wearing a mask until he flew to Washington earlier this month to meet with President Donald Trump.“If a mask was an option for the economy’s reactivation, I’d put one on immediately,” López Obrador said Wednesday. “But it’s not like that. I follow the recommendations of the doctors, of the scientists.”The World Health Organization recommends the wearing of masks among other measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. At age 66, López Obrador also falls into an at-risk group of people who should wear masks.Mexico continued to report high transmission rates Wednesday, with 6,019 newly confirmed cases, for a cumulative total of 362,274 infections. The Health Department also reported 790 more deaths, bringing the total so far in the pandemic to 41,190, the fourth highest total behind the United Kingdom at 45,586.On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Arturo Herrera said in a virtual meeting with a national business council that countries that have taken a more ordered approach and precautions in reactivating their economies had been more successful than others that suffered new outbreaks and had to lock down again.Herrera himself had been earlier infected with Covid-19 and recovered.On Wednesday, Herrera was sitting behind López Obrador when he spoke and he asked the president to let him clarify his comments from the day before. He said he was using the mask as an “analogy” to explain to business owners that measures have to be taken to safely operate now. Among such measures are masks and he pulled out his own.López Obrador returned to the podium and pronounced: “It’s safe distance and freedom.” He then proceeded to commend Mexicans for being careful and to criticize recent stories in the press that highlight the number dead in countries with presidents who don’t wear masks, including Mexico, the United States and Brazil.Trump tweeted a photo of himself wearing a mask Monday and yesterday conceded that they had an impact.López Obrador continued traveling around Mexico for weeks, wading into crowds like usual, after Mexico confirmed its first Covid-19 infection Feb. 28. He has generally downplayed the pandemic’s threat and pushed to reopen Mexico’s economy.“It’s not just the mask,” he said. “It has to do with a number of factors of all kinds.”On Wednesday, the Health Department reported that Covid-19 has now become the leading cause of death among pregnant women in Mexico and those who have recently given birth, accounting for 19% of such deaths.A total of 2,842 infections have been confirmed among pregnant women and those who have recently given birth, resulting in 83 deaths. The agency said 88% percent of the infections were confirmed during pregnancy and 12% after giving birth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-s-president-downplays-importance-of-wearing-masks-amid-covid-pandemic/story-7FfdICRwSzVC2ycd7yaEgJ.html
23-07-2020||World||Trump to send federal agents to more US cities as part of ‘law and order’ campaign||President Donald Trump announced a plan on Wednesday to send federal agents to the Democratic-run cities of Chicago and Albuquerque to crack down on violent crime in an escalation of his “law and order” theme heading into the final months before the presidential election.Trump, joined at a White House event by Attorney General William Barr, unveiled an expansion of the “Operation Legend” program to more cities in a further effort by federal officials to tackle violence.“Today I’m announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime,” said Trump, a Republican who has accused Democratic mayors and governors of tolerating crime waves. “This bloodshed must end; this bloodshed will end,” he said.The program involves deploying federal law enforcement agents to assist local police in combating what the Justice Department has described as a “surge” of violent crime.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, welcomed the federal help, so long as it was to assist local law enforcement with community policing and public safety. Both rejected the use of federal agents for the kind of protest crackdown seen in Portland, Oregon, saying such actions would be met with legal action.“If the Trump administration wishes to antagonize New Mexicans and Americans with authoritarian, unnecessary and unaccountable military-style ‘crackdowns,’ they have no business whatsoever in New Mexico,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. Barr sought to differentiate the initiative from the use of federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to quell unrest in Portland, where local authorities have complained about the federal involvement.Barr said the law enforcement personnel from a variety of agencies will serve as “street” agents and investigators who will be working to “solve murders and take down violent gangs.”“This is different than the operations and tactical teams we use to defend against riots and mob violence,” Barr said. “We will continue to confront mob violence. But the operations we are discussing today are very different – they are classic crime fighting.”Trump hopes his “law and order” push will resonate with his political base as he trails Democrat Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. But the initiative risks inflaming tensions running high in many cities in the wake of the death in police custody of George Floyd, an African-American.Operation Legend involves federal agents from the FBI, US Marshals Service and other agencies partnering with local law enforcement.Lightfoot said it was not unusual for federal law enforcement to work alongside local partners, but urged Chicagoans to watch for any sign that federal agents, especially DHS officers, were stepping “out of line.”“We don’t need federal troops, we don’t need unnamed, secret federal agents,” said Lightfoot, in reference to tactics used by federal personnel in Portland.Trump has emphasized a robust policing and military approach to the protests across the United States about racial inequality after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.The White House has sought to focus on city crime even as Trump’s approval numbers plummet in response to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “We are waiting for the mayor (Lightfoot), respectfully, and other mayors and governors to call us. We are ready, willing and able to go in there with great force,” Trump told reporters later on Wednesday.Operation Legend is named for LeGend Taliferro, a 4-year-old boy who was shot and killed while he slept early on June 29 in Kansas City, Missouri, according to the Department of Justice’s website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-send-federal-agents-to-more-us-cities-as-part-of-law-and-order-campaign/story-vuYcK0ZJ35BwawDDV6tX1K.html
23-07-2020||World||Canada sees fresh Covid-19 spike, experts blame it on ‘fatigue factor’||Young Canadians flocking to bars or packed indoor parties may be contributing to a fresh spike in the number of coronavirus cases in the country. The number of fresh cases reported in a day, which had gone down earlier, has now increased by over 50 per cent, crossing 450.Canada’s Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr Howard Njoo said there may be a “fatigue factor” in play as younger adults are seeking to enjoy themselves after over three months of facing restrictive measures. Most provinces in the country have brought about relaxations and opened bars, restaurants and pubs.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNjoo pointed out that younger adults, those under 39, now comprised 55 per cent of new cases as against approximately a third in May.As social gatherings increase, authorities are also seeing the number of contacts per person increase tenfold from threefold or fourfold earlier.Among the most impacted provinces in Canada is Ontario. On Tuesday it witnessed 203 new positive cases, the highest since late June. Ontario health authorities said 57 per cent of those cases involved those aged below 39.According to Public Health Agency of Canada, those in the 20-29 demographic formed the largest chunk of new cases in the second week of July.This trend has caused concern among health authorities in the country, even as the overall numbers haven’t spiraled out of control with the country recording nearly 112,000 cases with 8,862 deaths.Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam echoed the worry that younger Canadians may cause a resurgence in Covid-19 infections. Though our social, economic and recreational spaces are cautiously re-opening, we can’t afford to throw caution to the wind. Living with Covid-19 means we cannot eliminate all cases and clusters in Canada, so preventing epidemic acceleration depends on our actions, individually and collectively,” she said in a statement.Pointing out that this summer is “not like any other”, she advised Canadians to stay in their “social bubble”, avoid closed and crowded spaces and maintain measures like social distancing and wearing masks, even as the last two have been among those often sacrificed in places like bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sees-fresh-covid-19-spike-experts-blame-it-on-fatigue-factor/story-1zJA69GFFYXBDYPYICCFKJ.html

23-07-2020||World||California moves past New York, now tops in United States for Covid cases||A record one-day total of newly confirmed coronavirus cases gave California more than 409,000 since the pandemic began, sending it past New York for the most in the country, data from Wednesday showed.California’s cases have climbed rapidly in the last month, punctuated by the 12,807 recorded Tuesday, while New York’‘s have fallen to less than 1,000 per day. California’s overall total is about 700 more than New York’s, according to a tally Johns Hopkins University.The surge of cases in California came after much of its economy was reopened in May and early June following nearly three months under the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order that forced most businesses to close and restricted where people could go.Statewide, hospitalizations have nearly doubled in the past month to more than 7,100 patients. Coronavirus patients in intensive care have risen 71% over the same time frame to more than 2,000 patients.Gov. Gavin Newsom and health officials have blamed the increase on people — many of them younger adults — gathering with friends and family and not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing.At the end of June, Newsom began reimposing shutdowns. Bars and inside dining are forbidden statewide and tougher restrictions — including bans on indoor religious services and in-person instruction at schools and closures of indoor malls and gyms — have been imposed on virtually every large county and some small ones where the outbreak is most severe.Officials say it’s still too soon to know if the new restrictions will adequately slow the spread of the virus. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has warned the situation in LA has become so tenuous that a virtual lockdown may be needed.Still, the lure of sunny skies has beckoned families and friends to gather for barbecues and pool parties despite pleas from public health officials to stay home.“I know it’s hard,” Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Wednesday. “I know it’s a sacrifice, especially on beautiful summer days. But I’m asking people to stay home as much as possible. Avoid gathering with people you don’t live with.”New York still has by far the most coronavirus-related deaths in the country with more than 32,500 — four times more than California’s tally of about 7,900. New York’s rate of confirmed infections of about 2,100 per 100,000 people is twice California’s rate.With nearly 40 million residents, California is the most populous state in the country by a wide stretch. New York has 19.5 million residents.Newsom said it wasn’t surprising California would eventually have the most cases. He added, however, that it is “a sober reminder of why we are taking things as seriously as we are.”But with the disease spreading faster than public health officials can track it, it’s impossible to know the true extent of the virus’s reach in the United States. Federal government data published Tuesday found that reported and confirmed coronavirus cases vastly underestimate the true number of infections, echoing results from a smaller study last month.Testing supplies were so scarce at the start of the pandemic that many people had it and recovered without ever getting checked to see if they had the disease. Antibody surveys in New York City have suggested that by late April, as many as 1 in 5 people in the city had the disease, which would be about 1.6 million people.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study said true Covid-19 rates were more than 10 times higher than reported cases in most US regions from late March to early May. It is based on Covid-19 antibody tests performed on routine blood samples in 16,000 people in 10 US regions.In California, Los Angeles County and its 10 million residents remain a virus hot spot. County officials announced 64 new deaths on Wednesday, raising the total to 4,213 as the number of confirmed cases soared past 164,800. County hospitals had 2,207 patients, marking the fourth day in a row of hospitalizations exceeding 2,200 people.A state watch list of counties with increasing number of cases grew to 35 on Wednesday as officials added rural Butte County to the list. The Northern California county was devastated by a 2018 wildfire that destroyed most of the town of Paradise.Counties on the watch list for three consecutive days trigger a new round of restrictions, including closing indoor operations at hair and nail salons. The renewed restrictions now apply to more than 85% of the state’s population, fuelling fears of a more job losses in a state where more than 8 million people have applied for unemployment benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-moves-past-new-york-now-tops-in-united-states-for-covid-cases/story-NuNK9Fdqanz1Q6HgekAVLJ.html
23-07-2020||World||Donald Trump is first racist US president, says Joe Biden||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden labeled Donald Trump on Wednesday the first racist to become US president in remarks his opponent’s re-election campaign quickly rebuked.Biden, who was vice president under Barack Obama, the first Black US president, fielded a question at a Service Employees International Union roundtable from a healthcare worker concerned about the Republican president calling the coronavirus pandemic the “China virus.”He responded by saying it was “absolutely sickening” how Trump “deals with people based on the color of their skin, their national origin, where they’re from.”He added: “No sitting president’s ever done this. Never, never, never. No Republican president has done this. No Democratic president. We’ve had racists, and they’ve existed, and they’ve tried to get elected president. He’s the first one that has.”Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson fired back, calling Biden’s comments “an insult to the intelligence of Black voters” given the onetime senator’s past work with segregationist lawmakers. She said Trump “loves all people” and “works hard to empower all Americans.”A number of US presidents owned slaves or supported policies including the repression of Native Americans and segregation of Black Americans. Princeton University said last month it was dropping former President Woodrow Wilson’s name from the school, citing his racist thinking and policies.The Biden-Trump exchange marks an escalation in what had already been a heated clash on race in the campaign being waged between the two candidates, who are both white, ahead of their Nov. 3 election contest.Biden previously criticized Trump for stoking racial division, often saying that he was motivated to run for office by his outrage over Trump’s assessment that “both sides” were to blame for violence between white supremacists and counterprotesters at a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Race became an even more central issue as protests raged over unarmed African Americans being killed by police in the aftermath of the May death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police office pressed his neck into the pavement for more than eight minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-is-first-racist-us-president-says-joe-biden/story-PW2l0p68BLe1hipZuh5EqI.html

23-07-2020||World||Airline flies empty A380 to nowhere to keep its pilots certified||Airlines are taking extreme measures to survive the pandemic, with Asiana Airlines Inc. flying the world’s biggest commercial plane more than 20 times, going nowhere and carrying no passengers, just to keep trainee pilots certified.Keeping crew flight-ready is one of the challenges carriers face as they grapple with the unprecedented crisis that keeps more than a third of the world’s fleet grounded.The empty Airbus SE A380 flew over South Korea for a few hours a day for three days in May to enable pilots of the 495-seat superjumbo to practice taking off and landing. The alternative -- a trip to Thailand to use a simulator owned by Thai Airways International Pcl -- was blocked because of travel bans, an Asiana spokesman said.“Takeoffs and landings of this plane cost a lot of money, and it’s money that needs to be used wisely, especially these days,” said Um Kyung-a, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. “Asiana is in a bind because it also can’t afford for its pilots to lose their licenses.”Asiana had another 135 pilots who didn’t have enough flying time on its six A380s, but it couldn’t afford to keep flying the empty jet. In the end, the country’s transport ministry extended the pilots’ flying credentials as a special exemption. Japan’s All Nippon Airways, which operates two A380s, received a similar extension from Japan’s aviation authority.Most of the big A380 operators, like Asiana’s rival Korean Air Lines Co., have their own simulators.The International Civil Aviation Organization has provided guidelines to state members on how to help pilots keep up their skills. Normally, pilots must have taken off and landed an aircraft at least three times within the previous 90 days to keep their license.The problem is acute for the biggest jets, which were designed for an age of mass travel. But Boeing Co.’s 747 has more simulators and is used by many airlines, including Korean Air, for cargo flights, allowing carriers to rotate crews to keep them certified.The International Air Transport Association said international air traffic may not return to pre-Covid levels until 2024.One of the few that’s still flying the A380 is Emirates Airlines, which has the world’s biggest fleet of the superjumbos. The airline restarted A380 flights on July 15 to London Heathrow and Paris as Dubai eased travel restrictions.Deutsche Lufthansa AG said last month its A380 jets will be mothballed for at least two years and may never return to service. Even before the virus, weak demand for the giant plane caused Airbus to announce it would stop making the A380 next year.“It’s like you’re basically stuck with a 1990 car that’s running on diesel,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. “We’re going to see more heading to the scrapyard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airline-flies-empty-a380-to-nowhere-to-keep-its-pilots-certified/story-gjhFVa2AmF9mx7JvvauIhO.html

It is a mistake that I regret. I apologize for that.”The finance minister said the C$41,366 in expenses were incurred when his family traveled to Kenya and Ecuador in 2017 with the non-profit group. Morneau also said his family made two C$50,000 donations to WE, one in April 2018 to support work for students in Canada and a second last month for Covid-19 relief efforts in Kenya.Morneau said he wasn’t aware he had incurred the expenses at the time, and only realized the “error” after a recent review of the trips.Along with Trudeau, Morneau is also under investigation by Canada’s ethics watchdog for possible conflict of interest over the decision to award a contract worth up C$43.5 million to WE for the administration of a C$900 million student grant program. Two of the finance minister’s daughters have ties to the group, including one who currently works for the organization.Separately Wednesday, the prime minister’s office said Trudeau has accepted an invitation to testify before the finance committee on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-charity-scandal-trudeau-s-finance-minister-admits-to-travel-gift/story-0FdBTW5Q6E3zurTFeiDUDN.html
23-07-2020||World||Pompeo tells UK MPs China ‘bought’ WHO chief Tedros||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo told a group of British lawmakers that China had “bought” the head of the World Health Organization, according to people familiar with the matter.At a private meeting in London on Tuesday, Pompeo said there was firm intelligence to show that a deal had been done to get Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus the job of WHO director-general -- and that this had resulted in the deaths of UK citizens from coronavirus, the people said.Three of those who were present at the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussion was private, said Pompeo told them he believed China had bought the WHO chief. He didn’t give further details of what he meant but said there was intelligence to support this comment.The Chinese Embassy in London and the State Department did not respond to emailed requests for comment. The WHO rejected “unfounded allegations” which first surfaced in British newspapers including the Telegraph on Tuesday.Pompeo’s allegations mark a significant escalation in the Trump administration’s criticism of the WHO and of China’s response to the pandemic. US officials have said the WHO allowed the coronavirus outbreak to get out of control and President Donald Trump has said it is too close to China.Speaking a day after Tuesday’s meeting, Conservative member of Parliament Iain Duncan Smith, who was present, confirmed that Pompeo had said China swayed the WHO director-general election in May 2017 so Tedros won.“He openly made the point that the arrival of the present chief who had taken the WHO backwards and that it had become quite political,” Duncan Smith told Bloomberg TV Wednesday, when asked about Pompeo’s comments. “He therefore said that it was China had managed to get others to ensure that they voted for this particular candidate at the time and that is why the US, he said, has decided to withdraw and use the money,” to tackle some of the projects the WHO supports.According to three of the people present, Pompeo criticized the WHO and the United Nations Human Rights Council during the hour-long meeting.“WHO is not aware of any such statement but we strongly reject any ‘ad hominem’ attacks and unfounded allegations,” an emailed statement from the WHO read. “WHO urges countries to remain focused on tackling the pandemic that is causing tragic loss of life and suffering.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s officials were asked about Pompeo’s comments and confirmed that the Secretary of State had not made similar remarks in his meeting with the premier on Tuesday.“The prime minister believes the WHO and its Director General are playing an important role in leading the global health response to the pandemic,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack told reporters. “The WHO continues to have an important role to play in leading the global health response to the pandemic, the UK is a major donor to the WHO.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-tells-uk-mps-china-bought-who-chief-tedros/story-ySYJsVVP18PUUrfFmTfJXM.html
23-07-2020||World||Trump willing to work with China on Covid-19 vaccine ‘if it gets good results’||US President Donald Trump expressed a willingness on Tuesday to work with China or other countries to bring a successful coronavirus vaccine to the United States, despite rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.“We’re willing to work with anybody that is going to get us a good result,” Trump said, when asked if the administration would collaborate with China on a vaccine for Americans, whether China is first to develop one or not.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage​The remarks came a day after researchers said a vaccine against the coronavirus developed by China’s CanSino Biologics Inc (6185.HK) and China’s military research unit appeared to be safe and induced immune responses in most subjects in a closely-watched mid-stage study.The CanSino candidate is one of a handful of vaccines that have shown some promise in early human testing. Others gearing up for such trials include vaccines from US-based Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and Germany’s BioNTech SE (22UAy.F), in partnership with American drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).Data from a combined early/midstage trial of a vaccine candidate being developed by researchers at the University of Oxford and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca (AZN.L) was also released on Monday.Trump has long blamed China for mishandling the deadly coronavirus pandemic, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and charged across the United States, killing more than 140,000 Americans and raising the stakes for a quick and viable vaccine.“I think we’re going to have some very good results. We’re already in testing. Nobody thought that would be possible,” he said. “I think you’re going to see something over the next fairly short period of time - maybe very short period of time - having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-willing-to-work-with-china-on-covid-19-vaccine-if-it-gets-good-results/story-MZ3Ub6tHf71Rk6aLZmMETM.html
