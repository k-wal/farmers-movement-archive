Helping people return to gyms safely will also help the nation get match-fit to defeat this virus”.Officials, however, said the people will still need to remain cautious and follow guidance about social distancing, wearing face covering and limiting interaction with people outside their immediate family and friends circles.Leisure centres and indoor gyms, along with swimming pools and other indoor sports facilities, have been closed in the UK since March 21. Various organisations have lobbied the government to allow them to re-open in recent days.Dowden said: “The reopening of gyms is the news millions across the country have been waiting for with many people desperate to jump on a spinning bike or dive into a pool. Our comprehensive guidance will ensure gyms, pools and leisure centres have the support they need to reopen safely for their customers and staff”.“Helping people return to gyms safely will also help the nation get match-fit to defeat this virus,” he added.Leicester in the east Midlands remains under lockdown, unlike the rest of England, where pubs, restaurants and galleries are among those allowed to re-open. Testing in the city with a large population of Indian origin has shown falling number of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-after-huge-progress-gyms-plays-get-green-signal-to-re-open-in-uk/story-qL7dRooCFTd1Qy7RbHyqeO.html

Using other legal recourse still available, the president’s lawyers can prevent the release of these records till at least the November elections.Ruling 7-2 in both cases, the court rejected the central argument put forward by the president’s lawyers to prevent the release thee records — not from him directly, but his accountants — that US presidents enjoy complete and absolute immunity from criminal prosecution while in office.“We reaffirm that principle today and hold that the president is neither absolutely immune from criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need.” Chief Justice John Robert wrote in the majority opinion in the New York investigation case.In the same ruling, he also wrote, “In our judicial system, ‘the public has a right to ‘everyman’s evidence’. Since the earliest days of the Republic, ‘every man’ has included the President of the United States.”President Trump, who has refused to release his tax and financial records bucking a long-running practice for US presidents or those even running for the high office, will get to hold on to his financial records for now and until the elections at least, as his lawyers can challenge the New York investigators’ subpoenas for his records in lower courts. And his lawyers have said since that is their plan. It was thus a win for the president also, in a way. But he did not see it that way and lashed out in a string of angry tweets. “This is all a political prosecution. I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!” he wrote in one of them.“Courts in the past have given ‘broad deference’., he wrote in another. “BUT NOT ME!”Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both nominated by President Trump, ruled with the majority opinion, denying the president’s central claim of absolute immunity from prosecution.The office of the Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance, a Democrat, had sought eight years of the president financial records form Mazars USA, his accountant, in an investigation into the payment of hush-money to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who has said she had an affair with Trump. Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and fixer who is in jail for it, had paid her not to talk about the relationship in the run-up to the 2016 election, and was reimbursed by the president later.The second case was about subpoenas issued separately by the oversight committee and the intelligence committee of the House of Representatives that are also investigating the Stormy Daniels payments and whether Trump underreported his assets to reduce his tax liabilities, or inflated them overplay his worth to obtain loans. The Supreme Court ordered the House committees to go back to lower courts to get these records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-denies-trump-immunity-unblocks-release-of-financial-records/story-ioSca8mNQ5eEUTdcLxyYOO.html

With testing levels low, the real numbers are unknown.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageSouth Africa has the most confirmed cases with over 224,000, and for the first time Gauteng province — home to Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria — has the country’s most cases with over 75,000, or 33 per cent.Provincial official Bandile Masuku, a medical doctor, startled South Africans when he told reporters Wednesday that Gauteng is preparing over 1.5 million graves. “It’s a reality that we need to deal with,” he said, and it’s the public’s responsibility “to make sure that we don’t get there.” The province in a statement Thursday sought to calm fears, saying it “does not have over a million already open dug graves” and the number refers to the potential capacity. It also said six members of Gauteng’s Covid-19 War Room have tested positive for the virus.Asked about the comments, Africa CDC chief John Nkengasong said “there’s absolutely no harm to think ahead” and prepare for the worst-case scenario.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-in-africa-is-now-reaching-full-speed/story-Wf4ghViv5jsPgwgsNzNpwI.html
09-07-2020||World||Pak religious affairs ministry seeks Islamic body’s advice on construction of temple in Islamabad||Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry has written to an Islamic body to seek its opinion on the government’s funding for the construction of the first Hindu temple in the capital city amid opposition from some Muslim groups, a media report said on Thursday.The Krishna temple will come up in a 20,000 sq ft plot in the capital’s H-9 administrative division.Pakistan’s Minister of Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri on Wednesday said there was no problem related to the construction of the temple, but the real issue was whether it could be built with the public money.Pakistan government has approved Rs 100 million (Rs 10 crore) for the temple. Qadri has now forwarded the case to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), Dawn newspaper reported.The CII is a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the Pakistan government.In the letter, Qadri sought the council’s opinion on whether the government was allowed to fund the construction of a temple in the city, the report said.The letter asked whether the government can build a non-Muslim place of worship using government funds, it said.It said that a delegation from the Islamabad Hindu Panchayat and some non-Muslim parliamentarians met with Qadri and sought government funding for the temple’s construction.In the letter, the Qadri said his ministry also deals with the Minorities Welfare Fund, which is used for the repair and maintenance of religious sites of minority communities on the basis of recommendations from non-Muslim parliamentarians.“However, construction of a new place of worship for the religious minorities was not permissible under the rules,” the letter said, adding that in view of the situation, the application was forwarded to the Prime Minister’s Office for consideration.Parliamentarians and Qadri met with Prime Minister Imran Khan on this matter. The visit was used by some clerics, who opposed the construction of the temple, to create a controversy, according to the letter.CII Chairman Qibla Ayaz acknowledged that he had received the ministry’s letter and said it has been forwarded to the council’s research department to formulate an opinion on this question.Ayaz said clerics should not protest the matter but should guide the CII on it instead. He said it will be taken up during the CII’s meeting scheduled for September, as it takes two to three weeks for the research department to finalise an opinion after holding consultations and seeking public comments if needed.Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, a lawmaker from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, told Dawn that the argument regarding the funding for the temple was incorrect.“Some people say that a Hindu temple cannot be built with taxes collected from Muslims. That is correct and we agree with it but has any money been spent on the construction of any temple in the country with taxes paid by the Hindu community in 70 years,” he asked.“Therefore, the government’s grant of Rs100 million is valid, as it was actually our money,” he said.Meanwhile, a protest was also held in support of the temple’s construction at the National Press Club.The protesters said the temple should have been built for the city’s Hindu population decades ago and demanded that the government not bow down to pressure from extremists who have been harassing citizens of the country constantly on various pretexts. A Pakistani court on Tuesday dismissed three identical petitions challenging the construction of the first Hindu temple in Islamabad.A single bench of the Islamabad High Court delivered the judgement, making it clear that there was no bar on the Institute of Hindu Panchayat from building the temple on the land allotted to it, using its own funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-religious-affairs-ministry-seeks-islamic-body-s-advice-on-construction-of-temple-in-islamabad/story-arvT2rdgfLwXbIztGIPGQK.html

A booming MSME sector will also complement big industry. There are investment opportunities in the defence sector”.“With relaxed FDI norms, one of the world’s biggest militaries invites you to come and make products for it. Now, there are more opportunities for private investment in space sector. This will mean greater access to commercial use of space tech for the benefit of people,” he added.Noting India’s efforts to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, Modi said his government is equally focused on the health of the economy, and mentioned initiatives such as Ayushman Bharat, tax reforms and efforts to increase the ease of doing business.India, he told the virtual audience, will have a key role in scaling-up production of a vaccine for coronavirus, when it is found in ongoing trials across the globe. The pandemic has once again shown that India’s pharma industry is an asset for the entire world, he added.On his government’s relief package for those adversely affected by the pandemic, he said it has been smart and targeted to provide the most poor with the most help.He said: “Thanks to technology, every penny has reached the beneficiaries directly. The relief includes, providing free cooking gas, cash in the bank accounts, free food grains to millions of people and many other things”. “As soon as we unlocked, we have launched one of the world’s largest public works program to provide employment to millions of workers. This will not only re-energise the rural economy, but also help in creation of durable infrastructure in the rural areas.”, he added.Speakers at the three-day event themed ‘Be the revival: India & a better new world’ include Indian ministers S Jaishankar, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Piyush Goyal; British ministers such as Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Priti Patel; and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/noting-green-shoots-pm-modi-beckons-global-investors/story-Yhxen2FJPvN2KzyH7Wf4zO.html

09-07-2020||World||UN chief seeks end to financing of coal to smooth clean energy shift||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries on Thursday to stop financing for coal and commit not to build new coal-fired power plants to enable a shift to clean energy.He spoke at a virtual clean energy transition summit of 40 countries representing 80% of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. They discussed steps to buoy economies, cut emissions and make energy systems more resilient to climate change.As countries look to revive their economies from the slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, governments and investors have been calling for recovery packages to focus in part on green stimulus.The European Union and South Korea have already pledged environmentally-minded recovery programmes. But Guterres said some countries have used them to also prop up fossil fuel companies which were already struggling financially, and others have chosen to jump-start coal-fired power plants.“Coal has no place in COVID-19 recovery plans,” Guterres said in a videolink speech to the summit, hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA).He said the business case for renewables was better than coal in nearly every market and that green jobs and sustainable growth are both crucial.China, the world’s second largest economy and biggest coal producer, said it was committed to a clean and efficient low-carbon development of the energy sector.“We are going to make great efforts to develop hydro, wind and solar,” Zhang Jinhua, director of China’s National Energy Administration, told the virtual meeting.Although coal use has been declining in some regions such as Europe and the United States, and many investors have pulled out of coal financing, it has been growing in other parts of the world as emerging economies say coal use is needed for growth.A recent study found that China has nearly 250 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power now under development, more than the entire coal power capacity of the United States.Governments have agreed to curb global warming to safer levels to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change and to achieve a net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.“Global energy demand has declined sharply this year and so did emissions (due to coronavirus-related lockdowns). But whether that decline will rebound or not we do not know. Ministers will decide through the policies they put in place,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.The IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, said last week a huge acceleration in clean energy innovation is needed to achieve a global goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It has also produced a roadmap for governments to cut carbon emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-seeks-end-to-financing-of-coal-to-smooth-clean-energy-shift/story-A82TKy7I2B3DK3gr9eHlTL.html

There is an ongoing trade war, the South China Sea issue– where Washington has dispatched two of its super aircraft carriers – the status of Hong Kong, the tit-for-tat visa restrictions over Tibet and the human rights situation in the remote northwestern province of Xinjiang.“What is alarming is that the Sino-US relationship is one of the most important bilateral relations in the world, but is facing the most serious challenges since the establishment of diplomatic relations [in 1979],” Wang said in a speech in Beijing on Thursday.“Then we should properly manage those disputes and minimise the damage to relations between the two nations based on the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences,” he said.Washington has repeatedly accused Beijing in recent months of covering up the initial outbreak of the coronavirus, which later transformed into an epidemic, and accused it of allowing it to spread to other nations.US President Donald Trump has called it the “Chinese virus” on more than one occasion, triggering strong criticism from China.On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the world should not permit China’s “bullying” to take place, highlighting the country’s territorial disputes with India, Vietnam, and Japan, which has further riled Beijing with the Chinese foreign ministry making scathing comments on the US politician.Wang, who is one of China’s senior most diplomats, suggested that think tanks in China and the US compile three lists, with the first outlining bilateral and global issues the two countries could work on, and the second detailing issues on which they have disputes but expectations that can be resolved through dialogue. The final list should be of issues that cannot be resolved, Wang said.Some people say that China-US relations cannot go back to what they used to be, but that does not mean that the two countries begin anew regardless of history, Wang was quoted as saying.Decoupling cannot be forced either, Wang said, adding that Beijing and Washington should build on the past and advance with the times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-relations-facing-most-serious-challenge-minister-wang-yi/story-tZJwEDbLOgUhEkMTBdxfxN.html
09-07-2020||World||Hong Kong tightens social distancing to combat new virus outbreak||Hong Kong tightened social distancing measures on Thursday to combat a fresh coronavirus outbreak in a city that had largely managed to quash local transmissions in recent months.Health officials have been rattled by a cluster of new infections that have suddenly spread through the tightly packed business hub of 7.5 million people.The city recorded 34 locally transmitted coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest daily tally in more than three months. “Now that the pandemic is coming back, I appeal to everyone to reduce outings, gatherings and dining together,” health minister Sophia Chan told reporters. Authorities announced a reintroduction of limits to how many people can gather together, a repeat of measures taken earlier in the year that helped stifle the coronavirus outbreak. A maximum of eight people can sit together at restaurants while bars, pubs and nightclubs are capped at four people per table.Catering businesses can only operate at 60 percent of their usual capacity. Gyms and karaoke lounges must have no more than 16 people in each room or facility.Hong Kong was one of the first places to be struck by the coronavirus earlier this year after it burst out of central China.But authorities made impressive headway against the disease, helped by a population with previous experience of outbreaks who readily adopted facemasks and social distancing. The city has recorded 1,365 cases of the disease since January, with seven deaths. However the new outbreak shows the stubborn resilience of the coronavirus, even in a city with a strong record of stopping its spread. New infection clusters started to emerge in the past two days, including at an elderly care home that reported at least 32 cases. At least 12 new infections in the last five days have been classified as unknown in origin, meaning authorities are struggling to work out how the disease is spreading in those instances.Last month, Hong Kong relaxed its social distancing rules to allow public gatherings of up to 50 people, reopen theme parks and scrap customer restrictions for restaurants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-tightens-social-distancing-to-combat-new-virus-outbreak/story-SUUMevcxxfEo0Ss5peQ0OI.html
09-07-2020||World||Seoul mayor reported missing, his phone switched off, search underway||The mayor of South Korean capital Seoul has been reported missing and police are searching for him on Thursday.Police officers said they are looking for Mayor Park Won-soon at Seoul’s Sungbuk neighborhood where his mobile phone signal was last detected. They said Park’s mobile phone was currently turned off.His daughter called police earlier Thursday and said her father has been unaccounted for, the police officers said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media on the matter.They gave no further details. But Yonhap news agency reported Park’s daughter told police that her father left “a will-like” message before leaving their home earlier Thursday.Yonhap said officers, drones and police dogs have been mobilized for Park’s search.Kim Ji-hyeong, an official from the Seoul Metropolitan Government, confirmed that Park did not show up for work on Thursday because of unspecified reasons and canceled all his schedules, including a meeting with a presidential official at his Seoul City Hall office.A longtime civic activist and human rights lawyer, Park was elected as Seoul mayor in 2011 and became the city’s first mayor to be voted into a third term in June last year. A member of President Moon Jae-in’s liberal Democratic Party, Park has been considered a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in the 2022 elections.Park has mostly maintained his activist colors as mayor, criticizing what he described as the country’s growing social and economic inequalities and the traditionally corrupt ties between large businesses and politicians.During the earlier part of his terms, Park established himself as a fierce opponent of former conservative President Park Geun-hye and openly supported the millions of people who flooded the city streets in late 2016 and 2017, calling for her ouster over a corruption scandal.Park Geun-hye was formally removed from office in March 2017 and is currently serving a decades-long prison term on bribery and other charges.Seoul, a city with 10 million people, has been a new epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea since the Asian country eased its rigid social distancing rules in early May. Authorities are struggling to trace contacts amid surges in cases linked to nightclubs, church services, a huge e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-mayor-reported-missing-his-phone-off-search-underway/story-A6fQ0DEcuKHAiRqNQ0oDIM.html
09-07-2020||World||‘A hot mess’: Americans face testing delays as Covid-19 cases surge||With a cough and shortness of breath, it took Austin, Texas, resident Sam Lee three tries to get a Covid-19 test.The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second center when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,” said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn’t receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the US, Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the US can’t seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.“It’s a hot mess,” said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. “The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.“I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. “It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.”Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won’t control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.Other developments:— While the number of confirmed cases in the US hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins’ count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the US population.— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, “likely contributed” to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.“Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,” de Blasio said.The US Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free “surge testing” sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.“If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,” he said.In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests.

09-07-2020||World||Japan rescuers battle to reach thousands trapped by floods||Japanese emergency services and troops scrambled Thursday to reach people cut off by catastrophic flooding and landslides that have killed dozens and caused widespread damage, with more torrential rain forecast.In the scenic tourist area of Gifu in central Japan, officials said landslides and floodwater had left just nearly 1,000 households stranded -- or around 2,300 people.But in the hardest-hit region of Kumamoto, attention was turning to clean-up operations after some of the heaviest rain for years.A Kumamoto official told AFP: “The number of people stranded is zero. We can now reach all the areas which had been isolated.”An AFP reporter in the area saw part of a road collapsed into a river, and scenes of devastation in flood-affected houses.In one home, an elderly man was struggling to clear up the debris and furniture littering the mud-caked floor, his traditional straw tatami mats in one room ruined.The rain front started in the southwest early Saturday and has since cut a swathe of destruction across Japan, dumping record amounts of rain and causing swollen rivers to burst their banks.Japan’s Meteorological Agency (JMA) said “heavy rain will likely continue at least until July 12, calling for “extreme vigilance” for possible landslides and flooding in low-lying areas.The JMA issued its second-highest evacuation order to around 350,000 people. Such orders are not compulsory, however, and most residents are choosing not to go to shelters, possibly due to coronavirus fears.The death toll has climbed gradually as more victims are discovered in isolated areas.Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters that 58 people were confirmed dead.He said authorities were investigating whether four other deaths were linked to the floods, adding that 17 people were unaccounted for.After five days blocked by floodwater and landslides, troops finally managed to rescue some 40 residents from Ashikita village in Kumamoto region.Kinuyo Nakamura, 68, burst into tears of relief as she finally made it to an evacuation centre.“Gosh, it was scary. My house, it’s such a mess, I cannot live there anymore,” she said as she came across someone she knew at the shelter.“We have experienced flooding disasters in the past many times. But this one doesn’t compare,” she told public broadcaster NHK.Nakamura choked up as she explained that one of her neighbours had fallen victim to the floods.“A truly, truly, fantastic person,” she said, covering her face to hide the tears. “That was the hardest thing.” ‘Hesitating to offer help’ In many areas, landslides reduced houses to rubble and floodwater rushed into homes in low-lying areas, destroying the contents and rendering them uninhabitable.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that around 130,000 rescue workers and troops were battling to save lives.Complicating the rescue efforts, the coronavirus epidemic has claimed nearly 1,000 lives in Japan from more than 20,000 cases.The need to maintain social distancing has reduced capacity at shelters and many have preferred to take refuge in their vehicles for fear of becoming infected.One emergency worker said the coronavirus might be dissuading people from volunteering to help with the rescue.The latest natural disaster is a bitter blow for businesses in the hard-hit regions, already heavily reliant on tourism that has dried up due to the coronavirus.Japan is in the middle of its annual rainy season and often sees damaging floods and landslides during this period that lasts several weeks.However, experts say climate change is intensifying the phenomenon because a warmer atmosphere holds more water to dump in the form of rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-rescuers-battle-to-reach-thousands-trapped-by-floods/story-uOCmnYuod6ZqOi8rqTIhXL.html

Education minister of Pakistan Shafqat Mahmood at a news briefing said that administrations will have to follow strict “standard operating procedures” set by the government. According to the Ministry of National Health Services, Pakistan registered 3,359 cases and 61 deaths in the last 24 hours due to Covid-19. The total number of cases has now crossed 240,000 and the death toll stands at 4,983.In June, Pakistan was one of the worst-hit countries in South Asia. With a view to curb the spread of Covid-19 and revive the economy, the government decided to impose ‘smart lockdown’ in hotspots across the country. As per the smart lockdown, offices and businesses are allowed to operate five days a week,and medical stores can operate throughout. However, educational institutions, restaurants and movie theatres will remain closed and social, religious gatherings will not be permitted.

09-07-2020||World||Covid-19 cases rise in Australia; lockdown in worst-hit Victoria state||Amidst the rising number of coronavirus cases in Australia, authorities in Melbourne and some regional parts of the hardest-hit Victoria state on Thursday entered into its first day of the second lockdown, imposing restrictions for next six weeks. Victoria recorded another 165 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours including several hospital and aged care workers, on the first day of its second lockdown.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) remained closed temporarily along with Victoria to arrest the spread of the Covid-19. Urging residents not to become complacent, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that “about 25,000 tests are being done every day in Victoria, and particularly… in Melbourne. That is an industrial scale of testing, which is an essential part of dealing with the outbreak in Victoria”. Morrison will hold a Cabinet meeting on Friday to discuss the latest coronavirus surge in Victoria and look at the risk to other states. “I would say more broadly across the country that we must guard against complacency, that we must continue to follow those social distancing protocols all around Australia, even in states or territories where the number of cases is effectively zero,” the prime minister said. Please do not think that any of the states or territories are immune, he warned. ‘‘And if there were to be issues that presented in any of those states and territories, the best defence that we have, especially in the first instance, is that all citizens, all residents right across the country, are continuing to practice the appropriate social distancing and other measures. “We’ve seen the images in many parts of the country, where I think we are seeing some of that lapse. And it’s important, because we do not want to see the situation in Victoria repeated in any other part of the country,” he said. Morrison thanked the Melbourne residents for their patience during the ongoing health crisis. In a bid to contain the virus from spreading, the Victorian government has announced a regular temprature check for all the students who would return to school in the next term. The state government will distribute more than 14,000 thermometers to schools in greater Melbourne and Mitchell Shire and in schools that are near the lockdown zones. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that the coronavirus restrictions in the state will not be tightened “at this stage” after 13 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the last 24 hours. She said that the rate of community transmission was seen low. Only one new case was recorded in ACT after a man in his 20s contracted the virus. So far, Australia’s death toll from the Covid-19 stands at 106 with no new fatalities reported in the 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-rise-in-australia-lockdown-in-worst-hit-victoria-state/story-YOB1t20entuR2gJt6jOs4K.html
09-07-2020||World||Is that hand strap clean? Tokyo Metro sprays silver to fend off coronavirus||As global public transport operators look for ways to keep the coronavirus at bay on planes, trains and buses, one of Japan’s biggest rail firms is betting on the anti-microbial properties of silver to keep passengers safe on the world’s busiest subway.Tokyo’s labyrinthine rail network of about 900 stations and roughly 85 lines has seen passenger numbers approach pre-virus levels since the city’s de facto lockdown was lifted in late May.This raises the risk of transmission via high-contact points such as hand straps, hand rails and seats, just as the city’s number of new cases of COVID-19 infection is rising again. Tokyo Metro, the city’s main subway operator, has begun spraying its nearly 3,000 cars with a super-fine atomisation of a silver-based compound, taking advantage of silver’s anti-antimicrobial properties to repel the virus from surfaces.“Merely disinfecting the carriages only has a short-term effect, so we were looking for an anti-microbial application to reassure passengers that our trains are safe,” Masaru Sugiyama, Tokyo Metro’s section chief in charge of rolling stock, said at a demonstration on Thursday.After the end of daily operations, masked cleaners hauling motorised atomisers stride through carriages, spraying straps, poles, seats and windows with a mist of 10 micron droplets, roughly the size of a grain of pollen.Tokyo Metro said the anti-microbial compound has been shown to be effective against viruses including influenza and E-coli, though has not yet been proven to repel the novel coronavirus.Other operators are also looking at ways to help Tokyo’s passengers select less crowded trains to increase chances of social distancing on a network serving 40 million daily trips.East Japan Railway Co, the country’s biggest rail network operator, last month updated its mobile app to offer real-time updates on capacity by carriage, along with crowd levels at stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-that-hand-strap-clean-tokyo-metro-sprays-silver-to-fend-off-coronavirus/story-SYqMtzzwVOmdF7inpyma9M.html
09-07-2020||World||Australia suspends Hong Kong extradition deal in swipe at China||Australia is suspending its extradition agreement with Hong Kong and will give skilled migrants from the city five-year visas with a pathway to permanent residence, after China imposed sweeping national security legislation on the financial hub.“Our decision to suspend the extradition agreement with Hong Kong represents an acknowledgment of the fundamental change of circumstances in relation to Hong Kong because of the new security law,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a briefing in Canberra on Thursday.Morrison said Australia had formally notified Hong Kong and advised Chinese authorities. His announcement -- which swiftly earned a strong rebuke from Beijing’s embassy in Canberra -- came after Canada suspended its extradition agreement with the former British colony last week, making it the first country to break law enforcement links with the city since China enacted the legislation.Other nations with extradition links with Hong Kong include the Southeast Asian countries of Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, which have all clashed with China in recent years over its territorial claims in the South China Sea. Beyond the region, Hong Kong has extradition treaties with nations including the U.S., India, Germany and New Zealand. The latter on Thursday announced it would review all its policy settings with Hong Kong due to the security law.Though China remains Australia’s largest trading partner, Morrison’s moves have fueled tensions between the two countries. Australia said earlier Thursday that its citizens in Hong Kong were at an increased risk of detention, saying the security law could be interpreted broadly.China said Thursday that Morrison’s moves “severely violated” international law and it reserved the right to take countermeasures.“Any attempt to exert pressure on China will never succeed,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily news briefing in Beijing. “China urges the Australian side to immediately change course and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form so as to avoid further damage to China-Australia ties.”In another move that could aggravate Beijing, Morrison said his government will be actively seeking to lure Hong Kong-based businesses to relocate to Australia.“There’ll be citizens of Hong Kong who may be looking to move elsewhere, to start a new life somewhere else, to take their skills, their businesses, and things that they’ve been running under the previous set of rules and arrangements in Hong Kong and seek that opportunity elsewhere,” Morrison said. “Australia has always been a very welcoming country to such people.”Fuelling TensionsRelations between the two nations have become increasingly fraught since 2018, when Morrison’s government banned Chinese technology giant Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network on national security grounds. That year, it also said Beijing’s “meddling” was a catalyst for legislation designed to halt foreign interference in its governments, media and education sector.Since April -- when Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for independent investigators be allowed into the mainland city of Wuhan to probe Covid-19’s origins -- China has imposed crippling tariffs on Australia’s barley industry, halted beef imports from four meat plants and urged its tourists and students to avoid going to Australia citing a risk of racist attacks.“We advise the Australian side to look at the national security legislation in Hong Kong in a correct and objective light, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs with Hong Kong as a pretext, and refrain from going further down the wrong path,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said July 2 in response to a question on the possibility of Australia offering Hong Kong citizens a safe haven.Beijing has also been irked by Payne’s statements against Hong Kong’s new national security law, which she’s labeled “deeply” concerning, following criticism from other foreign governments including the U.S. and UKThe British Passport Stoking Controversy in Hong Kong: QuickTakeUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week refused to back down after China warned of “consequences” if it pressed ahead with an offer of home for millions of Hong Kong residents. Johnson called the new law a “clear and serious breach” of the 1984 handover treaty between London and Beijing, which preceded the British colony being returned to China’s hands in 1997.China hit back, questioning the UK’s right under the “joint declaration” treaty to make the offer to people in Hong Kong. “China strongly condemns that and reserves the right to make further reactions,” Zhao said. “All the consequences shall be borne by the UK side.”The law “undermines the ‘one country, two systems’ framework and Hong Kong’s own Basic Law, and the high degree of autonomy guaranteed in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,” Morrison said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-suspends-hong-kong-extradition-deal-in-swipe-at-china/story-4VZzW3PMQ7FxxGAfu91sNN.html
09-07-2020||World||Srebrenica killings: 25 years on victims solve world’s ‘biggest forensic puzzle’||A quarter of a century after they were killed in Europe’s worst massacre since World War II, eight Bosnian men and boys will be laid to rest Saturday in a cemetery just outside of Srebrenica — their marble gravestones joining thousands more, each with the same month and year of death.Over 8,000 Bosnian Muslims perished in 10 days of slaughter after the town was overrun by Bosnian Serb forces in the closing months of the country’s 1992-95 fratricidal war. Their executioners tried to ensure they would never get the sort of memorial Srebrenica holds every year. Their bodies were plowed into hastily made mass graves and then later dug up with bulldozers and scattered among other burial sites to hide the evidence of the crime.But, since 1996, Bosnian and international scientists have slowly unlocked what was once described as the “biggest forensic puzzle anywhere in the world,” unearthing the bones from those gruesome death pits and connecting them with the names of the people they belonged to.When the remains are identified, they are returned to their relatives and reburied in the Potocari memorial cemetery. And each year on July 11, the anniversary of the day the killing began in 1995, relatives gather for a funeral of the recently identified. Most of the dead were men and boys, so most of the mourners are women — mothers and sisters, daughters and wives.Massacre survivor Fazila Efendic will attend the collective funeral this year to witness her sisters in grief bury a handful of bones, as she once did.Having a grave to visit will bring them some relief, Efendic says. Her husband, Hamed, and her only son, Fejzo, were killed in the massacre.For years, every time a new mass grave was found, she rushed to the site hoping to see something she would recognize as having belonged to her loved ones.“There are no words to describe the sorrow you feel when you are looking for (your loved ones) bone by bone,” Efendic said. “I visited every newfound mass grave; I’ve seen the inside of every one of them.”All of Hamed’s remains were found in two mass graves, one unearthed in 1998 and the other in 2000. Fejzo — or rather two of his leg bones — was found in another one several years later. Efendic buried her husband at Potocari after his remains were found but waited years before finally deciding to do the same with Fejzo’s partial remains.“I wanted him to be next to his father and to be able to come and pray over their graves,” she said.Typically, thousands of visitors from various countries attend the July 11 service, but this year — because of the coronavirus pandemic — only a relatively small number of survivors will be allowed at the cemetery.Instead, many speakers will attend “virtually,” explained Emir Suljagic, the director of the Srebrenica Memorial Center at Potocari.That the massacre survivors are able to visit their dead at all is a testament to the forensic scientists at the International Commission on Missing Persons.Set up in 1996 at the urging of then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, the commission designed a DNA-based system to find and identify the remains of some 40,000 people — the vast majority of them from Bosnia — who had been reported as missing as a result of the 1990s conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.In 2014, the commission became a permanent global body, expanded its mission to other conflicts and natural disasters, and moved its headquarters to The Hague. But not before helping to identify more than 70% of all the missing victims of the 1990s Balkan wars, including close to 7,000 of those killed in Srebrenica.Damir Marjanovic, an early member of the then Bosnia-based commission, said the team’s work has greatly increased scientists’ ability to pull DNA profiles from skeletal remains.“For us, finding and identifying the missing was a mission,” said Marjanovic, who today is a professor of genetics and anthropology at the International Burch University in Sarajevo.The Srebrenica massacre is the only episode of the Bosnian war to be defined as a genocide, including by two U.N. courts, in part thanks to the commission’s findings, including DNA records, that have been admitted as evidence at trials.While many Bosnian Serbs continue to deny the extent of the crime, the still-expanding sea of white marble at Potocari makes the truth plain.“This is Srebrenica,” said Efendic, looking out at the gravestones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/srebrenica-killings-25-years-on-victims-solve-world-s-biggest-forensic-puzzle/story-gRPCV7etcUIODCctAbeUOP.html
09-07-2020||World||‘Unprecedented shock’: Covid-19 pandemic could cause Canada’s federal deficit to increase tenfold||Canada’s projected deficit for the year has multiplied 10 times and net debt could reach $ 1.2 trillion due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. These figures were among those detailed by Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau while presenting a fiscal update in the wake of what he described as, “an unprecedented shock to our system.”Before the coronavirus crisis hit and forced the closure of much of the economy, Canada was expected to record $ 34.4 billion for 2020-21 and this number has now been revised to a whopping $343.2 billion. As the deficit balloons, so does the net federal debt, crossing a trillion dollars for the first time in the country’s history.Even the country’s GDP is hitting historic highs, projected to decline by 6.8 per cent this year, placing the country in a situation not witnessed since the Great Depression.Also read: Canada’s Trudeau has exposed China’s attempt at hostage diplomacyThe document described these circumstances as “truly the challenge of our lifetime” but sounded a cautiously optimistic note, looking ahead to a return to 5.5 per cent growth next year.There are other systemic challenges: debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly at 50 per cent, a near 20 per cent spike from what was projected earlier.The update also said, “the projected contraction in federal budgetary revenues is unprecedented since the Great Depression with an expected decline in 2020-21 more than twice as big as in 2009-10 following the global financial crisis.”The burgeoning deficit can be attributed to emergency support measures announced by the government amounting to $212 billion with a loss of $81.3 billion to the treasury due to the slowdown caused by coronavirus-induced restrictive measures across the nation. Morneau said, “Some will criticize us on the cost of action. But our government knew that the cost of inaction would’ve been far greater.”The government was under pressure to present a full budget for the year but Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau had argued that was not possible given that the impact of Covid-19 could not be predicted. Instead, he settled on the compromise offering of this fiscal snapshot which was presented by Morneau in the House of Commons.And clarity regarding the future could be a while away, as the update stated, “Due to the unprecedented degree of uncertainty clouding the economic outlook, providing a fiscal forecast beyond the current fiscal year with an appropriate degree of confidence is not possible at this time, and would potentially be misleading.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprecedented-shock-covid-19-pandemic-could-cause-canada-s-federal-deficit-to-increase-tenfold/story-7szma75MV9ni9Sz0AkYbuN.html
09-07-2020||World||Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro now the ‘poster boy’ for dubious Covid treatment||After months of touting an unproven anti-malaria drug as a treatment for the new coronavirus, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is turning himself into a test case live before millions of people as he swallows hydroxychloroquine pills on social media and encourages others to do the same.Bolsonaro said this week that he tested positive for the virus but already felt better thanks to hydroxychloroquine. Hours later he shared a video of himself gulping down what he said was his third dose.“I trust hydroxychloroquine,” he said, smiling. “And you?”On Wednesday, he was again extolling the drug’s benefits on Facebook, and claimed that his political opponents were rooting against it.A string of studies in Britain and the United States, as well as by the World Health Organization, have found chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ineffective against Covid-19 and sometimes deadly because of their adverse side effects on the heart. Several studies were cancelled early because of adverse effects.US President Donald Trump has promoted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 but chloroquine — a more toxic version of the drug, produced in Brazil — has been even more enthusiastically promoted by Bolsonaro, who contends the virus is largely unavoidable and, what is more, not a serious medical problem.“He has become the poster boy for curing COVID with hydroxychloroquine,” said Paulo Calmon, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia. “Chloroquine composes part of the denialist’s political strategy, with the objective of convincing voters that the pandemic’s effects can be easily controlled.”Also read: Sick with Covid, Brazil’s Bolsonaro defends his coronavirus approachTrump first mentioned hydroxychloroquine on March 19 during a pandemic briefing. Two days later, and a month after Brazil’s first confirmed case, Bolsonaro took one of his only big actions to fight the coronavirus. He announced he was directing the Brazilian army to ramp up output of chloroquine.The army churned out more than 2 million pills — 18 times the country’s normal annual production — even as Brazil’s intensive care medicine association recommended it not be prescribed and doctors mostly complied.The White House on May 31 said it had donated 2 million hydroxychloroquine pills to Brazil. Two weeks later the US Food & Drug Administration revoked authorization for its emergency use, citing adverse side effects and saying it is unlikely to be effective.Brazil’s audit court on June 18 requested an investigation into alleged overbilling from local production of chloroquine, which it called unreasonable given the drug’s ineffectiveness and cited the FDA decision. Meantime, stocks of sedatives and other medications used in intensive care ran out in three states, according to a late-June report from Brazil’s council of state health secretariats.A former defence minister, Aldo Rebelo, told The Associated Press that he is concerned the army will be wrongly blamed for its involvement in production of a drug that most experts call ineffective against the coronavirus.“All they did was to follow a legal order and produce the pills,” said Rebelo. “The problem is the health ministry and the decision that the president made.”Brazil’s interim health minister, an army general with no health experience before April, endorsed chloroquine as a Covid-19 treatment days after assuming the post in May. His predecessor, a doctor and health consultant, quit rather than do so.As Brazil’s death toll continued to climb — nearing 68,000 on Wednesday, the second-most in the world — the health ministry distributed millions of chloroquine pills across Brazil’s vast territory. They have reached small cities with little or no health infrastructure to handle the pandemic and even a far-flung Indigenous territory.“They’re trying to use the Indigenous people as guinea pigs to test chloroquine, use the Indigenous to advertise for chloroquine like Bolsonaro has done on his live broadcasts, like a poster boy for chloroquine,” Kretã Kaingang, an executive coordinator of the Indigenous organization APIB, said by phone from Brazil’s capital, Brasilia.In Brazil’s largest city, Sao Paulo, three doctors treating Covid-19 in different hospitals told AP that patients routinely requested chloroquine as the pandemic spread, often citing Bolsonaro. In recent weeks, inquiries about the drug were less frequent after scientific doubts arose about its effectiveness, two physicians said.All say they worry Bolsonaro’s cheerleading will spur a new wave of desperate patients and relatives clamoring for chloroquine.“I tell them that I don’t prescribe it because there’s no study proving it improves patients, that there are important risks with the indiscriminate use of this drug,” said Dr. Natalia Magacho, an attending physician at the Hospital das Clinicas. “Some even get angry at first. But all prescriptions are the doctor’s responsibility and, as the risk outweighs the benefit, I don’t prescribe it.”Most doctors oppose any protocols for the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, but some physicians continue to believe and have pressured local authorities to permit its use, said João Gabbardo, the former No. 2 official at Brazil’s health ministry.“This issue has been framed in a very polarizing, politicized manner,” said Gabbardo, who is now executive coordinator of Sao Paulo’s Covid-19 contingency center. “We are moving away from the discussion of science, of scientific evidence, toward a discussion of political positions.”Bolsonaro’s supporters and aides have amplified his message. Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president’s son and a federal lawmaker, said his father will beat the disease because he is taking the anti-malarial drug.“Treatment with chloroquine is rather effective at the start of the illness (and should be available for any Brazilian who needs it),” the younger Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter, without distinguishing between the two types of the drug.Margareth Dalcolmo, a clinical researcher and prominent respiratory medicine professor at the state-funded Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said she has no objection to Bolsonaro and his doctor agreeing on hydroxychloroquine treatment. The problem, she said, is broadcasting that information to an impressionable public that, if he recovers, will believe a potentially dangerous drug was responsible.Dalcolmo treats patients and contracted Covid-19 herself. Before she bounced back, some friends asked if she would authorize administration of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were she unable to grant consent.“Over my dead body, dear,” she said. “I said if I’m in a coma, intubated, none of you are authorized to put me on chloroquine. I would never authorize its use on me. And I haven’t used it on my dozens of patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-now-the-poster-boy-for-dubious-covid-treatment/story-YT4nWPcvmuwFXsuhjiD8HM.html
09-07-2020||World||Covid: China defends WHO, lashes out at United States’ withdrawal decision||China defended the World Health Organization and lashed out at the US decision to withdraw from the UN body, adding to a litany of disputes between the world’s largest economies and increasing geopolitical rivals.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the move was “another demonstration of the US pursuing unilateralism, withdrawing from groups and breaking contracts.”WHO is “the most authoritative and professional international institution in the field of global public health security,” Zhao said at a briefing Wednesday, adding that the US departure would particularly hurt developing countries in need of international support.WHO plans to send a team to China to investigate the source of the virus, which was first detected in the central city of Wuhan last year. China has said it remains unclear where the virus originated and has rejected an independent probe, but reiterated this week that it is working closely with WHO and will “continue to support scientists from all countries to carry out global scientific research on the source and spread of viruses.”President Donald Trump has harshly criticized WHO over its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of bowing to Chinese influence. Trump said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 130,000 Americans.In comments Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Beijing’s response to the virus outbreak showed the ruling Communist Party has an “enormous credibility problem” and that its actions fitted a pattern of behavior that threatens freedom, democracy and the rule of law.“I am convinced more than ever that the free peoples of the world will come to understand the threat that’s presented not only internally inside of China, but importantly, that the impact that General Secretary Xi has on the world is not good for free peoples and democracy-loving peoples,” Pompeo told reporters.The Trump administration formally notified the UN on Monday of its withdrawal from WHO, although the pullout won’t take effect until July 6, 2021. That means it could be reversed by a new administration or if circumstances change.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said he would reverse the decision on his first day in office if elected.Health officials and critics of Trump’s administration say the withdrawal would cost the US influence in the global arena while undermining an important institution that is leading vaccine development efforts and drug trials to address the coronavirus.The US is WHO’s largest donor and provides it with more than $450 million per year, but owes about $200 million in current and past dues. Those financial obligations must be met before a US withdrawal can be finalized.Apart from the WHO, China and the US have tangled over human rights, China’s crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and its assertions of sovereignty over strategic waters and islands in the South China Sea. The two are also engaged in a protracted trade dispute amid allegations China is forcing companies to hand over technology or stealing the knowledge outright.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-china-defends-who-lashes-out-at-united-states-withdrawal-decision/story-qAW7pJxo9BxuPjhW5M0MwK.html

This strike for Black lives is a way to take our members’ understanding about that into the streets,” Henry told the AP.Among the strikers’ specific demands are that corporations and government declare unequivocally that “Black lives matter.” Elected officials at every level must use executive and legislative power to pass laws that guarantee people of all races can thrive, according to a list of demands. Employers must also raise wages and allow workers to unionize to negotiate better health care, sick leave and child care support.The service workers union has partnered with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the American Federation of Teachers, United Farm Workers and the Fight for $15 and a Union, which was launched in 2012 by American fast food workers to push for a higher minimum wage.Social and racial justice groups taking part include March On, the Center for Popular Democracy, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of over 150 organizations that make up the Black Lives Matter movement.Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, a strike organizer with the Movement for Black Lives, said corporate giants that have come out in support of the BLM movement amid nationwide protests over police brutality have also profited from racial injustice and inequity.“They claim to support Black lives, but their business model functions by exploiting Black labor — passing off pennies as ‘living wages’ and pretending to be shocked when Covid-19 sickens those Black people who make up their essential workers,” said Henderson, co-executive director of Tennessee-based Highlander Research and Education Center.“Corporate power is a threat to racial justice, and the only way to usher in a new economy is by tackling those forces that aren’t fully committed to dismantling racism,” she said in a statement Trece Andrews, a Black nursing home worker for a Ciena Healthcare-managed retirement home in the Detroit area, said she feels dejected after years of being passed over for promotions.The 49-year-old believes racial discrimination plays a part in her career stagnation.“I’ve got 20 years in the game and I’m only at $15.81 (per hour),” she said in a phone interview.As the single mother of a 13-year-old daughter and caregiver to her father, a cancer survivor, Andrews said inadequate personal protective gear makes her afraid of bringing the coronavirus home from her job.“We’ve got the coronavirus going on, plus we’ve got this thing with racism going on,” Andrews said.“They’re tied together, like some type of segregation, like we didn’t have our ancestors and Martin Luther King fighting against these types of things. It’s still alive out here, and it’s time for somebody to be held accountable. It’s time to take action.” The strike continues a decades-old labor rights movement tradition. Most notably, organizers have drawn inspiration from the Memphis sanitation workers’ strike over low wages, benefits disparity between Black and white employees, and inhumane working conditions that contributed to the deaths of two Black workers in 1968.At the end of that two-month strike, some 1,300 mostly Black sanitation workers bargained collectively for better wages.“Strike for Black Lives” organizers say they want to disrupt a multi-generational cycle of poverty perpetuated by anti-union and other policies that make it difficult to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions.Systemic poverty affects 140 million people in the U.S, with 62 million people working for less than a living wage, according to the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, a strike partnering organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strike-for-black-lives-to-highlight-racism/story-20j21rHOTOiXBjV0dJQKhM.html

Alexander Vindman, a national security aide who played a central role in President Donald Trump’s impeachment case, announced his retirement from the Army on Wednesday in a scathing statement that accused the president of running a “campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation.” The statement from attorney David Pressman said Vindman, 45, was leaving the Army after more than 21 years after it had been made clear “that his future within the institution he has dutifully served will forever be limited.” “Through a campaign of bullying, intimidation, and retaliation, the President of the United States attempted to force LTC Vindman to choose: Between adhering to the law or pleasing a President. Between honoring his oath or protecting his career. Between protecting his promotion or the promotion of his fellow soldiers,” read the statement, first obtained by CNN. Vindman’s name was on a promotion list sent to Defense Secretary Mark Esper earlier this year, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. But that list was delayed for weeks because the White House asked for an investigation of Vindman, one of the officials said. The Pentagon did a review and found that any suggestion of misconduct was unfounded. One official said the list was resent to Esper about a month ago, but again was delayed. A senior defense official said the list was held up by a routine personnel review, not related to Vindman. Esper received the final promotion list Monday and approved it, with Vindman’s name included, and it was expected to be sent to the White House in the next day or two, the defense official said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal personnel matter. It’s not clear whether Esper already knew of Vindman’s plan to retire before he signed the list, or whether the White House would have approved the promotion list. The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pressman said Vindman “did what the law compelled him to do; and for that he was bullied by the President and his proxies.” “LTC Vindman’s patriotism,” he said, “has cost him his career. Today our country loses a devoted soldier, but it is incumbent upon all of us to ensure it does not lose the values he represents.” Trump in February ousted Vindman from his job on the National Security Council, where he served as an expert on Ukraine, just two days after the president’s acquittal by the Senate. Vindman’s lawyer said then that his client had been told to leave in retaliation for “telling the truth.” Vindman’s twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also asked to leave his job as a White House lawyer. Both men were reassigned to the Army. Vindman had testified that he didn’t think it was “proper” for Trump to “demand that a foreign government investigate” former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s work for the energy company Burisma in Ukraine. And he told impeachment investigators that he twice raised concerns over the administration’s push to have Ukraine investigate the Bidens. In the aftermath, senior Pentagon leaders insisted that Vindman would not see any retaliation as a result of the testimony. Talking to reporters in November, Esper said the department has protections for whistleblowers. Vindman ”shouldn’t have any fear of retaliation. That’s DOD’s position,” Esper said, adding that he flatly rejected suggestions that the soldier’s career was over. He said he had spoken with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy about the matter. McCarthy said in February that Vindman was not under investigation, and that he was serving in an Army headquarters job and would go on to senior service college in the summer. In gripping testimony, Vindman also spoke of his family’s story and his father bringing them to the USfrom the Soviet Union when he was a young child. “Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to United States of America in search of a better life for our family,” he testified. “Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Wednesday, “History will remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman as an American patriot.” She said his firing from the White House “was a clear and brazen act of retaliation that showcases the President’s fear of the truth, which continues to this day.” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the Intelligence Committee chairman who led the impeachment probe, penned a letter to Vindman saying, “I hope that you are able to reflect on these events, unprecedented as they are, and find solace in knowing that you did the right thing.” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill, blamed Esper for his “failure to protect a decorated combat veteran against a vindictive Commander in Chief.” Duckworth, a a former Army helicopter pilot who lost both legs during a 2004 attack in Iraq, said last week that she was blocking Senate confirmation of 1,123 senior military promotions until Esper confirmed whether or not he was approving Vindman’s promotion. “Secretary Esper’s failure to protect his troops sets a new, dark precedent that any Commander in Chief can interfere with routine merit-based military promotions to carry out personal vendettas and retaliation against military officers who follow duly-authorized subpoenas while upholding their oath of office and core principles of service,” Duckworth said in a statement Wednesday. Vindman, who served in Iraq and later was assigned to the National Security Council as the director for European affairs, appeared at the congressional hearing wearing his uniform full of medals, including the Purple Heart he earned for wounds suffered in a roadside bomb attack. When a soldier requests retirement, it must be approved by the Army’s Human Resources Command, and normally it can take months to process before the person actually leaves the military. It was also not clear Wednesday if Vindman’s brother was on the promotion list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vindman-retiring-from-army-lawyer-blames-trump-of-bullying-intimidation/story-UlE4OJD7ypNlTU4BepxhRN.html
09-07-2020||World||Jair Bolsonaro plans to appease investors with ban on Amazon fires||Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro plans to put a four-month ban on fires in the Amazon and Pantanal regions in response to criticism from international investors and Brazilian companies about a surge in deforestation.The decree is being drafted by the Environment Ministry, with a start date yet to be decided. Last year, the government banned burning for 60 days before adding another 60 days. This year, it’s going straight to 120 days to prevent another jump in uncontrolled fires in the dry season.The moratorium is one of the measures the administration will use to try to convince international investors that it’s taking a stand against deforestation. The stricter rules for the Amazon and Pantanal regions won’t apply in the Cerrado biome, a tropical savanna increasingly used for farming.A video conference with businessmen and senior executives is scheduled for Thursday. In attendance will be Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who chairs the Council of the Amazon, Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto as well as ministers for the environment, agriculture and foreign affairs, said two people with knowledge of the event.The far-right government has faced mounting pressure from investors and entrepreneurs to do more to protect the environment amid surging deforestation in the Amazon.On Tuesday, a group of companies including pulp maker Suzano SA, meatpacker Marfrig Global Foods SA and agribusiness giant Cargill Inc. sent a letter to authorities stating that the negative perceptions are potentially damaging to both reputation and business prospects.Amazon deforestation has surged in the past two years under the government of Bolsonaro, who defends opening up the world’s largest rainforest to agriculture and mining.In early June, Amazon Environmental Research Institute, known as Ipam, warned that an area 11 times the size of New York City could be incinerated in the dry season. In June, the first month of the dry season, fires in this biome rose to a 13-year high, National Institute for Space Research data show. In Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland area, the number of fires this year through June is more than the double all of those recorded last year.According to Ipam, smoke from fires may also inhibit Brazil’s efforts to contain Covid-19 infections.In a closed-door meeting in May, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles urged Bolsonaro to take advantage of global leaders’ Covid-19 blinders to simplify regulations, according to a video of the gathering released by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jair-bolsonaro-plans-to-appease-investors-with-ban-on-amazon-fires/story-mAPnh5vF5GH4mOevQWPPsM.html
09-07-2020||World||Canada’s Trudeau has exposed China’s attempt at hostage diplomacy||The bitter recriminations have further plunged the ongoing acrimonious relations between Canada and China to new low. Limiting ties with China, Canada suspended the extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The Canadian decision was prompted by the new security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in violation of its international treaty.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday said “effective immediately, Canada will not permit the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong”. Canada would also assume that all sensitive goods exported to Hong Kong are meant for mainland China, he added further. The Canadian foreign minister termed the new law “a significant step back” for liberty.The development infuriated China that rebuked Canada for its criticism of the Hong Kong security law while Hong Kong officials expressed disappointment over Canada’s suspension of the extradition treaty.Ties between Ottawa and Beijing have been strenuous since 2018 when Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, under the US warrant. After Meng was detained, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovri, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, on charges of espionage.It has been more than 18 months since the Chinese government arbitrarily apprehended two Canadian citizens. It hasn’t even allowed them consular access. Their arrests were widely interpreted as a retaliation for Canada detaining the top Huawei executive and the daughter of the company’s founder on an extradition request from the United States. The US wants to try Meng for fraud relating to her alleged violating sanctions imposed on Iran.The Chinese reprisal has caused much anguish and frustration in Canada. Interestingly, the two Canadians were chosen randomly to be pawns in a wider game that China has been playing to reshape the world order to one where its desires and sensitivities determine decision-making in other countries. China wants the rest of the world to know that bad things would happen to any country that doesn’t toe its line - would invite arm-twisting in the form of arbitrarily jailing foreigners, straining of trading ties and sending fewer Chinese students. China is employing the same tactics against Australia because it had demanded an investigation of Chinese mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak.Pressure was also brought upon the Canadian government to settle the issue with China. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stayed firm, rejecting suggestions that his government should arrange for the release of the Huawei executive in the hope of securing the release of two Canadians currently jailed in China.“If the Chinese government concludes that detaining (citizens) is an effective way to gain leverage over Canadians and the Canadian government, to randomly arrest Canadians, then no Canadian will be safe,” Trudeau said. Any regime anywhere would be likely to start arresting “random Canadians” to press diplomatic goals, he said. “To demonstrate to China that they can just arrest Canadians and they can get what they want out of Canada - even for us going against the independence of our judicial system - would be absolutely unacceptable,” Trudeau added.PM Trudeau’s forceful rejection of the prisoner swap plan exposes the Chinese Communist Party’s style of “hostage diplomacy”. For China, the Huawei executive is a highly-valued individual due to her position as a senior executive in a company with strong links to the party, securing her release is not anaim in itself. It merely forms part of Beijing’s broader international objectives. The Trudeau government feels that submitting itself to the release of Meng would instead likely increase China’s antagonism towards Canada. It would also make Canadians in China less safe, and conditions less stable for Canadian businesses that export to China. With one norm successfully broken, Beijing would actively target Canada for the next.Prime Minister Trudeau correctly insisted that it would not legitimise China’s hostage-taking and place more Canadians at risk. The Canadian government recognises the importance of preventing China’s belligerent behaviour from becoming normalised. By doing so, Canada has completely exposed the Chinese government’s game plan that hostage-taking is an acceptable diplomatic tool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-trudeau-has-exposed-china-s-attempt-at-hostage-diplomacy/story-4ePAzASrk2xZrYP6MhoUNL.html
09-07-2020||World||United Nations rejects Russia’s bid to limit humanitarian aid to Syria||The UN Security Council on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected a Russian resolution that would have cut back the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria’s mainly rebel-held northwest to just one crossing point from Turkey. Western countries that voted against the resolution have insisted on keeping the two current crossings from Turkey, with strong backing from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and humanitarian groups. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has called the two crossings from Turkey “a lifeline for millions of civilians whom the UN cannot reach by other means.” The Russian resolution needed a minimum of nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council for approval, but Moscow got support from only three other countries — China, Vietnam and South Africa. Its failure to get the nine votes meant the US, UK and France didn’t need to consider using their veto. Those three permanent council members voted against the resolution along with Germany, Belgium, Estonia and the Dominican Republic. Four countries abstained — Tunisia, Niger, Indonesia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Russia, Syria’s closest ally, circulated the draft resolution after it joined China on Tuesday in vetoing a draft resolution co-sponsored by Germany and Belgium to maintain aid deliveries through two border crossing points from Turkey for a year. It received 13 “yes” votes. The current Security Council mandate for UN cross-border aid deliveries expires Friday, and Germany and Belgium are expected to circulate a new proposal, likely to authorize the two current crossings from Turkey for six months. In a joint statement after the vote, Germany and Belgium said that “millions of people are counting on the Security Council to allow for as much humanitarian access as possible ... (and) we will keep on working to this end.” Whether the differences between the five veto-wielding council members can be resolved in the next 48 hours remained to be seen. Russia has argued that aid should be delivered from within Syria across conflict lines. But the UN and humanitarian groups say aid for 2.8 million needy people in the northwest can’t get in that way. US Ambassador Kelly Craft accused Russia and China of “breathtaking callousness and dishonesty” and distorting the realities on the ground. Their actions in both resolutions underscore “a harrowing truth — that Russia and China have decided that millions of Syrian lives are an insignificant cost of their partnership with the murderous Assad regime,” she said in a statement. Moutaz Adham, the Syria director for the humanitarian group Oxfam, called the council’s failure to reach agreement “a devastating blow to the millions of Syrian families who rely on this aid for clean water, food, health care and shelter.” “Cross-border aid is needed now more than ever, as Syrians face the threat of Covid-19,” he said. “All available avenues for delivering aid will be critical in helping the more than 11 million people in need of assistance across Syria.” In January, Russia scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to just two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months, as Russia insisted. The defeated German-Belgian resolution had dropped a call for the re-opening of an Iraqi crossing to the northeast to deliver medical supplies for the Covid-19 pandemic. In May, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: “Do not waste your time on efforts to reopen the closed cross-border points.” The German-Belgian resolution would have extended the mandate for the two border crossings from Turkey to the northwest — Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa — for a year. The Russian-drafted resolution would only authorize cross-border deliveries through the Bab al-Hawa crossing for six months. Germany’s UN ambassador, Christoph Heusgen, said that while the Bab Al-Hawa crossing is used to deliver aid to Idlib province, the Bab al-Salam crossing reaches the region north of Aleppo, where an additional 300,000 Syrians displaced by the last offensive are now sheltering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-nations-rejects-russia-s-bid-to-limit-humanitarian-aid-to-syria/story-SG1Mw5IlcXm3VyNDgi0ZmO.html

Their job is to stay in Uyghur homes, share the same bed with them if necessary and to control all aspects of their daily lives,” the report said.“With the ‘Double Relative Program’ initiated by the Beijing government, Han Chinese cadres make visits at least once every two months and stay for about a week. During the stay, while constantly spreading Chinese Communist Party propaganda, they also spy on them. During these visits, they encourage drinking of alcohol and eat pork, all of which are forbidden in Islam. If a Uyghur requests ‘halal meat’ from the market and if they do not drink, they are declared a suspect and sent to the camps,” it further added.In order to disrupt the Uyghur family structure, the Beijing administration offers the Han Chinese money, jobs and free homes for these arranged marriages, Campaign for Uyghurs claimed.The report said that young girls and women are the worst sufferers among the Uyghurs. Campaign for Uyghurs Executive Director Rushan Abbas pointed out that this situation has led to government-sponsored mass rape.The report goes on the say that the Beijing administration has breached the “Prevention of Genocide” contract which was signed and approved by them before the international community.“As such, the President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Secretary, Chen Quanguo, and other executives are all responsible and accountable for these crimes,” the report said.It has recommended stripping China of its participatory status on the UN Human Rights Council Panel and has urged the UN to demand immediate, unfiltered access to the entire region of East Turkistan in order to perform independent, unescorted investigations of the concentration camps and factories suspected of using Uyghur forced labour.The implementation of Han Chinese immigration into East Turkistan and intrusion into Uyghur home should cease, the report said demanding that the United Nations should formally recognise the present events as genocide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/investigate-acts-of-genocide-in-china-uyghurs-urge-un-in-new-report/story-0EbuaRlOu4f9LEhNDPT4VL.html
09-07-2020||World||New US CDC school reopening guidelines promised after Trump complains||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to issue new guidelines for reopening schools, Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump criticized the agency’s recommendations as too expensive and impractical.Trump, a Republican who is seeking re-election in November, accused Democrats of wanting to keep schools shut for political reasons and threatened to cut off federal funding to schools that do not reopen, despite a surge in coronavirus cases.“I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!” Trump said on Twitter.Flanked by top administration health and education officials, Pence said the CDC next week will issue a “new set of tools ... to give more clarity on the guidance going forward.“The president said today we just don’t want the guidance to be too tough,” Pence said at a White House coronavirus task force briefing at the Department of Education.CDC Director Robert Redfield stressed that agency guidelines were not requirements. “It would be personally very disappointing to me, and I know my agency, if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools,” Redfield said.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters the White House did not pressure the CDC to revise its recommendations.The CDC has made a number of recommendations for schools, including testing for Covid-19, dividing students into small groups, serving packaged lunches in classrooms instead of cafeterias, and minimizing sharing of school supplies.It has advised that seats be spaced at least six feet apart and that sneeze guards and partitions be put in place when social distancing is not possible. Administration officials said local leaders would tailor their decisions on how schools reopen.“Ultimately it’s not a matter of if schools should reopen, it’s simply a matter of how. They must fully open,” Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said. States are responsible for primary and secondary education under the US Constitution, but some have been holding off on deciding when and how to open schools, concerned about the resurgence of coronavirus across the country.The US outbreak has crossed the 3 million mark in confirmed cases, with a death toll of 131,336, according to a Reuters tally. “The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if US schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!” Trump said on Twitter.Acknowledging that the lion’s share of school funding comes from states, Pence said that the administration would work with Congress to look for ways “to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back to school.” “It’s time for us to get our kids back to school,” he said.The federal government provides some supplementary funding for schools, including through congressional appropriations. With Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, any effort to curtail funding is sure to face roadblocks.McEnany said Trump is “looking at potential redirecting (of funding) to make sure it goes to the student and it is most likely tied to the student and not to a district where schools are closed.”Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said school reopenings were necessary for the US economic recovery. Business and conservative groups have said parents need to get back to work.On Tuesday, Trump said he would pressure state governors to open schools in the fall.However, the surge in US cases has raised concerns about the increased risk of children spreading the virus to vulnerable adults at home as well as to older teachers and school staff.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the federal government has no authority on schools and his state will announce its reopening plans in the first week of August.In neighbouring New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said he planned to reopen state schools in the fall, but reserved the right to “tweak that if it means saving lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-cdc-school-reopening-guidelines-promised-after-trump-complains/story-CQmetkWcJ2LYhySlpVKFlI.html
09-07-2020||World||Facebook takes down false accounts linked to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro||Social media giant Facebook said Wednesday that it has removed dozens of accounts, some used by employees of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and two of his lawmaker sons. The company said its decision was based on the creation of false profiles that engaged in “coordinated inauthentic behavior.”“We could see that there were employees of these offices engaged,” Nathaniel Gleicher, the company’s head of cybersecurity policy, said in a call with journalists. “We cannot see evidence and we do not see evidence of the politicians … or whether there is systemic coordination and direction from the leadership of those offices or not.”Gleicher added that some of the content posted by the accounts had already been taken down for community standards violations, including hate speech.There was no comment from Brazil’s presidential office about Facebook’s action.Facebook’s decision comes as Brazil’s president careens from crisis to crisis, with different investigations drawing close to him, his family and allies. Bolsonaro has faced growing political isolation since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, which has also affected his popularity.He frequently denounces the media for undermining his administration, and often opts to speak directly to his supporters -- whether on Facebook or in person, as they livestream his comments to their followers.Brazil’s Supreme Court is investigating a network of Bolsonaro supporters who have targeted justices, politicians and the media. Some of them were jailed in June and early July as the investigations moved forward. The country’s top electoral court is also looking into the accusation that the president’s 2018 campaign has illegally financed the spread of false news online.Gleicher said in a statement that 73 Facebook and Instagram accounts, 14 pages and one group were removed. About 883,000 accounts followed one or more of the Bolsonaro-linked pages and an additional 917,000 followed one of more of the Instagram accounts that were removed.“This network consisted of several clusters of connected activity that relied on a combination of duplicate and fake accounts — some of which had been detected and disabled by our automated systems — to evade enforcement, create fictitious personas posing as reporters, post content, and manage pages masquerading as news outlets,” Gleicher said in the statement.He said the accounts were linked to the Social Liberal Party, which Bolsonaro left last year after winning the 2018 presidential election, and to employees of the president, two of his sons, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro and congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, and two other lawmakers.Atlantic Council, a research firm used by Facebook, said a third son of the president, Rio de Janeiro city council member Carlos Bolsonaro, is also connected to one of the members of the network.It said the only operator of the accounts that is directly employed by the presidency is Tercio Arnaud Tomaz, a former staffer of Carlos Bolsonaro in Rio’s city council and a member of the president’s digital team in the 2018 presidential campaign. Tomaz did not reply to a request for comment.Bolsonaro’s allies have previously been accused by adversaries of running information operations, but this is the first time their staffers have been connected to inauthentic accounts, Atlantic Council said.“This network steered a significant and longstanding operation, stretching back to at least the 2018 presidential campaign and having amassed an audience of millions, that fused political spin and disinformation with targeted online harassment,” the research firm said.The Social Liberal Party’s spokesperson Luiz Passos denied any responsibility over the removed accounts. He also said the accounts belong to employees of lawmakers who are at odds with the party and are close to switching to another that is led by staunch supporters of the president.Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro said in a statement that “it is impossible to evaluate what kind of profile was banned and if the platform crossed or not the limits of censorship.” Lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro did not comment.Facebook suspended three other networks on Wednesday, including one it attributed Roger Stone, a longtime ally of US President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-down-false-accounts-linked-to-brazilian-president-jair-bolsonaro/story-oudZlfotqzRODSoGmjK44I.html
09-07-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 crisis, Donald Trump tells schools to ‘reopen or you may lose federal funds’||Determined to reopen America’s schools despite coronavirus worries, President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to hold back federal money if school districts don’t bring their students back in the fall. He complained that his own public health officials’ safety guidelines are impractical and too expensive.Shortly afterward, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be issuing new guidance next week “that will give all new tools to our schools.” The recommendations will keep students safe, he said, but “the president said today we just don’t want the guidance to be too tough. ”Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Despite Trump’s increased pressure on state and local officials, New York City announced that most of its students would return to classrooms only two or three days a week and would learn online in between. “Most schools will not be able to have all their kids in school at the same time,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio.For a nation that prides itself on its public school system, it’s an extraordinary situation in this pandemic year.With millions of the nation’s parents anxious about their children’s safety in the fall — and their own work interruptions if they must stay home — Trump continued to inject politics into public health. He accused Democrats yet again of wanting to keep schools closed for election-year reasons rather than health concerns. And he issued a veiled threat to CDC officials over their reopening guidelines, tweeting, “I will be meeting with them!!!”Elsewhere in the nation, many states continued to confront a resurgence of the virus, which has claimed more than 130,000 lives in the US But safety obstacles in schools can be surmounted, Trump insisted, and reopening “is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!”He did not say what funding he would pull, but Pence suggested at a coronavirus task force briefing that future Covid-19 relief bills could be tied to reopening schools as one way “to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back in school.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage On Twitter, Trump argued that countries including Germany, Denmark and Norway have reopened schools “with no problems.”Germany did begin to reopen its schools in May, but in many cases students are taking turns going to school and studying at home for half the week — just the thing administration officials have criticized. Germany authorities are aiming for classes to resume in close to normal fashion after the summer vacation.Trump’s Twitter warnings drew backlash from some governors who said he has no authority over schools’ fall plans. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said officials will reopen when it’s safe to do so.“School reopenings are a state decision, period,” he said at a news conference. “That is the law, and that is the way we are going to proceed. It’s not up to the president of the United States.”Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tweeted, “Our schools & child care providers need MORE federal funding — not less — to be able to safely open.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made reopening schools a priority to help parents get back to work, and he said Wednesday he supports CDC guidance to help that happen.Senate Democrats have proposed $430 billion for schools and child care providers as part of the next aid package to be debated in Congress later this month. McConnell, too, has suggested more money for schools will be needed.Trump made his threat a day after launching an all-out effort pressing state and local officials to reopen the nation’s schools and colleges this fall. At a White House event Tuesday, health and education officials argued that keeping students out for the fall semester would pose greater health risks than any tied to the coronavirus.Among those pushing for a fall reopening was the chief of the CDC. But Trump on Wednesday complained the agency’s school opening guidelines were too tough and costly.“While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things,” Trump wrote.The CDC’s director, Dr. Robert Redfield, has emphasized that his agency’s guidelines are only recommendations.“I want to make it very clear that what is not the intent of CDC’s guidelines is to be used as a rationale to keep schools closed,” he said at Wednesday’s coronavirus task force briefing, which was held at the Education Department.The CDC’s guidance recommends that students and teachers wear masks whenever feasible, spread out desks, stagger schedules, eat meals in classrooms instead of the cafeteria and add physical barriers between bathroom sinks.Trump did not clarify which of the guidelines he opposed. But a White House spokeswoman later offered an example, saying the president takes issue with the CDC’s suggestion that students bring their own meals to school when feasible.“There are 22 million children in this country who depend on these meals at schools, who depend on access to nutrition in schools,” Kayleigh McEnany said.Democrats slammed the president over his threats and warned him to keep out of the CDC’s work. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, ranking Democrat on the Education Committee, said the agency needs to be trusted to make decisions based on scientific evidence, “not on President Trump’s Twitter outbursts.”At the task force briefing, and a day earlier in a call with the nation’s governors, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said anything less than a full reopening would be a failure for students and taxpayers. But some of the nation’s largest districts plan to bring back limited numbers of students for only a few days a week, saying it would be unsafe for all to return at once.DeVos singled out Virginia’s Fairfax County Public Schools, which are asking families to decide between fully remote instruction or two days a week at school.“A choice of two days per week in the classroom is not a choice at all,” she said, according to audio of the call with governors obtained by The Associated Press.In announcing New York City’s plan for in-person instruction two or three days a week, de Blasio said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time while maintaining social distancing. The city’s public school system, with 1.1 million students, is by far the nation’s largest.Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association, said, “Educators want nothing more than to be back in classrooms and on college campuses with our students, but we must do it in a way that keeps students, educators and communities safe.”The American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued guidelines suggesting that districts aim to start the academic year with students “physically present in school.” Keeping students at home can lead to social isolation, the organization said, and prevent schools from identifying learning deficits, abuse, depression and other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-donald-trump-tells-schools-to-reopen-or-you-may-lose-federal-funds/story-sUr3X2flPl3znw7vMNbYxO.html
09-07-2020||World||US lawmakers seek probe into efforts made by Chinese govt to exploit Covid-19 outbreak||A group of 14 US lawmakers have introduced a bill in the Congress which demands the government to identify, analyse and combat alleged efforts made by the Chinese government to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic for nationalistic gains. Introduced by Congressman Jared Golden and co-sponsored by 13 other congressmen, the ‘Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act’ would mandate the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to investigate the ways in which the Chinese government intends to seize on the COVID-19 pandemic to promote its interests on the national stage and evaluate the risks to the United States. It also asks the DNI to provide policymakers with information they need to address and counter Chinese actions, when necessary, and report its findings to the Congress. “Since COVID-19 began, there is evidence that China is at work using the pandemic crisis against Americans through cyber-theft and the spread of misinformation,” said Golden. “We need to fully understand these threats and respond to them. We’re introducing the ‘Preventing China from Exploiting COVID-19 Act’ to gather and analyse important intelligence our country needs to protect American people and businesses,” Golden said. The bill requires the DNI -- in coordination with the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Homeland Security -- to prepare an assessment of the different ways in which the Chinese government has exploited or could exploit the pandemic, which originated in China, in order to advance China’s interests and to undermine the interests of the United States, its allies, and the rule-based international order. The assessment must be provided to Congress within 90 days and posted in unclassified form on the DNI’s website. “As we fight to save American lives and rebuild our economy, no country should be allowed to exploit the pandemic for its own advantage, yet reports indicate that China has done exactly that,” said Congressman Torres Small, a co-sponsor of the bill. “This is a time when countries should be coming together to fight the spread of COVID-19, not exploiting breakdowns in supply chains or a shortage of critical equipment like masks, gloves and gowns in order to advance their own national security interests. This is unacceptable, and the United States must be able to hold China accountable if it continues,” he said. Among others, the legislation requires the DNI to investigate, analyse, and report on the techniques used by the Chinese government to obstruct or retaliate against nations that have sought a full inquiry into China’s role in the emergence and spread of COVID-19, and the Chinese government’s motivations for such efforts. It seeks investigation into the activities undertaken by the Chinese government, like cyber-theft, intended to acquire information and intellectual property related to COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccines. The bill also asks the DNI to probe the manner in which the Chinese government seeks to advance its foreign policy interests by providing economic aid or medical equipment to nations adversely affected by COVID-19, and the degree to which this aid makes recipient countries more likely to adopt positions favourable to China and detrimental to the United States. The ways in which the Chinese government is using, or may be planning to use, the global disruption and distraction associated with COVID-19 as an opportunity to more aggressively pursue longstanding objectives, including with respect to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, and territorial disputes, is another subject being pointed out by the Congressmen. Relations between Washington and Beijing have spiralled downward since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. US President Donald Trump has questioned the Asian powerhouse’s handing of COVID-19. The two countries have also sparred over China imposing a new national security law in Hong Kong, restrictions on American journalists, treatment of Uyghurs Muslims and security measures in Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-seek-probe-into-efforts-made-by-chinese-govt-to-exploit-covid-19-outbreak/story-KGby0gr4LbWBofm05BHChL.html
09-07-2020||World||United States considering additional actions against China: White House||The United States is preparing to take additional actions against China, the White House has said, but what those presidential measures would be was not made clear. Relations between Washington and Beijing have spiralled downward since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. US President Donald Trump has questioned the Asian powerhouse’s handing of Covid-19. The two countries have also sparred over China imposing a new national security law in Hong Kong, restrictions on American journalists, treatment of Uyghurs Muslims and security measures in Tibet. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president on what our actions on China will be, but you will be hearing about some upcoming actions that pertain to China. So, I can confirm that,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Wednesday. McEnany was responding to a question on recent statements made by top administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor and Secretary of States, hinting the president could take additional measures against China in the coming days. US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien on Wednesday had told reporters that China had annexed Hong Kong, referring to the new security law in the former British colony. “I think you’re going to see a significant rollout of measures with respect to China over the coming days and weeks. There’s no president that’s ever stood up to China the way President Donald Trump has. He was the first president to put a massive tariff on the Chinese to stop the trade imbalance,” he said. O’Brien said that he gave a speech in Arizona two weeks ago on the Communist Party of China and the threat that it poses to the United States. FBI Director Christopher Wray gave a speech a day earlier about the massive theft of Chinese intellectual property. Referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments made last week, O’Brien said the president is looking very closely at TikTok, WeChat and some of other applications that the Chinese government is allegedly using to obtain personal and private data of Americans. “We are looking very closely at the apps,” O’Brien said, adding the president has already said that Hong Kong will no longer be treated as a separate entity, that it will be treated as part of China. “So there will be a number of regulations and a number of actions that take place to implement the president’s vision,” he said. He described the Chinese actions on Hong Kong as one of the biggest stories of the decade. “We have Hong Kong that’s basically been annexed by the People’s Republic of China, by the Communist Party of China, and they’re imposing their will on free and democratic people and not only are they doing it in Hong Kong, but they’re using this Hong Kong law to try and impose their will extra-territorially,” he said. “They’ll use the law, but they also use their economic leverage. So, when the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the peaceful protestors in Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist Party said that they’re not going to broadcast Rockets games in China, and they made the NBA kowtow to China because--simply because an American citizen supported free peaceful protests in Hong Kong,” he said. “So, what the Chinese Communist Party is doing isn’t just in Hong Kong. It’s affecting all of you. It’s affecting how we operate in the United States and we can’t let that happen,” O’Brien told reporters. In a tweet, Congressman Matt Gaetz said the US needs to be more resilient, diligent, and aware of the fact that China is an enemy. “And we shouldn’t be aiding the enemy by using the US dollar to prop up their companies and their operations in the United States,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-considering-additional-actions-against-china-white-house/story-g9JcVZsyXx106fGDNZSJhL.html
09-07-2020||World||Covid-19 could kill more through hunger, 122 million more may be pushed to starvation: Oxfam||More people could die as a result of hunger linked to Covid-19 than from the disease, warned charity group Oxfam in a new report published on Thursday, estimating that 122 million more people could be pushed to starvation this year.The scenario, it says in the report titled The Hunger Virus, is the result of the social and economic fallout from the pandemic including through mass unemployment, disruption to food production and supplies, and declining aid.Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: “The knock-on impacts of Covid-19 are far more widespread than the virus itself, pushing millions of the world’s poorest people deeper into hunger and poverty. It is vital governments contain the spread of this deadly disease, but they must also prevent it killing as many – if not more – people from hunger”.“Governments can save lives now by funding the UN Covid-19 appeal and supporting the call for a global ceasefire to end conflict in order to tackle the pandemic”, he added.The group wants the UK to champion debt cancellation at the G20 finance ministers meeting next week to pay for social protection measures such as cash grants to help people survive.The report reveals the world’s ten worst hunger ‘hotspots’, including Afghanistan, Syria and South Sudan where the food crisis is most severe and getting worse as a result of the pandemic.It also highlights emerging epicentres of hunger – middle income countries such as India, South Africa, and Brazil – where millions of people who were barely managing have been tipped over the edge by the pandemic.On India, the report says: “Travel restrictions left farmers without vital migrant labour at the peak of the harvest season, forcing many to leave their crops in the field to rot. Traders have also been unable to reach tribal communities during the peak harvest season for forest products, depriving up to 100 million people of their main source of income”.Women, and women-headed households, are more likely to go hungry despite the crucial role they play as food producers and workers, the group said.Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill, shadow international development secretary, said on the report: “Even before this pandemic, billions of people were facing unnecessary hunger, preventable deaths and extreme poverty”.“Covid-19 has worsened inequalities around the world and pushed millions more into hunger. We simply cannot overcome the challenges we face without global cooperation to provide humanitarian support now and to tackle the root causes behind the lack of access to nutritious food.”Since the pandemic began, Oxfam said it helped 4.5 million of the world’s most vulnerable people with food aid and clean water, working with over 344 partners across 62 countries. The international agency aims to reach a total of 14 million people by raising a further $113 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-kill-more-through-hunger-122-million-more-may-be-pushed-to-starvation-oxfam/story-67nncIVucQYuOEgrAPW6aK.html
09-07-2020||World||Trump forgoes insults of past, calls Mexico cherished friend||President Donald Trump, who has denigrated Mexican migrants and threatened the U.S. ally with crippling tariffs, welcomed President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to the White House on Wednesday, called him a cherished partner and claimed the countries’ economic and security ties were reaching new heights.Trump’s warm words were in stark contrast to the days when he called Mexicans “rapists” and railed against migrants entering the United States illegally. López Obrador had cordial words for Trump, too, saying that while they have disagreed, it was better to find common ground and avoid slinging insults.The meeting was billed as a celebration of economic ties and the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, but critics in Mexico worried López Obrador was being used as a political pawn to bolster the Trump campaign and his “America first,” anti-illegal migration agenda. Despite the verbal backslapping in the Rose Garden, thorny issues — from immigration to investment — remain.Trump has dialed back his harsh words since López Obrador took office a year and a half ago. And López Obrador signaled he wanted to put the insults in the past.“As in the best times of our political relations, during my term as president of Mexico, instead of insults toward me and more importantly against my country, we have received from you understanding and respect,” López Obrador said.Their relationship is an odd bromance: López Obrador is a veteran leftist and Trump tacks right.“Some thought that our ideological differences would have led us inevitably to confrontation,” López Obrador said. “Fortunately, this bad omen didn’t materialize and I consider that in the future there will be no need to break our good political relations, nor the friendship between our governments.”Later, Lopez Obrador said: “The forecasts failed. We didn’t fight. We are friends, and we’re going to keep being friends.”Trump their friendship developed “against all odds.”Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien said the two leaders have “really hit it off” and exchanged gift baseball bats during their meeting. Trump signed and gave López Obrador a custom Louisville Slugger, and the Mexican president gave the president a bat manufactured by indigenous people in southern Mexico, O’Brien said on Fox Business Network’s “Lou Dobbs Tonight.”The two signed a declaration highlighting U.S.-Mexico relations and the USMCA. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decided not to come to Washington to celebrate the agreement, citing scheduling conflicts.Trump and López Obrador also pledged to cooperate in responding to the coronavirus, which has rocked both nations. Since March 2020, movement across the border has been restricted to essential travel while allowing the flow of goods and services. Last year, Mexico became the largest goods trading partner of the United States.López Obrador arrived at the White House after morning stops at the Lincoln Memorial and a statue of Benito Juarez, a former Mexican president and national hero. Trump and a military honor guard greeted him at the White House. The two posed for pictures and Trump flashed a thumb’s up. They also were to have dinner at the White House with about 20 U.S. and Mexican business leaders, including Carlos Slim, one of the richest men in the world.With the U.S. looking to reduce its dependence on China for parts and supplies, Mexico is well-positioned to step into the void, though U.S. businesses have viewed some recent actions taken by the Mexican government as harmful to U.S. investors and say they undermine the framework of the USMCA. López Obrador didn’t publicly address U.S. business’ concerns.“If there is not a better investment climate for both foreign and domestic private investment, it will be very difficult to use the opportunity of USMCA and the drift between China and the United States to our advantage,” Geronimo Gutierrez, who was Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S. in 2017 and 2018, said during a virtual event hosted by the Wilson Center.With no meetings planned with former Vice President Joe Biden, López Obrador seemingly is banking that Trump will win a second term. The Democratic Party chairman, Tom Perez, recalled Trump’s insults of Mexicans and said the president was now trying to take credit for a trade deal that Democrats in Congress helped make possible.“Latino communities, immigrants, and the American people deserve a president with the empathy and experience to lead us forward, not a demagogue who cheers on bigotry from the White House,” Perez said, urging voters to elect Biden.When he arrived at the White House, López Obrador and Trump did not shake hands as would have been customary before the pandemic. White House spokesman Judd Deere said all members of the Mexican traveling delegation were tested for the virus. The presidents sat at tables positioned many feet apart to sign their joint statement.López Obrador likes to point out that Trump helped Mexico reach a deal with other oil-producing nations to cut production and aided Mexico in obtaining more ventilators to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Both presidents talk about a blossoming friendship that seems to stem from their pursuit of nationalist agendas.Many Mexicans, however, remain wary of Trump, whose denunciations are intended to rally his most loyal supporters. Trump has threatened tariffs to strong-arm Mexico into playing an uncomfortable role in U.S. immigration policy and insisted that Mexico will pay for a border wall meant to keep migrants out of the U.S.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wouldn’t get into detail about what the two presidents said about immigration. Mexico deployed 27,000 troops to the border to help stem the tide of illegal immigrants from Central American.___Associated Press writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-forgoes-insults-of-past-calls-mexico-cherished-friend/story-6iJ6JIcc8BA708mB37SOUP.html
09-07-2020||World||Beijing fears its people’s free thinking than any foreign foe, says Pompeo||US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, on Wednesday (local time) came down heavily on Chinese Communist Party and called for releasing Xu Zhangrun who was detained by Chinese authorities for publishing articles criticising Xi Jinping over coronavirus pandemic.“As with all unelected, communist regimes, Beijing fears its own people’s free thinking more than any foreign foe. We were deeply troubled to learn this week that the CCP detained Xu Zhangrun for criticizing General Secretary Xi Jinping’s repressive regime and the CCP’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Pompeo.“He should be released. He was simply telling the truth. He should be released as soon as possible,” the US Secretary of State said.According to media reports, Xu had published an essay in February criticising Xi’s policy of deception and censorship over the coronavirus situation in China.Xu worked as a law professor at Tsinghua University. He had earlier spoken against the 2018 abolition of presidential term limits. Stating that the CCP has an enormous credibility problem, the US Secretary of State said: “They failed to tell the world the truth about this virus, and now hundreds of thousands of peoples all across the world are dead. We need the truth; we still need the truth.”“We need to open up. We need to engage in a serious way with scientists around the world. And they now say they’re going to allow the WHO to come in. That’s great, but the WHO needs to be free to do its real work. We need to make sure the right people are there to engage in this investigation, and we need real answers, not a perfunctory political solution. This is about science, not politics, and the Chinese Communist Party needs to come clean with the world about this virus,” added Pompeo.The US Secretary of State also slammed China for its recent actions over Hong Kong.“Beijing said that for 50 years they’d give the people of Hong Kong “a high degree of autonomy.” And you all have seen what’s happened after only 23 years - empty promises made to the people of Hong Kong and to the world,” he said.Pompeo lauded Google, Facebook, and Twitter for “refusing to surrender user data to the Hong Kong government”. “Other companies should follow them and do the same,” he said.China’s decision to impose draconian national security law in Hong Kong has invited criticism with many saying the move would lead to erosion of its autonomy and also crush political dissent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-fears-its-people-s-free-thinking-than-any-foreign-foe-says-pompeo/story-C6PkBtXuJ7LuxqHxtLsrPM.html
09-07-2020||World||Brooks Brothers, which dressed 40 US presidents, files for bankruptcy||Brooks Brothers Group Inc filed for bankruptcy, felled by the pandemic’s impact on clothing sales and its own heavy debt load.The famed apparel company is the latest to succumb as a nationwide lockdown during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak added to the woes afflicting old-line retailers. Neiman Marcus Group Inc, J Crew Group Inc and John Varvatos Enterprises Inc each filed for bankruptcy since the virus took hold.The company that says it’s put 40 US presidents in its suits, survived two World Wars and navigated through casual Fridays and a loosening of dress standards even on Wall Street, but the Covid-19 pandemic pushed the 200-year-old company into seek Chapter 11 protection.The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware allows Brooks Brothers to keep operating while it works out a plan to turn the business around and pay its debts. The company listed assets and liabilities of at least $500 million each in court papers, and a spokesperson said via email it had lined up a $75 million bankruptcy loan.The pandemic has hit Brooks Brothers hard, shuttering office buildings and hurting demand for business wear as people worked from home. The retailer has been trying to sell itself since last year as many of its roughly 250 US locations struggled with declining sales, Bloomberg reported earlier. It’s continuing to seek a buyer, according to the spokesperson.With its first store in 1818 on the corner of Cherry and Catherine streets in lower Manhattan, the company’s simple, classic suits became a staple on Wall Street. Brooks Brothers, which calls itself the oldest US clothing retailer, has dressed US presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, and now sells men’s, women’s and children’s clothing.The store began its international expansion with a Tokyo flagship in 1979 and now has more than 250 locations outside the US. Its many stores have become a burden amid changing consumer habits and a shift toward more casual work attire.More bankruptcies are anticipated in the retail sector.The virus-induced recession has cratered spending in most sectors of the economy and accelerated shifts in where people shop, mostly to the benefit of online retailers like Amazon.com. Online sales are up a sizable 31% from a year ago.Brooks Brothers was one of the few national chains that produced its clothing in the US. In March, it shifted some production at plants in New York, North Carolina and Massachusetts to produce 150,000 masks per day for frontline healthworkers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brooks-brothers-which-dressed-40-us-presidents-files-for-bankruptcy/story-hOOcAQ6nooPQV4BZYXtjZK.html

Oli was set to meet Wednesday with his Nepal Communist Party rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who argues it is his turn to rule, ahead of a series of party meetings in coming days and weeks that will decide whether Oli is removed from his post.Oli’s troubles within the party also come as he deals with blowback from India over a new map that includes a disputed area claimed by both India and Nepal.Kathmandu’s relations with New Delhi only worsened after Oli said last week that India was attempting to oust him from office with help from some of the members of his own party. India has denied all allegations.India had been a dominant force in Nepal until recently, when China’s involvement began to grow. Besides China’s investment in the building of airports, highways and hydro-power projects in Nepal, Chinese diplomats have worked to increase ties with Nepali political leaders.Just this week, China’s ambassador to Nepal held meetings with some top Nepal Communist Party leaders.China views Nepal as key to its massive transcontinental infrastructure Belt and Road Initiative that builds on old Silk Road routes that once connected China to the West, analysts say.“Because Nepal remains in a strategic geographic location, both of these countries think they have to have importance in Nepal’s politics,” said Guranaj Luitel, editor of Nepal’s popular Nagarik newspaper. “The present government looks more inclined toward China, and because of that India’s role looks like it’s gradually declining.” Oli was elected PM in 2017 after the Nepal Communist Party won a majority of the seats in parliament. Just before the general election, two Communist parties led by Oli and Dahal had merged to become a stronger political force. It was widely believed that Oli and Dahal would split the five-year term, with each taking turns in office. But 2 1/2 years after taking power, Oli has shown no signs of stepping down. “Having differences and feuds is nothing new in our political party, but this time it has turned into a national crisis because we are the largest party and we are in the government,” said Khatiwada||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/power-tussle-in-nepal-ruling-party-over-china-influence/story-JeKDYs8b6EMsBrf9qekpFL.html
