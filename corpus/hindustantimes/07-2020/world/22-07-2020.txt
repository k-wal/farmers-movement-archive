Vaccines for this pandemic are not for the wealthy, they are not for the poor, they are for everybody,” he said.The US government will pay $1.95 billion to buy 100 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc and German biotech BioNTech if it proves safe and effective, the companies said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Ryan also cautioned schools to be careful about re-opening until community transmission of Covid-19 is under control. Debate in the United States over restarting education has intensified, even as the pandemic flares up in dozens of states.“We have to do everything possible to bring our children back to school, and the most effective thing we can do is to stop the disease in our community,” he said. “Because if you control the disease in the community, you can open the schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-expect-first-covid-19-vaccine-until-early-2020-says-who-expert/story-kTgt1fXtVogWluhyd7vCJI.html
22-07-2020||World||Ukraine president defends movie post to end hostage crisis||Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday defended his decision to agree to a hostage-taker’s bizarre demand that he post a movie recommendation to end a 12-hour stand-off.Zelensky described how he negotiated personally on Tuesday evening with a gunman who was holding 13 hostages on a bus in Lutsk, around 400 kilometres (250 miles) west of capital Kiev. The tense stand-off ended after the president agreed to post a video of himself recommending a 2005 US documentary narrated by actor Joaquin Phoenix called “Earthlings”, which condemns humans’ mistreatment of animals. “We have a result -- everyone is alive. We are not fighting for (approval) ratings -- we are fighting for life,” Zelensky said in a statement, after some criticised him for giving in to the gunman’s demands.The SBU security service said all the bus passengers were released unharmed. The hostage-taker had earlier fired shots and thrown an explosive package.Zelensky said he agreed in a phone-call with the man, identified as 44-year-old Maksym Kryvosh, that “he would release three people, and after that I would record a video.”- ‘Unstable’ -The armed man complied and freed three hostages: a man, a pregnant woman and a child.In response, the president posted a video message on Facebook urging people to watch the documentary.Kryvosh agreed to release all his captives half an hour later, Zelensky said.Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Kryvosh, who was armed with a pistol, a rifle and a hand grenade, came out of the bus following the negotiations.Footage published by Ukrainian officials showed police escorting hostages away while armed special forces detained Kryvosh, lying face-down on the pavement.The SBU security service classed the incident as an “act of terror” and “hostage-taking” and Kryvosh faces up to 15 years in prison.After the crisis ended, Zelensky deleted the short video he had posted.“Today loved ones can hug everybody who languished all day on the bus with a gun pointed at them,” he wrote on Facebook.“We did not lose a single person,” added the president, who was a television comedian before his 2019 election win.The hostage-taker is currently in a temporary detention centre, police reported.Kryvosh had previously spent around 10 years in prison on charges including fraud and illegal handling of weapons. Interior minister Avakov described him as “unstable.”Posts in a Twitter account in Kryvosh’s name, later suspended, claimed he had bombs and asked top Ukrainian celebrities to post anti-establishment messages on social media.The security service said on Wednesday that it had detained several suspected accomplices.The head of the Lutsk branch of the SBU, Pavlo Danyukov, said at a briefing that the hostages were in satisfactory condition and had not suffered any physical violence during the stand-off.- ‘This is a mistake’ -The US Embassy in Ukraine tweeted a message of praise, saying: “We join the people of Ukraine in celebrating the safe release of the hostages... and commend Ukrainian authorities’ success in securing their release.”Some Ukrainians criticised Zelensky for his concession to the hostage-taker, however.Many likened the incident to an episode of the popular British television series “Black Mirror” where the prime minister fulfils the grotesque demands of a kidnapper holding a member of the royal family.Natalia Delgyado, a Kiev-based Facebook user, wondered “whether Zelensky would have fulfilled the terrorist’s demands if he had demanded public sex with a pig like in the plot of the Black Mirror episode”. “This is a mistake. We should not negotiate with terrorists,” Kiev-based lawyer Igor Pashnev wrote on Facebook.But another Facebook user, Eduard Runin, from Kharkiv, praised Zelensky for choosing the option of “fulfilling the demands of a terrorist and keeping people alive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-president-defends-movie-post-to-end-hostage-crisis/story-e0xUxckRPj7hoe033JjozN.html

This dramatic development is sure to further sour the rapidly deteriorating bilateral ties with the two countries already at loggerheads over South China Sea disputes, the Hong Kong security bill, US arms sales to Taiwan, the condition of minorities in Xinjiang, and the origin of the coronavirus besides an ongoing trade war.Earlier on Wednesday, Hu Xijin, the editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper said Washington had given 72 hours to Beijing – that is by July 24 – to close down the Houston consulate.Also read: Relationship with India important, monitoring LAC very closely - US defense secretaryHu’s tweet came hours after Houston police and firefighters descended on the consulate following witness reports that papers were being burned outside in open containers, the Houston Chronicle and two local TV stations reported, citing local police.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry lashed out at the Donald Trump administration for passing the order.ALSO WATCH | ‘US leading the world in Covid-19 testing, India second’: Donald Trump “It is a political provocation unilaterally launched by the US side, which seriously violates international law, basic norms governing international relations and the bilateral consular agreement between China and the US.”Speaking at the regular ministry briefing, Wang said, “China strongly condemns such an outrageous and unjustified move which will sabotage China-US relations. We urge the US to immediately withdraw its erroneous decision, otherwise, China will make legitimate and necessary reactions”.“The unilateral closure of China’s consulate general in Houston within a short period of time is an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China,” Wang said and listed allegations of Washington harassing its diplomats and students in the US.“For some time, the US government has been shifting the blame to China with stigmatisation and unwarranted attacks against China’s social system, harassing Chinese diplomatic and consular staff in the US, intimidating and interrogating Chinese students and confiscating their personal electrical devices, even detaining them without cause,” Wang said.The spokesperson said China had shown goodwill to US diplomats in China and had promoted Sino-US ties through its envoys in the US.“On the contrary, the US put restrictions on Chinese diplomats in June and last October respectively with no valid reason. [The US] has seized and opened mail and official supplies,” Wang said.Due to the deliberate smearing and hatred-inciting moves from the US, Chinese delegations in the US have recently received bomb threats and death threats. Responding to a separate question at the press conference, spokesperson Wang asked the US to immediately stop making accusations against it about cybercrimes, in response to Washington’s indictment of two Chinese nationals for hacking Covid-19 vaccine-related data and defence secrets.Wang said “…the consulate was operating normally” but sidestepped questions about US media reports in Houston on Tuesday night that documents were being burned in a courtyard at the consulate.Earlier on Wednesday, US media reported that Houston police and fire officials responded to reports that documents were being burned in the courtyard of the Consulate General of China in Houston on Tuesday night, citing the Houston Police Department (PD).Houston PD said they began receiving reports just after 8 pm that documents were being burned at 3417 Montrose Boulevard where the consulate is located, click2houston.com reported.The Chinese Consulate in Houston was opened in 1979 - the first in the year the US and China established diplomatic relations.The consulate website says the office covers eight southern US states - including Texas and Florida - and has nearly one million people in the area registered at the consulate.There are five Chinese consulates in the US while the embassy is in Washington.The US has its embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/livid-china-ready-to-retaliate-after-us-says-shut-houston-consulate-in-72-hours/story-ALtRuNXsA0sWI0zLrtdD4M.html

It has 24 questions based on British traditions, history and customs that migrants need to know well enough to pass it.To prepare for the test, the applicants are prescribed an official handbook called ‘Life in the United Kingdom: A Guide for New Residents’. Over 1.25 lakh migrants applied for naturalisation in 2019, a process that includes the test.The historians, mainly specialising in the area of British empire, wrote an open letter in protest against what they call “misrepresentation of slavery” and empire in the test and the handbook, which includes references to colonial India.The letter says: “The official handbook published by the Home Office is fundamentally misleading and in places demonstrably false…It also states that ‘by the second part of the 20th century, there was, for the most part, an orderly transition from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence’.”“In fact, decolonisation was not an ‘orderly’ but an often violent process, not only in India but also in the many so-called ‘emergencies’ such as the Mau-Mau Uprising in Kenya (1952-1960). We call for an immediate official review of the history chapter”.Signatories include David Washbrook (Cambridge), Yasmin Khan (Oxford), Joya Chatterjee (Cambridge), William Dalrymple, Tirthankar Roy (LSE), Anindita Ghosh (Manchester), Sujit Sivasundaram (Cambridge) and David Olusoga (Manchester).The letter says: “Applicants are expected to learn about more than two hundred individuals. The only individual of colonial origin named in the book is Sake Dean Mohamet who co-founded England’s first curry house in 1810. The pages on the British Empire end with a celebration of Rudyard Kipling”.“The aim of the official handbook is to promote tolerance and fairness and facilitate integration. In its current version, the historical pages do the opposite…Until the history chapter has been corrected and rewritten, it should be formally withdrawn from the test”.The Home Office, headed by secretary Priti Patel, said: “Given the breadth of British history, the Life in the UK handbook provides a starting point to explore our past and help those seeking to live permanently in the UK gain a basic understanding of our society, culture and historical references which occur in everyday conversations”.“We have published several editions of the handbook since it was launched and will continue to keep its contents under review and consider any feedback we receive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/revise-official-history-on-india-british-empire-urgently-historians-tell-uk/story-YHke8kJgcS9D7yOpeutumM.html

22-07-2020||World||Global Covid-19 cases exceed 15 million||Global coronavirus infections surged past 15 million on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally, with the pandemic gathering pace even as countries remain divided in their response to the crisis. In the United States, which has the highest number of cases in the world with 3.91 million infections, President Donald Trump warned: “It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.”The top five countries with the most cases is rounded out by Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa. But, the Reuters tally shows the disease is accelerating the fastest in the Americas, which account for more than half the world’s infections and half its deaths.Globally, the rate of new infections shows no sign of slowing, according to the Reuters tally, based on official reports.After the first Covid-19 case was reported in Wuhan, China, in early January, it took about 15 weeks to reach 2 million cases. By contrast, it took just eight days to climb above 15 million from the 13 million reached on July 13.Health experts stress that official data almost certainly underreports both infections and deaths, particularly in countries with limited testing capacity.The official number of coronavirus cases at 15,009,213 is at least triple the number of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to World Health Organization data, while the death toll of more than 616,000 in seven months is close to the upper range of yearly influenza deaths.Relax or tightenWith the first wave of the virus still to peak in several countries and a resurgence of case numbers in others, some countries are reintroducing strict social distancing measures while others relax restrictions.Stung by low approval ratings for his handling of the epidemic and downplaying the risks during the early stages, Trump made a significant shift in rhetoric on Tuesday, encouraging Americans to wear a face mask.While the epidemic worsened in the United States, Trump’s focus ahead of a presidential election in November has been on reopening the economy, and governors in the hard-hit states of Texas, Florida and Georgia continue to push back hard against calls for stricter restrictions.In Brazil, more than 2.15 million people have tested positive including President Jair Bolsonaro, and more than 81,000 people have died. While Bolsonaro has played down the outbreak, its scale has made Brazil a prime testing ground for potential vaccines.India, the only other country with more than 1 million cases, reported almost 40,000 new cases on Wednesday. Having been keen to reopen its economy, India is now facing the twin challenge of combating the pandemic and massive flooding in the country’s northeast.Two ministers in South Africa’s cabinet were admitted to hospital with Covid-19, as Africa’s most-industrialised country counted a total 372,628 confirmed cases and 5,173 deaths.Other countries are reintroducing restrictions in response to fresh outbreaks.In Spain, the number of people allowed on Barcelona’s beaches was limited after crowds flocked to the seaside over the weekend despite advice to stay home.In Australia, residents of Melbourne, the country’s second biggest city, were ordered to wear masks in public from Wednesday after the country reported a record 501 new cases.Officials in Canada were closely watching a spike in cases as the economy reopens, attributing the rise in part to large numbers of young people gathering in bars.China, meanwhile, announced that passengers on inbound flights must provide negative Covid-19 test results before boarding, as authorities seek to reduce the risk of imported cases amid increased international travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-cases-exceed-15-million/story-ANaxmb4BPoyXznHm3RyaMN.html
22-07-2020||World||Five common cancers could get detected up to 4 years before conventional diagnosis: Study||A non-invasive blood test could prove key in detecting five common cancers up to four years before conventional diagnosis, a new international clinical study conducted in China says.The long-term study, the findings of which were published in Nature Communications on June 21, a leading science journal, was carried out on 123,115 individuals in Taizhou city in eastern China’s Jiangsu province.As part of the Taizhou Longitudinal Study (TZL), the individuals, aged between 25 and 90, provided blood samples for long-term storage between 2007 and 2014. The samples were collected by the Shanghai-based Fudan University.“These individuals were then indefinitely monitored for cancer occurrence through linkages with local cancer registries and health insurance databases. By the end of 2017, a total of 575 initially healthy subjects (who presented as asymptomatic) were diagnosed with one of five common cancer types (stomach, esophagus, colorectum, lung or liver) within 4 years of initial blood draw,” the study said.Also read: Breast Cancer Awareness - All you need to know about the disease, its symptoms and moreThe five cancer types studied in the research account for 261,530 annual cancer deaths in the US and 2.1 million cancer deaths every year in China, the study said, adding that early detection could greatly reduce deaths from these diseases.“Recent studies have also identified that early detection of cancer could reduce cancer treatment costs by $26 billion annually (and also reduce the loss of productivity caused by cancer),” it said.“The ultimate goal would be performing blood tests like this routinely during annual health checkups,” said Zhang Kun, one of the paper’s corresponding authors and professor and chair of the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego.“But the immediate focus is to test people at higher risk based on family history, age or other known risk factors,” Zhang was quoted by the University of California which was involved in the study.The researchers said early diagnosis of cancer was the aim of the study as late-stage cancers often lack an effective treatment option.“Survival rates increase significantly when cancer is identified at early stages as the tumour can be surgically removed or treated with milder drug regimens; average 5-year survival at early stage is 91%, while average 5-year survival at late stage is 26%,” the study said.The detection of tumours at the earliest possible stage is therefore of paramount importance for cancer treatment. The test, which has been named the PanSeer assay, however, is unlikely to predict which patients will later go on to develop cancer.Instead, it is most likely identifying patients who already have cancerous growths but remain asymptomatic for current detection methods, the study said.In conclusion, the research team said that more large-scale longitudinal studies were needed to confirm the potential of the test for the early detection of cancer in pre-diagnosis individuals.“We also demonstrate that PanSeer detects cancer in 95%... of asymptomatic individuals who were later diagnosed, though future longitudinal studies are required to confirm this result. These results demonstrate that cancer can be non-invasively detected up to four years before the current standard of care,” it said.The team, according to the University of California, comprised researchers from “…Fudan University and at Singlera Genomics, a San Diego and Shanghai-based startup that is working to commercialise the tests based on the advances originally made in Zhang’s bioengineering lab at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-common-cancers-could-get-detected-up-to-4-years-before-conventional-diagnosis-study/story-qQfO23z9CPToBFTbTVMVoO.html
22-07-2020||World||US asked China to close Houston consulate: Report||The US government abruptly ordered China to close its consulate in Houston in an “unprecedented escalation,” the Foreign Ministry said, in the latest sign of deteriorating ties between the world’s biggest economies.China said the move was unilaterally initiated by the U.S. and Beijing would “react with firm countermeasures” if the Trump administration doesn’t “revoke this erroneous decision.” It accused the U.S. of harassing diplomatic staff and intimidating Chinese students, confiscating personal electrical devices and detaining them without cause. Chinese diplomatic missions and personnel also recently received bomb and death threats, it added.“China strongly condemns such an outrageous and unjustified move which will sabotage China-U.S. relations,” the Foreign Ministry said. “We urge the U.S. to immediately withdraw its erroneous decision. Otherwise China will make legitimate and necessary reactions.”It wasn’t immediately clear what spurred the move by the U.S., which has clashed with China over everything from trade and 5G networks to territorial disputes and responsibility for the pandemic. The Justice Department on Tuesday accused two Chinese hackers of working for Beijing to steal or try to steal terabytes of data, including coronavirus research, from Western companies in 11 nations.A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In the statement, China said “infliltration and interference is never in the genes and tradition of China’s foreign policy,” without referring to anything specific.On Tuesday night in Houston, police and firefighters descended on the consulate following witness reports that papers were being burned outside in open containers, the Houston Chronicle and two local TV stations reported, citing local police.In videos posted online by local media outlets in Houston, fires could be seen in multiple containers, with smoke rising into the sky. TV stations KPRC and KHOU said firefighters were not allowed inside the complex, and KHOU said the fires were later extinguished. The Chronicle said no injuries were reported.The Chronicle and both stations separately reported the consulate would be evicted on Friday at 4 p.m. local time, each citing unnamed sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-close-consulate-in-houston-says-news-agency-reuters-quoting-sources/story-Yz9Gly1isk9clBdRIiMtsM.html

It is the allotment of cabinet berths to various factions of NCP which will define the politics ahead. While it is known that the morning meeting between co-chair Oli, Dahal and Madhav Nepal on July 15 was acrimonious to say the least, it is still not clear who ensured the stand down from Dahal after a lunch with Nepalese PM the same day and at what cost. It is only after this crucial lunch meeting with two associates of the two leaders negotiating on the sidelines that Oli refused to step down either from PM post or the party post and Dahal caved in by saying that he was opposed to the division of the party. Oli got a walkover in the duel last week and Dahal is now looking towards more Cabinet berths to maintain his political clout. The Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yonqi, on her part is preparing for another political battle ahead in an uncertain Nepal. “We do not know whether it was lure of incentives or threat of vulnerabilities that settled the round last week. But what is definitely know is that the Chinese had a major role to play in avoiding the bust-up,” said a western diplomat based in Kathmandu.Ambassador Hou, the master handler of KathmanduAlthough the politics in Nepal continues to be fluid and uncertain, Hindustan Times explored the background of Ambassador Hou, who is at the centrestage of the political games in the Republic.Born in Shanxi province in March, 1970, Hou is a master of arts and holds a major in Urdu language from Peking University, and is fluent in Hindustani language. While many assume that she has an PLA Intelligence background as she was Director, Department of External Security Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2012-2013, Hou for the record is a career diplomat with a firm belief that diplomacy is war by other means.For the past 24 years since 1996, Ambassador Hou has been attached to department of Asian Affairs and rose up to one of the four Deputy Director Generals in that department from 2015-2018 before becoming a master handler of Nepal. Barring a stint as Attache in Pakistan in 1996-2001 and 2007-2009 tenure as Consul at the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles, Hou has served only in Asian Affairs department to date.While Ambassador Hou has been successful in keeping the NCP flock together and orchestrated Oli’s needling of India through cartographic expansion, Beijing has not been so-successful in reading the Nepalese society. Even though China has now offered to revive one of the two hydropower projects in Nepal for free, the hill people of Nepal are still to be enamoured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-dahal-stand-down-in-round-1-fight-with-oli-is-now-for-cabinet-berths-in-nepal-reshuffle-ahead/story-wfwZmDbl8QPo1dukDKbsYN.html
22-07-2020||World||Swedish epidemiology boss says questioned Covid-19 strategy seems to be working||Sweden’s top epidemiologist said on Tuesday a rapid decline in new critical Covid-19 cases alongside slowing death rates indicated that Sweden’s strategy for slowing the epidemic, which has been widely questioned abroad, was working. Sweden has foregone a hard lockdown throughout the outbreak, a strategy that set it apart from most of Europe.Chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell of the public health agency said a rapid slowdown in the spread of the virus indicated very strongly that Sweden had reached relatively widespread immunity. “The epidemic is now being slowed down, in a way that I think few of us would have believed a week or so ago,” he told a news conference. Daily Covid-19 death rates as well as the number of infected in intensive care have been slowing gradually since April, with seven new deaths and no new ICU admissions reported by the health agency on Tuesday. Reported daily deaths peaked mid-April at 115. “It really is yet another sign that the Swedish strategy is working,” Tegnell said. It is possible to slow contagion fast with the measures we are taking in Sweden.”The slowdown in Sweden matched that in several countries that have accredited it to lockdowns. “We have managed to do it with substantially less invasive measures,” he said.Sweden’s death toll of 5,646, when compared relative to population size, has far outstripped those of its Nordic neighbours, although it remains lower than in some European countries that locked down, such as Britain and Spain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-epidemiology-boss-says-questioned-covid-19-strategy-seems-to-be-working/story-e2lGaZh3iHiyoCjo9pJ9kM.html
22-07-2020||World||Pakistani journalist Matiullah Jan set free by abductors ahead of court appearance||Pakistani journalist Matiullah Jan was released on Tuesday evening, approximately 12 hours after he was kidnapped from outside a public school in the heart of Islamabad. Observers have said it is still unclear who kidnapped him and why but all fingers point to the spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).The decision to release Matiullah Jan may have been taken after Islamabad High Court ordered authorities to produce him before it on Wednesday morning.Camera footage of the incident shows Jan’s abductors included plainclothesmen as well as uniformed policemen, who were travelling in four cars.Soon after Jan dropped his wife outside the government school in Islamabad, the footage shows the other cars encircling his vehicle and taking the journalist into custody.Jan, who is no stranger to controversy, was summoned earlier this week over an alleged tweet against judges and the judiciary.A three-member bench of the top court headed by the chief justice is hearing the case in which he was to appear on Wednesday morning. The court in its contempt notice stated Jan in a tweet from his Twitter account on July 10 apparently used painful words against judges and the judiciary.Last week, Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah dismissed another contempt application against Jan, saying the dignity of independent judges “is not so fragile and it can’t be harmed by a tweet.”A number of journalists and media associations had voiced concern about the safety of the Islamabad-based reporter. His abduction had also elicited comments from ministers in the Imran Khan cabinet. Information minister Shibli Faraz had condemned the incident but at the same time told reporters that he did not have any information on who had picked up Jan.Jan was attacked in Islamabad in 2017 but he had escaped unhurt. He was travelling from Islamabad with his children when two motorcyclists threw a rock and smashed the windscreen of his car.Before that, Jan had said he was chased by another car at night and his windscreen was smashed in a similar attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-journalist-matiullah-jan-set-free-by-abductors-ahead-of-court-appearance/story-uAcdt8QvG7Gan781kybV2J.html
22-07-2020||World||Bangladesh floods claim 54 lives, affect 2.4 million people, says UN||Severe flooding in Bangladesh, which has killed at least 54 people and affected over 2.4 million people, could be the worst since 1988, the United Nations has said.Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said on Tuesday (local time) that some 56,000 of those impacted already have been displaced and are taking refuge in government shelters, Xinhua reported.“At least 54 people have reportedly been killed to date as a result,” Dujarric told reporters at a regular briefing.“The UN and our humanitarian partners are helping the government respond to the situation by providing food, water purification facilities, hygiene and dignity kits, as well as emergency shelter supplies,” he said.The UN Central Emergency Response Fund recently provided UN agencies with 5.2 million US dollars to help families most at risk, the spokesman said.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on its website, “The anticipatory funding has since July 11 allowed partners to reach communities early with key assistance, including the distribution of sealable drums to protect agricultural equipment, and hygiene, dignity and health kits, as well as cash assistance.”“Responding to the flood is complicated by the fact that these efforts are taking place as Bangladesh is also addressing the Covid-19 pandemic and recovering from Cyclone Amphan,” Dujarric said.Amphan, which hit Bangladesh in May, was the strongest storm in the Bay of Bengal, the American Red Cross said.The 1988 floods claimed the lives of about 500 people and left more than 25 million people homeless, as per the UN records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-floods-claim-54-lives-affect-2-4-million-people-says-un/story-4Tzt8n1ZOQjxUwNnmlf5zJ.html

22-07-2020||World||Apology demanded from GOP lawmaker for Ocasio-Cortez remark||New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused a Republican colleague on Tuesday of angrily harassing her outside the Capitol over her progressive views in an encounter that a reporter said ended with the congressman using a sexist slur as he walked away.The No. 2 House Democrat demanded that Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, one of the House’s most conservative members, apologize to Ocasio-Cortez, one of the House’s most progressive, over Monday’s confrontation. A spokesperson for Yoho denied that the lawmaker had used a sexist slur, saying the Florida congressman had instead muttered “bull——” to himself to describe Ocasio-Cortez’s policies.There was little sign that Yoho’s GOP colleagues were rising to defend him, and the House minority leader said he would speak to Yoho.“We think everyone should show respect to one another,” Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters about the episode, which occurred during an election year in which partisan divisions have been rubbed raw.In a tweet Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she had never spoken to Yoho “before he decided to accost me” as they passed each other on the Capitol’s outdoor steps during a vote.“Believe it or not, I usually get along fine w/ my GOP colleagues. We know how to check our legislative sparring at the committee door. But hey, ‘b(asterisk)tches’ get stuff done,” she wrote, using one of the words Yoho reportedly used.A reporter for The Hill newspaper witnessed the encounter, the newspaper said. According to the news outlet, Yoho approached Ocasio-Cortez and said her recent comments connecting poverty to a crime surge in New York City during the coronavirus pandemic were “disgusting.”“You are out of your freaking mind,” Yoho added. Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being “rude,” the article said.The Hill said as the two headed in opposite directions, Yoho uttered the sexist comment “to no one in particular.”Walking with Yoho was Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, another conservative. Heather Douglass, Williams’ spokesperson, said he didn’t hear the exchange and “would have immediately condemned that type of language towards any colleague.”Ocasio-Cortez fired back, saying Williams was lying about not hearing the conversation and had even participated in it, making his own remark about “throwing urine.”“When he undeniably sees another man engaged in virulent harassment of a young woman, just pretend you never saw it in the most cartoonish manner possible,” she wrote.Yoho, 65, is a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a foe of GOP leaders he’s considered too moderate like former Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. He’s retiring when his term ends in January.Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a high-profile first-term congresswoman whose vociferous support for proposals like the Green New Deal has won her appearances in GOP campaign ads casting her as a liberal villain.Yoho spokesperson Brian Kaveney said in an email Tuesday that Yoho “had a brief member to member conversation” and had not called Ocasio-Cortez a name. He wrote that Yoho said “bull——” to himself, “summarizing what he believes her policies to be.”“It is unfortunate that Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is using this exchange to gain personal attention,” said Kaveny.Kaveny did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking if Yoho would apologize.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Yoho’s comments were “despicable and unacceptable” and require an apology on the House floor. By late afternoon Tuesday, there was no indication whether that would occur.“It was the act of a bully, of a person who is the antithesis of the person we are honoring this week, John Lewis,” said Hoyer, referring to the Georgia Democrat and civil rights hero who died Friday. He said Yoho’s action was “despicable conduct and it needs to be sanctioned.″Other congressional Democrats swarmed to Ocasio-Cortez’s defense on Twitter.Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a member of the “Squad” of first-term congresswomen of color, wrote that Yoho had “perpetuated” the problem of violence against women with his “sexist verbal attack.”Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., tweeted that he, too, believes poverty can cause crime and said, “Wonder why Rep. Yoho hasn’t accosted me on the Capitol steps with the same sentiment?”___Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apology-demanded-from-gop-lawmaker-for-ocasio-cortez-remark/story-yekkDoXoAjcvwr2R7VDIJP.html
22-07-2020||World||Donald Trump says Covid-19 in US will get worse before it gets better||President Donald Trump warned on Tuesday that the “nasty horrible’” coronavirus will get worse in the U.S. before it gets better, but he also tried to paint a rosy picture of efforts to conquer the disease that has claimed more than 140,000 American lives in just five months.He also professed a newfound respect for the protective face masks he has seldom worn. He pulled one from his pocket in the White House briefing room but didn’t put it on.After a three-month hiatus from his freewheeling daily virus briefings, Trump returned to the podium, keeping the stage to himself without the public health experts who were staples of his previous events but keeping close to scripted remarks prepared by aides.Besides declaring support for masks as a way to fight the pandemic, he admonished young people against crowding bars and spreading the disease.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt all marked a delayed recognition by Trump that the economic reopening he’s been championing since April — and, more importantly, his reelection — were imperiled by spiking cases nationwide.There were no guarantees how long Trump’s more measured tone, delivered with an eye to halting a campaign-season erosion of support, would last. Along the way Tuesday, the president still worked in jabs at the news media and Democrats for focusing on disease-fighting shortcomings in the U.S. as the rest of world also struggles with the virus. He also belatedly addressed bipartisan criticism of virus-testing delays that have hampered reopening plans.“It will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better,” Trump said from the White House. But he also touted a reduction in deaths and progress on vaccines and treatments for Covid-19, which he referred to repeatedly as a the “China virus.” He continued his recent encouragement of Americans to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.“Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact,” he said. “I’m getting used to the mask,” he added, pulling one out after months of suggesting that mask-wearing was a political statement against him.Swaths of the country are now battling rising infections and growing deaths, and some states are once again having to close businesses and rethink school in the fall. Many retailers themselves are insisting their customers don masks.For months, the nation’s top health experts have pleaded with Americans to wear masks in public and steer clear of crowds -- calling those simple steps life-saving -- even as the president’s stance fueled a partisan social divide.The early evening show at the White House came as the next stage of the federal government’s response to the pandemic was being crafted on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers and White House officials were opening negotiations on a trillion-dollar-or-more “phase four” rescue package.For weeks, White House aides have pressed Trump to grow more disciplined in his public statements about the pandemic. On Tuesday, he steered clear of what has been a favored talking point: that widespread testing for the virus in the U.S. “created” more cases, as aides noted that was false and projected a lack of responsibility.Little more than three months from Election Day, Trump and his political team hoped that the podium spotlight would give him an edge against Democratic rival Joe Biden.“The vaccines are coming, and they’re coming a lot sooner than anybody thought possible,” Trump promised anew.As early as next week, the first possible U.S. vaccine is set to begin final-stage testing in a study of 30,000 people to see if it really is safe and effective. A few other vaccines have begun smaller late-stage studies in other countries, and in the U.S. a series of huge studies are planned to start each month through fall in hopes of, eventually, having several vaccines to use. Already, people can start signing up to volunteer for the different studies.Health authorities warn there’s no guarantee -- it’s not unusual for vaccines to fail during this critical testing step. But vaccine makers and health officials are hopeful that at least one vaccine could prove to work by year’s end. Companies already are taking the unusual step of brewing hundreds of millions of doses so that mass vaccinations could begin if the Food and Drug Administration signs off.Trump also acknowledged bipartisan criticism of delays processing testing results.“We’ll be able to get those numbers down,” Trump said, saying his administration was working to improve the availability of rapid, point-of-care tests like those used to protect him at the White House.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told NPR Tuesday that he was glad Trump has begun to promote mask-wearing.“If we, during those conferences, come out and have consistent, clear, noncontradictory messages, I believe it will be very helpful in getting people on the track of knowing the direction that we need to go to get this pandemic under control,” he said.Biden, for his part Tuesday, launched into scathing criticism of Trump as he outlined the latest plank of his economic recovery plan, charging that Trump “failed his most important test as an American President: the duty to care for you, for all of us.”“He’s quit on you, he’s quit on this country,” Biden said.Earlier Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to claim that “by comparison to most other countries, who are suffering greatly, we are doing very well — and we have done things that few other countries could have done!”In fact, the U.S. leads the world in confirmed cases and deaths from the virus -- and ranks near the top on a per capita basis as well.On Capitol Hill, some Republicans have broken with the White House in seeking additional federal funding for testing and contact-tracing in the next relief bill.Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, in a news conference, encouraged White House aides to “keep Trump away from the podium,” calling the president “a threat to public health.”Trump’s daily turns in the White House briefing room largely ended in late April after the president’s widely derided suggestion that injecting toxic disinfectant could help treat the coronavirus. The comment prompted widespread medical warnings against the potentially deadly move.Scrapping the briefings was welcomed by aides who believed they were dragging down the president’s poll numbers, particularly with older voters. However, with his trademark rallies largely on hold because of the coronavirus, the view in Trump’s circle is that he needs an alternate means to reach voters.And Trump missed the days when he would dominate cable television ratings with his early evening briefings. Tellingly, when he announced Monday that the sessions could return, he did so with an eye toward their time slot and a boast about ratings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-covid-19-in-us-will-get-worse-before-it-gets-better/story-I1uen0T1TAngumZqsufXlN.html
22-07-2020||World||Covid-19 outbreak reported at Texas federal medical prison||More than 500 women at a federal medical prison in Texas have tested positive for the coronavirus, in one of the largest confirmed outbreaks at a federal prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.The number of confirmed cases at the Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Fort Worth jumped to 510 on Tuesday, just two days after the Bureau of Prisons reported that 200 women there had tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Only the federal prison in Seagoville, also located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, had more infected inmates, with 1,156 cases as of Tuesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We’re like a whole bunch of hamsters in a cage chasing our own tails,” said Carswell inmate Holli Chapman.Three weeks ago, the prison had reported only three confirmed cases of the virus among inmates. One prisoner, Andrea Circle Bear, died in April. On July 12, 69-year-old Sandra Kincaid became the second woman to die there from the virus.FMC-Carswell holds female inmates with medical and mental health issues. It currently has 1,357 prisoners. Since April, many inmates have told the newspaper they were concerned the virus could spread through the prison.One of the inmates who has tested positive for the virus is Reality Winner, a former government contractor who is serving a five-year prison sentence after she pleaded guilty to mailing a classified report to a news organization.Carswell’s administration directed questions to the Bureau of Prisons. The agency said in a statement that it is taking precautions to stem the virus’ spread.“As with any type of emergency situation, we carefully assess how to best ensure the safety of staff, inmates and the public,” the agency said. “All of our facilities are implementing the BOP’s guidance on mitigating the spread of Covid-19.”Last week, several women at Carswell told the Star-Telegram that the facility did not have enough sanitizing supplies or protective equipment. The woman also noted that cells are not immediately cleaned after someone tests positive. Inmate Sandra Shoulders said mattresses used by women who have tested positive are piled up in a TV room.“We feel basically abandoned,” she said. “(Officers) are saying they’re doing all this stuff for us, that they’re in here with us. But they’re not the ones in 24-hour quarantine, left in a 6-by-6 cell with three other people with 10 minute showers, 10 minutes to be on the phone or email to communicate with their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-reported-at-texas-federal-medical-prison/story-QzxZXCj3xIseJVHEMzkSRP.html
22-07-2020||World||Next coronavirus aid package could easily swell past $1 trillion||The price tag for the next Covid-19 aid package could quickly swell above $1 trillion as White House negotiators negotiate with Congress over money to reopen schools, prop up small businesses, boost virus testing and keep cash flowing to Americans while the virus crisis deepens in the U.S.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday promised a new round of direct payments to earners below a certain income level, similar to the $1,200 checks sent in the spring. President Donald Trump insists on a payroll tax holiday for workers. And Democrats want billions to outfit schools and shore up local governments.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and acting chief of staff Mark Meadows conferred privately with GOP senators before preparing to meet with House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Trump’s team is trying to broker a compromise between the GOP’s emerging $1 trillion proposal with the House’s more sweeping $3 trillion bill.Meadows told reporters the president wants to ensure the funding package “meets the legitimate needs that are before the American people.”With the pandemic showing no signs of easing, officials acknowledge the daunting challenge of trying to contain the coronavirus and prevent further economic distress. The U.S. has rising infections and a death toll of 140,800, more than anywhere else in the world. The health crisis is worsening just as emergency aid is about to expire.McConnell said Washington must develop a strategy to safely reopen schools and businesses until a vaccine can be found.“We need to carve out a new normal,” the Republican leader said.McConnell is poised to roll out the $1 trillion GOP proposal, a counter-offer to Pelosi’s $3 trillion House-passed plan as they race to strike a deal by the end of the month. That’s when a $600 weekly unemployment benefits boost and other aid, including a federal rental moratorium on millions of apartment units, expires.Also read: Mike Pompeo urges ‘entire world’ to stand up to ChinaMcConnell’s package wold send a fresh round of direct cash payments to Americans below a certain income level, likely $75,000 for singles, extend small business loans under the Paycheck Protection Program and create a five-year liability shield against what he warns is a potential “epidemic” of coronavirus lawsuits.It’s also expected to include at least $70 billion to help schools reopen and $25 billion in virus testing funds. Republicans want to replace the $600 weekly federal jobless benefit with a lower amount, to prevent the unemployed from receiving more aid than they would through a normal paycheck, Republicans said.But the president’s priorities are splitting his GOP allies in Congress giving momentum to Democrats as talks are underway.Trump wants a full repeal of the 15.3% payroll tax, which is split among employers and employees, and funds Social Security and Medicare. Experts say that alone would cost $600 billion. At a White House meeting on Monday, GOP leaders told Trump they preferred to include only a partial payroll tax cut.Also read: US accuses Chinese hackers of seeking to steal Covid-19 vaccine researchEasing the payroll tax is dividing Trump’s party because it does little to help out-of-work Americans and adds to the debt load. The tax is already being deferred for employers under the previous virus relief package. Supporters say cutting it now for employees would put money in people’s pockets and stimulate the economy.GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas was among several Republicans saying he’s “not a fan” of a payroll tax holiday.The administration also panned the push for more virus testing money, saying earlier allotments remain unspent.Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Health committee, said, “All roads to opening school, going back to work, opening child care lead through testing.”White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday the administration wants “targeted” funds for the next round of aid, rather than adding more to the existing pot. She said no one is holding up the money.Senate Democrats began investigating why the Trump administration has left almost half the testing money unspent.Democrats broadly dismissed the emerging GOP plan as favoring corporate interests over America’s working families. Schumer warned of repeating mistakes of spring when Trump pushed for states to ease stay-home orders and reopen.“That will not - will not - get the job done,” Schumer said.House Democrats have approved $100 billion as an education stabilization fund and Senate Democrats are seeking even more, $430 billion for schools and universities to re-open — with money for spacing students apart, buying masks for daily use and alternating bus schedules.The political stakes are high for both parties before the November election, and even more so for the nation, as the virus crisis and economic fallout hits cities large and small.Joe Biden, the Democrats’ presumed presidential nominee, stated his own priorities. The new package should “deliver a lifeline to those who need it most: working families and small businesses,” he said.After insisting in an interview Sunday that the virus would simply “ disappear,” Trump on Monday acknowledged a “big flareup” of Covid-19 cases. He announced plans to relaunch his daily televised briefings.But Trump’s focus on therapeutics and a vaccine is falling flat on Capitol Hill as lawmakers understand any Covid-19 cures remain months, if not a year, from widespread distribution in the U.S. The federal government is still struggling to provide basic medical supplies and personal protective equipment to hospitals and health care providers.Mnuchin vowed to stay on Capitol Hill for the next two weeks, determined to reach a deal by month’s end.The proposed virus aid package would be the fifth, following the $2.2 trillion bill passed in March, the largest U.S. intervention of its kind. The jobless rate has remained in double digits, higher than in the last decade’s Great Recession, and a federal eviction moratorium on millions of rental units approved in the last bill is about to expire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/next-coronavirus-aid-package-could-easily-swell-past-1-trillion/story-uWghXOX98hvJjsbI1jAfhP.html

22-07-2020||World||Pakistani journalist Matiullah Jan ‘abducted’ a day before court appearance||The Islamabad High Court has ordered the relevant authorities to produce abducted journalist Matiullah Jan before it on Wednesday morning, local media reported on Tuesday. Jan was kidnapped from outside a local school on Tuesday morning, one day before he was to appear before Pakistan’s Supreme Court on a contempt of court notice.Camera footage of the incident shows that Jan’s abductors included plainclothesmen as well as uniformed policemen who were travelling in four cars. Soon after Matiullah Jan dropped his wife outside the government school in Islamabad, the camera shows cars encircling his car and taking the journalist into custody.Earlier, Jan, who is no stranger to controversy, was summoned over an alleged tweet against judges and the judiciary. A three-member bench of the apex court headed by the chief justice is hearing the case. The court in its contempt notice stated that Matiullah Jan in a tweet from his Twitter account on July 10 apparently used painful words against judges and the judiciary.Last week, Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah dismissed another contempt application against Matiullah Jan, saying that the dignity of independent judges “is not so fragile and it can’t be harmed by a tweet.”In the court order, Justice Minalla noted: “The dignity of a judge or a court is not dependent or resorting to the law of contempt. The judgments of a judge and the latter’s conduct is the measure of his or her integrity and independence.”A number of journalists have voiced concern about the safety of the Islamabad-based reporter.Journalists Aima Khosa in a tweet on Tuesday said that Matiuallah Jan has been taken off the air, pushed into legal cases and now abducted. “It appears there is a concerted effort to silence him,” she tweeted.In 2017, Matiullah Jan was attacked in Islamabad. However, he escaped unhurt. He was travelling from Islamabad with his children when two motorcyclists coming from the opposite side of the road threw a rock and smashed the windscreen of his car.Prior to that incident, he said he was chased by another car at night and his windscreen was smashed in a similar way. Those days, he said, he was working on a story along with another journalist who had also been attacked in the same fashion around the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-journalist-matiullah-jan-goes-missing-wife-claims-abduction/story-MjIIMdWl4jFWfidQkfS57M.html
