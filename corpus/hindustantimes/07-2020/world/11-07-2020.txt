Just a few weeks after arriving in Vietnam in early February for a new role with the national carrier, Cameron spent an evening at the popular “Buddha Bar” in Ho Chi Minh City. He tested positive days later, on March 18, for Covid-19.Known as Patient 91, Cameron became the focus of huge media attention as the country’s top medical minds met to brainstorm treatment options.The news that he would need a lung transplant was met with 59 donation offers, according to the health ministry.But after waking from a coma at the end of May, there were small signs of improvement -- a thumbs-up sign for an attentive doctor, a trip on to the balcony to catch some sunshine and a video of him holding a Motherwell Football Club scarf aloft. Every step towards recovery made headlines.Finally on Saturday -- as state media said his treatment bill had reached at least $150,000 -- he was well enough to catch a special repatriation flight to London, accompanied by three doctors, state media added. His return home comes as Vietnam celebrated 85 days with no community transmission of the coronavirus.The country has just 370 virus confirmed cases and zero deaths, but its borders remain largely shut. More than 10,000 people are currently in mandatory quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pilot-to-fly-home-after-4-month-coronavirus-battle-in-vietnam/story-fSLnPvIHSXo6iYineaO55J.html
11-07-2020||World||Veteran BBC broadcaster Kailash Budhwar passes away||Kailash Budhwar, who had a distinguished career in BBC in London since 1969, became the first Indian to head any BBC section in 1979 and mentored a generation of journalists over the decades, has died aged 88, his former colleagues said. Hailing from Kanpur, Budhwar was the head of the BBC’s Hindi service and a prominent figure among listeners in India and the UK. A theatre buff, Budhwar was described by colleagues as an inspiring presence in the newsroom.Vijay Rana, senior journalist who worked with Budhwar from 1982-1992, said: “Sitting with him was an education in itself. He became very popular among listeners in India due his factual reporting during the Emergency. He was a doyen of Hindi journalism”.Speaking to Hindustan Times in 2016 on changes in Fleet Street over the years, he said an Indian journalist in a leading role in London was such a novelty in the 1970s that when he was appointed the first Indian head of any BBC section in Bush House in 1979, it became national news.Also read | Stop press: India never far from romance of Fleet Street“There was no space for us Indians on Fleet Street. The BBC in fact held a press conference to announce my appointment as the head of Hindi service, it was reported widely. Until then, Indians were only contributors, not at the top editorial level,” he had said.Budhwar, who retired from BBC in 1992, was a prominent figure in Indian community circles, striving to uphold Indian perspectives in BBC news discourse in relation to anti-India elements based in the UK, and attending independence day and other events of the Indian high commission.Budhwar leaves behind wife Binodini, three daughters and one son.Budhwar often oversaw elections of the Indian Journalists Association (established May 1947), besides actively participating in its engagements.IJA president Rupanjana Dutta said: “He was one of our most prominent and senior members. We remember him as an ever-smiling and pleasant person, often regarded as a beacon of knowledge. It is a great loss for IJA today”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/veteran-bbc-broadcaster-kailash-budhwar-passed-away/story-B3FFU6RLTuu5Ke7XwwcNNK.html
11-07-2020||World||Donald Trump working on merit-based immigration order, and DACA||The White House on Friday said President Donald Trump was working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system and offer a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, without offering them amnesty.The president has been pushing for a merit-based immigration system which offers US citizenship on the basis of the applicants qualifications and skills, in order to benefit the country, and less through familial connections, which currently account for roughly half of the 1 million Green Cards given annually. First lady Melania Trump’s parents were among millions who have benefited from family-based immigration, which the president has derisively called “chain migration”.No details were forthcoming, or the timeline.The White House statement came after President Trump told Telemundo, a Spanish-language TV channel, he was working on an executive order that would include provisions for DACA — the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the 2012 Obama-era protection from their deportation.“I’m going to do a big executive order. ... And I’m going to make DACA a part of it,” Trump said. “We’re going to have a road to citizenship.”There are an estimated 644,000 undocumented immigrants in this category, also called DREAMERs, including at least 2,500 from India.A White House spokesperson said, “As the President announced today, he is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system to further protect US workers.”On DACA, the spokesperson said the president was willing to work with congress to find “a negotiated legislative solution to DACA, one that could include citizenship, along with strong border security and permanent merit-based reforms”.“This does not include amnesty,” the spokesperson added.The Trump administration has been trying to rescind the Obama-era protections and its most recent attempt — an order from the Department of Homeland Security — went up to the Supreme Court, where it was rejected by justices who called it “arbitrary and capricious”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-working-on-merit-based-immigration-order-and-daca/story-NZpEiQVkUXhFyi2ClAqYGM.html
11-07-2020||World||Indian heritage in UK: 4 centuries of priceless art with royal family on display||Priceless paintings and manuscripts from India gathered as gifts and other acquisitions during centuries of British engagement will be on display at a unique exhibition in Edinburgh from July 23 to January 21, the Royal Collection Trust said on Friday.Held in the Royal Library in Windsor Castle, the Royal Collection contains one of the finest south Asian paintings and manuscripts in the world, including the Mughal era ‘Padshahnama’, Tipu Sultan’s Quran and the story of Prahlada from the Bhagavata Purana, 1775–90, by the Nainsukh family workshop.Most of the items will be on display for the first time in Scotland in the Queen’s Gallery in the Palace of Holyroodhouse in the exhibition titled ‘Eastern Encounters: Four Centuries of Paintings and Manuscripts from the Indian Subcontinent’.“Tracing more than 400 years of literary and artistic output, the exhibition offers new insights into the shared history of the British monarchy and the Indian sub-continent”, the trust said.The items include those from the beginning of the British engagement with India, with the formation of the East India Company in 1600. The 17th century was a period of instability for the British monarchy, but in south Asia the Mughal empire was at its zenith, richer and stronger than any European power, the trust noted.It said: “The extraordinary splendour of the Mughal court was captured by artists in intricate paintings and manuscripts. George III was given a number of these magnificent works, forming one of the greatest collections of South Asian works on paper outside the subcontinent”.“In 1798, Lord Teignmouth, Governor-General of India, presented the King with six volumes as gifts from the Nawab of Awadh. Among these was the mid-17th-century Padshahnama (‘Book of Emperors’), an illustrated chronicle commissioned by the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah-Jahan as a celebration of his reign and dynasty, described by Teignmouth as ‘the most splendid’ Mughal manuscript he ever saw”.The rise of the East India Company was reflected in the gifts of manuscripts presented to successive British monarchs on behalf of the company and by company officers.Detailed architectural drawings were commissioned from local draughtsmen by Colin MacKenzie, the Scottish Surveyor-General of the Company. A pen and ink drawing from 1800 shows an elevation of the temple at Srirangam, one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites in India.The collection includes a posthumous portrait of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Punjab, 1842, was sent to Queen Victoria by his successor, Sher Singh, in an unusual jewel-encrusted gold frame with a letter of belated congratulations on her marriage and the birth of her first son.It will be displayed in the exhibition alongside a sketch of his son, Maharaja Duleep Singh, by Queen Victoria. She received many books written about or dedicated to her from India, including a volume of her own published journals, The Queen’s Travels in Scotland and Ireland, translated into Hindi by the Maharajah of Benares. During Queen Mary’s visit to India in the early 20th century, she acquired numerous works of art, including Queen Tissarakshita, 1911, by Abanindranath Tagore, founder of the Bengal School of Art, and several Pahari paintings, which will also be on display.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-heritage-in-uk-4-centuries-of-priceless-art-with-royal-family-on-display/story-BfZH5A9d3e7BWDoYyjBTHO.html
11-07-2020||World||WHO urges aggressive virus measures as flare-ups spark new closures||The World Health Organization has urged countries grappling with coronavirus to step up control measures, saying it is still possible to rein it in, as some nations clamp fresh restrictions on citizens.With case numbers worldwide more than doubling in the past six weeks, Uzbekistan on Friday returned to lockdown and Hong Kong said schools would close from Monday after the city recorded “exponential growth” in locally transmitted infections.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on countries to adopt an aggressive approach, highlighting Italy, Spain, South Korea and India’s biggest slum to show it was possible to stop the spread, no matter how bad the outbreak.The health agency’s comments came as US President Donald Trump was forced to cancel an election rally in New Hampshire, citing an approaching storm.Trump has pushed to hold large gatherings against health advice as epidemiologists warn of the dangers posed by the virus moving through the air in crowded and confined spaces.- Lashing out at China -On a visit to Florida on Friday, Trump hit out at Beijing over the pandemic.“(The) relationship with China has been severely damaged. They could have stopped the plague.... They didn’t stop it,” he told reporters.The virus has killed at least 556,140 people worldwide since it emerged in China last December.More than 12.3 million cases have been registered in 196 countries and territories, triggering massive economic damage.The United States, the country worst hit by the illness, reported almost 64,000 new cases Friday and the death toll now stands at just under 134,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.Brazil, the second-hardest hit, surpassed 70,000 deaths and reported 45,000 new infections, the health ministry said.In Uzbekistan, citizens were from Friday facing lockdown restrictions again that were originally imposed in March but lifted gradually over the past two months.The Central Asian country’s return to confinement followed a decision by Australia to lock down its second-biggest city Melbourne from Thursday.A police officer manning a checkpoint on the outskirts of the former Soviet republic’s capital said only drivers with “a good reason” to enter Tashkent -- such as delivering food or other vital supplies -- could pass.Restaurants, gyms, swimming pools and non-food markets have all shut their doors until at least August 1.Private transport within cities will be limited to morning and early evening journeys and essential purposes such as travelling to work and purchasing food or medicine.In Hong Kong, the spike marks a setback for the city after daily life had largely returned to normal with restaurants and bars resuming regular business and cultural attractions reopening.Despite being right next to mainland China where the virus first emerged, the city had managed to quash local transmission in recent months.But new clusters have started to emerge since Tuesday, including at an elderly care home that reported at least 32 cases and a housing estate with 11.- ‘Turn this pandemic around’ -“Across all walks of life, we are all being tested to the limit,” the WHO’s Tedros told a virtual news conference in Geneva.“From countries where there is exponential growth, to places that are loosening restrictions and now starting to see cases rise.“Only aggressive action combined with national unity and global solidarity can turn this pandemic around,” he said.Elsewhere, French officials warned of rising cases in metropolitan France as the death toll topped 30,000.In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted a decision to allow businesses, including bars and event spaces, to reopen may have been made “too soon”.The Middle Eastern country recorded its highest number of infections over a 24-hour period, at nearly 1,500.In Australia, meanwhile, authorities said they would slash by half the number of people allowed to return from overseas.From Monday, only 4,000 Australian citizens or permanent residents will be permitted to enter each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-urges-aggressive-virus-measures-as-flare-ups-spark-new-closures/story-7yInexwOIxl7BaagpHAndL.html
11-07-2020||World||In India-China crisis, an India-US bonanza in view||A border clash has plunged ties between India and China to their lowest point in decades. But one beneficiary looks clear -- the US-India relationship.Experts say India could finally end equivocation about openly aligning itself with the long-eager United States, although there will still be disagreements -- which, paradoxically, are now mostly due to Washington.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that China “took incredibly aggressive action” in a hand-to-hand battle in the remote Himalayas on June 15 that killed 20 Indian soldiers.The hawkish Pompeo characterized the violence as part of a broader strategy by Beijing to challenge all of its neighbors.Jeff M. Smith, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has written a book on the India-China rivalry, said the United States is known to offer border intelligence to India, which is now likely to pick up the pace on defense acquisitions.But Smith said that India has asked the United States to be publicly circumspect -- in part to show the domestic audience that New Delhi does not need help.India also does not want “to feed Chinese propaganda narratives that this is all a component of the China-US rivalry and that India is working at America’s behest,” Smith said.Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, cautioned that neither India nor China wanted a complete rupture and said that both still saw some common interests, especially in international organizations.“But make no mistake: This current India-China crisis is a watershed for the geopolitics of Asia, and the US-India relationship will be one of the main beneficiaries,” he said.“Previous Indian concern about antagonizing China if it moves closer to the US is starting to melt away.”- ‘Transactional’ ties -The United States has been seeking warmer ties since the 1990s with India, which insisted during the Cold War on being “non-aligned” on the global stage.President Donald Trump has appeared to form a bond with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow nationalist who warns of the threat of radical Islam, and the pair have held two joint mega-rallies.But Trump, his eyes at home ahead of elections, has also taken action detrimental to India, including last year kicking it out of a preferential trade status under which it had exported billions of dollars in goods.Trump, citing the coronavirus pandemic, more recently has suspended high-tech visas and threatened to expel international students, moves with significant impacts on Indians.India is happy to see Trump’s tougher stances on China as well as historic adversary Pakistan but also feels demands, especially on trade, said Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia.“It is a semi-transactional relationship. It is not a strategic relationship, as it was in earlier years,” she said.Trump, who has frequently sparred with Western allies, may not even want a more committed relationship with India, she said.“I wouldn’t say there is as much reluctance on the Indian side. That has calmed down,” Pande said.“The two are closer than they have ever been. But are the two ready to take that extra step?”- Warmth regardless of election -In another recent shift, US lawmakers, mostly Democrats, have openly criticized India on human rights, including Modi’s revocation of autonomy and controls on the internet in Muslim-majority Kashmir.Anthony Blinken, a close aide to presidential candidate Joe Biden, said that the Democrat, if he defeats Trump, would seek to “strengthen and deepen” the relationship with India. But Blinken shared concerns on freedoms.“You’re always better engaging with a partner, and a vitally important one like India, when you can speak frankly and directly about areas where you have differences,” Blinken said at the Hudson Institute.Trump has stayed mum on rights and has offered, with little detail, to mediate between India and China.But John Bolton, Trump’s former national security advisor who recently published an explosive memoir, doubted Trump understood the border situation.“He may have been briefed on it, but history doesn’t really stick with him,” Bolton told Indian news channel WION.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-india-china-crisis-an-india-us-bonanza-in-view/story-XkAm8LwamHujaH4RaZVdkL.html
11-07-2020||World||Coronavirus, jobs and economy: Fact-checking Donald Trump’s tweets and claims||If saying things 100 times could make them true, President Donald Trump’s account of how the U.S. is doing with the coronavirus would be true.Covid-19 testing would be the envy of the world, the economy would be on the cusp of roaring back, the threat would be receding in a pandemic that has sickened more than 3.1 million Americans and killed more than 133,000.But repetition doesn’t make for reality. The U.S. is taking a disproportionate hit from the coronavirus globally and does not have it under control.A look at how rhetoric from the past week compares with the facts on various fronts:VIRUSTRUMP: “For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven’t done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!” — tweet Thursday.THE FACTS: His notion that infections are high only because the U.S. diagnostic testing has increased is false. His own top public health officials have shot down this line of thinking. Infections are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down.It’s true that increased testing also contributes to the higher numbers. When you look harder, you’re going to see more. But the testing has uncovered a worrisome trend: The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country.That’s a clear demonstration that sickness is spreading and that the U.S. testing system is falling short.“A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,” says the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic.Americans are being confronted with long lines at testing sites, often disqualified if they are not showing symptoms and, if tested, forced to wait many days for results.___TRUMP on the coronavirus: “We have the lowest Mortality Rate in the World.” – tweet Tuesday.THE FACTS: This statement is wholly unsupported.An accurate death rate is impossible to know. Every country tests and counts people differently, and some are unreliable in reporting cases. Without knowing the true number of people who become infected, it cannot be determined what portion of them die.Using a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, you can compare the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases. That count shows the U.S. experiencing more deaths as a percentage of cases than most other countries now being hit hard with the pandemic. The statistics look better for the U.S. when the list is expanded to include European countries that were slammed early on by the virus but now appear to have it under control. Even then, the U.S. is not shown to be among the best in avoiding death.Such calculations, though, do not provide a reliable measurement of actual death rates, because of the variations in testing and reporting, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not meant to be such a measure.The only way to tell how many cases have gone uncounted, and therefore what percentage of infected people have died from the disease, is to do another kind of test comprehensively, of people’s blood, to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus. Globally, that is only being done in select places.___TRUMP: “Deaths in the U.S. are way down.” — tweet Monday, one of at least a half dozen heralding a drop in daily deaths from the virus.THE FACTS: It’s true that deaths dipped even as infections spiked in many parts of the country. But deaths lag sickness and the spikes have not played out.“It’s a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday. He advised Americans: “Don’t get yourself into false complacency.”___ECONOMYTRUMP: “Job growth is biggest in history.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Yes, but only because it is following the greatest job losses in history, by far.The U.S. economy shed more than 22 million jobs in March and April, wiping out nearly a decade of job growth in just two months, as the viral outbreak intensified and nearly all states shut down nonessential businesses. Since then, 7.5 million, or about one-third, of those jobs have been recovered as businesses reopened. Even after those gains, the unemployment rate is 11.1%, down from April and May but otherwise higher than at any point since the Depression.___TRUMP: “Economy and Jobs are growing MUCH faster than anyone (except me!) expected.” — tweet Wednesday.THE FACTS: Not really. It’s true that May’s gain of 2.7 million jobs was unexpected. Economists had forecast another month of job losses. But most economists projected hiring would sharply rebound by June or at the latest July, once businesses began to reopen. The gains kicked in a month earlier than forecast.Now, though, coronavirus cases are rising in most states, imperiling the climb back. In six states representing one-third of the economy — Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, and Texas — governors are reversing their reopening plans, and the restart is on pause in 15 other states. Such reversals are keeping layoffs elevated and threatening to weaken hiring.___TRUMP ON BIDENTRUMP campaign ad, playing out a scenario where a person needing help calls the police in a Biden presidency and gets a voice recording: “You have reached the 911 police emergency line. Due to defunding of the police department, we’re sorry but no one is here to take your call.” The ad closes with the message: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”THE FACTS: Biden has not joined the call of protesters who demanded “defund the police” after Floyd’s killing. He’s proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.“I don’t support defunding the police,“ Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support tying federal aid to police based on whether “they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.”Biden’s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for “training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths” and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve.Specifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs.That adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement.Biden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime.Democrats, meanwhile, have pointed to Trump’s repeated proposals in the administration’s budget to cut community policing and mediation programs at the Justice Department. Congressional Republicans say the program can be effectively merged with other divisions, but Democrats have repeatedly blocked the effort. The program has been used to help provide federal oversight of local police departments.Despite proposed cuts, Attorney General William Barr last month said that the department would use the COPS program funding to hire over 2,700 police officers at nearly 600 departments across the country.___REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE email: “In the wake of rioting, looting, and tragic murders ripping apart communities across the country, Joe Biden said ‘Yes, absolutely’ he wants to defund the police.” — email Wednesday from Steve Guest, RNC’s rapid response director.THE FACTS: That’s misleading, a selective use of Biden’s words on the subject.The email links to an excerpted video clip of Biden’s conversation with liberal activist Ady Barkan, who endorsed Biden on Wednesday after supporting Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries. A full recording of that conversation, provided by the Biden campaign to The Associated Press, shows he again declined to support defunding police,Barkan raises the issue of police reform and asks whether Biden would funnel money into social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing to help reduce civilian interactions with police.Biden responds that he is calling for increased funding for mental health providers but “that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police” and that both approaches are needed, including more money for community police.Asked again by Barkan, “so we agree that we can redirect some of the funding,” Biden then answers “absolutely yes.”Biden then gives the caveat that he means “not just redirect” federal money potentially but “condition” it on police improvements.“If they don’t eliminate choke holds, they don’t get (federal) grants, if they don’t do the following, they don’t get any help,” Biden replied.“The vast majority of all police departments are funded by the locality, funded by the municipality, funded by the state,” he added. “It’s only the federal government comes in on top of that, and so it says you want help, you have to do the following reforms,.”___BIDEN ON TRUMPBIDEN: “President Trump claimed to the American people that he was a wartime leader, but instead of taking responsibility, Trump has waved a white flag, revealing that he ordered the slowing of testing and having his administration tell Americans that they simply need to ‘live with it.’’ – statement Wednesday marking the rise in U.S. coronavirus infections to more than 3 million.THE FACTS: To be clear, the government did not slow testing on the orders of the president.Trump at first denied he was joking when he told a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally on June 20 that he said “to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please’“ because “they test and they test.” Days later he said he didn’t really mean it.In any event, a succession of his public-health officials testified to Congress that the president never asked them to slow testing and that they were doing all they could to increase it. But testing remains markedly insufficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-jobs-and-economy-fact-checking-donald-trump-s-tweets-and-claims/story-32tCrNKRnB5JsvpxMje0NL.html
11-07-2020||World||Dozens of US Marines in Japan’s Okinawa get coronavirus||Dozens of U.S. Marines have been infected with the coronavirus at two bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa in what is feared to be a massive outbreak, Okinawan officials said Saturday, demanding an adequate explanation from the U.S. military.Okinawa prefectural officials said they could say only that a “few dozen” cases had been found recently because the U.S. military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps. Air Station Futenma, which is at the center of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Okinawan officials said.Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.“Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the U.S. military),” Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki told a news conference. He questioned disease prevention measures taken by the U.S. military and renewed his demand for transparency regarding the latest development.Okinawan officials asked the U.S. military on Friday to provide the number of cases and other details in order to address growing concerns among local residents, Tamaki said.The Marines said in a statement Friday that the troops were taking additional protective measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus and were restricting off-base activities. The statement said measures are “to protect our forces, our families, and the local community,” without providing details on the infections.Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, and the residents are sensitive to U.S. base-related problems. Many Okinawans have long complained about pollution, noise and crime related to U.S. bases.Okinawans also oppose a planned relocation of the Futenma air base from the current site in a densely populated area in the south to a less populated area on the east coast.Local media reported that the Okinawan assembly adopted a resolution Friday protesting the U.S. military’s lack of transparency about its outbreak on base, and that local officials were considering demanding shutdowns of Futenma and Camp Hansen.Okinawa has about 150 cases of the coronavirus. In all, Japan has about 21,000 cases and 1,000 deaths, with Tokyo reporting more than 200 new cases for a third straight day Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-us-marines-in-japan-s-okinawa-get-coronavirus/story-rc99e72UNCpJ9jpoGoxprN.html
11-07-2020||World||Coronavirus cases up sharply in Africa, India as inequality stings||South Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases have doubled in two weeks to a quarter-million, and India on Saturday saw its biggest daily spike as its total passed 800,000. Inequality concerns are growing as health workers seek better protection while some among the rich are hoarding equipment at home.Globally more than 12 million people have been infected by the virus, according to data compiled by the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. More than a half-million have died. Shortages of testing materials and poor data collection in some countries mean the true numbers are unknown.Some of the worst-affected nations are among the world’s most unequal. South Africa leads them all, with the pandemic exposing the gap in care.In Johannesburg at South Africa’s epicenter, badly-needed oxygen concentrators, which help people with Covid-19 breathe, are hard to find as private businesses and individuals are buying them up, a public health specialist volunteering at a field hospital, Lynne Wilkinson, told The Associated Press.Meanwhile South Africa’s struggling public hospitals are short on medical oxygen — and they are now seeing a higher proportion of deaths than in private ones, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases says.South Africa now has more than 250,000 confirmed cases, including more than 3,800 deaths. To complicate matters, the country’s struggling power utility has announced new electricity cuts in the dead of winter as a cold front brings freezing weather. Many of the urban poor live in shacks of scrap metal and wood.And in Kenya, some have been outraged by a local newspaper report citing sources as saying several governors have installed intensive care unit equipment in their homes. The country lost its first doctor to Covid-19 this week.“The welfare, occupational safety & health of frontline workers is a non-negotiable minimum!!” the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union tweeted after her death. On Saturday, the union and other medical groups called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to implement a promised compensation package to ease the “anxiety and fear that has now gripped health care workers.”More than 8,000 health workers across Africa have been infected, half of them in South Africa. The continent of 1.3 billion has the world’s lowest levels of health staffing and more than 550,000 cases, and the pandemic is reaching “full speed,” the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.Many parts of the world are now struggling with trying to reopen their economies and facing a fresh wave of infections.In India, which reported a new daily high of 27,114 cases Saturday, nearly a dozen states have imposed a partial lockdown in high-risk areas. A surge in infections saw cases jumping from 600,000 to more than 800,000 in nine days.

Doctors and researchers who had been openly discussing the virus suddenly clammed up. Those from the city of Wuhan--which later would become the hub of the outbreak -- went silent and others were warned not to ask them details.The doctors said, ominously, “We cannot talk about it, but we need to wear masks,’“ Yan said. The numbers of human-to-human transmission cases then began to grow exponentially, according to her sources.Yan made the decision to leave. She packed her bags, sneaked past the censors and video cameras on campus, and boarded a Cathay Pacific flight to the United States, on April 28.She had her passport and her purse and was about to leave all of her loved ones behind. If she was caught, she knew she could be thrown in jail -- or, worse, rendered one of the “disappeared”.Yan, now in hiding, claims that the government in the country where she was born is trying to shred her reputation and accuses “government goons” of choreographing a cyber-attack against her in hopes of keeping her quiet.She divulged to the media that the Hong Kong government swarmed her hometown of Qingdao and that agents ripped apart her tiny apartment and questioned her parents. When she contacted her parents, they pleaded with her to come home, and told her that she did not know what she was talking about, and begged her to give up the fight.Yan believes her life is still in danger. She fears she can never go back to her home and lives with the hard truth that she will likely never see her friends or family there again. Still, she says, the risk is worth it.“The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid,” she told Fox News from an undisclosed location.She added that if she tried to tell her story in China, she “will be disappeared and killed”.Meanwhile, the University of Hong Kong has also taken down her page and apparently revoked access to her online portals and e-mails, even after she says that she was on an approved annual leave.In a statement to Fox News, a school spokesperson said that Yan is not currently an employee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virologist-who-fled-to-us-from-hong-kong-accuses-china-of-coronavirus-cover-up/story-GOG3ndRfM9PGHjqsNwp3lK.html

Many cities and counties around the state have recently reinstated restrictions that had been lifted in May, when cases seemed to drop.All of Disney’s Orlando parks closed in mid-March in an effort to stop the virus’s spread. Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando closed around the same time but reopened several weeks ago after instituting similar rules to protect employees and customers from the virus.Disney’s new rules include mandatory masks and social distancing. Visitors will need reservations to enter a park, and they won’t be allowed to hop between parks. Both visitors and employees will receive temperature checks when they enter. Fireworks shows and parades have been suspended to prevent drawing too many people together.Disney has been opening its parks back up around the globe for the past two months. In May, the company opened Disney Springs, a complex of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues in Lake Buena Vista.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masks-social-distancing-are-mandatory-disney-world-to-reopen-as-coronavirus-cases-surge-in-florida/story-hdQtoKT08hL3UDgr5MJneJ.html

With a premature reopening of the country and the oncoming winter, experts are concerned that the coronavirus will spread in the country unabated.The president has been fighting virus-related restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic, which he has called a “small flu”. The country is now a hotspot in Latin America and with more than 1.7 million registered cases since the pandemic began, Brazil is also the second-worst affected country in the world.“There is a false dichotomy between the economy and health,” Dr Leticia Kawano Dourado, a respiratory physician at Hospital do Coracao, Sao Paulo, tells HT. “Many cities have now reopened without fulfilling the WHO criteria for it.”ALSO READ | Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro tests positive for Covid-19WHO Americas director Carissa Etienne had warned in June, as Brazilian cities, including the capital, Brasilia, reopened that coronavirus cases Latin America had yet to peak, recommending that Brazil and other countries in the region continue strengthening social distancing and reopening of the economy be done slowly and carefully.The capital is now seeing an explosion of cases. It now has more infections per capita than any other major city in Brazil, with 2,133 confirmed cases per 100,000 people. That is more than two times higher than metropolitan Sao Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, according to health ministry statistics.“They’re reopening everything without a clear plan, saying that getting sick is inevitable,” according to Brasilia resident Ana Lustosa da Costa. With her two of her two nephews testing positive, she is worried about her elderly parents who are in the at-risk group.“Despite the epidemic spreading through the country, the economy has been reopened. Social distancing measures are declining and people are moving around carrying the virus. No state has seen an infection rate lower than 1,” says Dr Paulo A Lotufo, professor of medicine at the University of Sao Paulo.According to a team of researchers at the university, Brazil has sixteen times more cases than the official numbers indicate. Meanwhile, Researchers at the Federal University of Minas Gerais have suggested it has eight times more cases, Washington Post reported. Nonetheless there is a general consensus that the official figures do not reflect the real cost of the epidemic in the country. “Testing is lacking big time, especially among the less privileged,” says Dr. Dourado.Add to this, the onset of winter in South America has PAHO worried that serious cases of Covid-19 will rise further. Winter “fuels respiratory infections—like seasonal influenza and pneumonia—that can rapidly spread in colder climates,” Etienne has said.“Winter is a cause for concern because people spend more time in closed spaces. Plus, the cold weather also brings other viruses,” Dr. Elnara Marcia Negri, a pulmonologist at Hospital Sírio-Libanês in São Paulo, tells HT. A potential spike in seasonal flu could overwhelm hospitals already straining under the coronavirus pandemic.Health ministry officials said on Wednesday that there are confirmed virus cases in 96.4% of Brazil’s municipalities and the country is still far from reducing the pandemic’s spread. “Brazil is paying the price for the government’s inadequate response to the crisis,” Dr Negri adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cold-weather-premature-reopening-may-escalate-brazil-s-covid-19-spread/story-u6ECiGtxmSClolyQFmMvdM.html

He added that many pneumonia cases were likely to be Covid-19 and “just have not been diagnosed correctly.” Ryan says WHO was working with local authorities to review X-rays and look at the pattern of pneumonia cases to see if they were consistent with Covid-19.“While we believe that many of these cases will be diagnosed as Covid-19, we keep an open mind,” says Ryan, noting a WHO team was already in Kazakhstan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unknown-pneumonia-in-kazakhstan-could-be-covid-19-says-who/story-7G4aarcmVbVjy5jWRy7Z4O.html

The shark attack left him with severe injuries to his legs.Several surfers came to the aid of the boy and helped him to shore for medical attention. Despite CPR efforts to revive him, he died at the scene.Jim Simmons, mayor of Clarence Valley shire, said visitors had flocked to the region for the school holidays and there would likely have been many people in the water.“What’s happened there this afternoon would shake everybody,” Simmons said. “It’s terribly shocking. All of our sympathies, from people in the area, go out to the boy’s family.”Last Saturday, a 20-year-old scuba diver who was spear fishing died after being attacked by a shark off the coast of Australia’s Queensland state. The man was attacked near Indian Head on the eastern side of Fraser Island.The attack happened not far from where 23-year-old Queensland wildlife ranger Zachary Robba was fatally mauled by a great white shark in April.A 57-year-old diver was killed off Western Australia state in January, and a 60-year-old surfer was killed off Kingscliff in New South Wales state in June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teenage-surfer-killed-by-shark-2nd-in-australia-in-a-week/story-RrDDDnt0CkXvuOf6V2QM5N.html
11-07-2020||World||Hong Kong pro-democratic opposition starts voting in primaries||Voting started in Hong Kong on Saturday for the primaries of pro-democracy opposition parties, after police raided a polling body working with the movement the night before.Almost 60,000 people voted in the first three hours, according to organizers of the unofficial primary. They are hoping to get at least 170,000 to take part in the vote on Saturday and Sunday and select candidates from each district to run in September’s Legislative Council election.Police searched the offices of the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute on Friday evening and seized its computers, said Au Nok-hin, an organizer of the primary. They had a warrant and didn’t make any arrests, Au said. The institute is a widely cited pollster helping the pro-democracy movement with the primary, which a top government official has said may violate Beijing’s new national security law for the city.Voting for the primaries was delayed until noon as a result of the raid, the organizers said. Police were seen visiting some of the 250 polling stations.A police spokeswoman said officers from the cyber security crime bureau conducted Friday’s search after receiving complaints from members of the public about leaked information, including that of police officers’.The opposition hopes to ride a decisive victory in last November’s district council elections to secure a majority in the legislature that would give it the power to block Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s agenda -- and even theoretically force her to resign by rejecting her budget proposals. However, the new security law has compounded risks that the Beijing-backed government will disqualify pro-democracy candidates to keep them from winning enough seats.“The primary election is our first time to let Beijing know Hong Kongers never bow down to China,” pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was cited by RTHK as saying ahead of the opening of the polls. “We urge the world to put Hong Kong under the global spotlight.”Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang on Thursday suggested that participation in the primary could run afoul of the law. If convicted by the courts, violators would be barred from seeking or holding public office for an unspecified period. Another top Hong Kong official last month advocated for the invalidation of candidates who expressed opposition toward the legislation, which is raising questions about the city’s autonomy from China.Tsang said that planning and participating in primaries could violate the law’s articles of secession, subversion and collusion, as well as its Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance. Though democrats refuted the government’s remarks and continued canvassing support for the primary, they also worry that authorities’ suggestions of illegality -- and a warning that district council offices shouldn’t be used as primary polling stations -- would dampen voter turnout over the weekend.Hong Kong Democrats Fear Disqualifications Ahead of Election“Surely that’s our worry, whether the new national security law will deter people from coming out to participate in a legally organized and lawful activity,” legal scholar and organizer Benny Tai said at a briefing earlier this week. He argued that the primary was not an act of “secession” or “collusion” because it didn’t have an agenda to split the country and wasn’t sourcing funds externally.Opposition BracesHong Kong, which is seeing a spike in locally transmitted coronavirus cases, has also reimposed social-distancing restrictions that go into effect Saturday and could dissuade some residents from coming out to vote.Pan-democrat organizers held media briefings in the past week to bolster public support and appeal for funds to cover expenses, but as of Friday had achieved only half their monthlong crowd-funding goal of HK$3.5 million ($450,000). Candidates -- including Wong -- have set up street booths in their respective districts in a last-ditch effort to secure votes ahead of the primary.If the total voting turnout is lower than the goal of 170,000, the camp would have to regroup and discuss who to put on the ballot, Tai said.Democrats had braced themselves for further disqualifications even before the law was handed down on the last day of June, as Lam’s government and its supporters criticized activists by name for a range of actions and political views that could put potential candidates in jeopardy.The government has blocked nine candidates from running over their support for Hong Kong independence and self-determination since 2016, when it first took the then-unprecedented step of banning politicians from running for Legco due to their political views.“Authorities want to use the rule of fear to suppress any different views and exactly how we can counteract the rule of fear is by doing the things we believe to be right,” Tai said. “The more people coming out to vote, it will give more legitimacy to the whole process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-pro-democratic-opposition-starts-voting-in-primaries/story-jsdo8KGsMI8rnnwOO4mLCN.html

I think everybody’s taken the ‘stay at home if you can’ (advice). I think now we should say ‘go back to work if you can.’“Britain’s economy shrank by 25% over March and April as the coronavirus pandemic escalated and the government ordered entire sectors to shut down.On Wednesday, finance minister Rishi Sunak said the government would pay bonuses to employers who bring temporarily laid-off staff back to work among other measures aimed at slowing an expected surge in unemployment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-to-tell-firms-to-order-staff-back-to-workplaces-report/story-RHDya30YokpczCwLG0BmzM.html
11-07-2020||World||Foreign students weigh studying in person vs losing visas||International students worried about a new immigration policy that could potentially cost them their visas say they feel stuck between being unnecessarily exposed during the coronavirus pandemic and being able to finish their studies in America.Students from countries as diverse as India, China and Brazil told The Associated Press they are scrambling to devise plans after federal immigration authorities notified colleges this week that international students must leave the US or transfer to another college if their schools operate entirely online this fall.Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit this week to block the decision, and now California and Washington state are seeking injunctions against enforcing the new visa policy.“Shame on the Trump Administration for risking not only the education opportunities for students who earned the chance to go to college, but now their health and well-being as well,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Thursday.Some said they may return home, or move to nearby Canada.“I’m generating research, I’m doing work in a great economy,” said Batuhan Mekiker, a Ph.D. student from Turkey studying computer science at Montana State University in Bozeman. He’s in the third year of a five-year program.”If I go to Turkey, I would not have that,” he said. “I would like to be somewhere where my talent is appreciated.” Mathias, a Seattle-based student who spoke on condition his last name not be used for fear of losing his immigration status, said he is set to sell his car, break his lease, and get his cat Louis permission to fly back to his home in Paris in the next two weeks.“Everyone’s very worried,” he said. “We have our whole lives here.” Seven students from China and Germany who attend universities in California sued Friday to block enforcement, alleging potential threats to their health and “financial calamity.” The policy “treats them as pawns for the president’s politically motivated decision,” Mark Rosenbaum of nonprofit Public Counsel, which filed the suit, said in a statement.Many American universities have come to depend on the revenue from more than 1 million international students, who typically pay higher tuition. President Donald Trump has insisted they return to in-person instruction as soon as possible, alleging that schools are being kept closed to harm the economy and make him look bad.The guidance was released the same day Harvard announced it would keep all undergraduate classes online this fall. Harvard said the new Trump directive would prevent many of its 5,000 international students from remaining in the US.The University of Southern California sent a letter to students and faculty, saying it is “deeply troubled” and that the “the policy could negatively impact countless international students.” Like other universities, USC said it was pushing back and working to ensure students’ academic careers aren’t harmed, while exploring ways for students to safely study in person if they wish.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the directive could inflict “significant harm” on colleges, students, the business community and the economy.A U.S. State Department press release said the policy “provides greater flexibility for non-immigrant students to continue their education in the United States, while also allowing for proper social distancing on open and operating campuses.” A day after Harvard sued, the university notified the court that immigration authorities appear to be already enforcing the policy. A lawyer for Harvard urged the judge to suspend the rule, saying that a first-year student from Belarus was turned away from his flight at a Minsk airport. There is another hearing Friday.“This is very dangerous and cruel,” said Jessie Peng, a Chinese graduate student in analytics at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology.“We have nowhere to go,” said Peng, 27. “Either risk our lives and go to school or we risk our lives flying back to China.” Jasdeep Mandia, a doctoral candidate from India studying economics at Arizona State University, said he has breathing problems that could worsen if he gets sick from Covid-19.Mandia, 35, originally planned to conduct all his fall studies online. He says the Trump directive puts the shaky standing of international students on display.“It has never been a level playing field,” he said. “But this makes it more apparent.” At Indiana University, American scholar Dakota Murray wrote in the school newspaper about his uncertainty over how the guidance would affect him and his wife, a fellow doctoral candidate who is from South Korea.Murray, 27, said he and his wife had discussed going to live in South Korea or maybe Canada, where she has relatives. He spoke on condition that his wife’s name not be used because she is trying to obtain a green card that will let her work and reside in the U.S. after she finishes her studies.Vanderbilt University student Safa Shahzad went home to Manchester, England, for a visit in March but got stuck there when the U.S. imposed travel restrictions to slow the spread of the virus.Still in England, the 19-year-old, who is double majoring in politics and computer science, completed her freshman year from afar after the university transitioned online.Although Vanderbilt has said courses will be a hybrid of online and in person this fall, Shahzad cannot travel to the U.S. until the Trump administration lifts the travel restrictions.“I’m just kind of waiting,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-students-weigh-studying-in-person-vs-losing-visas/story-UrLg7iflZPEYr68FIBepfN.html

11-07-2020||World||Many ‘flavours’ of Covid-19: Study finds multiple immune responses to coronavirus||A latest study has found that the Covid-19 has many “flavours”. The molecular study has arrived at findings that may allow targetting specific molecular changes in coronavirus patients for treatment in the future. The researchers found at least five different types of immune response against coronavirus - not just “mild” and “severe,” news agency Reuters reported. A team of experts set out to explore what makes the virus affect some people more severely than the others. For the purpose, patients’ “blood transcriptome” was studied which is the complete set of genes that are activated in immune cells in the blood. Also read: Covid-19 vaccine unlikely before 2021, TB vaccine shows promise in reducing deaths“In other words, there are different flavours of the disease,” just as there are different types of cancer, study co-author Dr Joachim Schultze of the University of Bonn told Reuters. An understanding of molecular mechanisms in Covid-19 patients can help design tailor-made therapies, Schultze said, adding that it could also help predict which drugs would likely benefit the patients. The experts cited steroid dexamethasone as “prominent” candidate in the fight against Covid-19 which has already shown promise in some coronavirus patients and pointed to the “surprising” discovery involving granulocytes  - a type of white blood cell. “Granulocytes, cells that are not really known to be major players in the fight against viruses, play a major role in severe Covid-19 disease,” Schultze said. The new findings “will help us to find better therapies and also will guide vaccine development,” he added. Another study suggested the role of a patient’s immune response in Covid-19 death. The study, an excerpt of which was published in science journal, ‘Nature’, suggested that immune responses, rather than the virus itself, are responsible for death in Covid-19 patients.“Numerous studies have suggested that the immune system contributes to the organ damage seen in some severe cases of Covid-19,” the paper read.Covid-19 has infected over 12 million people across the globe while more than 5 lakh people have succumbed to death globally. Over 7 million people have recovered from the deadly contagion worldwide.

The teachers union in the nation’s second-largest school district on Friday recommended keeping school campuses closed when the semester begins on Aug. 18.Simply calling for physical distancing and asking children and teachers to wear masks will not be enough, said Del Hierro. Her eight-year-old son, for example, complains that it is difficult to breathe through a mask, and tends to take his off.She said she is also worried that if something upsetting happens at her son’s school in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, teachers will not be able to properly console children from six feet away.“I wish they would just focus on distance learning and making it better,” said the stay-at-home mom, 33.Jennifer McAfee, who teaches English at Dotson Middle School in Rancho Palos Verdes, said with just six weeks left before the start of school, there is too little time and too few resources to plan a safe re-opening.Even something as simple as a ride on the school bus needs to be reimagined, she said, to make sure children obey distancing and mask guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-just-doesn-t-feel-safe-us-parents-teachers-worry-about-reopening-schools/story-m6WyAzjy4wnf1gOCUy1kBK.html
11-07-2020||World||US President Donald Trump rules out phase 2 trade deal with China||US President Donald Trump has for the time being ruled out a second phase trade deal with China, saying the relationship between the two countries has been severely damaged with Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. “The relationship with China has been severely damaged. I don’t think about it now,” Trump told reporters on Friday from Air Force One when asked about the trade deal. Earlier in the year, the Trump adminstration had signed a mega phase one deal with China, after intense negotiations between the two countries. Relations between Washington and Beijing have spiralled downward since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. US President Donald Trump has questioned the Asian powerhouse’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The two countries have also sparred over China imposing a new national security law in Hong Kong, restrictions on American journalists, treatment of Uyghurs Muslims and security measures in Tibet. “Relationship with China has been severely damaged. They could have stopped the plague, they could have stopped it, (but) they didn’t stop it. They stopped it from going into the remaining portions of China from Wuhan province. They could have stopped the plague, they didn’t,” Trump said. The coronavirus, which first emerged in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed over 1,30,000 lives in the US with 3.1 million confirmed cases. The virus toll in China stands at 4,641 with nearly 85,000 confirmed infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-rules-out-phase-2-trade-deal-with-china/story-zaqXFQB2A9tfsSdY2JeeGJ.html

11-07-2020||World||Working on order to establish merit-based immigration system: Trump||US President Donald Trump is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system, the White House has said. The White House statement came soon after Trump, in an interview with Telemundo News channel, said he is working on an executive order on immigration that will include a “road to citizenship” for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme. Responding to a question, Trump said his action on the DACA is going to be part of a much bigger bill on immigration. “It’s going to be a very big bill, a very good bill, and a merit-based bill and it will include DACA, and I think people are going to be very happy,” the president. “One of the aspects of the bill is going to be DACA. We’re going to have a road to citizenship,” Trump said, drawing sharp criticism from quarters in his camp. Senator Ted Cruz described the move as a mistake. “As the president announced today, he is working on an executive order to establish a merit-based immigration system to further protect US workers,” the White House said in a statement. “Furthermore, the president has long said he is willing to work with the Congress on a negotiated legislative solution to DACA, one that could include citizenship, along with strong border security and permanent merit-based reforms,” the White House said. “This does not include amnesty. Unfortunately, Democrats have continually refused these offers as they are opposed to anything other than totally open borders,” said the White House in a statement. During the interview, Trump alleged the Opposition broke the deal with him on the DACA. “I had a deal with the Democrats and they broke the deal. The DACA could have been taken care of two years ago, but the Democrats broke the deal. All of a sudden they just broke it for no reason. Actually, they had a court case that slightly went their way, and they said, ‘Oh, let’s not talk about the deal anymore,’“ he said. Trump said the recent Supreme Court ruling gave the president tremendous powers when they said that you could take in, in this case, 700,000 or so people. “Based on the powers that they (SC) gave, I’m going to be doing an immigration bill. One of the aspects of the bill that you will be very happy with, and that a lot of people will be, including me and a lot of Republicans, by the way, will be the DACA. It will give them a road to citizenship,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/working-on-executive-order-to-establish-merit-based-immigration-system-says-trump/story-2S01AfGmn7yu0kqwbjLA3I.html

Covid-19 has claimed more than 5 lakh lives globally while 7 million people have recovered from the deadly contagion worldwide. With a rapid surge in coronavirus cases across the globe, scientists and researchers are also ramping up effort to arrive at the potential Covid-19 vaccine. Gilead Sciences Inc., Oxford experts and American biotech company Moderna are at the forefront of vaccine development for Covid-19. In an interview with HT, Oxford University professor Sunetra Gupta had said that by the end of this summer, “we should have proof that the vaccine works”.Here are the latest developments on Covid-19 vaccine • On Friday, Gilead Sciences Inc said an analysis showed its antiviral remdesivir helped reduce the risk of death in severely ill Covid-19 patients. It, however, added that rigorous clinical trials are needed to confirm ita benefit. • Germany-based biotechnology company, BioNTech SE, could seek approval for its coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, Wall Street Journal reported. The experimental vaccine, BNT162b1, showed promise against coronavirus in early-stage human testing and is expected to move into a large trial involving 30,000 participants this month, pending regulatory nod. Also read: Psoriasis injection okayed for limited use to treat Covid-19 patients• Moderna Inc is expecting to begin late-stage trials of its vaccine later this month. Its vaccine was among the first to be tested in humans in the US. In a small trial conducted on a group of healthy individuals, the vaccine was found to produce protective antibodies. The company has signed an agreement with Spain’s Laboratorios Farmacéuticos Rovi SA to scale up the manufacturing and production of its potential Covid-19 vaccine for markets outside the US.• A tuberculosis vaccine routinely given to children in countries with high rates of that bacterial disease might be helping to reduce deaths from Covid-19, researchers reported on Thursday. The findings were published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.• A parliamentary panel on Friday informed the government of India that a vaccine for Covid-19 is expected only by early next year. Presentations were given by the Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the principal scientific adviser to the government before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Climate on the Centre’s Covid-19 preparedness.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-covid-19-vaccine-unlikely-before-2021-tuberculosis-vaccine-shows-promise-in-reducing-deaths/story-O4rQnBnnFXm3kZF8DqSyhM.html

This is how the president and his allies describe Mueller’s investigation into the Russian interference. As a 67-year-old man with medical conditions, he would be “put at serious medical risk in prison”, the statement added.“He was treated very unfairly, as were many others in this case. Roger Stone is now a free man!”Stone, a long-time Republican operative who shot to fame for his work for President Ronald Reagan’s campaign, had been convicted of seven charges including lying abut his role in alleged Trump campaign’s collusion with the Russian interference, withholding information and threatening an associate to not cooperate with the investigation.Stoner had publicly lobbied for presidential commutation of sentence in recent days as a quid pro quo for not implicating the president. “He knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him,” he told Howard Fineman, a journalist who tweeted about his conversation with Stone shortly before the White House announcement. “It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn’t.”Meanwhile, critics of the president wondered if Stone has a piece of information that he leveraged to get a commutation.“No other president has exercised the clemency power for such a patently personal and self-serving purpose,” said a statement issued by Representatives Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House oversight committee, and Carolyn B. Maloney, both New York Democrats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-commutes-long-time-friend-roger-stone-s-jail-term/story-EpywOKSo99VtPZG9tQVbcK.html
11-07-2020||World||Most adults infected with Covid-19 in South Africa are asymptomatic cases: Official||Of all adults infected with Covid-19 in South Africa, 50 to 66 per cent are asymptomatic cases, with many infections going undetected, a health official has claimed. The coronavirus, which first emerged in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed 3,860 lives in South Africa with over 2,50,000 confirmed cases.  “The majority of Covid-19 infections are going unnoticed,” said Dr Shabir Mahdi, who is heading the University of Oxford’s vaccine trials in South Africa.  In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Mahdi said the high number of asymptomatic cases was causing difficulties in vaccine trials. The enrolment process has shown that far more people are asymptomatic than what was previously believed, Mahdi said. He estimated that only about 10 per cent of all Covid-19 cases are being officially reported. Mahdi said around 80 per cent of all children who are infected are asymptomatic. The clinical trials require people who have not been infected by the virus. Part of the enrolment process for the Covid-19 vaccine trial involves the screening of individuals. Qualifying participants are randomly allocated into one of two groups -- vaccine group or placebo group. Madhi said the results on whether the vaccine works as protection against Covid-19 would be available by the end of November this year, but the trials may be extended into the second quarter of next year. He warned against ‘undue’ optimism, reminding that only 10 per cent of vaccines that go into clinical trials are eventually licensed for use. “Right now there are approximately 200 vaccines that are being developed (around the world) for Covid-19,” he said. “It would be a huge accomplishment if, over the next 12 to 18 months, we are successful in showing that even one out of every 20 of the vaccines that go into human studies are safe and provide some protection against Covid-19,” he said. Madhi said for the next year at least the only reliable protection against Covid-19 would be the non-pharmaceutical interventions of handwashing, sanitisation and social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-adults-infected-with-covid-19-in-south-africa-are-asymptomatic-cases-official/story-JLXOykppdgkpRrZZLeGZ4M.html
11-07-2020||World||UN fails for a 2nd time to agree on extending humanitarian aid to Syria||A divided UN Security Council failed for a second time Friday to agree on extending humanitarian aid deliveries to Syria’s mainly rebel-held northwest from Turkey as the current UN mandate was ending, leaving nearly 3 million people at risk of losing aid.Russia and China vetoed a UN resolution backed by the 13 other council members that would have maintained two crossing points from Turkey for six months. A Russian-drafted resolution that would have authorised just one border crossing for a year failed to receive the minimum nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council, with only four countries voting in favour while seven voted against and four abstained.Diplomats said Germany and Belgium, who insist two crossings are critical especially with the first Covid-19 case just reported in Syria’s northwest, circulated a new text. That resolution, obtained by The Associated Press, would extend the mandate through the Bab al-Hawa crossing for a year and the mandate for the Bab al-Salam crossing — which Russia wants to eliminate — for three months to wind up its activities.Council members continued discussions Friday night and diplomats said a meeting was possible Saturday to vote on the German-Belgium draft as well as likely Russian amendments.German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said the Russian vote should be “a last-minute wake-up call” for Security Council members to resolve their differences. He said Germany, which holds the rotating council presidency, was “ready to work around the clock,” and he urged council members to think of the millions of Syrian waiting for them “to decide their fate.” “To leave this weekend without a solution would send a signal of disappointment and despair to the people in the region,” Heusgen said,.The actions Friday capped a week of high-stakes rivalry over cross-border aid.Russia, Syria’s closest ally, has argued that aid should be delivered from within Syria across conflict lines. But the UN and humanitarian groups say aid for 2.8 million needy people in the northwest can’t get in that way.The initial German-Belgium resolution authorising two crossings for one year won support from 13 of the 15 council members on Tuesday but was vetoed by Russia and China.A Russian draft resolution authorising one crossing for six months failed to get the minimum nine “yes” votes on Wednesday. And a similar Russian amendment to the latest German-Belgium resolution was dramatically rejected Thursday, getting only two “yes” votes — from Russia and China.In January, Russia scored a victory for Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the yearlong mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months.US Ambassador Kelly Craft tweeted Friday: “Russia & China are using politics to prop up the Assad regime while more than 3 million people are in desperate need of aid. We cannot allow the Bab al-Salaam border crossing, where 30 per cent of UNICEF’s aid enters Syria, to close. The lives of 500,000 children are at risk.” The president of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, said reducing aid deliveries to just one crossing point “would cut essential health supplies to one million people, and leave the UN unable to scale up in response both to Covid-19 and deteriorating food security.” “Today is yet another example of the age of impunity, where two countries can veto with full knowledge, but utter disregard, for the impact it will have on civilian lives, all against the backdrop of an unprecedented and devastating global pandemic,” Miliband said.Without waiting for Friday’s announcement of the result of voting on the German-Belgium resolution and signaling its intent to use its veto, Russia announced late Thursday that it had circulated a new resolution that would authorise just one crossing from Turkey for a year.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, tweeted that Bab Al-Hawa “accounts for more than 85% of total volume of operations.” “We categorically reject claims that Russia wants to stop humanitarian deliveries to the Syrian population in need,” he wrote, urging Western nations to “seize this opportunity” and support the Russian draft which adapts “to the situation on the ground.” “If they block our compromise proposal they will be responsible for the consequences,” the Russian envoy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-fails-for-a-second-time-to-agree-on-extending-humanitarian-aid-to-syria/story-4Sbfqea5e1dHZKsOJ4ygRI.html

That study showed a trend toward better survival for remdesivir but the difference was not statistically significant.In the latest analysis, Gilead said it analyzed data from 312 patients treated in its late-stage study and a separate real-world retrospective cohort of 818 patients with similar characteristics and disease severity. Gilead’s late-stage study evaluated the safety and efficacy of five-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients. The study did not have a placebo comparison.Dr. Susan Olender from Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in the Gilead statement that the analysis draws from a real-world setting and serves as an important adjunct to clinical trial data even as it is not as vigorous as a randomized controlled trial.However, Dr. Walid Gellad, a professor at University of Pittsburgh’s medical school, called it “a joke” to compare clinical trial data with observational data and conclude anything definitive about mortality. “The mortality in the remdesivir trials has generally been lower for both control and intervention groups than other trials and other real world cohorts I’ve seen,” Gellad said in an email.“The real world patients are taken care of at different hospitals than those in the trial and potentially different adjunct treatments. They’re different.” Findings from the analysis showed that 74.4% of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by Day 14 versus 59.0% of patients receiving standard of care, the company said. The mortality rate for patients treated with remdesivir in the analysis was 7.6% at Day 14, compared with 12.5% among patients not on remdesivir.The US government trial in April showed that patients given remdesivir recovered 31% faster than those given a placebo. Gilead’s shares rose 2% to $76.27 in afternoon trading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-analysis-shows-remdesivir-reduced-covid-death-risk-but-more-trials-needed/story-0mk2aKvLmITkrr1xWCZzvJ.html

Hindustan, HT’s sister publication, reported that a child born at RML Hospital to a woman, who recovered from Covid-19 recently, has been found positive for the infection. Dr Rahul Chaudhary, an assistant professor with RML’s department of neonatal diseases, said the mother had recovered after contracting the virus at the time she delivered her baby. But after the child was born and her sample was sent for examination after six hours, the newborn tested positive for Covid-19.Chaudhary claimed that the birth of a coronavirus-infected child from the corona negative mother’s womb is the first case in the country. He said research in China had shown that a child can be infected with Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19, through the umbilical cord, although there was no solid evidence regarding it.“A woman giving birth to her child after being cured of coronavirus disease suggests that the corona infection can also reach the baby from the mother’s umbilical cord. However, it is very unlikely,” Dr Chaudhary was quoted as saying by Hindustan.The 25-year-old woman, a resident of Nangloi, was pregnant and was admitted to RML Hospital last month. She was tested for coronavirus disease on June 11 and was found to be infected. After this, her husband was also tested positive. The woman was again found positive after a repeat Covid-19 test on 25 June and on July 7 when the doctors conducted the RTPCR examination for the third time, the report came back negative. Dr Chaudhary said the woman’s delivery was done the next day after the report came negative and the child was examined only after six hours. Doctor Kirti, an assistant professor of the hospital’s department of microbiology, said coronavirus is present in the baby with high viral load. The baby is in the hospital.Scientists, in an editorial in the American Journal of Perinatology in June, have said that the spread of Sars-Cov-2 from a mother to foetus had not been well-established. The researchers at the University of California Davis Health, however, said it could happen in multiple ways including viral transmission from the mother to the foetus or intrauterine transmission.The transmission from mother to baby during or directly after delivery and superficial exposure to Sars-Cov-2 are also possible, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baby-born-to-delhi-woman-cured-of-covid-19-tests-positive-doctors-claim-first-such-case-in-india/story-Pwg66OnIzSqaxskSImWsPN.html

The authorities had previously attributed most new cases to people returning from overseas.“It will get worse before it gets better,” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told a televised news conference.“We will see more and more additional cases. This is going to be with us for months and months.”“Nobody is enjoying being locked at home. It is frustrating, it is challenging, but the strategy will be successful if we all play our part.”There were 100 separate outbreaks in Victoria, the state’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, told the news conference.Australia has avoided the high Covid-19 casualty numbers of other countries after closing its borders and going into nationwide lockdown in March. The country has recorded about 9,200 infections and 107 deaths, including the death of a man in his 90s in Victoria overnight, Andrews said.The country’s other states have been relaxing restrictions on movement but tightened their border closures to Victoria. Victoria, home to a quarter of the country’s 25 million people, has also become the first state to ask people to wear masks.Neighbouring New South Wales, the most-populous state, reported just seven new cases as of late Friday, including a man who had visited a Sydney pub that has been linked to two other infections. The authorities set up a pop-up testing clinic at the pub, which has been closed for cleaning, and urged recent patrons to take be tested.Though there is no proven vaccine or cure for the coronavirus, Australia gave provisional approval to Gilead Sciences Inc’s remdesivir as the first treatment option for virus, joining the United States and the European Commission which have given it conditional clearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-victoria-state-records-another-day-of-high-covid-19-infections/story-BfBzfT8jirDPvxxPYkGzjL.html
11-07-2020||World||Tropical Storm Fay weakens after landfall in New Jersey||Fast-moving Tropical Storm Fay made landfall in New Jersey on Friday amid heavy, lashing rains that closed beaches and flooded shore town streets.The storm system was weakening as it moved over New Jersey and was expected to continue doing so overnight, the US National Hurricane Center said in its 8 p.m. advisory. The storm is expected to bring 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain, with the possibility of minor coastal flooding from New Jersey to Rhode Island as well as flash flooding. That’s down from earlier forecasts of about 3 to 5 inches (8 to 13 centimeters) of rain.The storm made landfall along the coast of New Jersey about 10 miles (15 kilometers) north-northeast of Atlantic City, according to national forecasters and was around 45 miles (72 kilometers) north-northeast of that city and 50 miles (80 kilometers) south-southwest of New York City as of the latest advisory.Several beaches in Delaware had been temporarily closed because of the storm. And police in Ocean City asked drivers to avoid southern parts of the tourist town because flooding had already made some roads impassable. Some streets in the New Jersey shore towns of Sea Isle City and Wildwood were flooded, according to social media posts. Seaside Heights, New Jersey, reported a sustained wind of 37 mph (60 kph) and New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport reported a wind gust of 45 mph (72 kph), said forecasters.A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Great Egg Inlet, New Jersey to Watch Hill, Rhode Island. The warning area includes Long Island and the Long Island Sound in New York, forecasters said. Heavy rain was falling in New York City on Friday afternoon as the centre of the storm moved northward toward upstate New York and western New England.“We expect some pretty heavy winds, and we need people to be ready for that, and some flash flooding in certain parts of the city,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a briefing Friday morning.The summer storm’s impact on the city was expected to be ”pretty limited,” but de Blasio said it would be a bad night for outdoor dining — the only sit-down service allowed at city restaurants because of the pandemic.“If you were going to go out tonight, instead order in and keep helping our restaurant community,” he said.The shoreline town of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, was preparing to open the local high school as a 2,000-person shelter. In a nod to the coronavirus outbreak, Police Chief Michael Spera they will be handing out masks and will not be sending residents to the gym or other common areas.“They will actually be escorted into individual classrooms,” he said. “If you take a school and make pretend that it’s a hotel, we’ll be using individual classrooms like individual hotel rooms.”He said families will be allowed to stay together in one room. People who indicate they have symptoms that might be associated with the virus will be segregated to a separate area of the school.President Donald Trump said the storm is being monitored and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was poised to help if needed.“We’re fully prepared. FEMA’s ready in case it’s bad. Shouldn’t be too bad, but you never know,” Trump told reporters while departing the White House for Florida.Trump postponed his Saturday rally in New Hampshire due to the weather, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.The storm was moving north Friday evening at about 14 mph (22 kph) and producing top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), forecasters said. Earlier observations showed it moving at 8 mph (13 kph) with top sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph).Fay is the earliest sixth-named storm on record, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The previous record was Franklin on July 22, 2005, Klotzbach tweeted.Two named storms formed before the official June 1 start of the hurricane season. None of this season’s previous five named storms strengthened into hurricanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-fay-weakens-after-landfall-in-new-jersey/story-AwUJqD4Akwv9H77GVKDjpK.html
11-07-2020||World||Jair Bolsonaro picks evangelical pastor as the new education minister of Brazil||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced on Friday his second pick to head the education ministry in 11 days, naming a college professor and church pastor to the post.Milton Ribeiro, a former deputy dean of Mackenzie University in Sao Paulo who preaches at a Presbyterian church in Santos outside the metropolis, will be in charge of one of the government’s most desired jobs.Religious groups supporting the president say the education ministry is key to boosting Christian values in Brazil and casting aside what they contend is leftist influence in the schools.Ribeiro’s predecessor, economist Carlos Alberto Decotelli, left June 30 after only five days on the job amid multiple allegations that he had embellished his academic credentials.Decotelli was Bolsonaro’s first Black minister and replaced Abraham Weintraub, who has been targeted in an investigation into a network that purportedly spread defamatory and threatening social media posts about Supreme Court justices. Weintraub resigned June 18 and went to the United States.Last Sunday, a candidate interviewed by Bolsonaro said he had rejected the education minister job, without giving more details. Renato Feder, an education secretary in the state of Paraná, said he appreciated the offer.Feder’s decision highlighted the difficulty the far-right president has faced in naming members of his administration. An interim health minister, Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, has led the country’s efforts against the coronavirus pandemic since May 15.Bolsonaro took office in 2019 with promises to appoint Cabinet ministers with technical expertise rather than dole out positions to curry political favor.Evangelical conservatives are a key support to Bolsonaro, who has faced headwinds and political isolation due to his handling of the Covid-19 crisis, which has killed more than 70,000 people in Brazil. The president announced Tuesday he also has the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jair-bolsonaro-picks-evangelical-pastor-as-the-new-education-minister-of-brazil/story-S1caCOgingXH3qwdrB5eZP.html
11-07-2020||World||Hundreds try to storm Serbian parliament as protests against govt heat up||Police fired tear gas at hundreds of demonstrators who tried to storm Serbia’s parliament on Friday, the fourth night of protests against the Balkan country president’s increasingly authoritarian rule.Demonstrators — who were defying a ban on mass gatherings amid a spike in virus infections — threw bottles, rocks and flares at the police guarding the domed parliament building in central Belgrade and removed the metal fences in front of it. Smoke rose above the entry stairway.Police first used their shields to push back the protesters and prevent them from entering the building. But after repeated attacks, they fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, and then ended up in running battles with demonstrators.Several people were arrested, and many reporters were injured, mainly in attacks by the demonstrators.Some opposition leaders have said the violence was the work of far-right nationalist demonstrators controlled by the government — with an aim to discredit the peaceful protests that began in response to President Aleksandar Vucic’s efforts to reimpose lockdown restrictions against the virus. But, they have mushroomed into an expression of wider frustration with his hard-line rule.Vucic has denied that “hooligans,” who were seen beating up the peaceful protesters earlier this week, are under his control, claiming they were brought in by the opposition. On Friday evening, he told pro-government Pink TV that all those who were attacking the “brave” policemen will be arrested.“The masks have fallen,” Vucic said, describing the protesters as a mix of tycoons and bullies “who want to take over power.”Earlier in the day, Vucic said he wasn’t worried about losing political power amid the protests, considered the most intense since the overthrow of former Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. He instead expressed fear about the spread of the virus by the demonstrators.“It is so irresponsible to call upon people to gather and demonstrate when we are faced with the most horrific numbers of infections from the coronavirus,” Vucic told reporters during his state visit to France.“I beg people, please let’s keep our health safe. Nobody is going to take power by force. Power is taken at the elections. You can protest as much as you want when the epidemic is over,” he said.The Serbian prime minister announced the highest daily number of deaths, 18, on Friday since the start of the pandemic in the Balkan country. She said 386 new confirmed were recorded cases in the past 24 hours. That brings the total to over 17,300 confirmed cases and 352 deaths since March.Friday’s unrest came after a peaceful protest on Thursday — though there was also violence earlier this week.The protests started on Tuesday when Vucic announced that Belgrade would be placed under a new three-day lockdown following a second wave of confirmed coronavirus infections. They have continued even though Vucic suspended his plans to enforce the lockdown. Instead his government has banned gatherings of more than 10 people in the capital.After initially handling the pandemic relatively well, Vucic and his government have been accused of allowing the crisis to spin out of control in order to hold a June 21 election that tightened his grip on power.During his nearly three years in office, Vucic has consolidated a tremendous amount of power in the presidency, a role that previously was only ceremonial.Opponents blame the president for contributing to the large spike in deaths and new cases after he entirely lifted previous very tight lockdown measures. Mass gatherings at soccer and tennis matches and at nightclubs were allowed despite warnings by experts that this could lead to a spike in infections.Serbian officials denounced the protests as an attempt to overthrow the government and weaken Vucic’s position in the European Union-mediated negotiations on Kosovo, a former province whose 2008 declaration of independence Belgrade doesn’t recognize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-try-to-storm-serbian-parliament-as-protests-against-govt-heat-up/story-i7fqbzyxtVPFAgZk9SAZxO.html
11-07-2020||World||US sets record for new Covid-19 cases third day in a row at nearly 69,000||New cases of Covid-19 rose by nearly 69,000 across the United States on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, setting a record for the third consecutive day as Walt Disney Co. stuck to its plans to reopen its flagship theme park in hard-hit Florida.A total of eight US states - Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin - also reached records for single-day infections.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn Texas, another hot zone, Governor Greg Abbott warned on Friday he may have to impose new clampdowns if the state cannot stem its record-setting caseloads and hospitalizations through masks and social distancing.“If we don’t adopt this best practice it could lead to a shutdown of business,” the Republican governor told local KLBK-TV in Lubbock, adding it was the last thing he wanted.California announced on Friday the state will release up to 8,000 inmates early from prisons to slow the spread of Covid-19 inside the facilities. At San Quentin State Prison, outside San Francisco, half of the facility’s roughly 3,300 prisoners have tested positive for the virus.The Walt Disney Co. said the theme parks in Orlando would open on Saturday to a limited number of guests who along with employees would be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The park also cancelled parades, firework displays and events that typically draw crowds.Disney’s chief medical officer said earlier this week she believed the rules would allow guests to visit the park safely.Roughly 19,000 people, including some theme park workers, have signed a petition asking Disney to delay the reopening. The union representing 750 Walt Disney World performers has filed a grievance against the company, claiming retaliation against members over a union demand that they be tested for Covid-19. Other theme parks opened in Orlando in June, including Comcast Corp’s Universal Studios Orlando and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc’s SeaWorld.Florida remains one of the worst hotspots for the virus in the nation and is among a handful of states where deaths are rising, based on a Reuters analysis of fatalities in the last two weeks, compared with the prior two weeks. On Thursday, the state reported a record 120 deaths and added another 92 on Friday. It recorded 11,433 new coronavirus cases on Friday, just short of the state’s record, and nearly 7,000 hospitalizations.Antiviral drug to FloridaMore than four dozen hospitals in Florida have reported their intensive care units were full.This month, Florida has repeatedly reported more new daily coronavirus cases than any European country had at the height of their outbreaks. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, angered some residents and medical experts by calling the spike a “blip.” On Friday, DeSantis said that the state would receive more than 17,000 vials of the antiviral drug remdesivir from the US government, adding: “That’ll be something that will hopefully help to improve patient outcomes.” Scott Burkee, a 43-year-old former Disney employee from Davenport, Florida, said DeSantis “has shown zero effort to control the spread, he only becomes concerned when Trump does. The virus is clearly out of control.”Trump, a Republican, travelled to Florida on Friday for an event at the US military’s Southern Command and a campaign fundraiser.The president has sparred with state and local officials and teachers unions over the reopening of schools and said on Friday the Treasury Department would re-examine the tax-exempt status and funding of those that remain closed.Trump previously vowed to cut federal funding to the schools and eject foreign students attending universities in the United States unless their schools offer in-person classes. Most education funds come from state and local coffers.The number of confirmed US infections is over 3 million, according to a Reuters tally, stoking fears that hospitals will be overwhelmed.More than 133,000 Americans have died, a toll that experts warn will likely surge along with the rise in cases.Overall, coronavirus cases are rising in 44 American states, based on a Reuters analysis of cases for the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-record-for-new-covid-19-cases-third-day-in-a-row-at-nearly-69-000/story-zCQi8vr9DMwXz6kDSCdt0H.html
11-07-2020||World||Singapore’s PAP retains power but has weakest showing ever||Singapore’s ruling party retained a firm grip on power but suffered its weakest performance in 55 years in office in an election on Friday, with the economy badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. The result could shake up politics in the city-state, leading to more populist policies.The opposition Workers’ Party won a record 10 seats and secured two group representation constituencies. The ruling party won 83 seats -- or 89% of those up for grabs, according to an official count by the Elections Department. That allows it to amend the constitution, pass laws and set policies without major obstacles.Even so, it’s a setback for the People’s Action Party, which has always won at least 93% of parliamentary seats since Singapore became an independent nation in 1965. The result could potentially disrupt Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s succession plan. It may also spur the government to adopt more reactive policies as it did in the wake of the 2011 election, when the opposition tripled its seats to six.“It is not as strong a mandate as I’d hoped for, but it’s a good mandate,” Lee said in a media briefing early Saturday. “The results reflect the pain and uncertainty that Singaporeans feel in this crisis.”The outcome is a warning to other governments which have faced questions over their handling of a pandemic that has crippled economies around the world. Increasingly administrations are under pressure to provide greater safety nets for workers and spend more on things like health care and aged care. That means taking on higher levels of debt for longer in countries which have historically been wary of doing so.This “signals a new normal in Singapore politics, that the previous narratives of voters responding largely to bread and butter concerns may no longer hold water,” said Leonard Lim, Singapore country director for regional consultancy firm Vriens & Partners. “It’s a much more sophisticated electorate, one that isn’t afraid to send a signal to the PAP about its displeasure over the government’s performance even when economic worries weigh heavily on their minds.”Lim said the “remarkable” results show many voters cast ballots motivated by a desire for diverse and credible parliamentary representation.Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, who has been tipped to succeed Lee, won a tight race in the East Coast group constituency.In the briefing, Lee again reaffirmed an earlier promise to hand over Singapore “intact” and in “good working order” to the so-called “fourth generation” of party officials, who have helped spearhead the government’s response to Covid-19. The prime minister has signaled he would step aside by the time he turns 70 in 2022.Lee spoke about the loss of income, anxiety over jobs, and disruption caused by more than two months of restrictive measures to curb the pandemic. “This was not a feel-good election, but one where people are facing real problems and expect more rough weather to come,” he said.‘Sobering Reality Check’“It’s a flight from the status quo rather than a flight to safety -- a vote for change,” said Eugene Tan, a political analyst and law professor at Singapore Management University. “The 4G has their work cut out for them. They have little time to rebuild the trust and confidence of Singaporeans. They are not in a comfortable position and how they respond to this sobering reality check is crucial.”The next government will face the task of leading Singapore through one of its most tumultuous periods after it became one of Asia’s hardest-hit countries in the coronavirus pandemic with more than 45,000 cases, mostly migrant workers. Officials project Singapore’s gross domestic product will contract as much as 7% this year while employment fell in the first quarter by the most on record. That’s despite the government earmarking about S$93 billion in special budget support.Besides the Workers’ Party, which won six seats in the last election, others struggled. Progress Singapore Party, a newcomer led by former PAP stalwart Tan Cheng Bock and supported by the prime minister’s brother, Lee Hsien Yang, failed to win any seats. Tan lost narrowly in his West Coast district, getting 48% of the vote.Along with the 10 elected seats, the opposition will get two additional representatives under a designation called the non-constituency member of Parliament, or NCMP. Lawmakers approved the scheme via a constitutional amendment passed in 1984 after the PAP swept the previous four elections. It was increased to 12 from nine in 2016, when NCMPs were given the same voting rights as elected MPs.‘Social Inequality’Campaigning has been vigorous despite one of the shortest election cycles in the world at just nine days. The PAP has sparred with the opposition on everything from housing issues to the standard of living and goods and services tax, to the use of non-elected members of parliament.Some polling booths saw long lines amid a high turnout as election officials took special precautions such as temperature screenings, the use of disposable gloves and safe distancing rules.“It shows us that there is dissatisfaction about some things that Singapore has done -- whether it be the leadership renewal, the way the virus was managed, or holding the election in the midst of a pandemic,” said Felix Tan, associate lecturer in international relations at SIM Global Education. “It’s a changing landscape. Young voters are not necessarily concerned with job security, they are also concerned with issues such as social inequality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-s-pap-retains-power-but-has-weakest-showing-ever/story-oOV7We1EGzGg37Crj8lSfK.html
11-07-2020||World||Trump commutes longtime adviser Roger Stone’s prison sentence||President Donald Trump on Friday commuted the sentence of his longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, sparing him from prison after he was convicted of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election.“Roger Stone has already suffered greatly,” the White House said in a statement. “He was treated very unfairly, as were many others in this case. Roger Stone is now a free man!”Stone, 67, was scheduled to report by Tuesday to a federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, to begin serving a sentence of three years and four months for lying under oath to US lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 US election. A commutation does not erase a criminal conviction as a pardon does.The veteran Republican political operative’s friendship with Trump dates back decades.Stone was among several Trump associates charged with crimes in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 race to boost Trump’s candidacy.In announcing its clemency decision for Stone, the White House took aim at Mueller’s investigation and the prosecutors who brought the case against Stone. The White House said Stone “is victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency.”“There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign, or the Trump Administration, with Russia. Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election,” the White House said.Trump’s decision to commute Stone’s sentence marks his most assertive intervention to protect an associate in a criminal case and his latest use of executive clemency to benefit an ally.Congressional Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of undermining the rule of law by publicly complaining about criminal cases against associates including Stone, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff condemned Trump’s action, saying: “With this commutation, Trump makes clear that there are two systems of justice in America: one for his criminal friends, and one for everyone else.”A Washington jury in November 2019 convicted Stone on all seven criminal counts of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress and tampering with a witness.Stone was convicted for lying to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks, the website that released damaging emails about Trump’s 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton that US intelligence officials have concluded were stolen by Russian hackers.The US Constitution gives a president the “power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” Trump’s use of this executive clemency often has benefited allies and well-connected political figures.He pardoned hardline former Arizona county sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Republican White House aide Lewis “Scooter” Libby, conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza and convicted “junk bond king” Michael Milken. He also commuted the prison sentence of Democratic former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been a contestant on Trump’s former reality TV show.Stone has been a fixture in American partisan battles dating to the 1970s. Stone, a colourful figure known for his natty attire, has labelled himself an “agent provocateur” and famously has the face of former President Richard Nixon tattooed on his back. Trump repeatedly lashed out on Twitter about Stone’s case, accusing prosecutors of being corrupt, the juror forewoman of political bias and the judge of treating his friend unfairly. Late on Friday, the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia denied Stone’s request for a delay in reporting to prison. (Reporting by Steve Holland and Sarah N.

11-07-2020||World||Covid-19 surge visible across Texas: ‘The tsunami is here’||Urgent calls for field hospitals. Cars lined up for hours at drive-thru testing centers. Bars boarded up and grocery stores enforcing masks.Texas today resembles the state in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Except now, the outbreak is far worse.Records for Covid-19-related deaths and hospitalizations are set almost daily and Texas, the state that embarked on one of America’s fastest reopenings, is in retreat. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who on Friday extended a statewide disaster order first issued in March, is now telling the public to brace for what’s ahead.“Things will get worse,” Abbott told Lubbock television station KLBK. “The worst is yet to come as we work our way through that massive increase in people testing positive.”On Friday, Texas surpassed 10,000 hospitalized patients for the first time, capping a week of grim markers that also saw the state exceed 10,000 new cases in a single day. And it has been the deadliest week of the pandemic in Texas, with 95 new deaths reported Friday.“Several months ago, I warned of a potential tsunami if we did not take this more seriously,” said Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez, the top official in one of the largest counties on the Texas-Mexico border. Since Monday, at least 31 people there have died due to Covid-19 — more than in Houston or San Antonio.“The tsunami is here,” he said.The crush of patients at border hospitals is one alarming new sight in Texas. In rural Starr County, which has one hospital and no intensive care unit, County Judge Eloy Vera said Friday that doctors were down to two ventilators and that the local health director was calling around the country looking for places to send their most severe virus patients. “There aren’t any hospitals in Texas that would take them, so he was looking at maybe sending them to New York. It’s bad,” Vera said.He said the county is also seeking a refrigerated trailer to store the dead because the local funeral home already had seven or eight bodies waiting to be processed — more than it could handle at one time.The escalating crisis led members of Texas’ congressional delegation to ask Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar for a field hospital in the Rio Grande Valley as soon as possible. Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas also signed the letter, writing there was “no indication that case counts will level out soon.”“Our healthcare providers remain wholly overwhelmed,” the letter says.During the early weeks of the pandemic, overflow medical shelters were quickly set up in Dallas and Houston, but they closed in April without ever housing a single patient. Abbott announced at the end of that month that Texas would begin reopening after just a few weeks of stay-at-home orders. Mayors in Texas’ big cities and health experts winced at the speed, saying it was too soon.Bars reopened in May, but were ordered shuttered again a month later as Texas cases began climbing again. Abbott on Friday urged the public, again, to wear masks and warned of another shutdown if the spread isn’t stopped.“The next step would have to be a lockdown,” Abbott said. “The last thing I want to do, the last thing anybody in Texas wants to do is see another lockdown.”A resurgence of long lines for virus tests in Texas has also been accompanied by delays in getting results. Veronica Seever, co-owner of Leaf Landscaping Supply in Austin, said she and her family received their Covid-19 test results Tuesday after a 14-day wait.Seever went with her husband and 16-year-old son to get tested at an urgent care clinic east of Austin after two of their employees tested positive. She said all three of them had to miss eight days of work during their 14-day self-isolation period, with no results in sight.“That was a big frustration for us,” Seever said. “We are trying to be socially responsible and make sure we are not out in public or at work spreading, but when it takes that long to get a test, people are missing work that don’t necessarily need to be missing work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-surge-visible-across-texas-the-tsunami-is-here/story-5pWMmqR5Yn0CNy36dhVrYO.html

The privacy violations were exposed by Apple and independent program developers, according to the suit.Developers and testers of Apple’s most recent mobile operating system, iOS 14, found LinkedIn’s application was secretly reading users’ clipboards “a lot,” according to the complaint. “Constantly, even.” Apple’s clipboard often contains sensitive information users cut or copy to paste, including photos, texts, emails or medical records.“LinkedIn has not only been spying on its users, it has been spying on their nearby computers and other devices, and it has been circumventing” Apple’s clipboard timeout, which removes the information after 120 seconds, according to the suit.LinkedIn didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Adam Bauer of New York City, who says he routinely used the LinkedIn App on his iPhone and iPad.The suit seeks to represent a class of users based on alleged violations of federal and California privacy laws and a breach of contract claim.LinkedIn’s information collecting was reported earlier this month by outlets including the Verge and Forbes.The case is Bauer v.

11-07-2020||World||Amazon says email sent to employees asking to delete TikTok was an error||Roughly five hours after an internal email went out to employees telling them to delete the popular video app TikTok from their phones, Amazon appeared to backtrack, calling the ban a mistake. “This morning’s email to some of our employees was sent in error. There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok,” Amazon emailed reporters just before 5 p.m. Eastern time. Spokeswoman Jaci Anderson declined to answer questions about what happened. The initial internal email, which was disseminated widely online, told employees to delete TikTok, a video app increasingly popular with young people but also the focus of intensifying national-security and geopolitical concerns because of its Chinese ownership. The email cited “security risks” of the app. An Amazon employee who confirmed receipt of the initial email but was not authorized to speak publicly had not seen a retraction at the time of Amazon’s backtrack. Amazon is the second-largest US private employer after Walmart, with with more than 8,40,000 employees worldwide, and moving against TikTok would have escalated pressure on the app. It is banned on employee phones by the US military and the company is subject to a national-security review of its merger history. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that the government was “certainly looking” at banning the app. Chinese internet giant ByteDance owns TikTok, which is designed for users outside of China; it also makes a Chinese version called Douyin. Like YouTube, TikTok relies on its users for the videos that populate its app. It has a reputation for fun, goofy videos and is popular with young people, including millions of American users. But it has racked up concerns such as censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government; the threat of sharing user data with Chinese officials; and violating kids’ privacy. TikTok said earlier in the day that Amazon did not notify it before sending the initial email around midday Eastern. That email read, “The TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email.” To retain mobile access to company email, employees had to delete the TikTok app by the end of the day. “We still do not understand their concerns,” TikTok said at the time, adding that the company would welcome a dialogue to address Amazon’s issues. A spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment Friday evening. TikTok has been trying to appease critics in the U.S. and distance itself from its Chinese roots, but finds itself caught in an increasingly sticky geopolitical web. It recently named a new CEO, former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, which experts said could help it navigate U.S. regulators. And it is stopping operations in Hong Kong because of a new Chinese national security law that led Facebook, Google and Twitter to also stop providing user data to Hong Kong authorities. Pompeo said the government remained concerned about TikTok and referred to the administration’s crackdown on Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE. The government has tried to convince allies to root Huawei out of telecom networks, saying the company is a national-security threat, with mixed success; Trump has also said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in trade talks. Huawei has denied that it enables spying for the Chinese government. “With respect to Chinese apps on people’s cell phones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right too,” Pompeo said, and added that if users downloaded the app their private information would be “in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.” A U.S. national-security agency has been reviewing ByteDance’s purchase of TikTok’s precursor, Musical.ly. Meanwhile, privacy groups say TikTok has been violating children’s privacy, even after the Federal Trade Commission fined the company in 2019 for collecting personal information from children without their parents’ consent. Amazon may have been concerned about a Chinese-owned app’s access to employee data, said Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert. China, according to the U.S. government, regularly steals U.S. intellectual property. Part of Amazon’s motivation with the ban, now apparently reversed, may also have been political, Aaronson said, since Amazon “doesn’t want to alienate the Trump administration.” Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are frequent targets of President Donald Trump. Bezos personally owns The Washington Post, which Trump has referred to as “fake news” whenever it publishes unfavourable stories about him. Last year, Amazon sued the U.S. government, saying that Trump’s “personal vendetta” against Amazon, Bezos and the Post, led it to lose a USD 10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to rival Microsoft. Meanwhile, federal regulators as well as Congress are pursuing antitrust investigations at Amazon as well as other tech giants.

11-07-2020||World||WHO sees infections rise by record 228k in one day||The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Friday, with the total rising by 228,102 in the last 24 hours.In the US, which is driving the global surge in numbers, President Donald Trump has decided to no longer resist wearing a mask even as the country continued to witness a rise in new Covid-19 infections, which went up by a record 65,551 in one day.Trump told Fox News that he will wear a mask during a likely visit to the Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, in the adjoining state of Maryland, on Saturday. “You’re in a hospital, so I think it’s a very appropriate thing (to wear a mask),” he said.The US president had been refusing to use a facial covering since early March.  The US has a total caseload of more than 3.1 million, with at least 133,000 deaths. Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir reduced mortality risk for Covid-19 patients by 62% compared to standard care, according to a new analysis of trial data released by the drugmaker.The analysis compared late-stage trial data with real-world treatment. Gilead will present the findings at the Virtual Covid-19 Conference as part of the 23rd International AIDS Conference.The analysis showed the death rate for patients treated with remdesivir was 7.6% on day 14 compared with 12.5% among patients not taking remdesivir. The analysis found 74.4% of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by day 14, as against 59% of patients receiving the standard of care alone.The WHO said on Friday that it is still possible to bring coronavirus outbreaks under control, even though case numbers have more than doubled in the past six weeks. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the examples of Italy, Spain, South Korea and India’s biggest slum showed that however bad a outbreak was, the virus could still be reined in through aggressive action. “In the last six weeks cases have more than doubled,” Tedros told a virtual press conference in Geneva. However, “there are many examples that it can still be brought back under control”, said Tedros.In Singapore, a general election was held on Friday under the cloud of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-sees-infections-rise-by-record-228k-in-one-day/story-8snLIembFYRlTXonn3KFAK.html

Last week, Trump had tweeted saying the mural was a “symbol of hate”. Similar Black Lives Matter murals are planned in each of New York City’s five boroughs and have appeared across the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyc-mayor-activists-paint-black-lives-matter-outside-trump-tower/story-YQogfrdTvHpDn8YeL0t3TI.html
