The letter comes amid a debate over so-called “cancel culture” - where prominent people face attack for sharing controversial opinions. “The forces of illiberalism are gaining strength throughout the world and have a powerful ally in Donald Trump, who represents a real threat to democracy,’’ the letter said.“But resistance must not be allowed to harden into its own brand of dogma or coercion - which right-wing demagogues are already exploiting. The democratic inclusion we want can be achieved only if we speak out against the intolerant climate that has set in on all sides.’’The letter criticised the state of public debate and the “swift and severe retribution” dealt out to any perceived wrongs. It decried an “intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism.’’“The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away,’’ the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rowling-rushdie-atwood-sign-letter-warning-liberals-of-illiberalism/story-nbdDBMVkLJ2fjzOxqpR5aK.html

Look, what happened with China with this virus, what they’ve done to this country and to the entire world is disgraceful.”Trump said the banning of the app was “one of many” options he was considering against China.Separately, vice-president Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the United States would “continue to take a strong stand” regarding Chinese entities that threaten its security, including potentially TikTok. The federal trade commission and the US justice department are also looking into allegations TikTok failed to live up to an agreement on protecting children’s privacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-considering-ban-on-tiktok-to-punish-china/story-3XhchP3HF1VugikYkn1JVO.html

Look, what happened with China with this virus, what they’ve done to this country and to the entire world is disgraceful.”Trump was responding to a question about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s remarks suggesting the US was considering a ba TikTok, the popular video-sharing app that is at the top of every hit-list here and around the world after India banned it along with others with suspected links to Chinese government.On Wednesday, the secretary of state stated that the US was looking at an entire range of Chinese products, devices and apps, not just TikTok.“We have been engaged in constant evaluation about ensuring we protect the privacy of American citizens and their information,” Pompeo told reporters Wednesday, and “(not) to any one business or company but rather to American national security.”His comments from earlier in the week about “any one company” — TikTok — he said, “fall in the context of us evaluating the threat from the Chinese Communist Party”. He went on to cite ZTE, Huawei as examples of the ongoing evaluation.“We are now evaluating each instance where we believe that US citizens’ data they have on their phones or in the system or in their health care records we want to make sure that the Chinese government does not have the way to easily access them,” he said, adding the administration will be taking actions to preserve and protect that information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-evaluating-an-entire-range-of-chinese-products-with-access-to-data-on-americans/story-S1D5waD0bdIbRgyrdl7PkI.html

The president has further threatened to “cut off” federal funds for reluctant and defiant states, without citing what funding he would cut off or under what authority.The United States is undergoing a renewed surge in cases specially in southern and westerns states, with Texas, Florida and California hit the hardest. Amid this, citizens and health experts have voiced continuous concerns about the spread of the virus in confined and closes spaces such as schools and colleges.The number of confirmed infections went up by a record single-day spike of 60,021 to 3,009,611 on Wednesday and the fatalities climbed by 1,195 to 131,594.The president has focused on the lower number of fatalities compared to the past to push his reopening drive; he has sought to dismiss the spike in infections to increased testing, with questionable claims.Trump backed his argument on Twitter and said that countries including Germany, Denmark and Norway have reopened schools “with no problems.” The Republican president also repeated his claim that Democrats want to keep schools closed for political reasons and not because of any risks associated with the coronavirus.The Trump administration has pushed for a full reopening of the nation’s schools, with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying anything less would be a failure.In another tweet he publicly disagreed with the reopening guidelines for schools put forward by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), calling them “tough and expensive”. The American president has disagreed with this own public health officials and disregarded their advise whenever he finds them incompatible with his plans.Vice president Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, said at a news briefing later in the day the CDC will be issuing a five-part guideline for reopening of schools.In the US, most schools are funded by the state and local property taxes, not federal funds. However, a large number of schools would seek federal funding to pay their teacher and meet other expenses because of depleted resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-cross-3-million-mark-donald-trump-pushes-school-reopening/story-OitLQiCrfkHd854krxYAzI.html
08-07-2020||World||Mike Pompeo says Xi’s aggressive ‘behaviour’ behind India-China conflict||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said the “incredibly aggressive” Chinese actions along the border with China were a reflection of the “behaviour” of General Secretary and President Xi Jinping in the region and the world, holding the Chinese leader more directly accountable for it than before. “I put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behaviour throughout the region (and) the world,” Pompeo said referring to Xi by his party title, and not as president, in response to a question about the ongoing India-China border tensions at a news conference.“I don’t think it is possible to look at that particular instance — the Chinese Communist Party aggression (the border conflict with India) — in isolation; you need to be put it in the larger context.” he added.The secretary of state pointed to the number of both maritime band boundary disputes the Chinese Communist Party has “engaged in is unequal to any place in the world”.Pompeo said there is hardly any neighbour of China that can say with satisfaction where their “sovereignty end”, which will be respected by the Chinese. “That is certainly true now for the people of Bhutan as well,” the secretary of state said, bringing up the newest of China’s border disputes. Beijing announced last week the boundary with Bhutan have never been “delimited” and that there have been “disputes over the eastern, central and western sectors for a long time.”This was in addition to all the other continuing 14 territorial disputes, with India, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and others. The United States has been unequivocal in its support of India in this round of border of tensions with China and has squarely blamed Beijing for it. But it had until now put it mostly on the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA, the Chinese military).Pompeo has led the Trump administration’s increasing attacks on China over a growing range of issues from the Covid-19 epidemic to the suppression of Uighur minorities, the new national security law for Hong Kong and the border conflict with India.Two US aircraft carriers began the largest naval exercises in recent years in the South China Sea last Saturday in a move to send “an unambiguous signal to our partners and allies that we are committed to regional security and stability”, as Rear Adm. George M. Wikoff, commander of the strike group, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.Trump administration officials have signaled a more direct link to the India-China border conflict. “The message is clear,” Mark Meadows, President Donald Trump’s chief of staff, told Fox News Monday. “Our military might stands strong and will continue to stand strong, whether it’s in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-says-xi-s-aggressive-behaviour-behind-india-china-conflict/story-wMLhzAnfLKrHc1fyWIqKWM.html
08-07-2020||World||India flays Burhan Wani protest outside India House in London||The Indian high commission on Wednesday described as “mockery” a protest outside India House organised by some anti-India groups to mark the death anniversary of Burhan Wani of the banned Hizbul Mujahideen, who was killed in Jammu and Kashmir on July 8, 2016.“Celebrating a terrorist commander’s death anniversary is a mockery, which exposes those who believe in propagating a selective version of human rights”, a statement from the mission said, adding that the protest included a “very small gathering” that was peaceful.“The security cooperation provided by the Metropolitan Police, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office is much appreciated by the High Commission of India”, the statement added.Scotland Yard officials set up a buffer zone between India House and protestors. The protest was reportedly organised by groups such as Overseas Pakistan Welfare Council, Global Pakistan and Kashmir Supreme.The area in The Strand in central London had witnessed major protests and violence on the Kashmir issue on August 15 and September 3 last year, when several people were injured and projectiles hurled at the building as the police struggled to deal with the situation.According to the high commission, the protest was “essentially organised to glorify the death of slain terrorist Burhan Wani”, noting that Hizbul Mujahideen is proscribed by the European Union, besides India.The mission said: “Before he was killed during a counter insurgency operation on July 2016, Burhan Wani and his group carried out multiple attacks in J & K, causing deaths of security personnel and civilians”.“During 2017-18, he was single-handedly responsible for recruitment of innocent Kashmiri youth into Jihadi campaign through religious bigotry and hate. Some of them such as Adil Khandey, Asad dam Padder, Riaz Naikoo became well known terror operatives, who carried out suicide attacks and killed innocent civilians and security personnel,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-flays-burhan-wani-protest-outside-india-house-in-london/story-SxFVDLQDgmjUZc8Esz16hI.html

08-07-2020||World||Incredibly aggressive action, says Mike Pompeo on China’s moves in Ladakh||China’s “incredibly aggressive action” along the border with India should not be seen in isolation but in a larger context where Xi Jinping’s Chinese communist party is engaging in an increasing revisionist effort with its neighbours, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. Pompeo added he was confident that the world will come to understand the threat that is presented by Xi Jinping’s party and will come together to respond in a way that is “powerful and important”.“I have spoken with (foreign) minister S Jaishankar a number of times about this. The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action and the Indians have done their best to respond to that,” Pompeo said in response to the question on the Chinese efforts to expand its territory that led to the two-month-long stand-off between soldiers of India and China.China’s People’s Liberation Army has started scaling down its presence along the Line of Actual Control as part of a de-escalation process agreed between the two countries but insisted that it was India that had crossed the line.“I put this in the context of general secretary Xi Jinping and his behaviour throughout the region and indeed, throughout the world. I don’t think it is possible to look at that particular instance, Chinese Communist Party’s aggression in isolation. I think you need to put it in the larger context,” Pompeo said.The US secretary of state referred to the large number of boundary and maritime disputes that China had opened with its neighbours. “I think it is unequaled any place in the world,” he said.“There aren’t many neighbours that can satisfactorily say that they know where their sovereignty ends and the Chinese community party will respect that sovereignty. That is certainly true now for the people of Bhutan as well,” he said.China stunned Thimphu last month when it objected to a grant request for the 650-sq km Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district at a meeting of the Washington-based Global Environment Facility. Beijing reasoned that the sanctuary, which Bhutan always considered as its easternmost part, was Chinese territory.When Hindustan Times reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry for a clarification, Beijing said the China-Bhutan boundary had never been delimited and there were disputes “over the eastern, central and western sections for a long time”.“This is what the world must come together to respond to. This increasing revisionist effort that the Chinese communist party is engaged in, something that President Trump has taken incredibly seriously,” Pompeo said.Pompeo said the United States had attempted to communicate to the Chinese leadership that “we are serious about this. “When I say we, it is not just the United States but we will shortly start a dialogue with the EU (European Union) friends on how we collectively can respond to this challenge from the Chinese communist party,” he said.“I think what has happened with this spread of virus from Wuhan China, I think the world has seen the true colours of the Chinese communist party and I am convinced now than ever before that the free peoples of the world will come to understand the threat that is presented, not only internally, inside of China, but the impact that general secretary Xi has on the world is not good… and the world will come together to respond in a way that is powerful and important and will preserve sovereign nations operating under the rule of law and the way we have all become accustomed to, and benefits people all across the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/incredibly-aggressive-action-says-mike-pompeo-on-china-s-moves-in-ladakh/story-4RS5HVXAONi6vMGQzi9SvO.html
08-07-2020||World||Harvard, MIT sue Trump admin over foreign student visa rule||Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the proposed new rules for international students as the Trump administration sought to soften the impact of its controversial order arguing, one, it was only a temporary measure and, two, it was meant to force these institutions to reopen fully. In the lawsuit filed in a Boston court, the two top universities sought a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction to bar the Department of Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from implementing the proposed order that will force foreign students of universities and colleges offering online-only classes for the upcoming fall semester to leave the country.“The order came down without notice—its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness,” Harvard University president Lawrence S Bacow wrote in an email to affiliates. as reported by the campus news publication The Harvard Crimson. “We believe that the ICE order is bad public policy, and we believe that it is illegal.”Harvard is among the institutions directly impact by the order as it had announced plans to hold online classes only for the fall semester just hours before ICE issued the guidelines on Monday, which had come completely without warning as many colleges and universities were still planning their fall reopening after a long break forced by the Covid-19 epidemic.The push back to the new guideline came swiftly at home from US institutions, with echoes around the world. India, which is the second largest source of international students to the US with an estimated 200,000, brought up the issue at the “foreign office consultations” between Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and US under-secretary of state for political affairs David Hale on Tuesday. Other countries are reported to have reached out as well.Hours later, state department said in a statement that the intended measure was a “temporary accommodation” meant only for the fall semester, and that it will allow international students to, in fact, continue their education through a mixture of online and in-person teaching while ensuring adherence to social distancing norms still required to battle the Covid-19 epidemic. There was no mention of students being forced to leave.Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, also emphasized the temporary nature of the new rule in an interview on CNN and went to say it will “encourage schools to reopen”. The Trump administration has been pushing for reopening the country after the Covid-19 lockdowns wreaked havoc on the US economy, leaving a trail of shuttered businesses and lay-offs, that have left the president without his best pitch for a second-term, a booming economy.On Tuesday, Trump said he will force schools to reopen as well.Foreign students enrolled in US institutions offering online-only classes for their fall semester will be not allowed to come to the US and if they are already here they may be forced to leave, unless a majority of their coursework was taught in-person, according to a proposed rule the Trump administration announced Monday. It is expected to be notified later this month.But foreign students of colleges and universities that were shifting to a hybrid model of mixed online and in-person classes will be allowed opt for more online classes than previously allowed. But these institutions had show to authorities that hey had indeed shifted to this model, also called “blended”.The Unites States has admitted an estimated 1 million international students every year, who generated around $41 billion worth of economic activity and supported 450,000 jobs, according to the American Council on Education, which represents US colleges and universities. Incomes generated from foreign students are critical to the financial health of many US colleges.China, India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada are the top-five sources of international students, in that order.Indian students have said their first reactions were panic and confusion. “The words ‘removal proceedings’ in the order set us off really,” said a graduate student who wished not to be identified. The student was referring to the new guideline issued Monday by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency for international students.US universities are still trying to sift through the implications of the proposed guideline, and the confusion. “We highly value our international community,” the University of Maryland in Maryland state, which has a large number of Indian students, said in a statement. “We are urgently considering alternative options, as this newly announced rule has caused great concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-mit-sue-trump-admin-over-foreign-student-visa-rule/story-IcDAPxK94qaiUZAoZmnRhK.html
08-07-2020||World||Sick with Covid, Brazil’s Bolsonaro defends his coronavirus approach||Now infected with the virus he has shrugged off as a “little flu,” President Jair Bolsonaro is insisting that his approach to the coronavirus, a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of fellow Brazilians, was correct all along.After months of clashing with doctors, governors and mayors who clamored for strict quarantine measures, Bolsonaro announced Tuesday on live television he had tested positive for Covid-19. He told reporters through a mask that he felt “perfectly well,” after taking two doses of hydroxychloroquine, an unproven anti-malarial he has touted as a successful remedy.“We know there are other remedies that can help fight the coronavirus,” he said hours later in a video he posted to Facebook after swallowing a third dose of the drug. “None are scientifically proven, but there’s one that’s working.”Medical experts say otherwise, but Bolsonaro’s supporters are coalescing around the stricken president as proof that Brazilians should get back to work and not hide from the illness tearing through Latin American’s largest economy.“The president took the right approach,” lawmaker Jose Medeiros, the government’s deputy leader in the lower house, said in an interview. “He will be proven right that there was no way we would stay hiding in our homes.”Critics blame Bolsonaro for creating a public health disaster as the country’s politics have grown increasingly polarized and toxic. Brazil’s largest daily, Folha de S. Paulo, published an op-ed late Tuesday titled “Why I am Cheering for Bolsonaro to Die.”In a Twitter post on Wednesday, the president said that “those who are rooting against hydroxychloroquine” should know that he’s doing very well because of the medication and that will still “live for a long time.”Second WorstBrazil trails only the U.S. with more than 65,000 confirmed deaths and over 1.62 million total cases. Its response has been erratic partly because of Bolsonaro’s insistence that shutting down the economy would be more dangerous than the virus. Governors have rejected his advice and imposed various lockdowns in recent months but his refusal to back those steps has made enforcement harder.His argument has been that the virus can’t be escaped or beaten and the country has to learn to accept it. As he said on Tuesday, “This virus is like the rain. It’s going to get you.”Bolsonaro has had recent health troubles that could complicate his condition. In September 2018 while campaigning for president, he was stabbed in the abdomen, leading to multiple surgeries. For months, he relied on a feeding tube and colostomy bag.Thomaz Favaro, a Sao Paulo-based analyst for the consultancy Control Risks, says Bolsonaro’s illness could help shift the conversation to the state of his health rather what he’s doing to control the pandemic.“It’s a lot easier for him to answer questions about how he is feeling and whether he was able to exercise, rather than what your government is doing to address the latest 1000 deaths,” he said.Keeping Up NormalityBolsonaro, 65, is already making a point of keeping up a sense of normality. So far, the only adjustments to his agenda has been canceling two trips to Brazil’s interior and turning face-to-face meetings into virtual ones, according to two officials speaking on condition of anonymity. They said his symptoms remained mild.Marcio Coimbra, a political scientist with Interlegis, a Brasilia-based think tank, says that barring severe illness Bolsonaro will now feel vindicated in prioritizing opening the economy at all costs. But the health of his cabinet remains in question after his frequent meetings with ministers without a mask.“Many of them are potential high-risk patients and could develop strong symptoms -- something that may end up harming Bolsonaro’s narrative if he recovers fast and easy,” Coimbra said.Bolsonaro generally refused to use a mask in public and even battled a court over an order forcing him to, insisted on maintaining close-quarter meetings with his advisers and inner circle. According to data collected by Bloomberg of Bolsonaro’s recent agenda, the president has met with more than two dozen senior government officials in the past week.U.S. AmbassadorOn Saturday, he attended a lunch in honor of July 4, the U.S. Independence Day, at the residence of U.S. Ambassador Todd Chapman. Chapman and his wife tested negative but would remain in quarantine, the embassy said on Tuesday.Key advisers, such as the chief of staff, have also tested negative for Covid-19. His minister of defense was tested Tuesday morning and was awaiting the result.Investors are carefully following the next steps and health of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who has promised a rash of reforms as Brazil faces a looming recession. The minister, who is 70 years old, tested negative last week and will be tested again in the coming days, his office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sick-with-covid-brazil-s-bolsonaro-defends-his-coronavirus-approach/story-GKHfDnQh7voelUjaz93YbJ.html
08-07-2020||World||Violence in Serbia over plan to reimpose coronavirus curfew||Thousands of protesters clashed with police in Serbia’s capital after the president said he’d reinstate one of Europe’s strictest lockdown regimes to confront a spike in new cases of Covid-19 in the city.Riot police used tear gas to repel rock-throwing, mostly right-wing demonstrators who briefly broke into the parliament building in central Belgrade in the biggest outbreak of violence against President Aleksandar Vucic since he came to power in 2014. Seven protesters and 13 police were injured, according to police.The crowd of about 5,000 smashed several shop windows and set five police cars on fire, while smaller groups rallied peacefully in the biggest northern city of Novi Sad and in the central city of Kragujevac. The government, led by Vucic’s dominant Serbian Progressive Party, denounced the violence.“The state and all its institutions will preserve and protect our constitutional order,” Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said late Tuesday. She condemned opposition politicians “behind the violent charge into Serbia’s parliament at the moment when the state and the health system are facing the biggest onslaught of coronavirus since the pandemic began.”The former Yugoslav republic of 7 million lifted its lockdown restrictions -- which included overnight and weekend curfews and banned inter-city travel -- in May along with the rest of Europe after the social-distancing restrictions helped stifle contagion.However, a new surge in cases hit the country following June 21 elections, with the head of Serbia’s government office for Kosovo, the speaker of parliament and the defense minister all testing positive.The protests have little chance of unseating Vucic’s party, which won a constitutional majority in the vote. At the news conference where he announced the renewed lockdown, he said a new government would be formed by Aug. 25.‘Handful of Hooligans’Protesters gathered at the parliament building shortly after the president spoke, demanding his resignation. Aside from opposing the plan for the new lockdown, they chanted “We don’t want migrants” and “Kosovo is the heart of Serbia,” the latter of which underscores the Balkan state’s dispute with its neighbor, which declared independence a decade after the two sides fought a war.The violence was instigated by “just a handful of hooligans,” said Police Chief Vladimir Rebic, distinguishing them from peaceful protesters.The new surge in infections is overwhelming the national health-care system, and Serbia will quickly build a new hospital with 800 to 1,000 beds, Vucic said.“The situation in Belgrade is alarming,” he told a televised news conference late Tuesday. “Hospitals are literally packed.”Four other Serbian cities are also strongly affected, with 13 new deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday, the country’s highest daily death toll since the pandemic began. Some 330 have died from Covid-19.There’s also the risk that the disease will persist into the winter, when it may coincide with the seasonal flu, Vucic said.“We’ll be facing a difficult autumn with the coronavirus,” he said. “There won’t be a vaccine by then.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-in-serbia-over-plan-to-reimpose-coronavirus-curfew/story-sCFcrHMiYmmwrbWujCPgeN.html
08-07-2020||World||Covid-19: UK to pay 50% of pub, restaurant bills to aid recovery||Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday announced more billions of pounds to help revive the economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic, including a plan to encourage people to ‘eat out to help out’ by paying 50 per cent of their bills in pubs, restaurants and cafes. Delivering his Summer Economic Update in the House of Commons, Sunak announced a package of measures to support jobs, give businesses the confidence to retain and hire, and provide people with the tools they need to get better jobs.The government paying 50% of customer bills in pubs, restaurants and cafés will be available throughout August, he said, amidst reports of crippling impact on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Dwindling recent figures of new infections have prompted an easing of lockdown curbs.Officials said the tourism and hospitality sectors – both major employers – have been severely impacted by the pandemic due to necessary closures to protect public health. Nearly 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million hospitality workers have been furloughed – the highest proportions of any sector.To encourage demand for businesses to reopen, Sunak set out the new ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ discount scheme that will provide a 50% reduction for sit-down meals in cafes, restaurants and pubs across the UK from Monday to Wednesday every week throughout August.Sunak said: “Throughout this crisis I have never been the prisoner of ideology. For me, this has never just been a question of economics, but of values….Our plan has a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs. It will give businesses the confidence to retain and hire”.Since March, the Boris Johnson government has been paying 80% wages of private sector employees and 80% of earnings of the self-employed people, together amounting to billions of pounds, adding to the mounting borrowing bill to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic.The new plans include a temporary rise in the threshold of house prices at which buyers need to pay the mandatory stamp duty to the government: from property worth £125,000 to £500,000 until March 31, 2021 to help revive the housing sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-pay-50-of-pub-restaurant-bills-to-aid-recovery/story-CBpHmV1ELQJ6fwNG1TW0fP.html
08-07-2020||World||Harvard, MIT sue US immigration authorities over new student visa rule: Report||Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have sued the Department of Homeland Security and the federal immigration agency over new guidelines barring foreign students from remaining in America if their universities switched to online-only classes in the Fall.A report in The Harvard Crimson said the two pre-eminent educational institutions filed a lawsuit in District Court in Boston Wednesday morning against the two federal agencies. The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to bar the US Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from the enforcing federal guidelines that will force international students to leave the US.Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow said in an email to affiliates that the “order came down without notice—its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness. We believe that the ICE order is bad public policy, and we believe that it is illegal.” “We will pursue this case vigorously so that our international students—and international students at institutions across the country—can continue their studies without the threat of deportation,” Bacow said, according to the Crimson report.The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a press release issued Monday that for the fall 2020 semester students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States. “The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States,” the release said.In what could cause increased anxiety for the international students already present in the US, the agency said, “active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programmes must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status or potentially face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.” The Crimson report said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced Tuesday that her office “will sue” over the guidelines, which she called “cruel” and “illegal.” The Harvard lawsuit argues that the guidelines violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to consider “important aspects of the problem” in advance of its release, failing to provide a reasonable basis for the policy, and failing to adequately notify the public.Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh said in a panel Monday that Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliot is also contacting ambassadors on behalf of international students.“As a university with a profound commitment to residential education, we hope and intend to resume full in-person instruction as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so,” Bacow said. “But, until that time comes, we will not stand by to see our international students’ dreams extinguished by a deeply misguided order. We owe it to them to stand up and to fight—and we will.” The federal agency has said that students attending schools adopting a “hybrid model”, which includes a mixture of online and in-person classes, will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The guidance is certain to cause severe anxiety and uncertainty for the hundreds of thousands of international students who are studying in the country and for those who were preparing to arrive in the US to begin their education when the new academic session begins in September. International travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic have made it increasingly difficult for international students in the US to return to their home countries, while those outside the US are uncertain if they will be able to travel to join their courses in American colleges and universities.Before the ICE guidance was issued, Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) had said that it will bring up to 40 per cent of undergraduates to campus for the fall semester, including all first-year students. Bacow, FAS Edgerley Family Dean Claudine Gay, and Danoff Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana co-authored a message to the FAS community that described the path forward, allowing first-years the opportunity to adjust to college academics and to begin creating connections with faculty and other classmates, while learning on campus in September. It said the College will address gaps in students’ home learning environments and identify those who need to return to campus to continue to progress academically. Students on campus will move out before Thanksgiving in November and complete reading and exams periods from home. MIT has said that many graduate students and research staff will be allowed on campus for the fall. But to limit the density of the campus population, most administrative staff who can work remotely will continue to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvard-mit-sue-us-immigration-authorities-over-new-rule-for-foreign-students-report/story-8Kxk4P1d1GgF07lVKqbNMO.html

There was no record of West filing any official paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. The deadline to add independent candidates to the ballot has not yet passed in many states.West denied that his aim was to split the Black vote and hurt the chances of Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. It was “a form of racism and white supremacy” to suggest all Black people should support the Democrats, he said.Trump, who hosted Kanye West in a widely publicized visit to the Oval Office in 2018, said the rapper’s candidacy “would be a great trial run” and that he had a “real voice,” according to an interview Tuesday with Real Clear Politics news website.White House spokesman Hogan Gidley on Wednesday called Kanye’s announcement “a scathing indictment of the Democrat Party, not just their policies on abortion, the Planned Parenthood, but also the policies that disproportionately affected African Americans in a negative way.”West told Forbes he believed “Planned Parenthoods have been placed inside cities by white supremacists to do the Devil’s work.” The group provides reproductive health care and education, with most of that being preventive care.The rapper also said he had been ill in February with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and would be suspicious of any vaccines developed to prevent the infection. Reiterating false theories that link vaccines with child developmental disorders, he said: “So when they say the way we’re going to fix COVID is with a vaccine, I’m extremely cautious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/birthday-party-kanye-west-s-banner-for-fighting-us-elections-vows-to-win-presidential-race/story-qS2DsfFIvSHQGh1lfC6FIL.html

That means it could be reversed by a new administration or if circumstances change.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said he would reverse the decision on his first day in office if elected.President Donald Trump has harshly criticized WHO over its response to the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of bowing to Chinese influence. Trump said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 130,000 Americans.The move was immediately assailed by health officials and critics of the administration, including numerous Democrats who said it would cost the U.S. influence in the global arena while undermining an important institution that is leading vaccine development efforts and drug trials to address the coronavirus.The withdrawal notice was sent to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday and will take effect in a year, on July 6, 2021.The U.S. is WHO’s largest donor and provides it with more than $450 million per year, but owes about $200 million in current and past dues.

The Trump administration’s move announcing its new travel ban targets an unspecified number of Chinese officials with visa restrictions, limiting or entirely eliminating their ability to travel to the United States.Zhao said that China strongly opposes the relevant US measures. In response to the wrong actions of the US, China decided to impose visa restrictions on US personnel who “behaved badly” on Tibet-related issues, he said.Though China does not allow diplomats and journalists inside TAR without the government inviting – and escorting – them, Zhao said: “Tibet is an open Tibet and has never made any regulations restricting foreigners from entering Tibet”.Zhao defended that by saying that “…taking into account the special geographical and climatic conditions of Tibet, the Chinese government has taken certain management and protection measures against foreigners entering Tibet in accordance with law and regulations, “which are absolutely necessary and beyond reproach”.Quoting “incomplete statistics from 2015 to 2018”, Zhao said between the three years TAR had received nearly 176,000 foreigners for official, tourism, business and other activities. Ties between the US and China are going through some of the worst times with the two countries quarrelling on trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea – where Washington has dispatched two of its super aircraft carriers, the origin of the Coronavirus, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/urge-us-to-stop-interfering-now-china-slaps-visa-restrictions-on-washington-officials-over-tibet/story-W4oYqeEuf57S1sZJbBMV7K.html

By far the most successful launch anywhere in the world,” Paul Reid, the head of Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE), said on Twitter.Ireland has had a manual contact tracing programme in place since the end of February and says the app will cut the time it takes to trace close contacts “from days to hours”, as well as helping to identify close contacts who are not known to each other.Research conducted for the health service showed that 82% of respondents were willing to install the app, which adopts a decentralised model where the data is held on the person’s mobile phone and not centrally by the government.Ireland currently has one of the lowest infection rates in Europe, with just three infections per 100,000 people during the past two weeks. So far, 1,720 people have died from the disease, a number that has also slowed sharply in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irish-covid-19-tracing-app-nears-1-million-downloads-in-24-hours/story-Y62oV7I28nKw0Xv6QYtGVP.html
08-07-2020||World||French PM says any new coronavirus lockdown would be targeted||New French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Wednesday that any new lockdown will be targeted, and not imposed nationwide, if there is a major new coronavirus outbreak.The previous French government enforced a strict nationwide lockdown from mid-March to May 11 to try to curb the spread of COVID-19, and some restrictions on public gatherings are still in place.“We must be ready for a second wave, but we would not proceed to a general lockdown like in March, as that has terrible economic and human consequences. Any new lockdown would be targeted,” Castex told BFM television.Castex, who was a civil servant and used to be an adviser to former President Nicolas Sarkozy, was appointed prime minister on Friday. He has put together a new team for the remaining two years of centrist President Emmanuel Macron’s mandate.Castex appointed some ministers on Monday. He said he would complete the formation of his government with the nomination of junior ministers next week.He also said that talks with unions and employers about Macron’s wide-ranging pension reforms - which were halted during the lockdown - would resume before July 20.He said the delay was not necessarily a bad thing.“Sometimes, when you lose two or three months, that is actually time won ... we need to reopen the dialogue,” he said.Castex confirmed his government would commit 7.5 billion euros to raise the wages of hospital workers but said he would resist union calls to boost that to 9 billion, saying that state finances are under stress because of the coronavirus crisis.(Reporting by Geert De Clercq and Richard Lough; Editing by Alison Williams and Timothy Heritage)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-pm-says-any-new-coronavirus-lockdown-would-be-targeted/story-yZvsnPOICfw7NsHqMj9wsJ.html
08-07-2020||World||China calls US invite to nuclear talks a ploy to derail them||A senior Chinese arms control official called US pressure to join nuclear arms talks with Russia an American ploy to avoid signing a new deal, and said China would gladly participate if the US would agree to parity among all three nations.“I can assure you that if the US says that they are ready to come down to the Chinese level, China will be happy to participate the next day,” Fu Cong, the director general of the Foreign Ministry’s arms control department, said Wednesday. “But actually, we know that that’s not going to happen.”Fu spoke to journalists in Beijing after the US pointedly noted the Chinese absence at talks with Russia in Vienna two weeks ago on extending or replacing NEW Start, a 2010 arms reduction treaty that expires in Feburary.The pact is between the US and Russia, long the world’s major nuclear powers. The Trump administration wants China, as a rising military power, to join.Fu called that demand unrealistic because China has a much smaller nuclear arsenal than the other two. By inviting China to join, the US is creating a pretext to walk away from the talks without replacing the treaty, he said.“The real purpose is to get rid of all the restrictions and have a free hand in seeking military superiority over any adversary, real or imagined,” he said of US intentions.US negotiator Marshall Billingslea told reporters after the talks in Vienna that any new agreement must subject China to restrictions. He expressed hopes that others in the international community would pressure China to join the talks in the future.“A three-way nuclear arms control deal, in our view, has the best chance of avoiding an incredibly destabilizing three-way nuclear arms race,” he said.Fu said the US and Russia should agree to reduce their arsenals first, and then China and others can join nuclear arms reduction efforts.New START imposes limits on the number of US and Russian long-range nuclear warheads and launchers. It can be extended by five years by mutual consent, which is what Russia is proposing to do.The treaty is the last nuclear arms agreement between the two nations, after the Trump administration scrapped an intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty last year. That pact was also criticized because it did not cover China.Fu said that US missile defense systems in Asia, and its talk of deploying medium-range missiles in the region too, pose a strategic threat to China.He wouldn’t comment on China’s nuclear weapons plans, but said it should not come as a surprise to anyone that China feels a need to improve its military capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-us-invite-to-nuclear-talks-a-ploy-to-derail-them/story-etI5DhlqGENcSoqXAdIc9O.html

He was arrested on charges of espionage in Balochistan in March 2016 and sentenced to death by a military court a year later.“In the first round, he met his mother and wife and now we have offered to let him meet his father and wife,” Additional Attorney General Ahmed Irfan said in a press conference on Wednesday.Irfan jointly held the press conference with Director-General of South Asia and SAARC at the Pakistan Foreign Office, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri. They told the media that Pakistan enacted the International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance, 2020 in May this year which allows review petitions within a certain period of time.But the officials said that Jadhav has refused to file a review petition against the death sentence awarded to him. Last July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Pakistan to provide consular access to Jadhav and review his death sentence.“The petitions can be filed before the Islamabad High Court,” explained Irfan, adding that in this case, it can be filed by Jadhav himself, an appointed representative or a consular official of the Indian high commission.“On June 17 we invited Jadhav to file a petition for the reconsideration of his conviction and offered him legal representation but he refused to file the petition and instead preferred to follow up on his pending mercy petition,” said Irfan.He said the government had also repeatedly written to the Indian high commission to file the petition and initiate the process for a review before the deadline.“Pakistan is fully cognizant of its international obligations and committed to implementing the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit,” he said expressing hope that India will follow due legal course and cooperate with courts in Pakistan to give effect to the ICJ judgement.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. In May 2017, New Delhi petitioned the ICJ, which stayed Jadhav’s execution. In its ruling on July 17, the ICJ said its stay of the death sentence should continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-refused-to-seek-review-of-his-death-sentence-says-pakistan/story-1ixjESzuiG5WviNwJFb6mO.html
08-07-2020||World||US withdrawal from WHO over claims of China influence to take effect July 2021, says UN||The United States will leave the World Health Organization (WHO) on July 6, 2021, the United Nations said on Tuesday, after receiving notification of the decision by President Donald Trump, who has accused the agency of becoming a puppet for China during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump, who announced the decision over a month ago, has to give one-year notice of the US withdrawal from the Geneva-based body and pay all Washington’s dues under a 1948 joint resolution of the US Congress. The United States currently owes the WHO more than $200 million in assessed contributions, according to the WHO website.After more than 70 years of membership, the United States moved to quit the WHO amid escalating tensions with China over the coronavirus pandemic. The virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. The WHO has denied assertions by Trump that it promoted Chinese “disinformation” about the virus.US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi described Trump’s official withdrawal as “an act of true senselessness as WHO coordinates the global fight against COVID-19.”“With millions of lives at risk, the President is crippling the international effort to defeat the virus,” the Democratic leader posted on Twitter.So far there have been nearly 12 million cases of the coronavirus and more than 540,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally, with about 25% of both cases and deaths in the United States.Trump’s decision could be overturned before it takes effect if he is defeated by his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, in a November election. Trump had halted funding for the 194-member organization in April, then in a May 18 letter gave the WHO 30 days to commit to reforms. He announced the United States would quit less than two weeks later.Vice President Mike Pence, asked in a Fox News Channel interview whether it was the right time to break with the WHO, said: “It’s absolutely the right time.”“The World Health Organization let the world down ... There have to be consequences to this,” Pence said.The WHO is an independent international body that works with the United Nations. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that the WHO is “absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against COVID-19.”“The Secretary-General ... is in the process of verifying with the World Health Organization whether all the conditions for such withdrawal are met,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Tuesday.Since taking office, Trump has also quit the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency, a global accord to tackle climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. He has also cut funding for the U.N. population fund and the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees.

According to the study, published in the journal Materials Today Physics, the device killed 99.8 per cent of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in a single pass through its filter. It said the device, made from commercially available nickel foam heated to 200 degrees Celsius, also killed 99.9 per cent of the spores of the deadly bacterium Bacillus anthracis which causes the anthrax disease.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  “This filter could be useful in airports and in airplanes, in office buildings, schools, and cruise ships to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Zhifeng Ren, a co-author of the study from the University of Houston (UH) in the US. “Its ability to help control the spread of the virus could be very useful for society,” Ren added. The researchers said they are also developing a desk-top model for the device which is capable of purifying the air in an office worker’s immediate surroundings. “Schools, transit systems, hospitals, airplanes, office buildings, other health care facilities and public settings would be first in line to receive the devices,” said Garrett K. Peel of Medistar, a Houston-based medical real estate development firm which partnered with UH for developing the device.According to the scientists, since the virus can remain in the air for about three hours, a filter that could remove it quickly was a viable plan, and with businesses reopening across the world, they believe controlling the spread in air conditioned spaces was urgent.Click here for complete coronavirus cases The study noted that the novel coronavirus cannot survive temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius, so by making the filter temperature far hotter -- about 200 degree Celsius, the researchers said they were able to kill the virus almost instantly. Ren said the nickel foam met several key requirements. “It is porous, allowing the flow of air, and electrically conductive, which allowed it to be heated. It is also flexible,” the researchers noted in a statement. But they added that nickel foam also had low resistivity, making it difficult to raise the temperature high enough to quickly kill the virus. The researchers said they solved this problem by folding the foam, connecting multiple compartments with electrical wires to increase the resistance high enough to raise the temperature as high as 250 degrees Celsius. By making the filter electrically heated, rather than heating it from an external source, they said the the amount of heat that escaped from the filter is minimised, allowing air conditioning to function with very low strain. When the scientists built and tested a prototype for the relationship between voltage/current and temperature, they said it satisfies the requirements for conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and could kill the coronavirus. “This novel biodefense indoor air protection technology offers the first-in-line prevention against environmentally mediated transmission of airborne SARS-CoV-2, and will be on the forefront of technologies available to combat the current pandemic and any future airborne biothreats in indoor environments,” said Faisal Cheema, another co-author of the study from UH. The researchers have called for a phased roll-out of the device, “beginning with high-priority venues, where essential workers are at elevated risk of exposure.” They believe the novel device will both improve safety for frontline workers in essential industries and allow nonessential workers to return to public work spaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-develop-catch-and-kill-air-filter-claim-it-can-kill-coronavirus/story-Y5WTKth3p5bb0Zd1mZwc1I.html
08-07-2020||World||Analysts in Beijing link Doklam to Galwan, say India aggressor in both cases||The June 15 violent clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley could be linked to the 2017 Doklam standoff, which was resolved through talks despite Indian troops remaining in territory claimed by China for 73 days, experts and local state media In China said. The experts suggest that China lost face in Doklam and was waiting for an opportunity to get back. In 2017, Indian troops had crossed over to Doklam (Donglang in Chinese) - a territory disputed between Bhutan and China - to prevent the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from building a road in the area as it could impact India’s strategic interests. New Delhi has historically supported Thimphu’s claim and said it was interceding on the latter’s behalf.Linking it to the 2017 Doklam standoff, Beijing-controlled state media has said the current tension in eastern Ladakh was triggered after the Indian Army crossed over to Chinese side to illegally build structures.India insists that the Chinese were the transgressors in Galwan in Eastern Ladakh.There is no official acknowledgment of it but the possibility of a link between the two standoffs has been making the rounds of state media, military websites and among Chinese analysts.Not said in as many words but the message from Chinese analysts is this: The PLA would not allow a new serious standoff, like in Doklam, in eastern Ladakh where it has better infrastructure, to end without a fight even if it sustained casualties in the process. China has admitted but is yet to reveal the PLA’s casualty figures but India lost 20 soldiers in the violent brawl between border troops on the night of June 15.“After all, China is stronger than India, with advantages in all aspects and a higher GDP than India. Last time (Doklam), we had already put up with one step and lost face. China has blood in its veins and is definitely going to do something,” Shanghai-based military expert Ni Lexiong told HT.A television programme broadcast on national broadcaster CCTV on July 6, and then published on its English channel CGTN’s YouTube handle directly, links the two recent most crises between India and China.With undated photographs and satellite imagery, it claimed that Indian border troops crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to the Chinese side.The host of the programme asks the two Chinese analysts about the “...timing of this incident coincides with the third anniversary of the Donglang incident, on June 18, 2017, when it was also the time when the Indian border troops unilaterally crossed the China-India border to obstruct our personnel who were working within our Line of Control, operating normally. From Donglang to the Galwan Valley, in your analysis, what does India want?”To be sure, this line of argument is also contrary to international perception, where Beijing is clearly viewed as the aggressor. One of the guest analysts at the programme, Ruan Zongze from the China Institute of International Studies, had this to say: “First of all, from Donglang to the Galwan Valley to today’s (current) developments, it shows that Indian side’s illegal cross-border violations were not an isolated incident. Three years ago, and precisely in June, border troops on the Indian side also illegally crossed into the Chinese side of the border,” Ruan said.“The boundary of the Donglang incident was clearly demarcated in 1890 and has since been confirmed by successive Indian governments, without any issue, no controversy, but India still took the provocative action of crossing the border. So this time, I think it’s a repeat of the same old trick,” Ruan said.This again seems to be an overstatement if not an outright lie - India hasn’t accepted that Doklam is part of China. However, the prevailing view in Beijing seems to be to paint India as the aggressor. Beijing-based military expert Song Zhongping said: “This time, like the Donglang crisis, India provoked China on the western border in an attempt to change the status quo and create trouble. This time India’s intentions are too obvious, the means are too extreme.”Talking to the nationalistic tabloid Global Times, Hu Zhiyong from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences had spoken on similar lines as early as May 18.“...that the Galwan Valley is not like Doklam because it is in the Aksai Chin region in southern Xinjiang of China, where the Chinese military has an advantage and mature infrastructure. So, if India escalates the friction, the Indian military force could pay a heavy price”.Ni, the Shanghai-based military expert quoted earlier, said the perception about the 2017 standoff in China is that Beijing backed down.Ni said: “There is not a lot of coverage in the country on the Doklam incident because we were the ones who backed down, I was thinking if that is the case, we are pretty furious, if we cannot build roads, then why India can build roads over there (Galwan Valley) now?”“Then when the officers and soldiers on our side saw it, they thought we were building the road (in Doklam) and you would not let us, so how can you build it? It is not equal, it is not fair, so people just go over there and stir up things,” Ni said.Not everyone, however, agrees to the Doklam link.Ketian Vivian Zhang, a China expert, who has written on how China uses coercion in face of national security issues, at George Mason University said if the core reason was about teaching India a lesson it would have made more sense for China to do it earlier.“I personally do not think the recent events date back to Doklam or took place because of Doklam. As I said before, the trend of increased Chinese militarised patrol and presence along the border has started since 2006, way before Doklam,” she said.An article in the Communist Party-run current affairs website Utopia in June, however, clearly indicated retaliation.Quoted by Hemant Adlakha, a professor of Chinese at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi in the Indian Defence Review, the article “...blamed Indian arrogance for its continuously provocative behaviour along the LAC. Irked and annoyed by India’s unrelenting belligerence in recent years, in particular in what happened in Doklam three years ago, the Chinese or the PLA it seems were waiting for an opportunity to ‘outpunch’ and humiliate India.”“To permanently resolve Indian belligerent attitude against China and ensure security along China’s western border, the time has now come for China to go for a decisive offensive against India and recover all Chinese territory under the Indian occupation, including southern Tibet,” the article added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/analysts-in-beijing-link-doklam-to-galwan-say-india-aggressor-in-both-cases/story-4x8cUUWwtXwBQO6naLum5L.html
08-07-2020||World||UK’s Sunak focuses on jobs with $2.5 billion for young workers||Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is set to unveil a 2 billion-pound ($2.5 billion) program to pay the wages of more than 200,000 young workers as he tries to pull the UK economy out of the deepest slump in centuries.It will be the centerpiece of the government’s three-point plan to protect, support and create jobs, the Treasury said in a statement late on Tuesday.“Young people bear the brunt of most economic crises, but they are at particular risk this time because they work in the sectors disproportionately hit by the pandemic,” Sunak said. “We also know that youth unemployment has a long-term impact on jobs and wages and we don’t want to see that happen to this generation.”With the UK immersed in possibly its deepest recession in 300 years, the chancellor will on Wednesday set out a package of measures to help the economy recover from more than three months of lockdown. While Sunak has made protecting jobs the core of his plan, he has repeatedly conceded he won’t be able to protect every role as he unwinds the unprecedented government aid that is funding the wages of more than 12 million workers.Sunak will also announce a stamp duty holiday for homes costing up to 500,000 pounds in an effort to revive the housing market, according to The Sun newspaper, while the Financial Times has reported he is considering a temporary cut to value added tax to boost the hospitality industry.“We do not comment on speculation about tax changes,” the Treasury said in a statement.‘Build, Build, Build’The chancellor plans to conduct a wider spending review and outline a further package of stimulus measures in the fall.Over the past week, the Treasury has outlined more than 4 billion pounds of measures to promote jobs, skills and energy efficiency. They include:In addition, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has brought forward 5 billion pounds of infrastructure spending on schools, hospitals and roads, pledging the UK will “build, build, build” to emerge from the crisis. The government also outlined a 1.6-billion pound bailout earlier this week to help struggling theaters and music venues, which have yet to be allowed to reopen.Meanwhile, jobless claims have more than doubled to almost three million and economists say the unemployment rate could reach double figures from 3.9% currently. Those predictions are informing Sunak’s decisions as he tries to preserve jobs. The impact of the outbreak on the economy so far has been stark: Economic output shrank a record 20.4% in April, and the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates Sunak’s efforts to support businesses and workers through the crisis will cost more than 130 billion pounds. They have already pushed the national debt above the size of the country’s gross domestic product for the first time since the 1960s.The measures to be outlined on Wednesday were billed by the Treasury as the biggest package to tackle youth unemployment in decades. Under the so-called Kickstart Scheme, the government will pay the wages of 16 to 24 year-olds who are claiming benefits while they undertake six-month placements. The state will pay the workers at the level of the national minimum wage for 25 hours a week, with employers able to top them up.The program will open for applications next month, with the first placements starting in the fall, according to the Treasury. It’s due to run until Dec. 2021, with the option to extend it.The Resolution Foundation, a London-based think tank, welcomed the measure, saying it could help around 350,000 young people into work -- but stressed it needs to be delivered quickly to be effective. Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress said it was a “good first step” to prevent a spike in youth unemployment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-sunak-focuses-on-jobs-with-2-5-billion-for-young-workers/story-ilTp7PXSy3X3Z05FoZ8JXO.html
08-07-2020||World||US airlines move toward federal loans as Covid-19 surge threatens demand, jobs||The largest US air carriers have all signed letters of intent on federal loans to help them weather the novel coronavirus, with United Airlines warning employees on Tuesday that a surge in outbreaks was hitting bookings, threatening a travel rebound and jobs.United employees should expect to receive as soon as this week notices about potential furloughs effective Oct. 1, the airline said in a regulatory filing. It expects travel demand to remain depressed until a widely accepted Covid-19 treatment or vaccine is found, with no straight line to an industry recovery.US airline shares closed 5% lower on Tuesday, with United down 7.6%.While travel had picked up in some areas over the past two months from pandemic-driven lows in April, United has seen reservations for travel within the coming month slide after New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said they would require people arriving from hot-spot states to quarantine for 14 days.The slump was most pronounced at United’s Newark hub, where near-term net bookings were just about 16% of year-ago levels as of July 1. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said the bookings trend was likely much broader than the New York area. Andrew Nocella, United’s chief commercial officer, told employees at a virtual town hall meeting on Tuesday that its network would be slightly more impacted than other US domestic airlines, sources said after the meeting.It is among US airlines encouraging employees to accept voluntary departure packages to help prevent tens of thousands of job losses in the fall but said not enough workers have signed up ahead of a July 15 deadline to apply.US airlines have drastically reduced their flight capacity and rushed to shore up capital while warning that tens of thousands of jobs could be at risk as the industry braces for a slow recovery.United sees domestic load factors at around 50% in July versus around 80% normally, with international loads around 30%, and will continue to adjust its capacity based on demand.Delta Air Lines said last week it may scale back the number of flights it had planned for August. United and Delta were among US carriers - along with Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines - that the US Treasury Department said on Tuesday had signed letters regarding the terms of a $25 billion loan package under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.Last week, the department said it had agreed on the terms for government loans under the CARES Act with five other airlines including American Airlines.US airlines have already received $25 billion in payroll aid under the CARES Act to protect jobs through September and have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to take the loan, which would include the issue of warrants and restrictions on executive compensation and share buybacks. US unions representing aviation workers have separately asked lawmakers to extend the payroll aid package through March as Congress considers a new round of spending to address coronavirus-related issues and jobs.

08-07-2020||World||Japan battered by more heavy rain, floods, nearly 60 dead||Pounding rain that already caused deadly floods in southern Japan was moving northeast Wednesday, battering large areas of Japan’s main island, swelling more rivers, triggering mudslides and destroying houses and roads. At least 58 people have died in several days of flooding.By Wednesday morning, parts of Nagano and Gifu in central Japan were flooded by massive downpours.Footage on NHK television showed swollen water in the Hida River gouging into the embankment, destroying a national highway along the river. In another central Japanese city of Gero, river water rose to just below the bridge above it.In a mountainous town of Takayama, several houses were hit by a mudslide, with uprooted trees and other debris scattered around. It was not immediately known what happened to their residents.Across the country, about 3.6 million people were advised to evacuate, although evacuation is not mandatory and the number of people who actually took shelter was not provided.As of Wednesday morning, the death toll from the heavy rains starting over the weekend had risen to 58, most of them from the hardest-hit Kumamoto prefecture. Four others were found in Fukuoka, another prefecture on Kyushu, Japan’s third-largest island.Though the rains were causing fresh flooding threats in central Japan, flooding was still affecting the southern region. And search and rescue operations continued in Kumamoto, where 14 people are still missing.Tens of thousands of army troops, police and other rescue workers mobilized from around the country to assist, and the rescue operations have been hampered by the rains, flooding, mudslides and disrupted communications.Japan is at high risk of heavy rain in early summer when wet and warm air from the East China Sea flows into a seasonal rain front above the country. In July 2018, more than 200 people, about half of them in Hiroshima, died from heavy rain and flooding in southwestern Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-battered-by-more-heavy-rain-floods-nearly-60-dead/story-ipfkq7SxlSuxUnGeCsMTAN.html
08-07-2020||World||AirAsia’s future in ‘significant doubt,’ Ernst & Young warns||AirAsia Group Bhd.’s ability to continue as a going concern may be in “significant doubt” because of the impact the coronavirus is having on the indebted carrier, auditor Ernst & Young said.The airline’s current liabilities already exceeded its current assets by 1.84 billion ringgit ($430 million) at the end of 2019, a year when it posted a 283 million ringgit net loss, Ernst & Young said in a statement to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange Wednesday. The financial performance and cash flow have now been further hit by virus-related travel restrictions.The slump in air travel and the carrier’s financial performance “indicate existence of material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” Ernst & Young said in its unqualified audit opinion statement.Covid-19 plunged the aviation industry globally into crisis as border controls and health concerns vaporized demand for air travel. AirAsia on Monday reported a record quarterly loss of 803.8 million ringgit. It wasn’t until late March and the end of the quarter that the budget airline suspended flights.“This is by far the biggest challenge we have faced since we began in 2001,” AirAsia’s Chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes said in a statement Monday.He said the carrier is in talks for joint-ventures and collaborations that may result in additional investment, and it has also applied for bank loans and is weighing proposals to raise capital.Last month, South Korean conglomerate SK Group said it was reviewing a proposal to buy a small stake in the airline. In May, AirAsia sent a memo to Malaysian banks seeking to borrow 1 billion ringgit, people familiar with the matter said at the time.AirAsia said in an exchange filing Wednesday that Ernst & Young’s statement and a decline in shareholder equity triggered the criteria for a so-called Practice Note 17, which applies to financially distressed companies. However, the airline won’t be classified as PN17 as the Malaysian exchange suspended application of the status from April through June next year as part of relief measures in light of the coronavirus pandemic.AirAsia’s shares were suspended from trading in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. They will resume trading at 2:30 p.m. local time.AirAsia needs at least 2 billion ringgit this year to stay afloat, according to K. Ajith, an aviation analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Singapore.“There’s not a lot of options, and the best one could be the government stepping in but seeking a rights offering by the company in exchange,” he said.Despite the warnings, there are signs of improvement with the gradual lifting of restrictions on interstate travel and domestic tourism activities in the countries where AirAsia and its units operate, Ernst & Young said.The airline’s recovery depends on government policies on travel, discussions with financial institutions and investors and its ability to address concerns of its liabilities, the auditor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airasia-s-future-in-significant-doubt-ernst-young-warns/story-O90f2NP1qtvVASNKjVOZrI.html
08-07-2020||World||India returnee tests Covid-19 positive in New Zealand, escapes isolation to go shopping: Report||A 32-year-old man, who recently returned from India and tested positive for the deadly coronavirus on Wednesday, will be charged with absconding from a managed isolation facility in Auckland to go to a supermarket, according to media reports. The man, New Zealand’s latest new case of Covid-19 announced on Wednesday, escaped through a fenced area from an isolation facility about 6.50pm on Tuesday, the New Zealand Herald reported. He has been sent to a quarantine facility after he was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Wednesday. However, the man was asymptomatic and did not appear to have come into close or casual contact with anyone, the report said.The man, whose identity was not immediately known, came from New Delhi on July 3, it added.Health Minister Chris Hipkins has slammed the man’s actions as “selfish” and says he will face charges, the report said.But he wouldn’t describe the episode as a failure of the government’s processes, and even though those processes will now be reviewed, he said if anyone should apologise it was the man who broke the law.Hipkins said the man appeared to have made a spur of the moment decision and dashed through a gap where fencing was being replaced.A security guard was observing the area but confused the man with contractors working on the fencing. The alarm was raised within minutes but security were unable to find the man.Hipkins said the man may have spent 20 minutes in the supermarket on Victoria St West, and he returned of his own volition 70 minutes after leaving, the report added.He will be charged and now face up to a six-month jail sentence or a $4000 fine, the report added.After the man’s positive test result came on Wednesday, the supermarket staff are now self-isolating and will also be tested for the virus, the Stuff reported. ”CCTV footage from within the supermarket has confirmed there was no close contact between the man and any staff or customers during his time there,” head of managed isolation and quarantine Air Commodore Darryn Webb said. There are now 23 active Covid-19 cases in New Zealand, all in managed isolation or quarantine, and 1187 confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-returnee-tests-covid-19-positive-in-new-zealand-escapes-isolation-to-go-shopping-report/story-cNZS9etmxFOWC2C84LxZMI.html
08-07-2020||World||Boeing has settled almost all Lion Air crash-death claims||Boeing Co. said it settled 90% of the wrongful death claims filed in a U.S. court over the 2018 crash of a 737 Max jet operated by Lion Air.Claims relating to 171 of the 189 people on board Lion Air Flight JT 610 have been settled, Boeing said Tuesday in a Chicago federal court filing. The company didn’t say how much it paid the families or estates of the passengers and crew members killed in the crash.Of the resolved cases, five were partially settled because they involved more than one claim per person killed or involved claims represented by more than one law firm, Chicago-based Boeing said. The company said it is optimistic that the remaining cases will be resolved.The crash occurred over the Java Sea in October 2018 and was followed five months later by another 737 Max crash in Ethiopia that killed 157 people. The disasters led to lawsuits alleging the jets were unsafe and had a faulty software system. The 737 fleet has been grounded, Boeing sales have plunged and the U.S. government is investigating the aircraft’s flight-control system.“There are some remaining cases with extraordinary losses, including kids completely orphaned who lost both parents,” said Sanjiv Singh, a lawyer representing families of some victims. “It remains to be seen whether we can bring Boeing to the table on these cases.”Singh said he is prepared to go to court, including in the U.S., to settle those remaining cases.A year ago, Boeing said it would offer $100 million to support the families of victims and communities of those affected by the crashes.“Boeing has been working diligently to settle these cases through a mediation process,” Peter Pedraza, a company spokesman, said in an email. “We are pleased to have made significant progress in recent months in resolving cases brought by the victims’ families on terms that we believe fairly compensate them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-has-settled-almost-all-lion-air-crash-death-claims/story-I0tjnCvjeOXJEhwe5MkinN.html
08-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Texas passes 10,000 confirmed in single day||Texas surpassed 10,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day Tuesday for the first time, crossing a sobering milestone rarely seen since the pandemic first hit the US in March.The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of Covid-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be “an alarm bell for everybody” who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.“We have rapid spread of Covid-19 in the state of Texas right now,” Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party’s convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation’s hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and US — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.“Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,” said Michael Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility’s beds. “The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.”The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas canceled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to Covid-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-texas-passes-10-000-confirmed-in-single-day/story-CtXLC9t0sAtN3dU0IStcQI.html
08-07-2020||World||Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg disappoint once again||Facebook Inc. still doesn’t get it.A widely anticipated meeting on Tuesday between the social media giant and the civil rights groups behind the recent Facebook ad boycott — including the Anti-Defamation League, NAACP and Color of Change — did not go well. The New York Times reported CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg met for about an hour on a video-conference call, but offered little in terms of concessions related to their policies for managing content on their social networks.A negative response came swiftly. “It was abundantly clear in our meeting today that Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook team is not yet ready to address the vitriolic hate on their platform,” the groups said in a statement. “Instead of actually responding to the demands of dozens of the platform’s largest advertisers that have joined the #StopHateForProfit ad boycott during the month of July, Facebook wants us to accept the same old rhetoric, repackaged as a fresh response.”The representatives said Facebook offered to address just one of the groups’ 10 demands — the company was willing to create a position focused on promoting civil rights — but it didn’t promise to do so at the asked-for C-suite level. Otherwise, the company did not give an inch for the other nine demands, according to the groups.Frankly, Facebook’s inaction is not a surprise. The company has gone to this “hunkering down” playbook many times in the past. The old aphorism that says incentives often drive behavior seems to hold true for this tech giant. And on a pure dollars-and-cents level, the company is incentivized to do as little as possible.We all know the worst types of content — such as hate speech, misinformation and false conspiracies, along with the outrage surrounding them — tend to be more viral and generate more page-views for social media firms. The upside for Facebook in elevating such engaging content is obvious, but the downside to society as a whole is vast — from mental-health issues to giving rise to scientifically discredited  ideas such as the anti-vaxer movement. The brains of millions go down these poisonous rabbit holes. Given Facebook’s recent stock performance, Zuckerberg may feel even less pressure now. After a brief decline late last month, amid the frantic coverage of advertiser pledges to pull ads from Facebook’s platforms, the shares are now back near all-time highs again. At the end of it all, the boycott was mainly about headline risk, not significant sales risk for Facebook. Last week, I argued Facebook should act on the back of a sea-change in perception and beliefs after the recent wave of protests over racial injustice, adding the true risk for the company was the prospect of future political blow-back, not a near-term revenue hit. That view still stands.The strange thing is, meeting the civil rights groups’ demands isn’t such a big lift for a company with Facebook’s resources. Most of them are simply common sense. Following the meeting Tuesday, the civil rights groups reiterated them. Here’s a brief selection:Provide audit of and refund to advertisers whose ads were shown next to content that was later removed for violations of terms of service. Isn’t that just good customer service? Wouldn’t that assuage Facebook’s advertisers worried about brand safety placement, giving them confidence Facebook will take content moderation more seriously?Stop recommending or otherwise amplifying groups or content from groups associated with hate, misinformation or conspiracies to users. Not a big ask.Enable individuals facing severe hate and harassment to connect with a live Facebook employee. That’s just a question of being willing to spend some money for something worthwhile.Unfortunately, it looks like Facebook will keep disappointing its critics. Last week, Zuckerberg told his employees that advertisers will eventually return and they will not change their policies under duress, according to The Information. “I tend to think that if someone goes out there and threatens you to do something, that actually kind of puts you in a box where in some ways it’s even harder to do what they want because now it looks like you’re capitulating,” the executive reportedly said.For now, he may feel a sense of vindication. But instead of focusing on how it looks and establishing bad precedent, perhaps Zuckerberg should instead reassess his thinking and come to terms to this reality: The moral fabric of our society is fraying amid the disinformation propagated on his platform.There may be a ray of light, however, small. Facebook said it will release its independent civil rights audit report on Wednesday after a two-year review of its policies and practices. Sandberg explained in a blog post the company has heeded some of the recommendations from the report already, but won’t make all the changes they asked for.There is still room for real action. Let’s hope Facebook decides to do the right thing.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

08-07-2020||World||US, South Korean officials discuss North Korea strategy as Pyongyang rejects talks||The US point man for North Korea met with South Korean officials in Seoul on Wednesday for talks, overshadowed by Pyongyang’s insistence that it has no intention of returning to denuclearisation negotiations any time soon.Stephen Biegun, who led working-level negotiations with the North Koreans and now has broader responsibility as US Deputy Secretary of State, met briefly with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha before holding longer meetings with Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young and chief nuclear negotiator Lee Do-hoon.Talks covered a range of issues, including coronavirus responses and ongoing negotiations over military cost-sharing, but North Korea dominated the agenda, Seoul officials said.In a brief conversation, Kang told Biegun he had come at an important time for political developments and also after South Korean President Moon Jae-in recently reshuffled some of his senior North Korea policy aides.After meeting with Cho, Biegun said the United States is fully engaged in seeking peace on the Korean peninsula, would continue to cooperate closely with South Korea, and is “looking forward” to making progress on the issue this year.Biegun is likely to meet with Suh Hoon, Moon’s new national security advisor who, as spy chief, was instrumental in facilitating summits between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a Seoul official said.Talks with Pyongyang have since stalled, and North Korean officials say the country has no intention to sit down with the United States.Trump said on Tuesday he is open to another meeting with Kim and thinks it might be helpful, Voice of America reported, citing a transcript of an interview Trump gave to Atlanta, Georgia-based Gray Television, due to be aired on Sunday.Kim has been maintaining a low profile in recent months, making far fewer public appearances than usual, according to analysts who monitor his movements. On Wednesday, North Korean state media reported Kim had marked the anniversary of the death of his grandfather, North Korea’s founding leader Kim Il Sung, by visiting his mausoleum at Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun.NORTH KOREA NOT ENGAGING  Moon’s call for a new Trump-Kim summit and Biegun’s visit had sparked speculation of a last-ditch effort to try to revive North Korea talks ahead of the US presidential election in November.But Biegun has previously played down the likelihood of another in-person summit between Trump and Kim, saying the coronavirus pandemic made arranging such an event unlikely before the election.Upon arrival in South Korea on Tuesday, Biegun and the entire US delegation, as well as the American military air crew who piloted their aircraft, underwent tests for Covid-19 at the US military base in South Korea where they landed. After the tests came back negative, the delegation continued on to Seoul.Besides the coronavirus challenges, North Korea’s strident rejections of new talks also means Biegun’s visit is more likely to focus on coordination between the two allies, rather than seizing some opening for diplomacy, said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul.“I don’t see signals from North Korea that they are looking for engagement,” he said.Coordination between the two long-time allies is critical now, said Duyeon Kim, a senior advisor at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based independent non-profit organisation.“The allies should get on the same page about upcoming defence drills, how their working group can support inter-Korean projects while enforcing existing sanctions, and how to jointly respond if Pyongyang escalates or tests more weapons,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-south-korean-officials-discuss-north-korea-strategy-as-pyongyang-rejects-talks/story-aFLSk2L7GYoiKInoKJLZxN.html
08-07-2020||World||China converts Hong Kong hotel into new national security office||China opened its new national security office in Hong Kong on Wednesday, turning a hotel near a city-centre park that has been one of the most popular venues for pro-democracy protests into its new headquarters.The office, in the bustling shopping and commercial district of Causeway Bay, near Victoria Park, will oversee the Hong Kong government’s enforcement of the sweeping national security legislation that China imposed on the city last week.The law empowers the office to take enforcement action beyond existing city laws in the most serious cases. The legislation allows agents to take suspects across the border for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts and specifies special privileges for its agents, including that Hong Kong authorities cannot inspect their vehicles.The newly appointed chief of the office, Zheng Yanxiong, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and Luo Huining, the head of China’s Liaison Office in the city - Beijing’s top representative office - attended the opening ceremony at the former Metropark Hotel, which was popular with tourists for its harbour views.Luo said the office was “the gatekeeper of national security” and people who loved China and Hong Kong welcomed it.“Those with ulterior motives and who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong have not only stigmatized the office, but also smeared the legal system and rule of law in the Chinese mainland in an attempt to stir up unnecessary worries and fears among Hong Kong residents,” Luo said. Security was tight around the hotel, with tall barriers raised and numerous police on duty nearby.‘LEGITIMATE RIGHTS’The law has pushed China’s freest city onto a more authoritarian path and drawn condemnation from some Western governments, lawyers and rights groups.It punishes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. Police have arrested at least 10 people, including a 15-year-old, under it for suspected threats to China’s national security. Critics fear it will crush coveted freedoms in the Chinese-ruled city, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of sometimes violent protests that plunged the former British colony into its biggest crisis in decades.Zheng said the office would enforce the law strictly “without infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of any individual or organisation”.A Communist Party cadre prominent during a 2011 clampdown on land rights protesters in a south China village, 57-year-old Zheng most recently served as secretary general of the Communist Party committee of Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong.Leaked footage during the 2011 dispute showed him berating villagers and calling foreign media “rotten”.Zheng has never held a post outside Guangdong and has extensive experience in propaganda, having worked at the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily in its southern regional bureau for four years. He was vice minister in charge of propaganda for Guangdong from 2013 to 2018.But in a reflection of the widespread unease over the legislation, major U.S. internet companies including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Zoom have announced they have suspended the processing of requests for user data from the Hong Kong authorities while they study it.Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, which only operates outside China, said on Tuesday it would exit the Hong Kong market within days.

We lost our best chance at defeating this virus once the President began to minimize the pandemic and shift blame onto others, instead of assuming responsibility and actually leading,” he said in a tweet responding to the report of Trump administration formally withdrawing US from WHO.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here In a series of tweets, Bera hit out at President Trump accusing him of trying to shift the blame even as Covid-19 cases in US are surging.“#COVID19 cases are surging across the U.S. Instead of funding a national testing strategy and ramping up testing and contact tracing, the President has chosen to cut testing and to shift the blame by withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization,” he said.He also noted that by withdrawing from WHO, President Trump has further abdicated US global leadership.“His go-it-alone approach puts America’s health and security at risk, and allows other countries (China) to step in and write the rules,” he said.Meanwhile former Vice President and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden promised to rejoin WHO on first day if elected as President.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Americans are safer when America is engaged in strengthening global health.

The study, an excerpt of which was published in science journal, ‘Nature’, suggests that immune responses, rather than the virus itself, are largely responsible for death in Covid-19 patients.“Numerous studies have suggested that the immune system contributes to the organ damage seen in some severe cases of Covid-19,” the paper read.The study was conducted by the experts at the University of Edinburgh, UK, wherein little correlation was found between levels of the virus and inflammation.The study was carried out by conducting detailed autopsies to map signs of Covid-19 in the body, along with sites of inflammation and injury.Also read: Over 6 months into Covid-19 crisis, 5 mysteries that still shroud coronavirusExperts and scientists are racing to arrive at the first potential vaccine against coronavirus.

08-07-2020||World||Mexico president heads to Washington for meeting with Trump||For his first foreign trip as president, Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador travels to Washington Tuesday to meet with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken shots at Mexico and Mexican migrants to rally his base.The visit, coming just four months before US elections, has many Mexicans cringing. Trump has insulted them, threatened crippling tariffs to strongarm Mexico into playing an uncomfortable role in US immigration policy and insisted they will pay for a border wall meant to keep migrants out of the USBut López Obrador has had a surprisingly warm relationship with Trump. He likes to point out that more recently Trump helped Mexico reach a deal with other oil-producing nations to cut production and aided Mexico in obtaining more ventilators to face the coronavirus pandemic. Both presidents talk about a blossoming friendship that seems to stem from their pursuit of unapologetically nationalist agendas.López Obrador hints at the real reason for the trip when he reels off US economic statistics — the size of the US pandemic stimulus package, the number of jobs the US got back in June. Mexico’s economy was in recession before the pandemic, has shed about 1 million jobs since and is forecast to contract this year by as much as 10%.“This helps us by being neighbors,” López Obrador said Tuesday, before departing. “This is about the economy, it’s about jobs, it’s about well-being.”By late Tuesday his flight had arrived in Dulles International Airport after a layover in Atlanta.There is no doubt Trump will try to use the visit to his advantage. The encounter will draw attention to a trade accord replacing one Trump said was a bad deal and will allow the president to bash former Vice President Joe Biden for voting in favor of the old North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump could stir his base with sharp words for Mexico or simply play up López Obrador’s desire to express his gratitude.In 2016, Trump, then a candidate for the presidency, visited López Obrador’s predecessor, an invitation for which President Enrique Peña Nieto was harshly criticized, inlcuding by López Obrador. Trump left that visit and flew to Arizona where he railed against immigrants.López Obrador, a pragmatist and nationalist above all, knows there is no more important ally than the behemoth to the north, especially as Mexico’s economy plunges deeper into recession. If Trump wins a second term, López Obrador could be calculating he’ll have a friend for the remaining four years of his administration. If the Democrats take office, he trusts they will respect the importance of the bilateral relationship and not hold a grudge.“Maybe he’s making the right bet and we don’t know it,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, associate professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. She expects Trump to use the visit to rally his base, perhaps even reviving the claim that Mexico will pay for the border wall, a topic López Obrador repeatedly dodged Tuesday.“He’s conscious of what can happen,” she said. “It happened to Peña Nieto. It can easily happen to him.”López Obrador insists that he has no desire to be drawn into US domestic politics. He says he’s going to mark the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which took effect July 1.“There is no way (López Obrador) can spin this visit in his favor,” said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.Payan said the trade accord doesn’t merit wading into US political waters. “The (trade) agreement is done, finished and in force,” he said. “There is no need to thank anyone. There is no need to express any kind of gratitude. There is no need for a pilgrimage.”That’s a decision Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apparently reached in deciding not to attend the meeting.On Monday, López Obrador added another reason.“If we have a good relationship with the United States government, we are going to avoid mistreatment” of Mexicans living in the US, López Obrador said. López Obrador has repeatedly raised the importance of the remittances sent home by migrants and praised them as heroes.Payan said immigration is always on the bilateral agenda, but he sees little chance for Mexico winning any concessions from Trump, whose administration continues to curtail legal and illegal immigration.“I think Trump is more interested in restricting access to the American labor market today more than ever,” Payan said.Mexico’s worrisome level of violence — 2019 saw the highest number of murders on record — could be an opening. López Obrador could ask for more US assistance in intelligence or tracking drug traffickers’ financial transactions. He says he won’t undermine Mexico’s sovereignty and has been a harsh critic of the Merida Initiative that brought US financial and material support to Mexico as his predecessors battled the cartels.For Trump, the visit is an opportunity to criticize his opponent for supporting NAFTA more than two decades ago, possibling helping garner votes in the Midwest states where workers blamed the old trade deal for prompting US companies to shift manufacturing to Mexico, where labor costs were lower.Trump said replacing the “disastrous NAFTA trade deal” was one of the biggest promises he made to his supporters in 2016. Trade was perhaps the single biggest reason he ran for president in the first place, Trump says.He is fond of saying that after NAFTA was created, the US lost one in four manufacturing jobs while asserting that the new deal will create nearly 100,000 new, high-paying American auto jobs, boost exports for US farmers and ranchers and increase trade with Mexico and Canada.Trump is correct that the United States has lost nearly 4 million factory jobs since that pact took effect in January 1994. But most economists attribute the losses more to the recessions of 2001 and 2007-2009, automation and low-cost competition from China.Biden has said he didn’t regret voting for NAFTA during his time in the Senate. “Fair trade is important,” Biden has said. “Not free trade. Fair trade. And I think that back in the time during the Clinton administration, it made sense at the moment.”From López Obrador’s perspective, a good relationship with whoever occupies the White House is Mexico’s best policy.“We’re going to offer our opinion, but we’re not planning for confrontation,” López Obrador said Tuesday. “We’re going to look to convince, we’re going to seek understanding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-president-heads-to-washington-for-meeting-with-trump/story-cc2aqh1qj5G95qpV8syROO.html
08-07-2020||World||HCQ for Covid-19 highly politicised in US, widely used in India: White House official||The use of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients has become highly politicized in the US but it is used widely in India, a top White House official has said, asserting latest research showed the malaria drug is highly effective in early stages of Covid-19.“It’s the politicization of this medicine by the mainstream media and portions of the medical community that somehow made this a battle between President Trump and them and created this undue fear and hysteria over a drug, a medicine that has been used for over 60 years relatively safely and is regularly prescribed to pregnant women if they are going to a malaria zone,” White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro told reporters.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “The idea that this is a dangerous drug is just silly, but if you ask the American people based on the media’s coverage of it, that is kind of the state of play right now,” he said.Navarro said a day earlier four doctors at the Detroit Hospital System filed a request for emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine. The request was for three things.“One, for early treatment use in a hospital setting. Number two, treatment between a doctor and his patient in an outpatient setting. Three, not just as a therapeutic but also as a possible prophylaxis for preventative use,” he said.This request to the FDA comes on the heels of the publication of their study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases last week that showed an astonishing 50 percent reduction in the mortality rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine, Navarro said.“Give hydroxy a chance, and please don’t contribute to hydroxy hysteria because if it’s prescribed under the supervision of a doctor, the odds that it can harm you are way, way smaller than the odds that it can help you,” Navarro said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “This has become a highly politicized, but India uses this widely for prophylaxis. There is a number of studies which point to this actually working,” White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro told reporters.The official said if he were to show any kind of symptoms, he would first ask his doctor whether hydroxychloroquine is appropriate. “And then I wouldn’t hesitate to take it,” he said.He said if one looks at the 14-day arc of the virus from the beginning of symptoms, the first seven days are critical: when a person may have fever, dry cough, possibly a profound sense of fatigue.“At that point, your lungs are still intact, and the virus is not appreciably spread to the rest of your organs. Hydroxychloroquine, based on the science in articles like the one that originally appeared in 2005 in the Journal of Virology, works in a therapeutic way by raising the alkalinity of your cells which slows the replication of the virus and also can kill the virus,” he said.It also has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is why it is used for rheumatoid arthritis, and the drug can therefore also help manage what is called the cytokine storm, he said.The latest request to the FDA also comes on the heels of two decisions by the FDA over the last several months to shut down hydroxychloroquine.“The first was what is called a black box warning, the second was a withdrawal of an EUA and what I can tell you as someone who works with the Health and Human Services Department and FEMA to manage the stockpiles of hydroxychloroquine the FDA decisions that they made which I think were precipitous and based on bad science had a tremendously negative effect on two things,” he noted.“One is the ability for American people to use this medicine to protect themselves and two, the ability for hospitals like the Detroit Hospital System to recruit patients for the kind of randomized blind clinical trials that everybody wants to settle once and for all the questions of efficacy and safety,” he added.FDA’s previous decision to reject the emergency use authorization, he said, was based on two types of studies. “One set of studies that were poorly designed and basically doomed to failure, another set of studies where if you look carefully at the data it is very clear that these were late treatment studies where the medicine would not work,” he added.Navarro said the Detroit doctors are bringing back to the FDA a clear case for early treatment.“If the results of the Detroit study are confirmed in later studies, President Trump was absolutely right that hydroxychloroquine can save lives and if in fact early treatment use can lead to a 50 percent reduction in mortality that is tens of thousands of American lives that are at stake by a phenomenon which I call hydroxy hysteria,” Navarro said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-highly-politicised-in-us-widely-used-in-india-white-house-official/story-kLGI8mV7GVEXzpQWOc2cZP.html
08-07-2020||World||US tops three million known infections as coronavirus surges||The US coronavirus outbreak crossed a grim milestone of over 3 million confirmed cases on Tuesday as more states reported record numbers of new infections, and Florida faced an impending shortage of intensive care unit hospital beds.Authorities have reported alarming upswings of daily caseloads in roughly two dozen states over the past two weeks, a sign that efforts to control transmission of the novel coronavirus have failed in large swaths of the country.California, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas on Tuesday shattered their previous daily record highs for new cases. The biggest jumps occurred in Texas and California, the two largest US states, with more than 10,000 each. About 24 states have reported disturbingly high infection rates as a percentage of diagnostic tests conducted over the past week.In Texas alone, the number of hospitalized patients more than doubled in just two weeks. The trend has driven many more Americans to seek out COVID-19 screenings. The US Department of Health and Human Services said on Tuesday it was adding short-term “surge” testing sites in three metropolitan areas in Florida, Louisiana and Texas.In Houston, a line of more than 200 cars snaked around the United Memorial Medical Center as people waited hours in sweltering heat to get tested. Some had arrived the night before to secure a place in line at the drive-through site.“I got tested because my younger brother got positive,” said Fred Robles, 32, who spent the night in his car. “There’s so many people that need to get tested, there’s nothing you can do about it.”Dean Davis, 32, who lost his job due to the pandemic, said he arrived at the testing site at 3 a.m. Tuesday after he waited for hours on Monday but failed to make the cutoff.“I was like, let me get here at 3, maybe nobody will be here,” Davis said. “I got here, there was a line already.”In Florida, more than four dozen hospitals across 25 of 67 counties reported their intensive care units had reached full capacity, according to the state’s Agency for Health Care Administration. Only 17% of the total 6,010 adult ICU beds statewide were available on Tuesday, down from 20% three days earlier. Additional hospitalizations could strain healthcare systems in many areas, leading to an uptick in lives lost from the respiratory illness that has killed more than 131,000 Americans to date. At least 923 of those deaths were reported Tuesday, the biggest single-day toll since June 10 but still far fewer than the record 2,806 tallied back in April. A widely cited mortality model from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projected on Tuesday that US deaths would reach 208,000 by Nov. 1, with the outbreak expected to gain new momentum heading into the fall.A hoped-for summertime decline in transmission of the virus never materialized, the IHME said. “The US didn’t experience a true end of the first wave of the pandemic,” the IHME’s director, Dr. Christopher Murray, said in a statement. “This will not spare us from a second surge in the fall, which will hit particularly hard in states currently seeing high levels of infections.” ‘PRESSURE ON GOVERNORS’President Donald Trump, who has pushed for restarting the US economy and urged Americans to return to their normal routines, said on Tuesday he would lean on state governors to open schools in the fall.Speaking at the White House, Trump said some people wanted to keep schools closed for political reasons. “No way, so we’re very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools.”New COVID-19 infections are rising in 42 states, based on a Reuters analysis of the past two weeks. By Tuesday afternoon, the number of confirmed US cases had surpassed 3 million, affecting nearly one of every 100 Americans and a population roughly equal to Nevada’s.In Arizona, another hot spot, the rate of coronavirus tests coming back positive rose to 26% for the week ended July 5, leading two dozen states with positivity rates exceeding 5%. The World Heath Organization considers a rate over 5% to be troubling.The surge has forced authorities to backpedal on moves to reopen businesses, such as restaurants and bars, after mandatory lockdowns in March and April reduced economic activity to a virtual standstill and put millions of Americans out of work.The Texas state fair, which had been scheduled to open on Sept. 25, has been canceled for the first time since World War Two, organizers announced on Tuesday.In Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine said the state was ordering people in seven counties to wear face coverings in public starting Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tops-three-million-known-infections-as-coronavirus-surges/story-sEqkWXe8oWuMGJcVSx612M.html
08-07-2020||World||Policy change on international students is misguided, say US universities and lawmakers||Several Congressman and top educational institutions decried the policy change that will require international students who are in the United States with an F-1 visa to take at least one in-person course or else face the prospect of being deported.But the the State Department asserted that many international students who had planned to study this fall in the US may still have the opportunity to do so.The State Department’s statement comes a day after the new guideline created panic among international students, the largest number of whom come from China and India.Congressman Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, and Congresswoman Kathleen Rice, chairwoman of the Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations Subcommittee, said in a joint statement that the new policy will damage the economy, harm US institutions, and do nothing to improve America’s safety or security.Also read: Donald Trump is wrong, yet again | HT Editorial“There is no apparent legitimate reason for the (Trump) administration’s inflexibility toward international students attending colleges and universities that adopt ‘online-only’ policies – the Administration seems to just want them to leave,” the two lawmakers said.International students contribute billions of dollars to the US economy and barring them from our country will deprive Americans of badly needed income. “We cannot allow President Trump to continue destroying jobs and cause needless suffering just to satisfy his anti-immigrant base. We oppose this reckless policy and the lasting harm it will cause to universities and communities across the country,” they said.Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne expressed concern that the decision will create more uncertainty and complexity for international students.“Our international students must be able to continue making progress toward completing their degrees, and as a university we intend to support them in doing so. We will be working with our peers and national associations to understand how best to accomplish that in the context of these new rules, as well as to urge the Administration to rethink its position,” he said.The State Department, which issues visas to international students, however said the decision is temporary. “This will allow a mixture of both in-person and some online coursework to meet the requirements for nonimmigrant student status,” it said.This temporary accommodation provides greater flexibility for nonimmigrant students to continue their education in the United States, while also allowing for proper social distancing on open and operating campuses across America, the State Department said.“International students will still have to obtain the appropriate visa and may still be subject to other visa processing or travel restrictions due to COVID-19. Students should check with the local US embassy or consulate for information specific to their country,” it said.In a statement, the Embassy of India Student Hub encouraged students to monitor their university’s official channels for university/program specific information and to remain in contact with their university DSOs for additional questions.“We will issue updates in the coming days as we receive more clarity on this broadcast message,” it said.Congresswoman Debbie Dengell urged the Department of Homeland Security to review its decision.“Removing these students due to circumstances beyond their control is senseless and concerning. There does not appear to be any public benefit to the US, it will harm the quality of education students receive because of the many logistical challenges, while not in the classroom many remain on campus and in the community contributing to educations and cultural experiences in many other ways, and many have already signed leases and paid tuition as well,” she said.Among all the uncertainty, it’s disturbing that the federal government would initiate removal proceedings for international students especially given it is a reversal of an earlier decision taken by the agency at the on-set of the pandemic, she said.“Online courses are safe and sensible ways for universities to protect their students while continuing to provide a quality education while scientists study the best way to ensure students can learn in a safe environment,” the Congresswoman said.“With the high probability that the coronavirus pandemic will continue to make distance learning the predominant mode of instruction at colleges across the country, the rule change means that most of the estimated 1.1 million international students will be forced out of the country in September,” Chancellor Felix V Matis Rodriguez of the City University of New York said.In a statement, he said that this misguided policy change also threatens to hurt higher education at a time when the nation’s universities are working hard to adjust to the dual health and economic crises caused by the pandemic.“We are once again disappointed that our country’s leadership continues to restrict and reduce opportunities for those who seek them in the United States,” he said adding that he has instructed his administration to explore and pursue measures that would help these students remain in the country and continue their education at CUNY.

08-07-2020||World||Over 6 months into Covid-19 crisis, 5 mysteries that still shroud coronavirus||More than half of the year has already passed and the coronavirus pandemic does not seem to be slowing down with the global tally crossing 11 million recently. More than 50 percent of the patients ( more than 6 million) across the globe have recovered from the deadly contagion while over 5 lakh people have succumbed to death. With over 7 lakh patients, India stands at the third spot after the US and Brazil. The virus which first broke out in China’s Wuhan last year is yet to see a potential vaccine and treatment options and has many mysteries associated with it that need to be demystified. In its latest entry, science journal ‘Nature’ calls for a pressing need to unearth answers to five mysteries linked to coronavirus. So far, science has managed to figure out how the virus “enters and hijacks cells, how some people fight it off and how it eventually kills others. They have identified drugs that benefit the sickest patients, and many more potential treatments are in the works. They have developed nearly 200 potential vaccines — the first of which could be proved effective by the end of the year,” the journal read.However, the journal sheds light on some of the key questions that researchers still don’t have answers to with respect to the disease. These include the following:1. Why do people respond so differently?It is a well-known fact that children and the elderly, especially those with comorbidities, are more susceptible to the virus and experience the severity of the disease, however, it still needs to be understood what makes people respond differently to the virus. 2. What’s the nature of immunity and how long does it last?Immunologists and experts have been trying to determine what immunity to coronavirus disease look like and how long it might last. “Studies have found that levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remain high for a few weeks after infection, but then typically begin to wane,” the journal entry titled, ‘Six months of coronavirus: the mysteries scientists are still racing to solve,’ read.Also read: Masks, sanitisers out of essentials’ list3. Has the virus developed any worrying mutations?Much speculation is around the possible mutation of the virus as it travelled across the continent after first taking shape in China last year. 4. How well will a vaccine work?A growing body of experts and scientists believe that the Covid-19 vaccine would not be for the masses as most people end up recovering on their own from the contagion. The vaccine may target the vulnerable lot of the society, like the elderly and the children and those with co-morbidities. But how effective will it be against the virus is still being assessed. 5. What is the origin of the virus?This remains the million-dollar question. From bats to pangolins, much speculation has stemmed around the theory of the genesis of the virus that was birthed in China. “A comprehensive analysis of more than 1,200 coronaviruses sampled from bats in China also points to horseshoe bats in Yunnan as the probable origin of the new coronavirus,” the paper stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-6-months-into-covid-19-crisis-5-mysteries-that-still-shroud-coronavirus/story-k3eJQKiB9mpnfv8uNGkzlI.html
08-07-2020||World||US probing allegations TikTok violated children’s privacy: Report||The Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department are looking into allegations that popular app TikTok failed to live up to a 2019 agreement aimed at protecting children’s privacy, according to two people interviewed by the agencies.The development is the latest bump in the road for the short video company, which is popular with teens. TikTok has seen scrutiny, including from the national security-focused Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, rise sharply because of its Chinese parent corporation.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the United States is “certainly looking at” banning TikTok, suggesting it shared information with the Chinese government, a charge it denied.A staffer in a Massachusetts tech policy group and another source said they took part in separate conference calls with FTC and Justice Department officials to discuss accusations that TikTok had failed to live up to an agreement announced in February 2019.The Center for Digital Democracy, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and others in May asked the FTC look into their allegations TikTok failed to delete videos and personal information about users age 13 and younger as it had agreed to do, among other violations.A TikTok spokesman said they take “safety seriously for all our users,” adding that in the United States they “accommodate users under 13 in a limited app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for a younger audience.”Officials from both the FTC, which reached the original consent agreement with TikTok, and Justice Department, which often files court documents for the FTC, met via video with representatives of the groups to discuss the matter, said David Monahan, a campaign manager with the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.“I got the sense from our conversation that they are looking into the assertions that we raised in our complaint,” Monahan said.A second person, speaking privately, confirmed that advocates had met with officials from the two agencies to discuss concerns TikTok violated the consent decree.The FTC declined to comment. The Justice Department had no immediate comment.TikTok has grown increasing popular among US teenagers and allows users to create short videos. About 60% of TikTok’s 26.5 million monthly active users in the United States are aged 16 to 24, the company said last year.US lawmakers have also raised national security concerns over TikTok’s handling of user data, saying they were worried about Chinese laws requiring domestic companies support and cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party.TikTok, owned by parent company ByteDance, is one of several China-based firms that have had to navigate heightened US-China tensions over trade, technology and the COVID-19 pandemic.Under intense US regulatory scrutiny, it has poached Disney’s Kevin Mayer to be its chief executive and is trying to project a more global image, with offices in California, Singapore and elsewhere.

08-07-2020||World||Decision on foreign students’ visa misguided, say US institutes, lawmakers||Several Congressman and top educational institutions decried the policy change that will require international students who are in the United States with an F-1 visa to take at least one in-person course or else face the prospect of being deported.The Trump administration has yet again announced a new policy that will damage the economy, harm US institutions, and do nothing to improve America’s safety or security, said Congressman Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, and Congresswoman Kathleen Rice, chairwoman of the Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations Subcommittee in a joint statement.“There is no apparent legitimate reason for the administration’s inflexibility toward international students attending colleges and universities that adopt ‘online-only’ policies – the Administration seems to just want them to leave,” the two lawmakers said.International students contribute billions of dollars to the US economy and barring them from our country will deprive Americans of badly needed income. “We cannot allow President Trump to continue destroying jobs and cause needless suffering just to satisfy his anti-immigrant base. We oppose this reckless policy and the lasting harm it will cause to universities and communities across the country,” they said.Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne expressed his concern that the decision will create more uncertainty and complexity for international students.“Our international students must be able to continue making progress toward completing their degrees, and as a university we intend to support them in doing so. We will be working with our peers and national associations to understand how best to accomplish that in the context of these new rules, as well as to urge the Administration to rethink its position,” he said.Congresswoman Debbie Dengell urged the Department of Homeland Security to review its decision.“Removing these students due to circumstances beyond their control is senseless and concerning. There does not appear to be any public benefit to the US, it will harm the quality of education students receive because of the many logistical challenges, while not in the classroom many remain on campus and in the community contributing to educations and cultural experiences in many other ways, and many have already signed leases and paid tuition as well,” she said.Among all the uncertainty, it’s disturbing that the federal government would initiate removal proceedings for international students especially given it is a reversal of an earlier decision taken by the agency at the on-set of the pandemic, she said.“Online courses are safe and sensible ways for universities to protect their students while continuing to provide a quality education while scientists study the best way to ensure students can learn in a safe environment,” the Congresswoman said.“With the high probability that the coronavirus pandemic will continue to make distance learning the predominant mode of instruction at colleges across the country, the rule change means that most of the estimated 1.1 million international students will be forced out of the country in September,” Chancellor Felix V Matis Rodriguez of the City University of New York said.In a statement, he said that this misguided policy change also threatens to hurt higher education at a time when the nation’s universities are working hard to adjust to the dual health and economic crises caused by the pandemic.“We are once again disappointed that our country’s leadership continues to restrict and reduce opportunities for those who seek them in the United States,” he said adding that he has instructed his administration to explore and pursue measures that would help these students remain in the country and continue their education at CUNY.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decision-on-foreign-students-visa-misguided-say-us-institutes-lawmakers/story-8ji7mVtgUFEBLWOVVMxn1I.html
08-07-2020||World||Proxy wrote test for Trump||US President Donald Trump had paid someone else to take a college admission test for him and was admitted to the elite Wharton Business School on the basis of the proxy’s high score, the US president’s estranged niece has claimed in a tell-all book. In the book Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man, Mary L Trump also wrote that her aunt and Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, had been dismissive about his run for the White House, according to a report in The New York Times on Tuesday.Trump had often cited his admission to Wharton as proof of his intelligence. “I went to the Wharton School of Business,” he said at a Phoenix rally in 2015. “I’m, like, a really smart person.”The book is due for release next week. The Trump family had tried to block its publication through a lawsuit filed by the president’s younger brother Robert Trump, citing a confidentiality agreement from 20 years ago. A court did block the book’s release, as sought, but an appellate court overturned it, clearing its release.Mary Trump, 55, is the daughter of the US president’s elder brother Fred Trump Jr., who died at the age of 42. She has long been estranged from the president.She writes that Trump’s upbringing in one of the wealthiest real estate families of New York gave him a set of “twisted behaviours”, including “cheating as a way of life”. “He’s a clown - this will never happen,” Mary Trump quoted her aunt Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired federal judge, as saying about his presidential run. She also wrote, according to NYT, that her aunt was wary of Trump’s support among evangelicals. “The only time Donald went to church was when the cameras were there,” she quoted her aunt as saying. “ He has no principles. None!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/proxy-wrote-test-for-trump/story-WcwvcYO6d9XayvPK02DxoJ.html

08-07-2020||World||US announces visa restrictions for Chinese officials under Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has announced visa restrictions for a certain group of Chinese officials under the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act.“Today I announced visa restrictions on PRC (Peoples Republic of China) officials involved in restricting foreigners’ access to Tibet. We will continue to seek reciprocity in our relationship,” Pompeo tweeted on Tuesday.Beijing has continued systematically to obstruct travel to the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas by US diplomats and other officials, journalists, and tourists, while Chinese officials and other citizens enjoy far greater access to the United States, he said in a statement.As such, Pompeo said he is announcing visa restrictions on Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party officials determined to be “substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan areas,” pursuant to the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018.Access to Tibetan areas is increasingly vital to regional stability, given the Chinese human rights abuses there, as well as Beijing’s failure to prevent environmental degradation near the headwaters of Asia’s major rivers, he said.Pompeo said the US will continue to work to advance the sustainable economic development, environmental conservation, and humanitarian conditions of Tibetan communities within China and abroad.“We also remain committed to supporting meaningful autonomy for Tibetans, respect for their fundamental and unalienable human rights, and the preservation of their unique religious, cultural, and linguistic identity. In the spirit of true reciprocity, we will work closely with the US Congress to ensure US citizens have full access to all areas of the People’s Republic of China, including the TAR and other Tibetan areas,” Pompeo said.The State Department funding for the Tibetan issues for the fiscal year 2021 beginning October 1 has been proposed to be $17 million and $1 million for the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, according to the budget papers which is now making its way through the Congressional approval process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-restricts-visas-on-chinese-officials-over-tibet/story-Ko95E68juoNMXTpdFiDcjM.html

08-07-2020||World||‘Perfect storm of catastrophes’: Mary Trump’s book offers devastating portrayal of president||President Donald Trump’s niece offered a devastating portrayal of him in a book that credits a “perfect storm of catastrophes” for exposing the president at his worst.Mary L. Trump, a psychologist, writes that the coronavirus pandemic, the possibility of an economic depression and deepening social divides have brought out the “worst effects” of Donald Trump’s pathologies, which were less evident when the country had a stable economy and the lack of serious crises.Those factors, along with “Donald’s penchant for division, and uncertainty about our country’s future have created a perfect storm of catastophes that no one is less equipped than my uncle to manage,” she writes.The president’s brother Robert tried to bar publication of the book. Early copies of the book, slated for publication next week, became available on Tuesday. It is titled: “Too Much and Never Enough, How My Family Created The World’s Most Dangerous Man.”A ruling briefly blocking its publication was lifted last week by a New York state appellate judge.Mary Trump is the daughter of Fred Trump Jr., the president’s elder brother, who died in 1981. She has a doctorate in psychology.Robert Trump had argued in legal papers that Mary Trump was subject to a 20-year-old agreement between family members that no one would publish accounts involving the core family members without their approval.Simon & Schuster said it did not know about any alleged family agreement until a few weeks ago and was not a part of any deal. It said that 75,000 first-run editions had already been sent to bookstores.In the book, Mary Trump writes that current challenges have weakened the president’s usual tools for shielding himself from blame.“His ability to control unfavorable situations by lying, spinning, and obfuscating has diminished to the point of impotence in the midst of the tragedies we are currently facing,” she said.“His egregious and arguably intentional mishandling of the current catastrophe has led to a level of pushback and scrutiny that he’s never experienced before, increasing his belligerence and need for petty revenge as he withholds vital funding, personal protective equipment, and ventilators that your tax dollars have paid for from states whose governors don’t kiss his ass sufficiently,” Mary Trump wrote.The White House declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perfect-storm-of-catastrophes-mary-trump-s-book-offers-devastating-portrayal-of-president/story-vP7QyODZZHTzZbOsoj4dMO.html
