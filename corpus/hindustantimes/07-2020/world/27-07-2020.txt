The panel will advise him on the pandemic.“Covid-19 has changed our world,” he told reporters from WHO’s Geneva headquarters on Monday. “It has brought people, communities and nations together — and driven them apart.”He cited some factors that have proven effective in some countries, including political leadership, education, increased testing and hygiene and physical distancing measures.“We are not prisoners of the pandemic. Every single one of us can make a difference,” Tedros said. “The future is in our hands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-accelerating-cases-doubled-over-past-6-weeks-who-chief/story-cvBYdhDhp2Vr2nlBgaIXwI.html
27-07-2020||World||First lady Melania Trump announces Rose Garden ‘renewal’ project||Melania Trump has announced plans to redo the White House Rose Garden to make it more in line with the original design implemented during the 1960s Kennedy administration.The first lady says Monday in a statement that decades of use and changes made to support a modern presidency have taken a toll on the outdoor space just off the Oval Office.President Donald Trump has been using the Rose Garden a lot more lately to make statements and hold news conferences in the age of the coronavirus. The first lady also hosted a state dinner for Australia in the garden last year.Plans described by the first lady include returning the Rose Garden to its original 1962 footprint with improved infrastructure and drainage and a better environment for the plants and flowers.The renovation also includes making the space more accessible for people with disabilities, and improvements for audiovisual and broadcasting needs, she said.“The very act of planting a garden involves hard work and hope in the possibility of a bright future,” said Mrs. Trump, who adds the garden project to a list of other White House renovations, including refurbishing the Red and Blue Rooms and building a tennis pavilion on the South Lawn.“Preserving the history and beauty of the White House and its grounds is a testament to our nation’s commitment to the care of this landscape and our dedication to American ideals, safeguarding them for our children and their children for generations to come,” she said.The renovation plan has been approved by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, an advisory committee. The project is also supported by the National Park Service, which cares for the White House grounds, and will be paid for using private donations, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-lady-melania-trump-announces-rose-garden-renewal-project/story-sl61fBmgm5lLW7aPYlPa4M.html
27-07-2020||World||Pilgrims arrive in Mecca for downsized hajj amid pandemic||Muslim pilgrims have started arriving in Mecca for a drastically scaled-down hajj, as Saudi authorities balance the kingdom’s oversight of one of Islam’s key pillars and the safety of visitors in the face of a global pandemic.The hajj, which begins on Wednesday, normally draws around 2.5 million people for five intense days of worship in one of the world’s largest gatherings of people from around the world.This year, Saudi Arabia’s Hajj Ministry has said between 1,000 and 10,000 people already residing in the kingdom will be allowed to perform the pilgrimage. Two-thirds of those pilgrims will be from among foreign residents in Saudi Arabia and one-third will be Saudi citizens.The kingdom has one of the Mideast’s largest outbreaks of the coronavirus, with nearly 269,000 reported infections, including 2,760 deaths.Fatin Daud, a 25-year-old Malaysian who is studying Arabic in Saudi Arabia, was among the select few whose application for hajj was approved. After her selection, Saudi Health Ministry officials came to her home and tested her for the COVID-19 virus. She was then given an electronic bracelet that monitors her movements, and told to quarantine for several days at home.After that, Daud was moved to a hotel in Mecca, where she remains in self-isolation, still wearing the electronic wristband. A large box of food is delivered to her hotel room three times a day as she prepares to begin the hajj.“It was unbelievable. It felt surreal because I was not expecting to get it,” she said of her excitement when she found out she was selected. Daud said she’s praying for the end of Covid-19 and for unity among Muslims around the world.“I am confident that safety measures are being taken and that the only thing that we need to do as pilgrims is follow instructions, and try our best to support each other,” she said.While self-isolating has been emotionally challenging, Daud said she is part of a group of about 10 Malaysian and Singaporean pilgrims connecting online and sharing tips and religious exercises to keep busy.The Saudi government is covering the expenses of all pilgrims this year, providing them with meals, hotel accommodation, transportation and health care. Normally, the hajj can cost thousands of dollars for pilgrims who save for a lifetime for the journey. It also generates billions of dollars in revenue each year for Saudi Arabia.Saudi kings have for generations assumed titles as custodians of Islam’s holiest sites, and their oversight of the hajj is a source of prestige and influence among Muslims globally. Saudi Arabia has never canceled the hajj in the nearly 90 years since the country was founded.King Salman, who typically oversees the hajj from Mecca, underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder at a hospital in the capital, Riyadh, the royal court said last week. The 84-year-old monarch was to remain at the hospital to recover and be observed by doctors.For the first time in Saudi history, no pilgrims from abroad were permitted to take part in the hajj due to concerns about the coronavirus and overcrowding. It’s a stark departure from previous years, when some 2 million pilgrims from more than 160 countries flocked to Mecca for the spiritual rituals, mostly from across Asia and Africa.Although the hajj often draws all age groups, pilgrims this year were required to be between the ages of 20 and 50, and in good health.The physically demanding rituals of the hajj offer a profound experience for Muslims, with the faithful often weeping, their palms stretched toward the sky, in prayer and repentance. The hajj is required of all able-bodied Muslims once in a lifetime.This year, international media were not given permission to cover the hajj from Mecca.Also this year, pilgrims must wear face masks and will only be able to drink holy water from the Zamzam well in Mecca that has been prepackaged in plastic bottles. Pebbles for casting away evil that are usually picked up by pilgrims along hajj routes will be sterilized and bagged before being distributed to the pilgrims.Pilgrims are also bringing their own prayer rugs and will be required to pray at a distance from one another, rather than packed shoulder-to-shoulder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilgrims-arrive-in-mecca-for-downsized-hajj-amid-pandemic/story-aaHovs2V6Sir8NKe7wEWoI.html
27-07-2020||World||US warplane flew less than 100 km from Shanghai, says China think tank||A US anti-submarine warplane came within 100 km from Shanghai in eastern China on Sunday, a Chinese think tank focused on the South China Sea has said in the backdrop of the tit-for-tat closure of consulates and escalating tension between the two countries.A P-8A anti-submarine plane and an EP-3E reconnaissance plane entered the Taiwan Strait, flying near the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian on Sunday, a report in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) said Monday, quoting the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCS Probing Initiative or SCSPI in short), a Beijing-based think tank.An American battleship, destroyer USS Rafael Peralta was sailing below the aircraft, the think tank said.ALSO WATCH | Amid China tension, India & US Navy conduct joint exercise in Indian OceanQuoting a tweet from the SCSPI, the report said the P-8A aircraft came within 76.5km (47.5 miles) of Shanghai – likely the closest any US plane has come to mainland China in recent years; another aircraft came within 106 km of Fujian’s southern coast.The think tank, the SCMP report said, tweeted again Sunday night, saying the US Navy P-8A was operating near Shanghai, with the USS Rafael Peralta, a guided missile destroyer, following a similar route, asking “might be a joint operation?”.Using satellite imagery, it tweeted on Monday early evening that a US warplane was “conducting close-in reconnaissance of Guangdong in southern China”.The Chinese foreign ministry didn’t deny the development but did not respond to a request for a comment from Hindustan Times. Incidentally, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is currently conducting a live-fire drill with “powerful ammunition” in the southern Guangdong province’s Leizhou peninsula, considered to be at the doorstep to the South China Sea (SCS).The week-long drills will include anti-ship and anti-aircraft exercises by the PLA air force with the PLA’s navy and rocket forces joining in.Writing for the SCSPI website on Monday, Wang Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies (NISCSS), said: “It (the US) has conducted six Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) so far this year, compared with four times in 2017, six times in 2018 and eight times in 2019. In addition, the U.S. military has conducted nearly 2,000 close-in reconnaissance operations on China from the air this year.”According to the think tank, US air force E-8C surveillance planes have come within 185km or less of the southeast coast of Guangdong province on four separate occasions in the past week.“At the moment the US military is sending three to five reconnaissance aircraft each day to the South China Sea,” the think tank said, adding the US military planes have come unusually close to mainland airspace several times since April.In this context, Wang from NISCSS wrote that chances were “…growing for an accidentally triggered incident between China and the U.S. As the US intensifies its military operation in the South China Sea, China will adopt corresponding countermeasures, such as tracking and monitoring as well as warning and expulsion. The more intensifying US military operations, the more chances for accidentally triggered incidents.”US warplanes flying close to China coincided with a tense week between the two countries in the backdrop of Washington and Beijing ordering the closure of consulates in Houston and Chengdu.The US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu officially shut down on Monday morning within 72 hours of Beijing ordering its closure as a tit-for-tat shutting of its Houston consulate amid worsening ties between the two largest economies of the world.The SCSPI says on its website that it is an “international research network and not affiliated with any institution, mainly funded by social donation and non-profit investment.”The think tank’s director, Hu Bo, however, is also the director of the Centre for Maritime Strategy Studies and Research Professor at the Institute of Ocean Research, Peking University in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warplane-flew-less-than-100-km-from-shanghai-says-china-think-tank/story-1jwPu9806CzIiKHmW0K5oK.html
27-07-2020||World||European tourism faces turbulence only weeks after restart||Europe’s tourism revival is running into turbulence only weeks after countries reopened their borders, with rising infections in Spain and other nations causing increasing concern among health authorities over people bringing the coronavirus home from their summer vacations.European countries started opening up to each other’s tourists in mid-June, but recent events have shown that the new freedom to travel is subject to setbacks. Over the weekend, Britain imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain’s Catalonia region.In Austria, the lakeside resort town of St. Wolfgang shortened bar opening hours after an outbreak was detected on Friday. By Monday, 53 people had tested positive, including many people working in the tourism industry.In Germany, officials decided last week to set up testing stations at airports to encourage people arriving from a long list of countries deemed high-risk — including popular destinations such as Turkey — to get tested. They will also allow people to get tested elsewhere for free within three days of arrival.Bavaria’s governor, Markus Soeder, said he is worried about travelers returning from vacation. Referring to the Austrian ski resort that was an early European hot spot in March, he said: “My worry is not that there will be one big Ischgl, but that there will be many mini-Ischgls.”Soeder called for tests of returning vacationers from risky areas to be made obligatory, something the federal government is considering.“Mostly it is the considerate people who have behaved very cautiously on vacation anyway who take up the voluntary offers, while those who are more careless don’t take a voluntary test,” Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RBB Inforadio.New infections in Germany have been creeping higher from a low level.The tourism industry employs 2.6 million people in Spain and generates 12% of the country’s economic activity.Juan Molas, the head of a national association of tourism companies, Mesa del Turismo, said Spain’s tourism sector has on average lost 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) a week since March.Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said the Spanish government is trying to persuade Britain to exempt the Balearic Islands, which have a low infection rate, from the quarantine rule.“We’re living alongside the virus. That doesn’t mean we can’t travel. We can, if we are careful,” Maroto said.The Catalonia and Aragón regions have Spain’s most worrying virus clusters, prompting authorities to tighten restrictions in Barcelona, in a rural area around Lleida and in Zaragoza that were relaxed only a month ago.Catalonia is facing “the 10 most decisive days of this summer,” regional leader Quim Torra said, warning that it is in everyone’s hands to prevent a “critical situation” from worsening.Elsewhere in Europe, authorities in Belgium said COVID-19 cases are growing at an alarming rate amid a surge of infections in Antwerp. Greek authorities said they are likely to extend the mandatory use of masks at churches and shopping malls.And in North Africa, Morocco banned most travel to and from some major cities — including Tangier, Casablanca and Marrakech, usually a popular tourist destination — to stem a small spike in cases.In the Asia-Pacific region, many countries are still essentially banning foreign travelers or, if they do allow them to enter, requiring them to submit to tests and strict quarantine. That includes Australia, where the premier of Victoria state, Daniel Andrews, said the biggest driver in the region’s outbreak is people continuing to go to work after showing symptoms.The crossing of borders was linked to other outbreaks in Asia. South Korea said 16 of the 25 new cases it confirmed Monday were tied to people arriving from abroad. Over the past few days, the country reported dozens of cases among crew members of a Russia-flagged cargo ship and hundreds of South Korean construction workers airlifted from Iraq.A tally by Johns Hopkins University shows about 16.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and around 650,000 deaths. The actual numbers are thought to be much higher because of limits on testing and the many minor cases that have gone unreported.The World Health Organization said the pandemic continues to accelerate, with a doubling of cases over the past six weeks.The U.N. health agency’s emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, stressed the need to “keep pressure on the virus.”“Every single country where pressure has been lifted on the virus, where virus is still at community level, there’s been a jump back in cases,” he said.___Kurtenbach reported from Mito, Japan.

27-07-2020||World||China flood: Yangtze river in the throes of third flood peak, 45 million impacted||Torrential rain triggered the third flood peak of the Yangtze river on Sunday, putting the Three Gorges Dam under severe pressure as China grapples to mitigate the impact of the deluge that has already impacted more than 45 million people and resulted in losses worth billions of dollars.Authorities have issued warnings of possible new flood peaks in the near future, requiring the Three Gorges Dam to reserve enough space for possible floods.Warning against a new peak that may appear later, China’s water resources ministry said, “The flood control and flood fighting situation is severe.”The volume of water inflow that has entered the reservoir has reached 50,000 cubic meters per second, state media reports said, adding that the reservoir will see inflow volume of 60,000 cubic meters per second around Tuesday.By last week, China’s ministry of emergency had said that since June 1 the latest round of floods – possibly the worst since 1998 – had affected 45.52 million in 30 Chinese provinces including specific cities and counties.The situation remains grim the sprawling municipality of Chongqing located along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, was hit on Monday by the most severe flooding since the flood season started this year.“Residents living along the river have been urged to evacuate and stay away from the riverbank… a landslide has blocked a river in southwest China’s Chongqing City, forming a barrier lake that threatens nearby townships and a power station,” local authorities told state media.State media reports have said that massive flooding along the Yangtze river, which is the longest river in Asia, has displaced over 2 million people.The current round of flood in the Yangtze river is stronger than the first two rounds, as was the second round compared to the first.The first flood this year arrived at the dam on July 2 with a peak flow rate of 53,000 cubic meters while the second one, in the third week of the month, was at 55,000 cubic meters per second.Ahead of the second round of flood, water resources authorities was quoted by the state media as saying following continuous downpours in the upper reach of the Yangtze River, the “…Three Gorges Dam is being tested by the second floods this year in the Asia’s longest watercourse.”The dam’s maximum capacity is 175 meters. As of Monday, the reservoir level was at 159.46 meters, slightly lower than 164.18 meters from a week ago, reported news agency Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-flood-yangtze-river-in-the-throes-of-third-flood-peak-45-million-impacted/story-OSsPDfRJhpGLZQfQjGmYJN.html
27-07-2020||World||First UK case of Covid-19 in pet cat detected||The UK’s chief veterinary officer on Monday revealed that for the first time the virus responsible for Covid-19 has been detected in a pet cat, but added that there is no evidence of the pet transmitting the virus to owners or other animals.The infection was confirmed following tests at the Animal and Plant Health Agency laboratory in Weybridge on July 22. Health officials reiterated their advice to wash hands regularly, including before and after contact with animals.All available evidence suggests that the cat contracted the coronavirus from its owners who had previously tested positive for Covid-19. The cat and its owners have since made a full recovery and there was no transmission to other animals or people in the household.Chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: “This is a very rare event with infected animals detected to date only showing mild clinical signs and recovering within in a few days. There is no evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans”.Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England added: “This is the first case of a domestic cat testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK but should not be a cause for alarm. The investigation into this case suggest that the infection was spread from humans to animal, and not the other way round.Officials said the pet cat was initially diagnosed by a private vet with feline herpes virus, a common cat respiratory infection, but the sample was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of a research programme.Follow-up samples tested at the laboratory confirmed the cat was also co-infected with SARS-CoV2 which is the virus known to cause Covid-19 in humans. There have been a very small number of confirmed cases in pets in other countries in Europe, North America and Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-uk-case-of-covid-19-in-pet-cat-detected/story-6oWYXSyJCSlMYhU5HGSzOJ.html
27-07-2020||World||Danish prince undergoes brain surgery in southern France||Prince Joachim, the youngest son of Queen Margrethe of Denmark, has undergone emergency surgery for a blood clot in his brain, the royal palace said.The 51-year-old prince, who had been on vacation in France, was admitted to the Toulouse University Hospital late on Friday and was immediately operated on. The palace said he is in a stable condition and that his French-born wife is by his side.Joachim married Marie Cavallier, with whom he has two children, in 2008, and she became Princess Marie. He also has two children from his first marriage to Hong-Kong born Alexandra Manley, who became Countess of Frederiksborg after their divorce in 2005, the first split in nearly 160 years in Europe’s oldest monarchy.Earlier this month, he was all smiles at the Danish queen’s summer residence in France, Chateau de Cayx, when he posed for a photo in connection with his oldest son’s 18th birthday.Joachim is sixth in the line to Denmark’s throne after his elder brother, Crown Prince Frederik, and his brother’s four children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/danish-prince-undergoes-brain-surgery-in-southern-france/story-2ozuLaQIDkljeoRjBtSL8M.html
27-07-2020||World||Trade, technology and security at risk in US-China feud||They have the largest economies in the world. They spend more than anyone else on their militaries. From high-tech chips to control of the high seas, their interests are closely intertwined.The ongoing sharp deterioration in U.S.-China ties poses risks to both countries and the rest of the world. In the latest escalation, a U.S. consulate in Chengdu in southwestern China shuttered Monday, ordered by China to close in retaliation for the U.S. shutting down its consulate in Houston last week.With the U.S. presidential campaign heating up, all bets are that relations with China will only get worse. A look at what’s at stake:TRADEBoth countries already have suffered heavy losses in a tariff war that erupted in 2018 over Beijing’s technology ambitions and trade surplus. If talks on ending the dispute fail, the world could face downward pressure on trade at a time when the global economy is already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.The United States is China’s biggest single-country export market, even after President Donald Trump imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. And China is the No. 3 market for American exporters, as well as a huge market for goods and services produced in China by U.S. companies ranging from General Motors Co. to Burger King.Chinese purchases of American farm goods, semiconductors and other goods declined 11.4% last year but still exceeded $100 billion. Exports to China support just under 1 million American jobs, according to the U.S.-China Business Council, though that was down 10% from 2017’s peak.China is the biggest export market for Iowa and other American farm states, which were slammed when Beijing suspended imports of soybeans and raised tariffs on pork and other goods.That briefly boosted sales for soybean exporters in Brazil and Argentina, though China resumed buying lower-priced American beans under the “Phase 1” trade truce signed in January.But if the two can’t resolve broader differences on trade, it will be a blow not only to their exporters but also to other Asian economies that supply China’s factories with raw materials and components.___TECHNOLOGYU.S. and Chinese producers of telecom, computer, medical and other technology and their markets are tightly interwoven. Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and others rely on Chinese factories to assemble most of their smartphones, computers and other consumer electronics. Those factories need processor chips and other components from the United States, Japan, Taiwan and Europe.The disruption caused by moves including the Trump administration’s curbs on Chinese tech giant Huawei’s access to U.S. components and technology threatens to disrupt those flows and cost suppliers, including Silicon Valley companies, billions of dollars in lost revenue.China is also a top market for Apple and other U.S. tech brands, and is increasingly becoming a technology competitor with its own brands in smartphones, medical equipment and other fields.The United States often is the top market for China’s highest-value-added goods. Beijing has been urging exporters to find other markets, but many say Asian and even European markets won’t buy such high-value goods.___SECURITYWhile the U.S. has long been the predominant military power in the Pacific, China now has two operational aircraft carriers and an arsenal of missiles seen as a threat to U.S. vessels and bases in the region.Military tensions have largely focused on the South China Sea, a crucial waterway that is the subject of overlapping territorial claims by China and several smaller Asian nations.In 2018, a Chinese destroyer came perilously close to colliding with a U.S. destroyer, the USS Decatur, while executing what the Navy called an “unsafe and unprofessional maneuver” in the South China Sea.A Chinese fighter jet collided with a U.S. Navy surveillance plane in international airspace over the South China Sea in 2001, leading to major diplomatic incident after the U.S. plane made an emergency landing on a Chinese island.Taiwan is another potential flashpoint. China claims the self-governing island as its territory, to be taken by force if necessary. The U.S. is bound by its own law to ensure the island has a credible defense and has approved military sales to Taiwan under Trump.Taiwan’s foreign minister said last week that Chinese military flights near the island have been taking place on a near-daily basis, more frequently than previously reported.Washington upped the ante earlier this month by declaring that it did not recognize most of China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, a break with its previous policy of not taking a stance on the sovereignty disputes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trade-technology-and-security-at-risk-in-us-china-feud/story-kJOnew8zpFL8B5rEutKadP.html
27-07-2020||World||World’s biggest Covid-19 vaccine study begins, a US trial that will include 30,000 people to see if shots really work||The world’s biggest Covid-19 vaccine study got underway Monday with the first of 30,000 planned volunteers helping to test shots created by the U.S. government -- one of several candidates in the final stretch of the global vaccine race.There’s still no guarantee that the experimental vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., will really protect.The needed proof: Volunteers won’t know if they’re getting the real shot or a dummy version. After two doses, scientists will closely track which group experiences more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in areas where the virus still is spreading unchecked.“Unfortunately for the United States of America, we have plenty of infections right now” to get that answer, NIH’s Dr. Anthony Fauci recently told The Associated Press.Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain’s Oxford University earlier this month began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries.But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country and has set a high bar: Every month through fall, the government-funded Covid-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate -- each one with 30,000 newly recruited volunteers.The massive studies aren’t just to test if the shots work — they’re needed to check each potential vaccine’s safety. And following the same study rules will let scientists eventually compare all the shots.Next up in August, the final study of the Oxford shot begins, followed by plans to test a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and Novavax in October -- if all goes according to schedule. Pfizer Inc. plans its own 30,000-person study this summer.That’s a stunning number of people needed to roll up their sleeves for science. But in recent weeks, more than 150,000 Americans filled out an online registry signaling interest, said Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute in Seattle, who helps oversee the study sites.“These trials need to be multigenerational, they need to be multiethnic, they need to reflect the diversity of the United States population,” Corey told a vaccine meeting last week. He stressed that it’s especially important to ensure enough Black and Hispanic participants as those populations are hard-hit by Covid-19.It normally takes years to create a new vaccine from scratch, but scientists are setting speed records this time around, spurred by knowledge that vaccination is the world’s best hope against the pandemic. The coronavirus wasn’t even known to exist before late December, and vaccine makers sprang into action Jan. 10 when China shared the virus’ genetic sequence.Just 65 days later in March, the NIH-made vaccine was tested in people. The first recipient is encouraging others to volunteer now.“We all feel so helpless right now. There’s very little that we can do to combat this virus. And being able to participate in this trial has given me a sense of, that I’m doing something,” Jennifer Haller of Seattle told the AP. “Be prepared for a lot of questions from your friends and family about how it’s going, and a lot of thank-you’s.”That first-stage study that included Haller and 44 others showed the shots revved up volunteers’ immune systems in ways scientists expect will be protective, with some minor side effects such as a brief fever, chills and pain at the injection site. Early testing of other leading candidates have had similarly encouraging results.If everything goes right with the final studies, it still will take months for the first data to trickle in from the Moderna test, followed by the Oxford one.Governments around the world are trying to stockpile millions of doses of those leading candidates so if and when regulators approve one or more vaccines, immunizations can begin immediately. But the first available doses will be rationed, presumably reserved for people at highest risk from the virus.“We’re optimistic, cautiously optimistic” that the vaccine will work and that “toward the end of the year” there will be data to prove it, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Massachusetts-based Moderna, told a House subcommittee last week.Until then, Haller, the volunteer vaccinated back in March, wears a mask in public and takes the same distancing precautions advised for everyone -- while hoping that one of the shots in the pipeline pans out.“I don’t know what the chances are that this is the exact right vaccine. But thank goodness that there are so many others out there battling this right now,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-biggest-covid-19-vaccine-study-begins-a-us-trial-that-will-include-30-000-people-to-see-if-shots-really-work/story-aUibdMzwCTsRFZ1lnU0mlI.html
27-07-2020||World||Indonesian coronavirus cases top 100,000 as more hotspots emerge||Total coronavirus infections in Indonesia surged past 100,000 amid an easing of physical-distancing rules to allow economic activity to resume, prompting President Joko Widodo to order health officials to focus on containing the disease in the nation’s eight main provinces.There were 1,525 new confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 100,303, official data showed on Monday. The number of fatalities rose by 57 to 4,838 as more hotspots emerged, making it the highest tally among Southeast Asian nations.The number of infections has almost quadrupled since the end of May as more cities and provinces, including the capital Jakarta and Indonesia’s second-largest city Surabaya, began easing curbs in early June.The pandemic threatens to send Indonesia’s economy into its first recession since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, battering small and big businesses alike, according to Widodo. The outbreak has rendered millions of people jobless, and may plunge many more into poverty.Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, told his cabinet on Monday to expedite the spending of 695 trillion rupiah ($48 billion) in fiscal stimulus to revive the economy which is forecast to contract 4.3% in the second quarter. He also instructed health officials to focus on eight provinces, including capital Jakarta, which collectively account for about three-quarters of the nation’s total infections.The government has insisted in further opening Southeast Asia’s largest economy despite the rising caseload. Bali, Indonesia’s most popular holiday destination, is pressing ahead with a plan to welcome back foreign and domestic visitors even as the resort island reports a surge in new virus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-coronavirus-cases-top-100-000-as-more-hotspots-emerge/story-0PB1ed79mm0rD9VxTPhlBN.html
27-07-2020||World||UN says Afghan civilian casualties down by 13% this year||Afghanistan saw a 13% drop in the number of civilians killed and wounded in violence across the country in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period last year, according to a UN report released Monday.The report credited the drop in casualties in part to the reduction of operations by international forces — which now only act when called upon and in support of the Afghan forces — and also to a decrease in the number of attacks by the Islamic State group.However, the report underscores the still heavy toll the conflict continues to inflict on the civilian population — and sends a harsh message to both the Taliban and the Afghan government forces, saying civilian casualties caused by the warring sides in the conflict continue to be high.The report comes against the backdrop of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal signed at the end of February and touted as the best hope for peace in Afghanistan after decades of war. While the US and NATO have already begun reducing their troop strength, the second phase of the deal — which calls for negotiations between the Taliban and the Kabul government — has been delayed. Much of the delays have been as a result of Kabul’s reluctance to free some Taliban prisoners identified for release as part of the agreement.The UN report said 1,282 people were killed in violence in the first six months of 2020 in Afghanistan and 2,176 were wounded. That represents an overall 13% decrease from the same period in 2019. The report said the U.N. had recorded 17 attacks by IS causing civilians casualties during the first six months of 2020, down from 97 attacks in the same period last year.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the report, describing it as propaganda aimed at defaming the Taliban. He blamed airstrikes and heavy artillery by government forces and their allies, saying they are “responsible for the majority of civilian casualties.”The Afghan government, meanwhile, said the UN reports underscores the government’s own findings that the Taliban are responsible for the vast majority of the civilian casualties. The statement added that the recent increase in Taliban attacks comes despite the insurgents’ commitments under the US-Taliban deal.“At a time when the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban have a historic opportunity to come together at the negotiating table for peace talks, the tragic reality is that the fighting continues, inflicting terrible harm to civilians every day,” said Deborah Lyons, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Civilian casualties from airstrikes carried out by Afghan forces tripled in the first six months of the year, compared to the same time period last year. Afghan forces were responsible for 23% of the civilian casualties, while the Taliban were responsible for 43%, the report said.“I urge the parties to pause, to reflect on the chilling incidents and the harm that they are causing to the Afghan people as documented in this report, and to take decisive action to stop the carnage and get to the negotiating table,” said Lyons.Women and children continue to be disproportionately affected by the direct and indirect impacts of the armed conflict, comprising more than 40% of the total civilian casualties, meaning both the killed and the wounded, the report said.The report noted that children in Afghanistan are especially vulnerable to abuse by both sides, including being recruited for combat.Last week, a government airstrike killed at least 14 people in western Herat province, many of them women and children. Hundreds of people had gathered in the province’s Adraskan district to welcome home a former Taliban fighter freed from jail, when aircraft reportedly pounded the gathering.The government said the strike was being investigated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-afghan-civilian-casualties-down-by-13-this-year/story-iY2j8uWD4dhkTfeaMzBeZP.html

Like many people I struggled with my weight”.“Since I recovered from coronavirus I’ve been steadily building up my fitness. I am at least a stone down. But when I went into ICU, when I was really ill, I was way overweight. I was too fat. I (now) start the day by going for a run with the dog”.Official figures show that nearly two-thirds (63%) of adults in England are overweight or living with obesity – and 1 in 3 children leave primary school overweight or obese, with obesity-related illnesses costing the National Health Service £6 billion a year.The urgency of tackling the obesity time bomb has been prompted by evidence of the link to an increased risk from the virus, with officials calling it a ‘wake-up call’. Nearly 8% of critically ill patients with the virus in intensive care units have been morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% of the general population.Johnson said: “Losing weight is hard but with some small changes we can all feel fitter and healthier. If we all do our bit, we can reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus – as well as taking pressure off the NHS”.Health secretary Matt Hancock added: “Everyone knows how hard losing weight can be so we are taking bold action to help everyone who needs it. When you’re shopping for your family or out with friends, it’s only fair that you are given the right information about the food you’re eating to help people to make good decisions”.“To help support people we need to reduce unhelpful influences like promotions and adverts that affect what you buy and what you eat. Taken together, supported by an inspiring campaign and new smart tools, will get the country eating healthily and losing the pounds”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-too-fat-pm-boris-johnson-launches-uk-fitness-drive/story-MT9FWl8Tl7qUHdGUioC4kO.html
27-07-2020||World||Australia’s consumer watchdog accuses Google of privacy breaches||Australia’s consumer watchdog launched court action against Google on Monday alleging the technology giant misled account holders about its use of their personal data.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s action in the Federal Court is the latest litigation Google has faced around the world over allegations of privacy breaches.The commission alleges the California-based company misled millions of Australians to obtain their consent and expand the scope of personal information that Google collects about users’ internet activity to target advertising.The allegations arise from Google’s move in 2016 to start combining users’ personal information in their Google accounts with information from the same users’ activity on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from customers to take this step,” the commission’s chair, Rod Sims, said in a statement.“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the ‘price’ of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Sims added.Google said it had cooperated with the watchdog in its investigation and that its account holders had been asked to “consent via prominent and easy-to-understand notifications.”“We strongly disagree with their allegations and intend to defend our position,” a Google statement said.Google has also been closely involved with the watchdog in recent months over the Australian government’s plan to make global digital platforms including Facebook pay for content siphoned from news media.The commission this week will release draft rules for the platforms to pay fair compensation for journalistic content after the coronavirus pandemic slashed advertising revenue for legacy media.British regulators want new rules to foster competition in digital advertising markets and rein in the industry’s dominant players, Google and Facebook.The Competition and Markets Authority have taken aim at the US tech giants in a report that recommends the British government adopt a new regulatory approach to governing big digital platforms making money from online ads.Google announced last month that it was tweaking its privacy settings to keep less data on new users by default, automatically and continuously deleting web and app activity as well as location history after 18 months.France’s highest administrative court last month upheld a fine of 50 million euros ($56 million) Google was ordered to pay for not being “sufficiently clear and transparent” with Android users about their data protection options.In Canada, Google abandoned its smart-city development in Toronto after more than two years of controversy over privacy concerns and amid economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.In the United States, New Mexico’s attorney general has filed a lawsuit in the District Court over allegations that Google illegally collected personal data generated by children in violation of federal and state laws.In Australia, it is not clear what penalty Google might face if the watchdog’s lawsuit succeeds. The commission has made multiple allegations of consumer law breaches, each carrying a potential maximum fine of 1.1 million Australian dollars ($780 million).Australia substantially beefed up penalties for such offences in 2018, but Google will be judged by the rules that applied in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-consumer-watchdog-accuses-google-of-privacy-breaches/story-LEwkikvDCS3Wq6OhRVB40O.html
27-07-2020||World||Hospitalised coronavirus patients have low risk of stroke: Report||Patients hospitalised with Covid-19 may have a lower risk of stroke, according to a study that found majority of afflicted patients had existing risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. The study, published in the journal Stroke, contradicts initial reports that suggested a significant risk of stroke in patients hospitalised with Covid-19. “While there was initial concern for a high number of strokes related to Covid-19, that has not been born out,” said Brett Cucchiara, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the US. “Importantly, while the risk for stroke in Covid-19 patients is low, it’s mostly tied to pre-existing conditions -- so physicians who do see stroke in hospitalised Covid-19 patients must understand the virus is not the only factor, and it’s necessary to follow through with normal diagnostic testing,” Cucchiara said. However, he said, there are still many unknowns and researchers need to continue investigating the linkage between stroke and Covid-19, particularly considering the racial disparities surrounding the disease. To evaluate the risk and incidence of stroke in Covid-19 hospitalized patients, the researchers analyzed data from 844 Covid-19 patients admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, and Pennsylvania Hospital, in the US, between March and May. The team also analysed the data for cases of intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding in the brain. Researchers found that 2.4 per cent of patients hospitalised for Covid-19 had an ischemic stroke -- the most common type of stroke, typically caused by a blood clot in the brain. They said the majority of these stroke patients had existing risk factors, such as high blood pressure (95 per cent) and a history of diabetes (60 per cent), and traditional stroke mechanisms, such as heart failure. Also, over one-third had a history of a previous stroke, according to the researchers. The results suggest that these cerebrovascular events in hospitalised Covid-19 patients are likely tied to existing conditions, and not the sole consequence of the virus, they said. However, the researchers said, other factors could be at play and require continued research. While the precise mechanisms linking cerebrovascular events to Covid-19 remain uncertain at this time, it has recently been reported that infection with Sars-CoV-2 causes inflammation and excessive blood clotting -- both could be potential mechanisms leading to stroke, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hospitalised-coronavirus-patients-have-low-risk-of-stroke-report/story-bEcafHT2VOZUn4G5j4hSeM.html

Even his facial hair became an issue of debate.The envoy’s mother was Japanese and, with Koreans still bitterly resentful of Tokyo’s 1910-45 colonisation of the peninsula, commentators claimed the moustache alluded to the fashions of imperial governors-general from the period.In January Harris retorted that his grooming was a matter of personal choice, and that his critics were “cherry picking history”.But over the weekend he uploaded a video to social media of him getting the moustache shaved off at a traditional Korean barbershop, saying he did so to keep cool in the Seoul summer, while wearing a mask to fight the coronavirus pandemic.“Glad I did this,” the envoy said in a tweet. 잘한 결정이라고 생각합니다. 콧수염을 기르고 마스크까지 착용하기엔 서울의 여름은 매우 덥고 습합니다. 코로나 지침이 중요하니 마스크는 필수죠! 오 사장님을 뵙게 되어 반가웠고 #한미동맹 을 중요하게 생각해주셔서 매우 감사했습니다. https://t.co/pqfIQshM2g“For me it was either keep the ‘stache or lose the mask. Summer in Seoul is way too hot & humid for both. #COVID guidelines matter & I’m a masked man!”Seoul and Tokyo are both major US allies, democracies and market economies faced with an overbearing China and nuclear-armed North Korea, but are locked in bitter disputes over historical issues.Earlier this year Harris said: “I understand the historical animosity that exists between both of the countries but I’m not the Japanese American ambassador in Korea, I’m the American ambassador to Korea.“And to take that history and put it on me simply because an accident of birth I think is a mistake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-to-seoul-shaves-off-controversial-moustache/story-uA1sl4Hc7KQRYW8IBuuCgI.html

27-07-2020||World||Saudi Arabia gears up for downsized hajj amid Covid-19 pandemic||Saudi Arabia on Wednesday begins hosting the annual hajj pilgrimage, dramatically downscaled due to the coronavirus pandemic that has barred millions of international pilgrims for the first time in modern history.Up to 10,000 people residing in the kingdom will participate in the Muslim ritual, a tiny fraction of the 2.5 million that attended last year, after what many saw as an opaque selection process that left a wave of applicants rejected.The foreign press are barred from this year’s hajj, usually a huge global media event, as the government tightens access to the holy city of Mecca and puts in place strict health restrictions to prevent a virus outbreak during the five-day pilgrimage -- a key pillar of Islam.Saudi Arabia has recorded more than 260,000 cases of the novel coronavirus, while the number of declared global infections exceeded 16 million on Sunday. Mask-clad pilgrims began trickling into Mecca over the weekend and were subject to temperature checks and placed in quarantine, authorities said.They were given elaborate amenity kits that include sterilised pebbles for a stoning ritual, disinfectants, masks, a prayer rug and the ihram, a seamless white garment worn by pilgrims, according to a hajj ministry programme document.Pilgrims are required to be tested for coronavirus before arriving in Mecca and will also have to quarantine after the pilgrimage. The ministry said it has set up multiple health facilities, mobile clinics and ambulances to cater to the pilgrims, who will be required to observe social distancing.‘Golden ticket’ Saudi authorities initially said only around 1,000 pilgrims residing in the kingdom would be permitted for hajj but local media reports say as many as 10,000 will be allowed.The hajj ministry has fielded a deluge of anguished queries on Twitter from rejected applicants.But Hajj Minister Mohammad Benten insisted the process was transparent, telling the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya television that “health determinants” formed the basis of selection.The ministry said non-Saudi residents of the kingdom from around 160 countries competed in the online selection process.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt said foreign residents would make up 70 percent of all selected pilgrims.But it did not explain how many applied, and some disappointed pilgrims have complained that the government-run lottery was not clearly outlined and say no reason was given for their rejection.Among the chosen few is Nasser, a Riyadh-based Nigerian expatriate, euphoric at winning what he called the “golden ticket” to hajj.“This feeling cannot be described,” he told AFP before his arrival in Mecca.The ministry has said the Saudi pilgrims were selected from a pool of health practitioners and military personnel who have recovered from Covid-19.To be among the chosen ones adds an aura of religious prestige to this year’s pilgrimage, applicants say.Despite the pandemic, many pilgrims consider it is safer to participate in this year’s ritual without the usual colossal crowds cramming into tiny religious sites, which make it a logistical nightmare and a health hazard.Even in a regular year, the hajj leaves pilgrims exposed to a host of viral illnesses.‘Substantial cost’ The government scaled back the pilgrimage as it could be a major source of contagion, but the move will deepen the kingdom’s economic slump, analysts say. It comes as Saudi Arabia faces a sharp downturn in oil prices due to a collapse in global demand driven by national lockdowns, which triggered austerity measures including the tripling of a value added tax and cuts to civil servants’ allowances.The virus has also battered pilgrimage-reliant businesses that support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Mecca, from travel agents to street barbers and souvenir shops.Many have reported sweeping layoffs, pay cuts or delayed salaries.Mecca has seen a construction boom in recent years that added shopping malls, apartments and luxury hotels, some offering spectacular views of the sacred Kaaba, a cube-shaped structure in the Grand Mosque towards which Muslims around the world pray. But most premises have lain empty since the pandemic reached the kingdom.Saudi authorities had already in March suspended the umrah pilgrimage, which can be performed at any time.The pilgrimages together rake in some $12 billion (10.3 billion euros) annually, keeping the economy humming in Mecca.“Limiting this year’s hajj to Saudi residents comes at a substantial but surmountable cost to the economy,” the Eurasia Group’s Sofia Meranto told AFP.“Against the backdrop of daily infection rates still (remaining) high, the government is prioritising healthcare... over short-term economic costs, hoping to recoup lost revenue by next hajj season or by resuming umrah earlier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-gears-up-for-downsized-hajj/story-IbAMwEIoigGy6P1eGfOTHL.html
27-07-2020||World||Hurricane Douglas threatens Hawaii as Hanna downgrades to tropical storm||Hawaii braced for Hurricane Douglas on Sunday as the storm approached the Pacific archipelago, after the year’s first Atlantic hurricane lashed Texas.The Category One hurricane had moved north of Maui as of 3:00 pm (0100 GMT Monday) and was about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of the capital Honolulu, according to the National Hurricane Center.Douglas was packing winds of up to 85 miles (140 kilometers) per hour.It is rare for hurricanes to make landfall in Hawaii. Should Douglas do so, it will be only the third storm in modern history, the last two being Hurricane Dot in 1959 and Hurricane Iniki in 1992.Earlier Sunday, Hurricane Hanna was downgraded to a tropical storm after lashing coronavirus-hit Texas.A hurricane warning was in effect for Maui county, although local media reported that skies began clearing over the island by mid-afternoon. Maui mayor Mike Victorino said there were no reports of serious damage.Hurricane warnings were also in effect for Kauai county, as well as Oahu -- the island on which Honolulu, a city of just under 350,000 -- is located.“Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, but Douglas is expected to remain a hurricane as it moves through the islands,” the National Hurricane Center said earlier Sunday.The NHC said the storm was expected to bring life-threatening and potentially destructive surf and rainfall of up to 15 inches on higher terrain.In Honolulu, Mayor Kirk Caldwell opened evacuation centers with space for 1,600 people -- but warned they should be used as a “last option” and that those needing shelter would need to have a mask or face covering, have their temperature taken and comply with social distancing requirements, local media reported.“If you are sheltering away from home today, please remember that #Covid19 is not taking a break for the storm. Please continue to wear a mask and physically distance as much as is practical,” Caldwell tweeted Sunday evening.Roads flooded in Texas Storm Hanna, meanwhile, was downgraded to a tropical depression Sunday.It was still packing winds of around 35 miles (55 kilometers) an hour as of 4:00 pm (2100 GMT), after crossing from the Lone Star state over northeastern Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said, adding it should dissipate by Monday.There were no immediate reports of casualties or widespread damage, and both Mexico and Texas had lifted all coastal storm warnings by afternoon.Damage appeared limited in the immediate aftermath of Hanna’s arrival on Padre Island, a 110-mile-long barrier island off the Texas coast, around 5:00 pm (2200 GMT) Saturday. Images captured by CBS showed roads and a caravan park in the Texas coastal city of Corpus Christi strewn with debris and downed trees.Some motorists even braved flooded roads, while one hardy storm-watcher was seen calmly taking pictures of the beach from a wind-swept promenade.Local authorities were readying for the possibility of tornadoes into the evening in southern Texas, as the American Red Cross opened three shelters across the state in preparation.Images shared by the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi showed water lapping at the city’s bayfront Art Museum of South Texas. The Texas State Aquarium said it would be closed following some storm damage. Hanna hit as Texas faces a huge surge in Covid-19 infections, with officials instituting a state-wide mask mandate to curb the spread of the disease.The US is the hardest-hit country in the coronavirus pandemic, with some 4.2 million cases, and authorities will have to figure out how to safely shelter residents forced out of their homes by future hurricanes this season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-douglas-threatens-hawaii-as-hanna-downgrades-to-tropical-storm/story-hLmi7iZ7ggH1k11LmHv5MM.html

US and European lawmakers have recently stepped up their focus on how tech companies treat user data due to privacy concerns.“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.The regulator alleges Google used the combined data to boost targeted advertising - a key source of income - and that it did not make clear to consumers about changes in its privacy policy.The regulator did not say what it wanted the court to do, adding that it has filed the claim on a “confidential basis pending claims by Google.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-regulator-sues-google-over-expanded-personal-data-use/story-yQk6qgfbNFZDPTm25iQMZO.html

The protest was led by Canadians with ancestral roots from mainland China, Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, India and Philippines. The protestors stood in opposition to China’s treatment of people in Hong Kong and Tibet. They urged the international communities to intervene to get two Canadians, Michael Korvig and Michael Spavor, released who have been held hostage by the Chinese government The protest rally received an overwhelming response similar to a previous demonstration which was carried out earlier this month.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic, each group was allowed to bring a maximum of 50 people only. This comes just a week after a massive protest took place in Toronto against the Chinese communist regime for its expansionist policies. The protest saw over a hundred people participate in the rally wherein the speakers urged the Chinese communist party to free Tibet and Hong Kong, opposed Chinese aggression in Ladakh and raised the issue of human rights violations against Uyghurs.Ties between Canada and China have been strenuous since 2018 when Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, under the US warrant. After Meng was detained, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovri, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, on charges of espionage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-protest-held-in-vancouver-against-china-s-communist-regime/story-5FuktJILrka3mTNhnkRNSJ.html
27-07-2020||World||In another setback to China, Russia suspends deliveries of S-400 missiles: Report||Russia has announced suspension of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to China and said the resumption of further deliveries is yet to be ascertained.Citing Chinese newspaper Sohu, UAWire reported, “This time, Russia announced the postponement of the delivery of missiles for the Chinese S-400 system. To a certain extent, we can say that it is for the sake of China. Getting a gun is not as easy as signing an invoice after receiving a weapon.”“They say that the work on delivering these weapons is quite complicated. While China has to send personnel for training, Russia also needs to send a lot of technical personnel to put the weapons into service,” Sohu said.Post-Russia’s announcement, China has reportedly said that Moscow was forced to make such a decision as it “is worried that the delivery of S-400 missiles at this time will affect the anti-pandemic actions of the People’s Liberation Army and does not want to cause trouble to China.”Also Watch | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump In 2018, China received the first batch of S-400 missile, a military diplomatic source told Russia’s TASS news agency.The S-400 air defence missile system is considered the most advanced of its kind in Russia, capable of destroying targets at a distance of up to 400 kilometres and a height of up to 30 kilometres.Russia’s suspension of S-400 missiles to China comes after Moscow had earlier accused Beijing of spying, despite the two countries enjoying considerably good relations over the years.Russian authorities have found Valery Mitko, president of its St Petersburg Arctic Social Sciences Academy, guilty of handing over ‘classified materials to the Chinese intelligence,’ TASS reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-another-setback-to-china-russia-suspends-deliveries-of-s-400-missiles-report/story-BjFvo3A1cMlJq4jWRfODhL.html
27-07-2020||World||China pressurises Vietnam to cancel, compensate offshore firms operating in South China Sea||Amid the growing Chinese movement in the South China Sea, Vietnam has agreed to pay around a billion dollars to two international companies after cancelling their drill operations following pressure from Beijing, The Diplomat reported.To maintain its presence in the South China Sea region, China, for several years, continued its efforts to prevent the Vietnam-based companies developing oil and gas resources in the area.Citing a well-placed oil industry source, Bill Hayton, author of the article, said, “Vietnam’s state-owned energy company PetroVietnam will pay the money to Repsol of Spain and Mubadala of the United Arab Emirates in ‘termination’ and ‘compensation’ arrangements.”Meanwhile, Russian energy company Rosneft has been forced to suspend its plans for drilling offshore even as China Coast Guard vessels continue operating in the area where the drilling was supposed to place.In another instance, a drilling rig standing in the Vietnamese port of Vung Tau for two months has been stood down. “Its owners, Noble Corporation, noted that the contract “includes a termination payment. This is likely to cost Vietnam several million dollars more,” the author said.Similarly, Repsol, once one of the largest players in Vietnam’s offshore industry and owning rights in 13 blocks of the seabed, had to cancel its planned exploration drill in July 2017 and again on March 2018.Hayton said, “With minimal interests in China, Repsol appeared ready to withstand political pressure from Beijing. Two of its best development prospects were particularly bold: located at the far edge of Vietnam’s claimed exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and well within the U-shaped, nine-dashed line drawn on Chinese maps since 1948...”Repsol executives were reportedly informed that the cancellations were a political decision, ordered by top Vietnamese leadership, following extreme pressure from China, Hayton said.The author said, “China had assembled a flotilla of 40 naval ships off the coast of Hainan Island, about two days’ sailing from the drill site, and it appeared to be ready for confrontation.”As compensation for the investments made by Repsol and Mudabala, Vietnam is paying USD 800 million for their rights in the blocks and a further USD 200 million, Hayton quoted a regional oil industry source with knowledge of the settlement as saying.“This will be a billion dollars that PetroVietnam would otherwise have paid into the Vietnamese government’s budget.”As China’s pressure on Vietnam continues, recently, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said, “The United States rejects any PRC maritime claim in the waters surrounding Vanguard Bank (off Vietnam), Luconia Shoals (off Malaysia), waters in Brunei’s EEZ, and Natuna Besar (off Indonesia). Any PRC action to harass other states’ fishing or hydrocarbon development in these waters - or to carry out such activities unilaterally - is unlawful.”Extending help to Vietnam on the matter, he said, “America stands with our South-East Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pressurises-vietnam-to-cancel-compensate-offshore-firms-operating-in-south-china-sea/story-VrhQwQUo9nFY92vfz3TrSO.html

Bush was raised and where he met his wife, Laura, who was born there.While in Texas, Trump will raise money for the Republican Party and his reelection campaign at a fundraising luncheon with supporters in nearby Odessa.It will be Trump’s 16th visit as president to Texas, the White House said. He won the state in 2016 by 9 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Clinton, and Democrats are hoping for a more competitive race this year against Biden — if not an outright Biden win.Double Eagle Energy says it is one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, covering parts of western Texas and southeastern New Mexico.The White House said Trump has taken steps to help the energy industry recover after the coronavirus outbreak caused demand for energy — and prices — to plummet as people stayed home to avoid becoming infected..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-discuss-energy-tour-oil-rig-raise-money-in-texas/story-ueSdqQN6EbdabTQKYQqSuO.html
27-07-2020||World||UK plans to fight obesity with ad bans, more calorie labels||The UK imposed strict new limits on junk food advertising as ministers seek to control the country’s growing obesity problem, which has also been identified as a factor in coronavirus deaths.Plans include banning the advertising of foods high in fat, sugar or salt on television and online before 9pm, the country’s health and social care department said Monday. The government will also end buy-one-get-one-free promotions on sugary treats and require calorie labels on more products in stores as well as in restaurants. It’s starting a consultation on putting calorie counts on alcoholic beverages.“Losing weight is hard, but with some small changes we can all feel fitter and healthier,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. “If we all do our bit, we can reduce our health risks.”The curbs pile more pressure on food, retail, advertising and media industries already suffering from the economic lockdown imposed to control the coronavirus pandemic, with thousands of jobs under threat. They’re also a change of tack for Johnson, who’s previously complained about “nanny state” meddling in the lives of ordinary people. But the pandemic and his own brush with death in April persuaded him of the need to act on obesity.Almost two-thirds of British adults are overweight and one in three children leave primary school weighing too much, the health department said. Being too heavy also puts people at greater risk from coronavirus and places additional strain on the National Health Service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-to-fight-obesity-with-ad-bans-more-calorie-labels/story-Y3Uxos6WTV2tm4cdcags8K.html
27-07-2020||World||American flag lowered at US consulate in Chengdu: Report||The American flag was lowered at the United States consulate in Chengdu on Monday, days after Beijing ordered it to close in retaliation for the shuttering of the Chinese consulate in Houston.Footage on state broadcaster CCTV from outside the consulate showed the flag being slowly lowered early Monday morning, after diplomatic tensions soared between the two powers with both alleging the other had endangered national security.Relations deteriorated in recent weeks in a Cold War-style standoff, with the Chengdu mission Friday ordered to shut in retaliation for the forced closure of Beijing’s consulate in Houston, Texas.The deadline for the Americans to exit Chengdu has been unclear, but the Chinese consulate in Houston was given 72 hours to close after the original order was made.On Saturday AFP reporters saw workers removing the US insignia from the front of the consulate.Over the weekend, removals trucks entered the US consulate and cleaners were seen carting large black rubbish bags from the building.Beijing says closing the Chengdu consulate was a “legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable measures by the United States”, and has alleged that staff at the diplomatic mission endangered China’s security and interests.Washington officials, meanwhile, said there had been unacceptable efforts by the Chinese consulate in Houston to steal US corporate secrets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-flag-lowered-at-us-consulate-in-chengdu-report/story-nIMwriAyMZgt6pUtM3geSI.html
27-07-2020||World||New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern’s ratings sky high ahead of election||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s party raced ahead of rivals in the latest opinion poll, putting the charismatic 40-year-old leader on track for a comfortable victory in the elections in September.A Newshub-Reid Research Poll released late on Sunday showed the popularity of Ardern’s Labour Party rose to 60.9%, the highest it has been in the poll’s history.The popularity of the main opposition National Party, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and leadership changes, plunged to 25.1%.According to the survey the Labour Party, which is now in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, would win 77 of 120 seats in parliament. This means Labour would be able to govern without a coalition partner.Ardern’s own popularity as preferred prime minister was sky high at 62%, while the National Party’s newly elected 61-year-old leader Judith Collins stood at just 14.6%.Ardern has consistently polled ahead of her rivals and her popularity has risen further this year as she won global praise for her leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic.The country of 5 million people has had just 1,206 Covid-19 cases so far, and 22 deaths.Ardern’s stratospheric rise in 2017 to become New Zealand’s youngest prime minister and third woman to hold the office has been dubbed “Jacinda-mania” by some.“I would like to think the message we can take from this is the general support for the government’sCovid-19 recovery and response plan,” Ardern told Newshub on Monday in response to the survey.National Party campaign chairman Gerry Brownlee said the poll is a “rogue”.Collins told Reuters last week that she was confident her party would form the next government.Ardern, who turned 40 on Sunday, told Newshub she celebrated with her partner and her two-year-old daughter doing normal things like going to the beach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-s-ratings-sky-high-ahead-of-election/story-CkUvWGAbdMnVdxqKR99MtL.html
27-07-2020||World||Over 60 killed in renewed violence in Sudan’s Darfur: UN||A new bout of violence in Sudan’s war-torn Darfur region has left more than 60 people dead, the United Nations said Sunday. The clashes threaten to derail a fragile transition to democracy more than a year after the military’s ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Sudan said about 500 armed men on Saturday attacked the village of Masteri, located 48 kilometers (30 miles) south of Genena, the provincial capital of West Darfur province. The clashes between the Masalit and other Arab tribes in the area started earlier Saturday and lasted until late Sunday, state-run SUNA news agency reported, citing unnamed sources. Local authorities asked for military reinforcements to halt the clashes, the report said. The SUNA report did not provide a death toll, but said dozens of people were killed or wounded, and more than 60 wounded were taken by helicopter to Genena for treatment. An unconfirmed number of houses were looted and burned in the village, along with half the local market, OCHA said. The village borders Chad. The attack prompted around 500 people to start a protest camp in front of the Masalit Sultan House, a settlement hosting about 4,200 internally displaced persons in Masteri, the UN agency said. The protesters called for authorities to protect them from attacks. Sudan is on a fragile path to democracy after a popular uprising led the military to overthrow al-Bashir in April 2019. A military-civilian government now rules the country until elections, possibly in late 2022. Such clashes pose a challenge to government efforts to end decades-long rebellions in areas like Darfur, where most people live in camps for the displaced and refugees. Al-Bashir faces international charges of genocide and crimes against humanity over a scorched-earth campaign against rebels in Darfur in the 2000s.Saturday’s attack was the latest in a series of attacks in the area. OCHA documented at least seven from July 19-26 which left dozens dead or wounded. Last week, local authorities in West Darfur declared a 24-hour curfew in Genena, compromising access to nutrition, water and sanitation, education, health and other critical services, OCHA said. The clashes have come in the middle of the agricultural season, increasing humanitarian needs in the region. About 2.8 million people in the Darfur region are estimated to be severely food insecure from June to September, more than 545,000 of them in West Darfur alone, OCHA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-60-killed-in-renewed-violence-in-sudan-s-darfur-un/story-uioxPu8MoJo1FseKrNyEyO.html
