The second law would require that parents be notified when a girl under 18 is seeking an abortion even in situations in which she has asked a court to provide consent instead of her parents, as was allowed under existing law.The ultrasound measure was passed by the state legislature in 2016 and signed by Vice President Mike Pence when he was Indiana’s governor before Donald Trump selected him as his running mate.Abortion rights proponents have said that for most women seeking an abortion, an ultrasound is not medically necessary, and that the requirement is an attempt by anti-abortion politicians to make obtaining an abortion more difficult.Republicans at the state level have pursued a variety of abortion restrictions.In a third Indiana case on Thursday, the court left in place a ruling in favor of an abortion clinic seeking a license to open a clinic in South Bend. The state appealed when the 7th Circuit ruled in 2019 that abortion provider Whole Woman’s Health could get a provisional license while the litigation over the matter continued.The Supreme Court on Thursday in two other abortion-related cases left in place policies in Chicago and Pennsylvania’s capital Harrisburg that place limits on anti-abortion activists gathered outside clinics.The Chicago policy bars activists from coming within eight feet (2.4 meters) of someone within 50 feet (15 meters) of any healthcare facility without their consent if they intend to protest, offer counseling or hand out leaflets. The Harrisburg measure bars people from congregating or demonstrating within 20 feet (6 meters) of a healthcare facility’s entrance or exit. In Monday’s ruling on Louisiana’s law, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four liberal justices in the majority on the basis that the law was almost identical to a measure from Texas that the court struck down in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-tosses-rulings-blocking-indiana-abortion-curbs/story-WXuyCpyOcPipdkeUGZdKIJ.html
02-07-2020||World||Priest sues to stop federal execution over coronavirus risk||A Zen Buddhist priest, who is a spiritual adviser to one of three federal death row inmates scheduled to be executed this month, filed a lawsuit Thursday arguing the Bureau of Prisons is putting him at risk for the coronavirus by moving forward with executions during a nationwide pandemic.Dale Hartkemeyer, who goes by the religious name Seigen, argues that he would be putting his life at risk if the federal government proceeds to execute Wesley Ira Purkey, as scheduled on July 15, because of his prior medical conditions including respiratory issues.The 68-year-old is asking a federal judge to delay Purkey’s execution until a coronavirus vaccine is available or there’s a widespread effective treatment.Hartkemeyer said in court papers he has visited Purkey monthly as his priest since January 2009 to provide him with spiritual guidance and counseling.“I’m being asked to make an impossible decision — violate my religious beliefs or risk my health and life by attending an execution that could become a ‘super-spreader’ event for Covid-19,” Hartkemeyer wrote in a blog post.Purkey, a devout Buddhist, is one of four federal inmates scheduled to be put to death in July and August. Attorney General William Barr directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions, ending an informal moratorium on federal capital punishment as the issue receded from the public domain.Barr had initially scheduled five executions set to begin in December, but some of the inmates challenged the new procedures in court, arguing that the government was circumventing proper methods to wrongly execute inmates quickly. The executions were rescheduled last month after an appeals court threw out a lower court ruling that put the executions on hold. This week, the Supreme Court refused to block the executions.The executions are scheduled to resume as the country is still battling a major coronavirus pandemic and the number of inmates infected at jails and prisons across the U.S. is approaching 50,000 nationwide, according to data by The Associated Press and the Marshall Project. But federal officials have insisted that precautions will be put in place — including temperature checks and a requirement to wear masks — and that they are obligated to carry forward sentences imposed in the court system.The federal prison system has struggled to combat the coronavirus pandemic behind bars. As of Wednesday, there were five confirmed coronavirus cases at USP Terre Haute, the prison where the executions are scheduled to take place. One inmate there has died.Hartkemeyer argues that he must be present at the execution to be a spiritual guide for Purkey and to provide “spiritual consolation and compassion to him during this time, helping him attain peace of mind as he leaves this life.”“It’s vital that I be there, as Wes’s priest, to ensure this peaceful transition from life to death during his most dire moment of distress — his ultimate crisis — as he sits at the threshold of death,” he wrote. “I will chant from behind a plexiglass barrier to ensure his peace of mind while passing and, through my physical presence, serve as a spiritual reminder to Wes of all the religious lessons I have taught him as he passes on from this life. This is my sacred duty.”But he argues that means risking his own life. If he couldn’t be there, it would “constitute a troubling violation of my religious tenets and priestly obligations,” the lawsuit says.“He’s in this position where he has to decide between fulfilling his spiritual duty and trying to attend the execution and between protecting his own life and health and safety,” said Cassandra Stubbs, the director of the Capital Punishment Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Hartkemeyer.“There’s absolutely no reason to do it now in the pandemic. It’s really morally abhorrent,” Stubbs said.Purkey’s lawyers are separately asking a federal judge to halt his execution, arguing that he isn’t mentally fit to be executed because he suffers from “advancing Alzheimer’s disease and deteriorating cognitive functioning.”Purkey, of Lansing, Kansas, was sentenced to death for the 1998 killing of 16-year-old Jennifer Long after picking her up in Kansas City, Missouri. Purkey raped Long, stabbed her repeatedly and used a chainsaw to cut her body into pieces. He burned her remains in a fireplace and then dumped her ashes 200 miles (322 kilometers) away in a septic pond in Clearwater, southwest of Wichita. He was also convicted of using a claw hammer to kill an 80-year-old Kansas woman, Mary Ruth Bales, who suffered from polio.Purkey had a long history of childhood trauma, was sexually abused by family members and a Catholic priest and was beaten by other family members, said Liz Vartkessian, a mitigation specialist who has worked with Purkey’s legal team and has visited him dozens of times in the last five years.“His case is replete with instances where he has expressed a deep remorse,” she saidBut recently, Purkey’s mental health has seriously deteriorated to the point where he doesn’t have the stamina for long visits with his legal team and often forgets key facts and dates, she said. Correction officers have to help him write down a schedule to remember his visits with his lawyers, she said.He has also had a long history of paranoia and delusions and believes the Justice Department is moving forward with his execution because of many complaints and lawsuits he’s brought in prison, even though most have failed, Vartkessian said.“It’s hard to find any rational explanation for trying to set those executions so quickly,” Stubbs said, “especially when we haven’t had an execution in 17 years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/priest-sues-to-stop-federal-execution-over-coronavirus-risk/story-dc0isevLcSZN2dtZcLoFVN.html

It recommends that smokers quit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/smoking-linked-to-higher-risk-of-coronavirus-says-who/story-RaqUoqBaDPfFdwKGS6gmBL.html
02-07-2020||World||Joe Biden vows to accord ‘high priority’ to ties with India if elected||Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has said the United States and India were “natural partners” and if elected the relationship will be a “high priority” for his administration. The former vice-president also said he will end the temporary suspension of H-1B visas ordered by President Donald Trump last week ostensibly to ensure American had the first crack at jobs becoming available as the US reopens from Covid-19 lockdown. But the visa programme, of which Indians are the largest beneficiaries, has been in the crosshairs of immigration hawks in his administration.India and the US are “natural partners”, Biden said at a virtual fundraiser Wednesday, using a phrase for describing the relationship that has evolved from “natural allies”, as first used by late Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. Former US president George W Bush switched in “partners” for “allies”.“That partnership, a strategic partnership, is necessary and important in our security,” Biden said and proceeded to give a more expansive account of his role in promoting the relationship, such as securing the civil nuclear deal that ended India’s isolation from the community of nuclear states.“I was proud to play a role more than a decade ago in securing congressional approval for the US India Civil Nuclear Agreement,” he said, adding, “which is a big deal.” It was indeed, and has remained so, setting a high bar for everything that has followed in the relationship.“Helping open the door to great progress in our relationship and strengthening our strategic partnership with India was a high priority in the Obama-Biden administration and will be a high priority if I’m elected president,” the former vice-president said, and added, “India needs to be a partner in the region for our safety(’s) sake and quite frankly for theirs.”Biden visited India as vice-president in July 2013, with his wife Jill Biden.At a virtual town-hall with Asian American and Pacific Islanders, the former vice-president came out clearly agains Trump’s suspension of H-1Bs. “He (Trump) just ended H-1B visas the rest of this year. That will not be in my administration,” he said in response to a questions.People on this visa “have built this country”, Biden said.This will come as a huge relief for the Indians hoping to work in the United States and US and Indian companies that hire them on H-1B. The United States issues 85,000 of these temporary non-immigrant visas for high-skill jobs every year, and more than 70% go to Indians.Critics of the programme have argued H-1B visas are being used to bring cheaper labor from abroad and displace Americans. The Trump administration stepped up scrutiny of the programme soon after Trump came into offie in January 2017 and issued an executive order titled “Buy American, Hire American”.A larger reform of the programme was announced along with the suspension last week. It would include doing away with the electronic lottery system to pick successful H-1B petitions from among the hundred and thousands that are filed. Selection will be based on those getting the highest salary. Other changes are also in the offing, but there is no timeline for it yet.The vice-president went on to speak of other immigration issues as the plight of undocumented immigrants brought as children, called Dreamers. Many of them are of Indian origin. “On day one (of his presidency), I’m going to send a legislative immigration reform bill to congress to provide a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who contribute so much to this country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-to-accord-high-priority-to-ties-with-india-if-elected/story-LvoFIaLIFXtpSoFrNL50zO.html

The bill heads to President Donald Trump for his signature or veto.The House and Senate moved quickly to enact the legislation after the Chinese government imposed a new national security law in the territory that critics say is aimed at squashing protests against the government and could lead to, in some cases, life imprisonment.The legislation has been a top priority for some of the highest profile members of Congress, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi giving it her full endorsement Wednesday and praising its swift passage.Pelosi, in a statement Wednesday, called the legislation “an urgently needed response to the cowardly Chinese government’s passage of its so-called ‘national security’ law, which threatens the end of the ‘one country, two systems’ promised exactly 23 years ago today.”The legislation was originally introduced in the Senate by Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, and Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat. After the Senate passed it by voice vote last week, the bill was modified slightly in the House and had to be passed again by the Senate.It provides for sanctions against financial institutions that are determined by the U.S. to be interfering in Hong Kong affairs. It requires the State Department to report to Congress every year about officials who seek to undermine the “one country, two systems” model that applies to Hong Kong. It gives the president the power to seize the assets of those individuals and block their entry to the U.S.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-passes-bill-for-sanctions-on-chinese-officials-over-hong-kong-security-law/story-4QIBcnNsEJYDSjw6j6kqVJ.html

This was also much more than the expected 2.9 million.Lay-offs and job losses have also continued and another 1.4 million claims were filed last week for unemployment benefits.President Donald Trump focused on the June job numbers, calling them “historic”. He went on to say at a news briefing, “Today’s announcement proves that our economy is roaring back. It’s coming back extremely strong.”The US economy is indeed opening but not equally. Some states in the south has slapping back restrictions as they witness a surge in daily infections. And economists have warned that June numbers do no reflect the impact of the second round of shutdowns forced by the new infections, which, public health officials fear, could spread to other parts of the country.The June jump comes on the back of the stunning turnaround first seen in the situation in the May numbers, which had shown 2.7 million new jobs had been added instead of the steady losses that had come to be expected every Thursday, when the labor leased its weekly jobs report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-added-4-8-million-jobs-in-june-donald-trump-says-historic/story-t2lsHI61t9aJzKdmVWgLAK.html

The EU Delegation in agreement with EU Heads of Mission based in Kabul said in a statement on Tuesday that the situation has further deteriorated since May 29 when the EU Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers declared the level of violence as “unacceptable”.“The attacks by the Taliban against Afghan National Defence and Security Forces are undermining the prospect for intra-Afghan Negotiations; this must end and a full-fledged ceasefire enter into force. Violence against civilians has also continued. It is a violation of international humanitarian law, which profoundly undermines the confidence and trust necessary for peace negotiations,” read the statement posted on the official twitter page of EU in Afghanistan on June 30.The European mission heads said the targeted killings against clergy, journalists, human rights defenders, among others, have increased in the recent weeks. “It appears to be a deliberate attempt to stifle debate in advance of peace negotiations. These crimes need to be investigated and the responsible brought to justice,” said the statement.One such attack is the cowardly assassination of two staff members of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission on June 27.“The violence must stop now and an immediate humanitarian ceasefire put in place. A permanent and comprehensive ceasefire is a subsequent step that needs to accompany the Intra-Afghan Negotiations,” the statement added.US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad is in Asia these days, travelling over to Islamabad, Tashkent and Doha to garner support to meet the remaining commitments ahead of intra-Afghan negotiations which were initially set to commence on March 10, under the US-Taliban peace deal, but were pushed back due to disagreements over the mutual release of prisoners.Last week, Khalilzad said that intra-Afghan talks are closer than ever, praising Kabul for freeing over 3,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban for releasing more than 500 government prisoners.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-seeks-immediate-humanitarian-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-condemns-violence/story-c2mLcd93HlbHZCY5sF5H7K.html

As people say, a lot of things have just been tacked together,” he added. “We need internal stability and time to strengthen the country and its institutions.”Putin said he understood those who voted against the amendments, pointing to “many unsolved problems.”But the results of the vote “show that an overwhelming majority of Russian citizens believe that we can work better” and the government “must do everything to justify this trust,” Putin said.ma/as/bmm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-thanks-russians-for-support-and-trust-after-vote/story-Lam8CitKwAwo1IcBXRM8dK.html

Verma, who was 42 at the time, was assaulted in Acton Park by eight men on August 31, 2003, resulting in severe brain damage. He died on May 27, 2018. A special post mortem in June 2018 concluded there was a causal link between the 2003 assault and his death.A verdict of unlawful killing was recorded at an inquest held at West London Coroners Court in November 2019. The case was classified as a murder investigation in March this year, with inquiries by homicide detectives from the Yard’s Specialist Crime Command.A £20,000 reward is being offered for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Verma’s killer. Officials distributed leaflets in Action high street in the borough as part of the resumed investigation, besides re-issuing appeals for information.Detective chief inspector Vicky Tunstall said on Thursday: “The attack on Raj involved ferocious violence by a group of men, one of whom, stabbed him in the head with a set of garden shears found near the crime scene”.“We believe Raj was attacked after he intervened in a dispute between one of his friends and another individual. The suspects are believed to be local to the Acton area and are likely to still be living there or have links to the area. All were described as being of East African appearance”.“This is a shocking crime and I’m in no doubt that people will have chatted and boasted about it. I need your call to identify Raj’s killer and that’s why we are offering a reward of £20,000 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible”, she added.After the 2003 attack, Verma was treated at hospital before being discharged. However, he was left with a number of ongoing health issues due to the damage caused to his brain by the stab wound to his head.In 2015, he had a major heart attack, which resulted in a lack of oxygen to his brain that further complicated the existing damage. This rendered him unresponsive and unable to move or speak for the last 18 months of his life.Verma’s wife, Roma Verma, said the aftermath of the attack had a huge impact on the family: “Our children were 11 and 13 when their lives were turned upside down. We chose to care for him at home in the way that he had cared for all of us”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-cops-resume-probe-into-indian-man-s-murder-in-2003/story-xHrIqK20FiaxzC9V5rFzXP.html

With 78 new deaths due to coronavirus, Pakistan’s death toll stands at 4,473. A total of 1,04,694 patients that amount to nearly half of the total cases in the country recovered from the infection, the ministry added.The Sindh Province continues to remain the worst hit from Covid-19 with total infections nearing 87,000. This is followed by Punjab with 77,740 cases, whereas the capital city of Islamabad registered 13,082 infections. Pakistan has so far tested 1,327,638 of its citizens with 22,128 tests conducted in the last 24 hours. In the recent weeks, Pakistan was one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic. In view of this, the government decided to impose ‘smart lockdown’ in hot spots across the country in order to curb the spread of Covid-19 and revive the economy.As per the smart lockdown, offices, business are allowed to operate five days a week. Medical stores are allowed to operate throughout. However, educational institutions, restaurants, movie theatres will remain closed and social, religious gatherings will not be permitted.Special Assistant on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said the numbers of infections were decreasing due to ‘smart lockdown’ and the monsoon season would further reduce the number of cases.Mirza added that 28 laboratories were conducting tests for the virus across the country.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-4-339-new-cases-pakistan-s-covid-tally-reaches-217-809-death-toll-at-4-473/story-p5Ip6MzXAdpcpbjHJOtxIM.html

But data cited by former Bank of England policy maker Charles Goodhart and co-author Jonathan Ashworth show a marked increase of bills in circulation in the US, Canada, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Brazil and Russia.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here While some analysts argue that going completely cashless would help the global economy become more efficient, an abrupt end would hurt people with no access to the banking system. It would also pose a challenge to small businesses that find the costs of going completely digital too expensive.“While the economic shutdowns and increased use of online retailing are currently diminishing cash’s traditional function as a medium of exchange, it seems that this is being more than offset by panic driven hoarding of banknotes,” Goodhart and Ashworth wrote in a paper for the Centre for Economic Policy Research.“Cash in circulation has actually been growing strongly,” they wrote.The findings jar with the view expressed by US President Donald Trump’s former economic adviser Gary Cohn, who argued recently that the virus was speeding up the disappearance of cash.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage It’s easy to see why such a prediction could be appealing. The use of paper money has been on the decline in some countries for years, due to the spread of credit cards and the technological developments that led to the rise of mobile-phone wallets. A research report by HSBC Holdings Plc in April said that the shift away from cash an “acceleration of an already ongoing trend.”Michele Bullock, an assistant governor at Australia’s central bank, said in a speech last month that while cash remains important, Covid-19 might be the “ultimate disrupter” of the payment system. ATM withdrawals in Australia were down 30% in April compared with the previous month, she said.But data cited by the Bank of International Settlements supported the findings of Goodhart and Ashworth, showing that the rise in digital transaction during the pandemic wasn’t necessarily at the expense of the old stuff.“Precautionary holdings of cash have risen in some economies – even as its use in daily transactions has fallen,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-isn-t-killing-cash-people-are-hoarding-more-of-it/story-jo9hr6cW2Yc8ertPmJQa2N.html
02-07-2020||World||At least 113 killed as Myanmar jade mine collapse buries workers||A landslide at a jade mine in northern Myanmar killed at least 113 people, with more feared dead, authorities said on Thursday, after a heap of mining waste collapsed into a lake, triggering a wave of mud and water that buried many workers.The miners were collecting stones in the jade-rich Hpakant area of Kachin state when the “muddy wave” crashed onto them, after heavy rain, the fire service department said in a Facebook post.Rescue workers recovered 113 bodies, the department said, but more were missing.“Other bodies are in the mud,” Tar Lin Maung, a local official with the information ministry, told Reuters by phone, “The numbers are going to rise.”Deadly landslides and other accidents are common in the poorly regulated mines of Hpakant, which draw impoverished workers from across Myanmar, but this is the worst in more than five years. About 100 people were killed in a collapse in 2015, which strengthened calls to regulate the industry.Media have reported scores of people killed in the area in recent years, many of them freelance “jade pickers” who scour tailings - the residue from mining - for stones that have been missed by larger operators.Video footage on social media showed frantic miners racing uphill to escape as a towering pile of black waste cascaded into a turquoise lake, churning up a tsunami-like wave of mud.Photos showed rows of dead bodies laid out on a hill, covered by tarpaulin.Maung Khaing, a 38-year-old miner from the area who witnessed the accident, said he was about to take a picture of the precarious waste mound that looked set to collapse when people began shouting “run, run!”.“Within a minute, all the people at the bottom (of the hill) just disappeared,” he told Reuters by phone. “I feel empty in my heart. I still have goose bumps ... There were people stuck in the mud shouting for help but no one could help them.”Than Hlaing, a member of a local civil society group helping in the aftermath of the disaster, said those killed on Thursday were freelancers scavenging the waste left by a larger mining company. She said about 100 people were still missing and 30 had been hospitalized.The government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi pledged to clean up the industry when it took power in 2016, but activists say little has changed.Official sales of jade in Myanmar were worth 671 million euros ($750 million) in 2016-17, according to data published by the government as part of an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.But experts believe the true value of the industry, which mainly exports to China, is much larger.Than Hlaing said a local official had warned people not to go to the mine on Thursday because of the bad weather.“There’s no hope for the families to get compensation as they were freelance miners,” she said, “I don’t see any route to escape this kind of cycle. People take risks, go into landfills, as they have no choice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-113-killed-as-myanmar-jade-mine-collapse-buries-workers/story-rOmvKZEghqLnOrpHSQ9YxH.html
02-07-2020||World||How Chinese firm CanSino jumped to the front of the coronavirus vaccine race||When a group of Chinese scientists gathered over barbecue and beer in a Toronto backyard a decade ago, talk drifted to their homeland’s vaccines, which had long lagged the developed world on quality and safety. Four of them decided to act.They left top positions at global pharmaceutical companies in Canada to set up a biotechnology firm half a world away in Tianjin, China, hoping to produce vaccines on par with Western countries. Now, that company, CanSino Biologics Inc., is vaulting into the global spotlight as connections on both sides of the Pacific make it one of the front-runners in the race for a coronavirus vaccine.CanSino’s Chinese-born chief executive officer, Yu Xuefeng, formerly a senior executive at drugmaker Sanofi’s Canadian vaccine operations, has maintained relationships in Canada and China even as geopolitical disagreements polarize both countries. Yu has boosted his firm’s scientific prowess by tying up with the Canadian government’s largest research organization. At home, he’s worked with a prominent Chinese military scientist, first on an Ebola vaccine and now on CanSino’s experimental coronavirus shot.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here In May, CanSino became the first globally to publish a full scientific study on its early human trials, an important step because it allows researchers worldwide to assess a vaccine’s potential.The company -- which is yet to generate revenue and logged a $22 million loss last year -- has so far kept up with, and occasionally even outpaced, Western pharmaceutical giants with the speed of its initial coronavirus vaccine trials. The research is still too nascent to know if the shot from CanSino, or indeed any company, will provide the magic bullet countries are seeking to open up while the pandemic rages. But CanSino’s inroads show China’s young biotechnology industry is becoming a global contender, and a powerful tool for President Xi Jinping.CanSino “deserves credit for the speed with which they pushed the vaccine through pre-clinical studies and human testing,” said Wang Ruizhe, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Capital Securities Corp. in Shanghai. “It tells you something about their ability to mobilize and leverage the resources that it takes to get all these done. The resources required here are substantial.”A spokesperson for the Chinese company, citing media reports in May, said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is supportive of the Canadian researchers working on clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine with CanSino.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage China’s pharmaceutical industry has been dogged by safety incidents and quality scandals. But in recent years, parts of it have grown more advanced as hundreds of Chinese scientists trained in the West have come home.Called hai gui, or “sea turtles,” these returnees have capitalized on relationships and expertise gained in countries like the US and Canada, and created new companies. CanSino’s CEO Yu -- 57, who has a doctorate from Canada’s McGill University in microbiology and was the head of vaccine development and production at Sanofi Pasteur in Canada -- belongs to this new breed of executives.In the prospectus for CanSino’s 2019 public offering in Hong Kong, Yu described the difficult choices he and his colleagues made in forging their new path back home in China.“Most of our families stayed in Canada, and we could only see them a few times a year,” he wrote. “When you think about your young kids and teenagers growing up without dads, when you know your wife had to shovel out of 10 inches of deep snow early morning in -20°C wind chill all by herself – those were the tough moments.”Both SidesThe name CanSino represents the Chinese characters for health, hope and promises, while in English it’s a combination of Canada and China. Besides Yu, other top officials at the firm have Canadian connections. Chief Scientific Officer Zhu Tao was also a senior scientist at Sanofi Pasteur in Canada. The company’s success has relied on threading the needle between both nations.In February 2014, about five years after returning to China, Yu licensed a technology from the National Research Council of Canada called HEK 293 cell lines, which is required to produce large quantities of a vaccine reliably. That science went on to partly underpin CanSino’s viral vector technology.An advanced way to make a vaccine, a viral vector is a genetically modified virus that is no longer harmful to humans, but can serve as a vehicle to carry the genes of another germ to prepare the immune system for attack. Few Chinese companies had that technology in 2014, when a Chinese army researcher called Chen Wei began looking for viral vector expertise to produce a vaccine amid Africa’s Ebola outbreak.Ebola VaccineA major general in China’s People’s Liberation Army, Chen headed the Institute of Biotechnology at the country’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences. She went on to work with CanSino to develop an Ebola vaccine that in 2017 was approved in China for emergency use and national stockpiling.Chen has star status in China. In a nationalistic movie called Wolf Warrior II, the character of a scientist who develops a vaccine against a deadly African virus is believed to be modeled on her. She developed a therapy used by Chinese health workers during the SARS outbreak of 2003.Chen is also known for a singular dedication to her work. In a 2004 interview with state-run CCTV, she said she presented her findings on the SARS therapy to Beijing’s municipal authorities after dosing her four-year-old son with it for two months because she was so sure about her research.CanSino’s long-running relationship with Chen paid off again this year. CanSino and her team raced through pre-clinical studies on the coronavirus vaccine -- called Ad5-nCoV. They secured Beijing’s help on everything from isolating virus strains to animal testing. Chen and the institute couldn’t be reached for comment.Mixed ResultsThe team started human clinical trials in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged, on March 16. Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc., seen as one of the best contenders to produce an American vaccine, started its tests in the US the same day. Less than a month later, CanSino began the second phase of wide-scale human trials. On May 22, when it published a study in the medical journal the Lancet, the results were mixed: The shot appeared to be safe and generated some immune response, but there were shortcomings.Viral vector technology can have limitations when some people already have pre-existing immunity to the vector virus used to create the vaccine. This was the case for the adenovirus -- a genetically-altered cold-causing virus -- which CanSino used for its vaccine. Many of those with pre-existing adenovirus immunity showed diminished response to its coronavirus shot in the Lancet study.‘In the Game’For upcoming trials in Canada, CanSino has added a booster shot for some participants to attempt to address the lackluster response from those with pre-existing immunity to the adenovirus vector, according to a person with knowledge of its trial design who didn’t want to be named discussing information that’s not public.“CanSino is in the game and it’s about where the other so-called leaders are,” said William Haseltine, a former Harvard University HIV researcher. “Whether anybody will cross the finish line where we ever can see safety data that we would like to see is unknown.”Final-stage trials could yet stymie CanSino’s outsized ambitions. Its Ebola vaccine was approved on an emergency basis after two stages of human testing, but the company never completed the final phase as the epidemic petered out in Africa. CanSino doesn’t generate much revenue because most of its products, including two late-stage meningitis vaccines, are still in development.The company has received some funding from Beijing for the coronavirus vaccine, although the amount isn’t large, the person familiar with its trials said.Phase IIICanSino’s founders’ ties with Canada are once again proving fortuitous as it looks to conduct Phase III tests on its vaccine. Still, there could be challenges in conducting the sizable studies required in the final stages if new coronavirus infections continue to taper in Canada. China has largely stamped out its outbreak.Researchers at Dalhousie University’s Canadian Center for Vaccinology, who are leading the clinical trials, have said they hope to start Phase III studies of the CanSino shot as early as this fall. Canada’s National Research Council said if the vaccine candidate is approved by authorities there, it has the option to produce doses of the vaccine for emergency pandemic use in Canada. (CanSino is responsible for funding its own trials, Health Canada, the government’s health agency, said in an email.)Meanwhile, China’s reputation in Canada -- already damaged by Beijing’s reaction to the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer in Vancouver -- has been dealt a further blow by the pandemic and perceptions China hid the virus initially. That could fuel more scrutiny of CanSino and its vaccine in Canada.Other companies are also racing ahead. Moderna is set to test its vaccine among 30,000 people in the US in July, while an early-stage trial of a Pfizer Inc. and BioNtech SE shot showed it’s safe and prompted patients to produce antibodies against the coronavirus. A vaccine co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc also started the final stage of human testing in Brazil in June.At home, state-run vaccine developer China National Biotec Group Co. has secured approval from health authorities in the UAE to conduct Phase III testing for the two shots it developed against the coronavirus. Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech Ltd. has inked a deal to do final tests in Brazil, too. The outcome for all of these companies -- and CanSino -- will only be known once this ultimate stage of scientific studies is complete.“The viral vector CanSino is using is a relatively safe approach compared to other techniques but it’s hard to make a call on efficacy for now,” said Wang, the Shanghai-based analyst. “There’s no shortage of histories where promising efforts made it to the last stage of testing only to see things fall apart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-chinese-firm-cansino-jumped-to-the-front-of-the-coronavirus-vaccine-race/story-tlVBubnfCBcQ8ygsapebgJ.html
02-07-2020||World||Donald Trump grateful to health workers for Covid-19 fight: White House||US president Donald Trump is tremendously grateful to all the doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals, including Indian-Americans, who have selflessly risen to the occasion to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the White House has said. More than 100,000 Indian-American doctors have contributed to the fight against the coronavirus and the president thanks them for their tireless, life-saving work, White House Assistant Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told PTI on Wednesday. Many Indian-Americans have laid down their lives in the fight against the Covid-19. This is the first time that the White House has recognised the selfless contribution of the Indian-American doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals. “President Trump is tremendously grateful for all of the doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals who have selflessly risen to the occasion to combat the coronavirus pandemic on the frontline,” Leavitt said. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 10 million people and killed more than 516,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.6 million cases and more than 1,28,000 deaths. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. Eminent Indian-American doctors from across the country thanked Trump for recognising their efforts. “We are going through one of the most unprecedented crises of our lifetime. The leadership of President Trump has helped to reduce the economic damage to the country,” Dr Raj Bhayani, president of New York chapter of American Association of Physicians of India-origin (AAPI), said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his recent first-ever address to an AAPI summit through video conferencing, said that he was proud of the achievements and contribution of the Indian-origin physicians in the battle against the Covid-19. “Hundreds of Indian physicians in the US have fought this global war as frontline physicians/soldiers,” said AAPI president Dr Suresh Reddy, adding that the organisation has honored more than 10,000 nurses in over 100 hospitals in over 40 states. Welcoming Trump’s praise for the doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals, Dr Naresh Parikh, former AAPI president from Atlanta, said that as compared to other countries, American citizens have done better due to the brilliant economic stimulus for businesses, physicians and direct payment to taxpayers who are in employment. “We believe that under the leadership of Trump, America will come out even stronger once this crisis is over,” Dr Parikh said. Responding to a question, Dr Bhayani said that he and a group of eminent Indian-American doctors are planning to campaign for Trump in the key battleground states of Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Virginia. They are working with Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee. “There is tremendous enthusiasm among Indians in the US to support Trump as Democrats are lining up against Modi and India as well as the Kashmir issue,” he said, adding that one should not get surprised if people of Indian-origin play a major role in the 2020 elections. Dr Humberto Nunez, a physician from Texas, said that healthcare professionals have been hit hard. “Our hospitals are almost in full capacity, fortunately we have the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and resources to treat those patients properly in our hospitals, and my business got the financial support from the government through the care programme,” he said. Noting that the COVID-19 has taken a tremendous toll; mentally, physically and financially, not only on his patients but also on him and his family, neurologist Dr Vithalbhai D Dhaduk said that Trump has done an outstanding job to help people with PPP and loans, assisting healthcare workers with special federal funding and stabilising the financial and job market. “We as an Indian community and US citizens are very proud of President Trump,” said Dr Dhaduk, who is also the chairman of the Saurastra Patel Cultural Samaj. Over the weekend, addressing the virtual AAPI summit, India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu described Indian-American doctors as real heroes’ warriors in this fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-grateful-to-health-workers-for-covid-19-fight-white-house/story-ZdI60Ui7oB2rUp3EZnjF4M.html
02-07-2020||World||78% of voters back extending Russian Prez Putin’s rule till 2036: Report||Almost 78% of voters in Russia have approved amendments to the country’s constitution that will allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036, Russian election officials said on Thursday after all the votes were counted. Kremlin critics said the vote was rigged.In the week-long balloting that concluded on Wednesday, 77.9% voted for the changes, and 21.3% voted against, with 100% of the precincts counted by Thursday morning, Russia’s Central Election Commission said. The turnout exceeded 64%, according to officials.The reported numbers reflect the highest level of voter support for Putin in 10 years. In the 2018 presidential election, 76.7% of voters supported his candidacy, while in the 2012 election only 63.6% did.But Kremlin critics say the numbers alone show they are false, with an unrealistic approval rating for the Russian leader amid wide frustration in the country over declining living standards.“A record in falsifying votes has been set in Russia,” opposition politician Alexei Navalny said in a Facebook post on Thursday. “The announced result has nothing whatsoever to do with the people’s opinion.” Putin’s approval rating was at 59% in May, according to the Levada Center, Russia’s top independent pollster. That was the lowest in two decades.The week-long plebiscite was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities, with independent election observers criticising the voting procedure as having a complete lack of transparency and independent control.For the first time in Russia, polls were kept open for an entire week to bolster turnout and avoid election-day crowds amid the coronavirus pandemic -- a provision that Kremlin critics denounced as an extra tool to manipulate the outcome, as ballot boxes remained unattended for days at night.Observers also pointed to the relentless pressure that state and private employers put on their staff to vote, monitoring that was hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and virus-related restrictions, and the dubious legal standing of the early voting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/78-of-voters-back-extending-russian-prez-putin-s-rule-till-2036-report/story-TcpiGZCYeVQ4cdXUvgcr0K.html
02-07-2020||World||Microsoft to help 25 million people acquire digital skills amid Covid-19 crisis||Microsoft Corporation has announced a new global skills initiative aimed at bringing more digital skills to 25 million people worldwide by the end of the year.This comes in response to the global economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Expanded access to digital skills is an important step in accelerating economic recovery, especially for the people hardest hit by job losses.The initiative includes immediate steps to help those looking to reskill and pursue an in-demand job and brings together every part of the company, combining existing and new resources from LinkedIn, GitHub and Microsoft. This includes the use of data to identify in-demand jobs and the skills needed to fill them, free access to learning paths and content to help people develop the skills these positions require, low-cost certifications and free job-seeking tools to help people who develop these skills pursue new jobs.In addition, Microsoft is backing the effort with 20 million dollars in cash grants to help non-profit organisations worldwide assist the people who need it most.“Covid-19 has created both public health and an economic crisis, and as the world recovers, we need to ensure no one is left behind,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.“We are bringing together resources from Microsoft inclusive of LinkedIn and GitHub to reimagine how people learn and apply new skills -- and help 25 million people facing unemployment due to Covid-19 prepare for the jobs of the future.”Microsoft President Brad Smith said the biggest brunt of the current downturn is being borne by those who can afford it the least.“Unemployment rates are spiking for people of colour and women as well as younger workers, people with disabilities and individuals who have less formal education. Our goal is to combine the best in technology with stronger partnerships with governments and nonprofits to help people develop the skills needed to secure a new job.”Microsoft said it will also use its voice to advocate for public policy innovations that will advance skilling opportunities needed in the changing economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-to-help-25-million-people-acquire-digital-skills-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-23W89ckoo8crVpFy8wkSwK.html
02-07-2020||World||V-shaped recovery not guaranteed, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath warns UK||Britain may not get the V-shaped recovery that some Bank of England policy makers are hoping for.Asked by a panel of UK lawmakers on Wednesday whether the country could see a smooth rebound, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said “many things are possible.”“My fear is that the beginning of the recovery” will show “a spike initially, and then going forward, I think we could end up with something much more flat,” Gopinath told the House of Commons Treasury Committee. “It’s a little too early at this point to project what the rest of that path would look like.”Globally, this will likely be a prolonged recovery, with activity levels below pre-crisis levels even by the end of 2021. There are still upside risks, she said.Her comments follow a speech from BOE policy maker Jonathan Haskel, who said that the economy is seeing a “glimmer of hope.” BOE Chief Economist Andy Haldane said earlier this week that the recovery looks V-shaped so far in Britain.Laurence Boone, chief economist at the OECD, told the Treasury Committee that while the economic impact on Britain is comparable to France, Spain and Italy, it will be particularly hit because of its reliance on services.The OECD sees the UK economy shrinking 11.5% this year, while the IMF predicts a contraction of just over 10%. Gopinath reminded lawmakers that the impact of the pandemic in poor countries is much worse.‘Really Sad’“The U.K. having negative growth of 10% is very different to a low-income country having a negative growth rate of 10%,” she said. The projections for poverty in such countries are “really sad.”The sectors worst affected by the pandemic are job intensive, and low-skilled workers, the young, women and minorities have taken a disproportionate hit, Gopinath said. Unemployment will come down “only gradually.”Asked whether the 5 billion pounds of accelerated investment announced by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be sufficient tor revive the economy, Gopinath said the multiplier effect -- the output generated for every pound of new investment -- would be “quite substantial” at a time of low employment.Still, measures to help specific firms can only go so far. While credit guarantees made sense during the initial part of the crisis, Gopinath said, “the more prolonged it gets, and depending upon which sector the firm is operating in, you could see that this becomes very quickly a solvency problem for many firms.”Company FailuresDebt restructuring and equity finance could help, though the best possible policy for countries to pursue now is to improve their bankruptcy procedures, according to Gopinath. “As the longevity of this crisis increases, that’s going to be important,” she said.The risk of runaway inflation is “pretty muted at this point,” she said, when asked about the massive policy loosening deployed by global authorities to tackle the crisis. Demand is expected to remain subdued for some time, and low employment will limit wage growth.The deficits created by the crisis cannot be left unchecked indefinitely, however. While now is not the time to be cutting spending or raising taxes, countries need to be planning for medium-term fiscal term consolidation, Gopinath said.A return to growth in 2021 will stabilize debt, but “more will need to be done to bring down debt to pre-crisis levels,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/v-shaped-recovery-not-guaranteed-imf-chief-economist-gita-gopinath-warns-uk/story-LgH1DGMLolJcO7OdQu0UeK.html
02-07-2020||World||Museum or mosque? Top Turkey court to rule on Hagia Sophia||Turkey’s top court will deliver a critical verdict Thursday on whether Istanbul’s emblematic landmark and former church Hagia Sophia can be redesignated as a mosque, a ruling which could inflame tensions with the West.The sixth-century edifice -- a magnet for tourists worldwide with its stunning architecture -- has been a museum since 1935, open to believers of all faiths. Despite occasional protests by Islamic groups, often shouting, “Let the chains break and open Hagia Sophia” for Muslim prayers outside the UNESCO world heritage site, authorities have so far kept the building a museum.The Hagia Sophia was first constructed as a church in the Christian Byzantine Empire in the sixth century but was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Transforming the Hagia Sophia into a museum was a key reform of the post-Ottoman Turkish authorities under the modern republic’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.But calls for it to serve again as a mosque have raised anger among Christians and tensions between historic foes and uneasy NATO allies Turkey and Greece.Turkey’s Council of State will deliver a ruling on its status either on the same day or within two weeks, the official Anadolu news agency reported.ALSO SEE : Photos | Mosque or museum: Turkey’s disputed Hagia Sophia- ‘High-profile symbol’ -President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month said the decision was for the court -- known as the Danistay -- adding: “The necessary steps will be taken following the verdict.”But Erdogan previously indicated it was time to rename the Hagia Sophia as a mosque, saying it had been a “very big mistake” to convert it into a museum, in comments before municipal elections last year.“The Danistay decision will likely be a political one. Whatever the outcome, it will be a result of the government’s deliberation,” said Asli Aydintasbas, fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.But she added the government will be weighing a number of issues, including relations with Greece, Europe and with the US where “religion is an important matter”.Anthony Skinner of the risk assessment firm Verisk Maplecroft said converting the Hagia Sophia into a mosque would “kill at least two birds with one stone” for Erdogan: he could cater to his Islamic and nationalist base, and sustain if not exacerbate tensions with Greece, all while seeking to cast Turkey as a formidable power.“Erdogan could not find a more high-profile and potent symbol than Hagia Sophia to achieve all these goals at once,” he told AFP.The Turkish leader has in recent years placed ever greater emphasis on the battles which resulted in the defeat of Byzantium by the Ottomans, with lavish celebrations held every year to mark the conquest.In May, Muslim clerics recited prayers in the museum to celebrate the anniversary after the first Koran recital in 85 years inside the Hagia Sophia in 2015.In 2016, the state religious channel broadcast a Koran recitation by a different senior Turkish cleric inside the museum on each day of the holy month of Ramadan.- Turks divided -Greece closely follows the future of Byzantine heritage in Turkey and is sensitive to the issue as it sees itself as the modern succession to Orthodox Christian Byzantium. Greek Culture Minister Lina Mendoni, who sent a letter of protest to UNESCO last week, said the move “rekindles national and religious fanaticism” and is an attempt to “diminish the monument’s global radiance”.She accused the government of using the monument “to serve internal political interests,” arguing that only UNESCO had the authority to change Hagia Sophia’s status. The issue is also followed closely in Washington. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday urged Turkey to keep the Hagia Sophia as a museum, and to ensure it remains accessible to all.“The United States views a change in the status of the Hagia Sophia as diminishing the legacy of this remarkable building and its unsurpassed ability... to serve humanity as a much-needed bridge between those of differing faith traditions and cultures.”But Turks are divided over its future status.Mahmut Karagoz, an Istanbul shoemaker, 55, dreams he can one day pray under the dome of Hagia Sophia.“It is a legacy by our Ottoman ancestors. I hope our prayers will be heard, this nostalgia must come to an end,” he told AFP.However Sena Yildiz, an economics student, believes the Hagia Sophia should retain its museum status.“It is an important place for Muslims, but also for Christians and for all those who love history,” she said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/museum-or-mosque-top-turkey-court-to-rule-on-hagia-sophia/story-1NvZWSzW7ddygfpvfWatNM.html
02-07-2020||World||Weak evidence for accuracy of Covid-19 antibody tests: Study||A review of studies has found major weaknesses in the evidence base for diagnostic accuracy of Covid-19 antibody tests, particularly for point-of-care tests performed directly with a patient, outside a laboratory, and does not support their continued use. Serological tests to detect antibodies against Covid-19 could improve diagnosis and may be useful tools for monitoring levels of infection in a population, but it is important to formally evaluate whether there is sufficient evidence that they are accurate, the researchers said. The study, published ín The BMJ, set out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests for Covid-19. The researchers, including those from Harvard Medical School in the US and University of British Columbia, Canada, searched medical databases and preprint servers from January 1 to April 30, for studies measuring sensitivity and specificity of a Covid-19 antibody test compared with a control test. Sensitivity measures the percentage of people who are correctly identified as having a disease, while specificity measures the percentage of people who are correctly identified as not having a disease, they said. Of 40 eligible studies, most (70 per cent) were from China and the rest were from the UK, US, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Japan and Germany. The researchers noted that half of the studies were not peer reviewed and most were found to have a high or unclear risk of bias -- problems in study design that can influence results. Only four studies included outpatients and only two evaluated tests at the point of care, they said. When sensitivity results for each study were pooled together, they ranged from 66 per cent to 97.8 per cent depending on the type of test method used, meaning that between 2.2 per cent and 34 per cent of patients with Covid-19 would be missed, according to the researchers. Pooled specificities ranged from 96.6 to 99.7 per cent, depending on the test method used, meaning that between 3.4 per cent and 0.3 per cent of patients would be wrongly identified as having Covid-19, they said. The study found that pooled sensitivities were consistently lower for the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test compared with other test methods. The LFIA test is the potential point-of-care method that is being considered for ‘immunity passports.’ The researchers explained that, if an LFIA test is applied to a population with a Covid-19 prevalence of 10 per cent, for every 1,000 people tested, 31 who never had Covid-19 will be incorrectly told they are immune, and 34 people who had the disease will be incorrectly told that they were never infected. Pooled sensitivities were also lower with commercial test kits (65 per cent) compared with non-commercial kits (88.2 per cent) and in the first and second week after symptom onset compared with after the second week, they said. The researchers point to some limitations, such as differences in study populations and the potential for missing studies. However, study strengths include thorough search strategies and assessment of bias, they said. “These observations indicate important weaknesses in the evidence on Covid-19 serological tests, particularly those being marketed as point-of-care tests,” the researchers said. “While the scientific community should be lauded for the pace at which novel serological tests have been developed, this review underscores the need for high quality clinical studies to evaluate these tools,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weak-evidence-for-accuracy-of-covid-19-antibody-tests-study/story-rqUfeFhkllLdVR4qzdekvL.html

02-07-2020||World||How UN Security Council condemned Karachi attack, and Pakistan||The UN Security Council on Wednesday condemned the terrorist attack on the Karachi Stock Exchange in a move initiated by China, but it is understood to have slow-walked the process enough to also deliver Pakistan its quiet but clear disapproval of its continued support for terrorism.“The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack that took place in Karachi, Pakistan, on 29 June 2020, which resulted in several people killed,” it said in a statement, more than 24 hours after the first draft was circulated on Tuesday.Written by China, an all-weather friend and benefactor of Pakistan, the statement was expected to be timed for release with Pakistan government’s efforts to blame the attack on India, without explicitly saying so in the statement, which would have never passed the “crazy test” of the full council.“Our security forces fought and thwarted a huge tragedy which was planned by our neighbouring country India,” Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan told the country’s National Assembly. He offered no evidence, because he did not have any and he, probably, believed he did not need any to just smear India.Shortly after or before in New York city, where the UN is headquartered, China circulated a draft of a press statement for the UN Security Council to issue condemning the terrorist attack in Karachi. Any member of the Security Council can start this process and in case of China it was for all the obvious reasons.UN secretary general Antonio Gueterres had already condemned the attack the same day on Monday. UN diplomats closely associated with the process said the purpose of the Chinese draft statement could have been, one, to provide Pakistan an opportunity to portray itself as a victim of terrorism and not the leading state-sponsor of terrorism it was. And, two, to allow it the perverse opportunity to slur India, timed with claims made in Islamabad.But it did not quite work out that way. Germany, which holds the rotational presidency of the council for July, put up the first obstacle. It used the period until 4:00 pm (US eastern time, 1:30 am in India), set aside as a part of the practice and tradition at the UN body for member countries to read the draft, consider their position and dissent, it they wanted, “breaking the silence”.Germany asked for, and got, an extension until 10:00 am Wednesday (US eastern, 7:30 pm India), saying it needed to “consult the capital”, for consultations with the home government in UN parlance. It can be genuinely a consultation or a ruse to slow down the process. It was the latter in this instance, according to UN diplomats who followed the process closely, because Germany did not return with objections.Germany simply passed on the baton of disapproval to the United States, which sought an extension, and got one till 1:00 pm (US eastern, 10:30 pm India).America’s reasons could not be ascertained immediately but UN diplomats wondered if it was a subtle way for the Americans to convey their displeasure with the Pakistani prime minister for his remarks recently that the US “martyred” Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader who was killed by US navy SEALs in Abbottabad in Pakistan in 2011.Khan’s gratuitous remarks on bin Laden could not have been more badly timed. “I won’t be surprised if that was indeed a consideration for the Americans,” said a diplomat, pointing to the fact that New York was Ground Zero of the 9/11 attacks masterminded by bin Laden.The US mission just let the 1:00 pm deadline lapse.The UNSC statement was released shortly, condemning the Karachi attack. But it was perfunctory, styled to fit a template.“It did not even specify the number of victims,” said the UN diplomat cited above. Eight people died in the attack, including all the four terrorists. But the UNSC report said, perhaps suspicious of Pakistan’s account of the attack, “several people killed”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-un-security-council-condemned-karachi-attack-and-pakistan/story-ZgF9IndGSOqtr7Gi6K1nMK.html

The City Council’s 12-2 vote will drop the number of officers from 9,988 as of last month to 9,757 by next summer, abandoning a goal of 10,000 officers touted by political leaders and only reached in 2013.“This is a step forward, supporting minority communities in ways in which they deserve — with respect, dignity and an even playing field,” Councilman Curren Price said.It’s a big change in the nation’s second largest city, where the 1992 acquittal of white officers in the beating of black driver Rodney King set off violent unrest that has been compared to the chaos during some protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.Other cities around the country also have cut police budgets or are moving to do so, including an effort in Minneapolis to disband the city’s force. New York City lawmakers approved an austere budget Wednesday that will shift $1 billion from policing to education and social services in the coming year. In California, liberal Berkeley passed a budget Wednesday that cuts $9.2 million from police, while Oakland leaders last week slashed $14.6 million from law enforcement and they are considering steeper reductions.The Los Angeles vote reduces the LAPD’s nearly $2 billion budget. Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti had proposed increasing it in April to help preserve the staffing level of 10,000 officers before facing intense pushback after Floyd’s death invigorated a nationwide campaign to “defund” police.There was no immediate comment from the LAPD. However, Police Chief Michel Moore tweeted Wednesday night that “we remain as resolved as ever to the conversation around reform, and continuing to walk forward together.”“The success of the city’s future is grounded in bridging the divide, and we will never stop working to do just that,” he wrote.In a statement last month, Moore had said the cut would require “a top-to-bottom assessment, including how we go about our most basic operations” and said the department already had begun to identify potential cost savings and service reductions.The move comes a day after the board of the Los Angeles Unified School District voted to immediately cut its school police budget by a third. The $70 million budget for the force of more than 470 officers will be reduced by about $25 million and the money dedicated to “support African American student achievement to the extent of the law,” according to the resolution.Some 65 officers will be laid off and nearly 40 vacant positions won’t be filled, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain told the school board. He resigned Wednesday.The school board also called for officers to give up their uniforms and patrol off campus . Board President Richard Vladovic opposed the move on safety grounds, urging a delay.“We’re walking right into this without knowing where we’re going, and how we’re going to get there,” Vladovic said.Mass protests nationwide have demanded shrinking or eliminating police departments, with activists saying police disproportionately arrest Black people and are seen as repressive figures rather than protectors in communities of colour.“We need to rethink what it is that makes people safer and makes communities stronger,” the City Council resolution said. “We cannot just look at the police in isolation. There is no doubt that communities of color suffer disproportionately from negative interactions with the police.”The LAPD cut was part of a budget modification measure for the fiscal year beginning July 1 that comes amid the coronavirus pandemic. Months of social distancing measures, including closing many businesses, have left the city with a drastically reduced tax revenue and a potential shortfall of $45 million to $409 million, according to finance department estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lapd-s-funding-slashed-by-150m-reducing-number-of-officers/story-dlDKisVpeHv2CdTzWzM0xM.html
02-07-2020||World||UN experts appalled by enforced disappearance of Pakistani human rights activist Idris Khattak, call for impartial probe||UN human rights experts have condemned the enforced disappearance of Idris Khattak, a Pakistani human rights defender, calling it an “intolerable attack” on his legitimate work against a range of human rights and minority violations in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in Pakistan.In a joint statement on Tuesday, nine UN human rights experts called for a prompt and impartial investigation into the abduction and incommunicado detention of Khattak and said that they are extremely concerned by the authorities’ continued practice of enforced disappearances, leaving thousands of cases unresolved in the country.Khattak was last seen on November 13 last year after security agents stopped his car near the Swabi interchange in the northernmost province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. On June 16, the Pakistani authorities acknowledged for the first time that he has been in the custody of law enforcement authorities and detained incommunicado since then.“The enforced disappearance of Khattak, which began over seven months ago, is an intolerable attack on his legitimate work of monitoring, documenting and advocating against a range of human rights and minority violations in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan,” the independent experts said.The experts are Nils Melzer, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Luciano Hazan (Chair-Rapporteur), Tae-Ung Baik (Vice-Chair), Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders Bernard Duhaime, Houria Es-Slami, and Henrikas Mickevicius; Mary Lawlor; Agnes Callamard, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Fernand de Varennes RP, Special Rapporteur on minority issues.“We are extremely concerned by the authorities’ continued practice of enforced disappearance, leaving thousands of cases unresolved in the country. We call for a prompt and impartial investigation into the abduction and incommunicado detention of Khattak, and for the prosecution of those responsible,” the experts said.They condemned the widespread silencing of human rights defenders through intimidation, secret detention, torture and enforced disappearance, whether with the direct involvement of the Pakistani government or with its complicity or complacency.“Even today, Khattak remains deprived of the most basic protections of the law and his enforced disappearance subjected him and his family to severe and prolonged suffering, that could amount to torture,” the experts said.“Given the arbitrariness of Khattak’s arrest and detention and the very serious violations of his integrity and procedural rights, we call on the Government of Pakistan to immediately release Khattak and to provide him and his family with adequate redress and rehabilitation,” they added.Pakistan has a long history of enforced disappearances, many of which have targetted human rights and minority defenders critical of the government and the military, as well as persons suspected or accused of involvement in the opposition.While successive governments have promised to criminalise enforced disappearance, none has taken concrete steps and the practice continues with impunity.The experts stressed that there can be no justification for the Pakistan government’s failure to end enforced disappearances and that any such violation must be investigated, prosecuted and punished.“Truth and justice must be served, both in the case of Idris Khattak and for countless other victims and their families in Pakistan. State-sponsored disappearances and related impunity may amount to a crime against humanity and must end now,” they said.The experts have taken note that Pakistan’s Commission on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has been seized of the case and called on the commission to ensure accountability.The experts will continue to engage with the Pakistani authorities to assist them in eradicating the “horrendous practice” and to closely monitor the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-appalled-by-enforced-disappearance-of-pakistani-human-rights-activist-idris-khattak-call-for-impartial-probe/story-Z71H114tQZqJW9GEzPcmtI.html

Biden said that his administration will work toward strengthening ties with New Delhi which is a “natural partner” of the United States. Biden’s comments came during a virtual fundraiser event hosted by Chairman and CEO of Beacon Capital Partners Alan Leventhal. During the event, Biden described the strengthening of US-India ties as a “necessary and important” move for US security. Here are Biden’s top comments:1) India needs to be a partner in the region for our safety’s sake, and quite frankly for theirs.2) That partnership, a strategic partnership, is necessary and important in our security.3) In our administration, I was proud to play a role more than a decade ago in securing Congressional approval for the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, which is a big deal.4) Helping open the door to great progress in our relationship and strengthening our strategic partnership with India was a high priority in the Obama-Biden administration.5) Strengthening our strategic ties with India will be a high priority if I’m elected president.Biden also slammed US President Donald Trump for the handling of the Covid-19 crisis in the country and stated that Trump had ignored many warnings. He said that more than an apt leadership, the country is need of healing. “He refused to prepare and failed to protect the country. Not just now but throughout his presidency, undermining the very core pillars of our, what I would argue, moral and economic strength,” Biden said. US President Donald Trump recently ordered to extend the suspension of immigration and expand it to cover H-1B, most sought-after visa programme among the Indians. Trump described the move as a step toward bolstering job opportunities and employment for Americans amid the Covid-19 crisis. The move has a souring effect on the Indians workforce in the US. As a result, some 3,75,000 temporary visaholders and green card applicants will now be banned from entering the US until next year, Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, told Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ties-with-india-will-be-high-on-priority-here-s-what-biden-promises-india-if-elected-us-president/story-e9NNuiqHV4vDZ1QR4giuAJ.html
02-07-2020||World||‘Pattern of aggression’: White House’s sharpest remark yet against China on Ladakh face-off||The Trump White House on Wednesday blamed Chinese “aggression” unequivocally in the sharpest remarks yet over the ongoing border confrontation with India.President Donald Trump has said that “China’s aggressive stance along the India-China border fits with a larger a pattern of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world and these action only confirm the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party”, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said quoting the president from her notes at the daily briefing.This was much further than the studied neutral tone the White House had maintained thus far on the dispute, according to close observers of India-US relations in Washington.It was “closely monitoring” the situation, the White House had said after the deadly clashes of June 15. And the press secretary and then “noted” and “condoled” the death of Indian soldiers, and had gone on to say, deploying standard diplomatese, the US hoped for a “peaceful resolution” of the situation.The Trump White House had not given up on all of that still. “We’re closely monitoring the situation; he is as well. Both India and China have expressed a desire to deescalate, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation,” McEnany said before rolling out the new and more aggressive White House line.It reflected a shaper position that had been evolving around the White house, and outside, specially as laid out by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It puts the India-China border issue in the larger context of Chinese aggressive behavior in the South China Sea and elsewhere in the world, the internment of its own Uighur muslims at home and changing its relationship with Hong Kong in violation of its international commitments.On Wednesday, Pompeo offered full-throated support for the Indian ban on Chinese apps, which, he said “can serve as appendages of the CCP’s surveillance state. India’s Clean App approach will boost India’s sovereignty.”There is bipartisan purchase in US Congress of China’s responsibility in triggering the border clashes. Tom Cotton, a Republican senator and close ally of the president, has said that “China has essentially invaded India, an ally of ours”. Marco Rubio, another Republican senator, has called Chinese actions at the border “unwarranted & lawless armed aggression”.Brad Sherman, a senior Democratic member of the House of Representatives, has slammed “Chinese aggression” for the June 15 clashes. Sherman is also the co-chair of House India caucus.The growing chorus of US support for India in this confrontation with China is unlikely to lead to any tangible action on the ground; both parties have already turned down a mediation offer from President Trump, which he made on May 27 and has not mentioned it again since.But Beijing, which, observers said, has made no secret of its mounting worries about India getting closer to the United States, will feel “pressured” to consider if it had, in fact, succeeded in pushing India further towards the US with the Galwan Valley over-reach. And that, for the moment, is all that the New Delhi in understood to be seeking as part of its larger effort to resolve the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pattern-of-aggression-white-house-s-sharpest-remark-yet-against-china-on-ladakh-face-off/story-t0eNlSat46Uyr1oa88TbhJ.html
02-07-2020||World||Aggressive stance against India, other countries confirms true nature of Chinese Communist Party: White House||White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that according to President Donald Trump the aggressive stance of Beijing against India and other countries in the region confirms the “true nature” of the Chinese Communist Party.Against the backdrop of the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh, she said the US was closely monitoring the current situation and supports its peaceful resolution.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last seven weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.“With regard to India and China, we are closely monitoring the situation. The president is doing so as well. And he said that China’s aggressive stance along the India-China border fits the larger pattern of Chinese aggression and other parts of the world.“These actions only confirmed the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party,” McEnany said in response to a question during a news conference.Earlier, during a Congressional hearing, US lawmakers expressed concern over the aggressive Chinese actions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “This past month, China engaged in deadly clashes along the Line of Actual Control, resulting in the tragic deaths of a dozen Indian soldiers and an unknown Chinese death toll as well,” said Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, during a hearing on coronavirus and US-China relations.Senior fellow at Brookings Institute Tanvi Madan told members of the House Select Intelligence Committee that since early May there has been attempts by the People’s Liberation Army of China to “unilaterally change the status quo” along the LAC, the de facto boundary between the two countries.This, along with the coronavirus pandemic have had and will continue to have an impact on Indian views and approaches towards China, the United States, and the international order, she said.Madan said that when Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in October 2019, they sought to stress on Sino-Indian cooperation.However, the pandemic and the boundary crisis have demonstrated that despite Delhi and Beijing’s efforts over the last few decades to engage, India-China ties remains a fundamental and increasingly competitive relationship that can even spill over into conflict, she said.Observing that the boundary crisis and the pandemic have reinforced and accelerated concerns in India about China’s lack of transparency, Madan said it sends uncertain commitment to the rules-based order. “The Indian government has signalled that the boundary crisis will have a serious impact on the broader relationship, particularly if the status quo ante is not restored speedily,” she noted.Informing the lawmakers that public perception about China have “deteriorated considerably”, the Brookings Institute senior fellow said during the pandemic and the boundary crisis, Delhi has already imposed restrictions or additional scrutiny on Chinese economic and technology interests within the broader strategic community.“In India, there is near consensus that ties with Beijing need to be reassessed and reset.” The boundary crisis and the pandemic have led to calls for India to maintain and even deepen its partnership with the US and for Washington to play a more sustained and robust role in ensuring that a rules-based order prevails in the region and globally, she said.Madan told the lawmakers that the boundary crisis remains serious and requires careful watching.“Washington will be considering different scenarios. It should also assess what New Delhi might ask of it in each case, whether or not the US is willing to be responsive, and if it is, prepare for those contingencies,” she said.“If the US wants to be responsive or to show support to India, it should convey this willingness while taking care not to escalate the situation. Such support will facilitate a closer Indian alignment with the US in the future.” However, Washington should not try to push India into decisions or choices or let Delhi think it is taking advantage of the boundary crisis. That would be unhelpful if not counterproductive, Madan cautioned.“How India deals with these health and national security crises as well as the choices and tradeoffs it makes will affect the US. It will offer opportunities, but potentially also challenges,” she said.The willingness of partners like India to cooperate with the US in the region and globally will depend not just on Chinese mis-steps but on Washington’s’ willingness and ability to respond, Madan said.During the hearing, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi asked that without taking steps that would escalate the crisis, what can the US do to assist India to productively respond to this situation and get China to comply with a rules-based order.Madan said that the ability for the US to be helpful to India has been enhanced by a number of agreements and dialogue mechanisms that have been set up over the last decade.“The structure is in place. It’s helpful often because there’s a concern that this doesn’t become a geopolitical football between the US and China, that the administration has taken the stance to let India set the base of asking for that support. That is a good idea,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aggressive-stance-against-india-other-countries-confirms-true-nature-of-chinese-communist-party-white-house/story-DGgrlqwbEAL863RXliVdLL.html
02-07-2020||World||Twitter removes image tweet by Donald Trump over New York Times copyright complaint||Twitter Inc has taken down an image tweeted by the US President Donald Trump from its platform, after receiving a copyright complaint from the New York Times.The original tweet by Trump issued on June 30, showed a meme that read “In reality they’re not after me they’re after you I’m just in the way” with Trump’s picture in the background. The background picture was taken by a New York Times photographer, to accompany a feature article on then presidential candidate Trump in September 2015.Twitter now displays the message “This image has been removed in response to a report from the copyright holder,” in place of the tweet.The move by the social media site is the latest instance of content posted by Trump being flagged or removed, due to what Twitter says are copyright complaints, violation of its policy on threatening violence, among others.Twitter removed the image after it received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) complaint from the New York Times, which owns the rights to the photo, according to a notice posted on the Lumen Database.The database collects and analyzes legal complaints and requests for removal of online materials.Twitter began challenging Trump’s tweets in May and has repeatedly clashed with him since then. The president has threatened to change laws on social media after Twitter labeled one of his tweets about postal voting inaccurate and hid a tweet about looting, which Twitter said fomented violence.A campaign tribute video to George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis police custody, was also disabled by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on their platforms last month, due to copyright complaints.Twitter and NYT did not respond when reached by Reuters for further comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-removes-image-tweet-by-donald-trump-over-new-york-times-copyright-complaint/story-XI0zNDGqENlHZdKRNH2YZI.html

02-07-2020||World||Bars, restaurants in California pay price for surge in Covid-19 cases||California took a big step back in reopening its economy on Wednesday as Gov. Gavin Newsom shut down bars, wineries, museums, movie theaters and inside restaurant dining across most of the state for three weeks amid troubling increases in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations.The order affects Los Angeles and 18 other counties where nearly three-quarters of the state’s roughly 40 million people live. The impacted counties are those seeing the most serious uptick in infections, and include almost all of Southern California, though not San Diego, which is faring better.“The bottom line is the spread of this virus continues at a rate that is particularly concerning,” Newsom said.To encourage greater adherence to health rules, Newsom also said the state is creating “strike teams” of state regulators to more aggressively go after non-compliant businesses. He also is limiting beach access and imposed statewide changes for religious services — no more singing or chanting — and at gyms, where people now must wear masks while working out.For the two weeks ended Monday, California’s confirmed coronavirus cases increased 45% to nearly a quarter-million and hospitalizations increased 52% to 5,077. About 500 more patients were sick enough for intensive care treatment, bringing the state total to 1,528 in ICUs.The state’s worst outbreak is in Imperial County, an agricultural center along the border with Mexico. Infection rates are 20% -- more than double the state average -- and hospitals are overwhelmed.Last week the state took the unprecedented step of ordering Imperial officials to come up with a new health order and on Wednesday the most restrictive plan in California was approved -- it bars non-essential gatherings of any size, shopping in stores and indoor religious ceremonies.Other states, including Texas and Florida, have also paused their reopenings after seeing similar spikes in coronavirus cases. In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey has ordered bars, gyms and movie theaters to close for 30 days and banned large gatherings.California authorities have said many things contributed to the increase in the state, including people not following the mandate to wear masks and gathering socially with friends and relatives.Jot Condi, who heads the California Restaurant Association, said the order is devastating for restaurants that have worked to put in place safety measures and reduced seating to meet the state’s requirements for inside dining. The changes have left many with no room to spare on revenue.“This will be the last straw for a lot of restaurants,” Condi said, adding the state hasn’t provided evidence to specifically show dining in restaurants is helping fuel the increase in virus cases.Newsom imposed the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order in March, earning praise from public health officials as virus cases were kept relatively low in the nation’s most populous state for more than two months. But the order devastated the economy, forcing most businesses to close and prompting more than 6.7 million people to file for unemployment benefits.As the spread of the virus slowed in May, Newsom moved quickly to begin allowing businesses to reopen across the state. Bars got the green light on June 12 and quickly images emerged showing throngs packed tightly together, many not wearing masks as required by the state.Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the new restrictions could be an “over response.” He said the state should consider other strategies designed to keep young people away from older people, who are more at risk for the virus.“It appears we’re playing a game of whack-a-mole. Every time there is an increase in cases we have to take a step backwards,” he said.However, Klausner said when restrictions are imposed they “can tell people (that) health officials are very serious and therefore people are more likely to adopt personal behavior change.”Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, said the new order is targeted at places where people can’t wear face coverings the whole time, like restaurants where they are removed to eat and drink, or where people are likely to mix with others outside their household.Businesses not on the list, like hair salons, are able to “do things in a lower-risk way,” he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Ghaly defended the state’s process for reopening, saying officials carefully developed guidance that businesses should follow. But he noted the state has seen a “sufficient number” of places not following the guidance.“We have always prepared for something like this, we have always been ready,” he said.At Crepeville in Sacramento, owner Derar Zawaydeh cussed when informed of the new mandate for restaurants. He has a few tables outside but most are inside and will be lost.“It definitely presents a challenge,” he said. “But on the flip side if that is what we need to do to ... reduce the risk of infection, then we really don’t have much of a choice,.”Ahead of the busy Fourth of July weekend, Newsom also closed state beaches in Los Angeles and Ventura counties to mirror local public health orders. Other state beaches will stay open, but parking lots will close this weekend to limit overcrowding in Marin, Monterey, Orange, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Sonoma counties.For people planning gatherings of family and friends this weekend, Newsom urged them to reconsider. In Los Angeles County, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer says many outbreaks in the past three weeks are linked to parties and gatherings of family and friends, adding “there are very real risks to celebrating this holiday with people who are not in our households.”Newsom’s order applies to 19 counties that have been on the state’s watch list for increasing coronavirus cases for at least three consecutive days: Besides, Los Angeles, they include: Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Merced, Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Solano, Stanislaus, Tulare and Ventura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bars-restaurants-in-california-pay-price-for-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-D2660g3upREMIShygpB6WP.html

The tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.“Good to see India ban 59 popular apps owned by Chinese firms, including TikTok, which counts India as one of its largest markets,” Haley tweeted on Wednesday.“India is continuing to show it won’t back down from China’s aggression,” the former US Ambassador to the UN said in a tweet hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed India’s decision in this regard.Pompeo on Wednesday welcomed New Delhi’s decision to ban dozens of apps with Chinese links, saying it will “boost India’s integrity and national security.” “We welcome India’s ban on certain mobile apps that serves as an appendage of the CCP’s (Chinese Communist Party) surveillance State,” Pompeo told reporters at a news conference held at the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department.“India’s clean app approach will boost India’s sovereignty. It will also boost India’s integrity and national security,” he said.In an interview to Fox News, Republican Senator Marco Rubio supported India’s move to ban Chinese apps.“Yes, they’re not only appropriate, they’re long overdue,” he said when asked about steps like banning Chinese apps by India and the US taking action against Huawei and ZTE.According to MIT Technology Review India has a huge smartphone user base and English-speaking population, which make it the world’s largest social media market. India is also TikTok’s biggest market, with nearly 191 million downloads at the end of 2019; the US is at a distant second with nearly 41 million, it stated.“India’s Chinese app ban is a new diplomatic maneuver. India and China have opened a new front in their ongoing skirmish. Both countries are nuclear powers and economic giants, but India’s ban is notable for using social media as a tool to exert political pressure on its rival,” MIT Technology Review said.Forbes magazine said that the ban on TikTok has left many influencers and influencer managers bereft of work and in shock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-continuing-to-show-it-won-t-back-down-from-china-s-aggression-nikki-haley-on-app-ban/story-VXEPXG9qmxcK87ytNB9HyM.html
02-07-2020||World||US regulator, Boeing complete 737 MAX certification test flights||The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing Co have completed certification test flights on the 737 MAX, a key milestone toward the plane’s return to service, the U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.The MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.The FAA said it must still evaluate data from the three days of testing and has other tasks to complete.“The agency is following a deliberate process and will take the time it needs to thoroughly review Boeing’s work,” the FAA said. “We will lift the grounding order only after FAA safety experts are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.”Boeing declined to comment, saying it would defer to the FAA statement.The tests of Boeing’s proposed changes to the automated flight control system on the aircraft are a pivotal moment in the company’s worst-ever corporate crisis. The FAA must complete the data review, approve new pilot training procedures, among other steps, and is unlikely to approve the plane’s ungrounding until mid-September, Reuters reported this week.If that happens, the jet is on a path to resume U.S. service before year-end, in a process plagued by delays.The crisis has cost Boeing more than $18 billion, slashed production and hobbled its supply chain, with criminal and congressional investigations still ongoing. In December, Boeing fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg after scrutiny into the jet’s design and development tarnished its reputation with airlines and regulators.A Transportation Department inspector general report first reported by Reuters on Tuesday faulted Boeing for not disclosing information to the FAA about a key safety system known as MCAS tied to both fatal crashes.Boeing agreed to add significant safeguards to MCAS, make other software updates and move wiring bundles that the FAA said posed a safety hazard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-regulator-boeing-complete-737-max-certification-test-flights/story-ZZgLInfVxWFzZpiXeBcw8J.html

That move could force them to cut staff in the U.S. and adds to a long list of frictions in economic and political relations between the two countries.Zhao said recent U.S. policies damage the reputation and image of Chinese media, impact their operations and “seriously interfere with the normal people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S.”The Trump administration’s moves are rooted in “Cold War thinking” and go against the freedom of the press long espoused by Washington, he said.“China urges the U.S. to immediately change its course and correct its mistakes and stop the political suppression and unreasonable restrictions of the Chinese media,” Zhao said.State Department officials said at the time that the four organizations, including state-run CCTV, would be required to submit a list of everyone who works for them in the U.S. and any real estate holdings, the same as is required of foreign embassies or consulates.None is being ordered to leave the U.S. and no limits on their activities were announced. But a visa cap was put on five other Chinese media organizations in March, forcing them to reduce their Chinese staff two weeks after they were designated as foreign missions.Chinese media including the official Xinhua News Agency and the international arm of state broadcaster CCTV are now restricted to a total of 100 visas. Collectively, they employed about 160 Chinese in the U.S., meaning about 60 had to leave.China retaliated by ordering more than a dozen reporters from The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal to hand in their press credentials, forcing them to leave the country because their visas were tied to their work status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-demands-info-from-4-media-companies-in-response-to-us/story-vexXv89Cy7laAEe3LbCNTN.html
02-07-2020||World||US records highest one-day jump of nearly 50,000 Covid-19 cases||New US Covid-19 cases rose by nearly 50,000 on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally, marking the biggest one-day spike since the start of the pandemic.The record follows a warning by the government’s top infectious diseases expert that the number could soon double to 100,000 cases a day if Americans do not come together to take steps necessary to halt the virus’ resurgent spread, such as wearing masks when unable to practice social distancing. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here In the first week of June, the United States added about 22,000 new coronavirus cases each day. But as the month progressed, hotspots began to emerge across the Sun Belt. In the last seven days of June, daily new infections almost doubled to 42,000 nationally.Brazil is the only other country to report more than 50,000 new cases in one day. The United States reported at least 49,286 cases on Tuesday. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayMore than half of new US cases each day come from Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, home to 30% of the country’s population. All four states plus 10 others saw new cases more than double in June.The daily increase in new cases could reach 100,000 unless a nationwide push was made to tamp down the fast-spreading virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a US Senate committee on Tuesday.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We can’t just focus on those areas that are having the surge. It puts the entire country at risk,” Fauci said.The rise in cases is not just the result of more testing. Hospitalizations are also skyrocketing.Nationally, 7% of coronavirus diagnostic tests came back positive last week, up from 5% the prior week, according to a Reuters analysis. Arizona’s positivity test rate was 24% last week, Florida’s was 16%. Nevada, South Carolina and Texas were all 15%, according to the analysis.Also read: Ayush ministry clears Patanjali drug for sale as immunity boosterSome of the recent increase traces back to Memorial Day holiday celebrations in late May.

02-07-2020||World||Canadians go virtual to celebrate national day amid coronavirus lockdown||While the fireworks displays in cities and communities across the nation took place, the 2020 edition of Canada Day was celebrated without the large gatherings due to restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Government organized a slew of virtual events to keep Canadians engaged with the anniversary of the formation of the dominion in 1867.In a message issued to mark the Day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invited Canadians to join the virtual celebrations and join the conversation online. ““The last few months have been difficult for all Canadians, but throughout this pandemic, we have been there for one another. We are neighbours helping neighbours, small businesses being there for their communities and their staff, Armed Forces answering the call to help protect our most vulnerable, and doctors and nurses keeping our families healthy,” his statement said.The department responsible for the festivities, Canadian Heritage, streamed shows featuring artists along with virtual fireworks that could be accessed on devices.Canada’s Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marco Mendicino held a virtual citizenship ceremony for 18 healthcare workers, including one with roots in Goa. “The pandemic has changed the way that we celebrate today, and this includes being able to physically join in citizenship ceremonies to welcome our newest Canadians,” Mendocino said in a statement.The country’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam also thanked citizens for their “hard work” to keep the coronavirus infection “curve down.”“Our data show that your efforts are making a difference and that is reason to celebrate.Right now, it is our actions, and our actions only, that will reduce the spread. While COVID-19 is still active in our communities, I want to remind Canadians to celebrate Canada Day safely,” she said, with a series of instructions to keep it virtual.But the day was also marked with a series of protests across major Canadian cities, including by Black Lives Matter, by those protesting lockdown norms and by Indigenous groups who also used the hashtag #CancelCanadaDay as a reminder of how the confederation came into being through exploitation of the natives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadians-go-virtual-to-celebrate-national-day-amid-coronavirus-lockdown/story-nM0URLrJGlR5m9bQ4ANLMN.html
02-07-2020||World||Movement for Black Lives Matter plans virtual national convention||Spurred by broad public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, thousands of Black activists from across the U.S. will hold a virtual convention in August to produce a new political agenda that seeks to build on the success of the protests that followed George Floyd’s death.The 2020 Black National Convention will take place Aug. 28 via a live broadcast. It will feature conversations, performances and other events designed to develop a set of demands ahead of the November general election, according to a Wednesday announcement shared first with The Associated Press.The convention is being organized by the Electoral Justice Project of the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 organizations. In 2016, the coalition released its “Vision for Black Lives” platform, which called for public divestment from mass incarceration and for adoption of policies that can improve conditions in Black America.“What this convention will do is create a Black liberation agenda that is not a duplication of the Vision for Black Lives, but really is rooted as a set of demands for progress,” said Jessica Byrd, who leads the Electoral Justice Project.At the end of the convention, participants will ratify a revised platform that will serve as a set of demands for the first 100 days of a new presidential administration, Byrd said. Participants also will have access to model state and local legislation.“What we have the opportunity to do now, as this 50-state rebellion has provided the conditions for change, is to say, ‘You need to take action right this minute,’” Byrd said. “We’re going to set the benchmarks for what we believe progress is and make those known locally and federally.”Wednesday’s announcement comes at a pivotal moment for the BLM movement. A surge in public support, an influx in donations and congressional action to reform policing have drawn some backlash.President Donald Trump lashed out again Wednesday on Twitter over plans to paint “Black Lives Matter” in yellow across New York City’s famed Fifth Avenue, calling the words a “symbol of hate.” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump “agrees that all Black lives matter” but disagrees with an organization that would make derogatory statements about police officers. McEnany was referring to an oft-cited chant of individual protesters from five years ago.The Black National Convention was originally planned to happen in person, in Detroit, the nation’s Blackest major city. But as the coronavirus pandemic exploded in March, organizers quickly shifted to a virtual event, Byrd said. The first-ever Black Lives Matter convention was held in Cleveland in 2015.The most recent AP analysis of Covid-19 data shows Black people have made up more than a quarter of reported virus deaths in which the race of the victim is known.Initial work to shape the new platform will take place Aug. 6 and 7, during a smaller so-called People’s Convention that will virtually convene hundreds of delegates from Black-led advocacy groups. The process will be similar to one that produced the first platform, which included early iterations of the demand to defund police that now drives many demonstrations.Other platform demands, such as ending cash bail, reducing pretrial detention and scrapping discriminatory risk-assessment tools used in criminal courts, have become official policy in a handful of local criminal justice systems around the U.S.Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, which organizes in 15 states, said the 2020 Black National Convention will deepen the solutions to systemic racism and create more alignment within the movement.“We’re in this stage now where we’re getting more specific about how all of this is connected to our local organizing,” Albright said. “The hope is that, when people leave the convention, they leave with greater clarity, more resources, connectivity and energy.”The coalition behind the convention includes Color of Change, BYP100, Dream Defenders and the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which has 16 official chapters nationwide.Convention organizers said this year’s event will pay tribute to the historic 1972 National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, which concluded with the introduction of a national Black agenda. The Gary gathering included prominent Black leaders such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton, Rep. Shirley Chisolm, who ran for president, as well as Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale, Coretta Scott King and Betty Shabazz.That convention came after several tumultuous years that included the assassinations of Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and outbreaks of civil unrest, all of which were seen as blows to the civil rights movement.The upcoming convention builds on more than a century of Black political organizing.In 1905, civil rights activist and scholar W.E.B. Du Bois formed the Niagara Movement after a national conference of Black leaders near Buffalo, New York. In a written address to the country, Du Bois and others decried the rise of institutionalized racial inequality in voting, criminal justice systems and public education.In the 1950s, William Patterson, founder of the now-defunct Civil Rights Congress, led the effort to charge the U.S. with genocide of African Americans using legal standards set by the United Nation. The resulting petition, “We Charge Genocide,” is an oft-cited document in conversations about fatal shootings of Black people by police in the U.S.And in 1998, organizers of the Black Radical Congress in Chicago met to strategize ways to beat back attacks on affirmative action policies that helped to diversify higher education and other facets of American life.Like any large political gathering, consensus is not guaranteed. The National Black Political Convention caused divisions between participating organizations over the Black agenda’s position on busing to integrate public schools and statements on global affairs that some viewed as anti-Israel. Ultimately, the agenda prompted a leader of the NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, to sever ties with the convention.Somewhat similarly, the Vision for Black Lives platform and its characterization of Israel as an “apartheid state” committing mass murder against Palestinian people drew allegations of anti-Semitism from a handful of Jewish groups, which had otherwise been supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement.The Black Lives Matter movement’s coalition has more than doubled in size in the years since the first platform, largely because of organizers’ laser focus on issues central to Black freedom, Byrd said.“That actually is the Black self determination that our politics require,” Byrd said, “that we don’t just respond to the Democratic Party. That we don’t just respond to the Republican Party. We don’t just say ‘Black lives matter’ and beg people to care. We build an alternative container for all of us to connect, outside of the white gaze, to say this is what we want for our communities.”The August convention will happen on the same day as a commemorative, in-person march on Washington that is being organized by Sharpton, who announced the march during a memorial service for Floyd, a Black man who died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer held a knee to his neck.The Black National Convention will broadcast after the march, Byrd said.August “is going to be a huge month of Black engagement,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/movement-for-black-lives-matter-plans-virtual-national-convention/story-Rdycp38rJttlh5JgeKugUP.html
02-07-2020||World||Mexico passes Spain to have sixth deadliest coronavirus outbreak||Mexico’s Covid-19 deaths rose by 741 to reach 28,510, leading the country to overtake Spain and have the world’s sixth deadliest outbreak, according to data released by the Health Ministry Wednesday night.Confirmed cases rose by 5,681 to 231,770. Deaths and cases in Mexico have increased steadily in recent weeks as Latin America has emerged as a hot spot for the pandemic. The country is also likely to soon overtake France, which has 29,864 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Mexico, like other Latin American countries has vulnerable populations living in tight quarters where work is essential to meet daily basic needs. That makes social distancing to slow the pandemic nearly impossible while President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been criticized by some health experts for downplaying the virus’s risks.Lopez Obrador has focused largely on reopening the economy, rather than enforcing strict lockdowns. He continued to travel through the country amid record rises in cases. Mexico City began reopening businesses and restarting economic activity this week based on government data showing a decrease of hospital occupancy.At his nightly press conferences Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell has repeatedly implored people to stay home, while Lopez Obrador has said the worst is likely past. In a recent morning press conference, the president thanked the Mexican people for helping avoid an even more troubling outcome.“Despite the terrible nature of this pandemic, we have avoided more suffering,” Lopez Obrador said.The numbers from Mexico’s Health Ministry don’t reflect data from only the previous 24 hours, as it takes longer for it to gather information from hospitals on coronavirus patients. Experts have questioned the government’s tracking of the virus, as even the ministry has acknowledged actual cases are much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-passes-spain-to-have-sixth-deadliest-coronavirus-outbreak/story-P29TvM7hwIDsG2qPPP9gUJ.html

All seven men and three of their superiors have been fired, while two higher-up officials have been re-assigned.Another case - that of a young girl allegedly sexually abused by various soldiers while being held at an army site in jungle Guaviare province for several days without food or water - emerged over the weekend.Zapateiro denied a systematic effort to protect army members implicated in acts of sexual violence against minors and said all soldiers receive human rights training.“No Colombian soldier is trained within the institution to attack the human rights of boys, girls or adolescents,” he said.“I will not tolerate any type of conduct distant from ethical principles, moral values and good customs,” Zapateiro said. “There are no second chances.”The general did not specify how many cases the 118 officials are involved in or discuss allegations of sexual harassment made by women soldiers in recent months.The Colombian army has 240,000 members and leads the country’s fight against leftist guerrillas and crime gangs founded by former members of right-wing paramilitary groups.The army has long been accused by sexual violence survivors and human rights groups of rights violations during Colombia’s more than five decades of internal conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-100-colombian-soldiers-implicated-in-sex-abuse-of-minors-army-says/story-HpzPTty0gKnGfO7XLfBUrO.html

Subsequent tests then showed that 82 students and 8 instructors had Covid-19, Army spokeswoman Janice Burton told The Associated Press on Wednesday.Now all 110 are quarantined, although the 20 people who did not test positive were separated from the rest, she said.Their course, called Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, is naturally isolated from Fort Bragg’s other special warfare courses, the Army said.Guidelines were implemented at Fort Bragg to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and some classes were shifted online. Portions of classes that could not be taught online were closely monitored. Students taking the survival course were tested prior to training and received daily welfare checks.“The health and wellness of our students and staff is our top priority,” said Maj. Gen. Patrick Roberson. “We will do everything we can to protect our students and their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-army-quarantines-90-soldiers-with-coronavirus-at-fort-bragg/story-NI7Ok53c6QL0j4V2NK1b5H.html
02-07-2020||World||Coronavirus may infect heart cells of infected patients, says report||Researchers, including those of Indian-origin, have shown that the novel coronavirus can infect lab-grown cardiac muscle cells, indicating it may be possible for the virus to directly cause heart infection in Covid-19 patients. The study, published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, was based on experiments conducted in lab-grown heart muscle cells which were produced from unspecialised human stem cells. “We not only uncovered that these stem cell-derived heart cells are susceptible to infection by novel coronavirus, but that the virus can also quickly divide within the heart muscle cells,” said study co-author Arun Sharma from the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute in the US. “Even more significant, the infected heart cells showed changes in their ability to beat after 72 hours of infection,” Sharma said. Although many Covid-19 patients experience heart problems, the scientists said the reasons for these symptoms are not entirely clear. They said pre-existing cardiac conditions, or inflammation and oxygen deprivation that result from the infection have all been implicated. According to the scientists, there is only limited evidence available that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, directly infects individual muscle cells of the heart. The current study showed that SARS-CoV-2 can infect heart cells derived from human stem-cells and change how the genes in these cells helped make proteins. Based on this observation, the scientists confirmed that human heart cells can be actively infected by the virus, activating innate cellular “defense mechanisms” in an effort to help clear out the virus. Citing the limitations of the study, they said these findings are not a perfect replicate of what is happening in the human body since the research was carried out in lab-grown heart cells. However, this knowledge may help investigators use stem cell-derived heart cells as a screening platform to identify new antiviral compounds that could alleviate viral infection of the heart, believes study co-author Clive Svendsen. “This viral pandemic is predominately defined by respiratory symptoms, but there are also cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure and viral myocarditis,” said Svendsen, director of the Regenerative Medicine Institute. “While this could be the result of massive inflammation in response to the virus, our data suggest that the heart could also be directly affected by the virus in Covid-19,” Svendsen said. The scientists also found that treatment with an antibody protein could lock onto the human cell surface receptor ACE2 -- a known SARS-CoV-2 ‘gateway’ into cells. According to the researchers, the antibody treatment was able to blunt viral replication on the lab-grown heart cells, suggesting that the ACE2 receptor could be used by the virus to enter human heart muscle cells. “By blocking the ACE2 protein with an antibody, the virus is not as easily able to bind to the ACE2 protein, and thus cannot easily enter the cell,” Sharma said. “This not only helps us understand the mechanisms of how this virus functions, but also suggests therapeutic approaches that could be used as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection,” he added. In the study, the researchers also used human induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, which are a type of undifferentiated cells grown in the lab from a person’s blood or skin cells. They said iPSCs can make any cell type found in the body, each one carrying the genetic material of the individual. According to the scientists, tissue-specific cells created in this way are used for research, and for creating and testing potential disease treatments. “It is plausible that direct infection of cardiac muscle cells may contribute to COVID-related heart disease,” said Eduardo Marban, executive director of the Smidt Heart Institute in the US, and study co-author.“This key experimental system could be useful to understand the differences in disease processes of related coronaviral pathogens, SARS and MERS,” said Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami, another co-author of the study from the University of California Los Angeles in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-may-infect-heart-cells-of-infected-patients-says-report/story-gQoU7Rmzkj4XIpZJBRB0SN.html
