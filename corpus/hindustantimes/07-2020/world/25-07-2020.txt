The United States is cracking down on Chinese spying, with the FBI having interviewed dozens of visa holders about their possible ties to Chinese intelligence.On Friday a Chinese researcher who took refuge in the San Francisco consulate was expected to appear in court on allegations she lied about her Chinese military service, while the US counterintelligence agency chief warned China and other nations could interfere with November elections.China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singaporean-in-us-pleads-guilty-to-acting-as-chinese-intelligence-agent/story-tEDZ3IjQldDYIMYYWdyl6L.html
25-07-2020||World||China slams ‘forced entry’ of US federal agents into its Houston consulate||US-China diplomatic tensions continued to simmer on Saturday as Beijing slammed the “forced entry” to its Houston consulate by U.S. personnel hours earlier and vowed to respond “as necessary.”Federal agents and local law enforcement authorities broke into the consulate building late Friday, according to the Houston Chronicle and CNN, after issuing an order on July 21 that it must close within 72 hours.The newspaper reported that among the personnel on site were some wearing shirts carrying the words “U.S. Department of State.” Agents tried three different entrances at the compound before prying open a back door, the Chronicle reported.Beijing said that U.S. had broken diplomatic conventions by entering “China’s national property.”“According to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-U.S. Consular Treaty, the United States must not infringe on the premises of the Chinese Consulate in Houston in any way,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in an a Q&A posted on the ministry’s website late on Saturday.Beijing has already expressed “firm opposition” to the move and will respond as “proper and necessary,” Wang said.On Friday, China ordered the U.S. to close its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, retaliating for the Trump administration’s decision to shutter the Chinese mission in Houston.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that the consulate’s closure was a “legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the U.S.”The widely anticipated retaliation came hours ahead of the U.S.’s deadline for Chinese diplomats to vacate the Houston facility, which the State Department said had served as a hub for spying and influence operations.Beijing’s decision will not only oust American diplomats from the capital of Sichuan province -- a region with a population rivaling Germany -- it will close a key listening post for developments in neighboring Tibet. The move will probably have a bigger impact than shutting the U.S. consulate in Wuhan, but less than closing U.S. missions in the key financial centers of Hong Kong or Shanghai.Wang,the foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular news briefing in Beijing that some consulate staff had “engaged in activities inconsistent with their capacity, interfered in China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s national security interests.” By Friday afternoon, dozens of police, plainclothes officers and People’s Liberation Army personnel were seen patrolling the street outside the building, searching phones and ordering people to delete photos.While police ordered most reporters and pedestrians to leave the area, China’s state broadcaster began live-streaming footage of the consulate’s entrance.U.S. stocks have been hit by the tensions, and spot gold topped $1,900 an ounce for the first time since 2011. China’s CSI 300 Index slumped 4.4% at the close on Friday, while the ChiNext Index dropped 6.1%, the most since Feb. 3.“It’s not possible to carry out an entirely equivalent action, but choosing Chengdu shows China wants to reduce the harm made to bilateral relations,” said Wang Yiwei, a former Chinese diplomat and director of China’s Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. “The operations out of Chengdu are not the most high profile of the U.S. mission in China, compared to say Shanghai.”In another potential sign of a deescalation, U.S. officials said a Chinese researcher wanted by law enforcement who had taken refuge in China’s San Francisco consulate was now in custody. The researcher, Juan Tang, is expected to have a court appearance on Friday, official said on a briefing call for reporters.Yet the Chengdu and Houston consulate closures illustrate the alarming degree to which relations between the world’s two largest economies have worsened in recent years, as China assumes a more assertive posture on the world stage and the U.S. seeks to check its rise. President Donald Trump and his aides have stepped up attacks on China ahead of the U.S. election in November, accusing Beijing of spying, cybertheft and causing the coronavirus pandemic.In a speech Thursday at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo accused President Xi Jinping and the Chinese leadership of attempting to “tyrannize inside and outside China forever” in pursuit of global hegemony. “Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time,” Pompeo said.In the first U.S. reaction to the Chengdu decision, a spokesman for the National Security Council said the closure of the Houston consulate was justified after years of espionage activity.“For years, the CCP has undertaken a whole-of-society effort to steal American technology and intellectual property for commercial gain, and many of these activities are directed from PRC diplomatic facilities,” NSC spokesman John Ullyot said in a statement Friday. “Our action to direct the closure of PRC Consulate General in Houston was taken to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information.”A commentary published by China’s official Xinhua News Agency moments after the Chengdu announcement said the Chengdu closure was “aimed at a few extremist forces in the U.S. government, not the American people.” “The U.S. has stirred up trouble in bilateral relations to the point of hysteria,” the commentary said.In a sign things could deteriorate further, Wang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, answered a question on Thursday about the future of the U.S.-China trade deal by saying the American side should think “carefully” about where the relationship was heading. Trump also said that his “phase one” deal meant “much less” to him in the wake of the pandemic.The Chengdu mission, which opened in 1985, covers Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, as well as Sichuan. The consulate has also served as a key U.S. perch to follow events in Tibet, where Communist Party efforts to suppress dissent have long been a focus of tensions between China and the West.In 2012, former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun sought refuge in the Chengdu consulate with evidence linking the family of his then boss, former Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai, to the death of a British businessman. The episode exposed a scandal that would see Bo ousted and his wife convicted of murder, leading Xi to launch a nationwide anti-corruption campaign.“They wanted to make it hurt a little bit more so they picked Chengdu,” said James Green, a former State Department official who is now a senior adviser for geopolitical consulting firm McLarty Associates. “What the Chinese care about more -- and what we care about more -- is what we do out of Chengdu, which is follow Tibet. And shutting that down kind of cuts our link to Tibet, which is a political blow to us.”Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin, who had earlier reported the timing of the decision on his Twitter feed, said U.S. diplomats were given the same 72-hour notice as their Chinese counterparts in Houston, meaning they must leave by Monday morning. The Wall Street Journal separately reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter, that China had given the affected diplomats 30 days to leave the country.Wang Wenbin repeatedly sidestepped questions about when the diplomats would have to leave, saying only “we always talk about reciprocity in diplomacy.”“The current situation in China-U.S. relations is not what China desires to see, and the U.S. is responsible for all this,” the Foreign Ministry said earlier Friday. “We once again urge the U.S. to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-forced-entry-of-us-federal-agents-into-its-houston-consulate/story-5w8UHowIJDiJd77EhiGdhK.html
25-07-2020||World||Record number of new Covid-19 cases as public loses faith in govts||The world has set a new record for the highest daily increase in coronavirus infections, as a survey released Saturday showed governments are fast losing support for their handling of the pandemic.There were more than 280,000 new cases recorded globally on both Thursday and Friday, the highest daily rises since the virus emerged in China late last year.Friday’s tally of 282,042 was marginally down on Thursday’s single-day record 284,661, according to an AFP count based on official sources, but still marks an alarming uptick in the spread of the virus.Nearly a third of the world’s 15.8 million infections have been registered since July 1, while the total death toll nears 640,000. The World Health Organization said that more than a million cases had been recorded in each of the last five weeks, “with over 280,000 being reported on July 24 alone”. “While no country is unaffected, this rise is driven by high transmission in large and populous countries in the Americas and South Asia,” it said in a statement on Saturday.It added that Brazil and India had recently reported their highest daily increases, while the figures remained worryingly high in the United States and South Africa.The US, still the hardest-hit nation, on Friday reported its second straight day of more than 70,000 new cases and over 1,000 deaths as the virus takes hold in the south and west.- Bolsonaro tests negative - Governments worldwide have struggled to contain the virus despite long and economically-crippling lockdowns imposed on millions of people, and a new survey showed that faith in authorities is dwindling in six rich nations.Populations in France, Germany, Britain, Japan, Sweden and the US widely believed death and infection figures to be higher than recorded, according to the study, which polled 1,000 people in each nation.“In most countries this month, support for national governments is falling,” the report by the Kekst CNC communications consulting group said.One world leader widely criticised over his handling of the pandemic is Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was diagnosed with coronavirus on July 7.Bolsonaro, who has downplayed what he calls “a little flu”, announced on Saturday that he had finally tested negative.Despite his diagnosis, Bolsonaro has appeared to continue flouting virus precautions, being spotted riding his motorcycle and chatting maskless with presidential palace groundskeepers on Thursday.Brazil’s biggest city Sao Paulo on Saturday said it was indefinitely postponing its 2021 carnival, while Rio de Janeiro was considering a similar move.New outbreaks continue to wreak havoc elsewhere around the world, with fresh clusters emerging across Asia.South Korea on Saturday reported its highest infections figure in nearly four months, and in Vietnam the first locally-transmitted case in nearly 100 days was detected.Authorities in China said they would introduce a new wave of measures and testing in the port city of Dalian, home to about six million people, after fresh infections were detected there.That did not prevent the Chinese Super League kicking off behind closed doors on Saturday with the players of Guangzhou Evergrande and Shanghai Shenhua holding a minute’s silence for the victims of the pandemic.- ‘The world is infested’ -Europe remains the hardest-hit continent, accounting for a fifth of the world’s case count.Belgium said Saturday it could further tighten its restrictions following the death of a three-year-old girl, the country’s youngest victim of the virus.There have been recent outbreaks in the Spanish regions of Aragon and Catalonia where officials have reintroduced fresh curbs on daily life.However with experts fearing a spike in Covid-19 infections linked to the European summer holiday season, many tourists are reticent to cancel their plans. Fanny Lievens said she and her family had no choice but to continue on their holiday trip to Catalonia from the southern French city of Montpellier.“If we cancelled our holiday, which has been planned since February, we would lose the rental money,” she said.In France, where infections have been rising, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on-the-spot testing would be rolled out for travellers arriving from 16 high-risk nations.Britain meanwhile has made it compulsory to wear a face covering in shopping centres, banks, takeaway outlets, sandwich shops and supermarkets.The virus has overwhelmed health systems and devastated families across Latin America, where nearly 180,000 people have died.“The world is infested,” said Raquel Barrera, a 28-year-old in El Salvador who has lost three brothers and both her parents to the disease in less than two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-number-of-new-virus-cases-as-public-loses-faith-in-govts/story-fw39goWdbV3siXGdo5sLbP.html
25-07-2020||World||Businessman’s frozen £190 million UK assets returned to Pakistan||Britain’s crime officials have returned £190 million to Pakistan following an investigation into a Pakistani businessman whose assets in the UK were the subject of freezing orders; millions of pounds more were similarly returned to other countries in 2019-20, officials said.The amounts are the result of investigations into international corruption and bribery. More individuals were charged by the National Crime Agency (NCA)’s international corruption unit than ever before during the year, linked to the laundering of criminal cash into major overseas developments projects.An NCA spokesperson said none of the cases investigated during 2019-20 involved Indian citizens.Its international corruption unit restrained or detained £32 million; £146 million more were been confiscated or forfeited, of which £139 million were returned to developing countries, the NCA said in its annual report.“In December 2019, the NCA agreed a civil settlement of £190 million following a civil investigation into a Pakistani national, whose business is one of largest private sector employers in Pakistan. Most of the frozen funds in this case have now been returned to Pakistan”, it said.The NCA had previously identified the businessman as Malik Riaz Hussain. The settlement was announced after NCA implemented eight account freezing orders in August 2019 linked to nearly £120 million and one in December 2018 linked to the same investigation for £20 million.Account freezing orders and unexplained wealth orders were unveiled by British authorities in 2018 as part of efforts to tackle fraud and organised crime, or assist in the recovery of illegitimate assets. Some non-EU politicians have been subject to such orders.The International Anti-Corruption Coordination Centre (IACCC) based at the NCA supported foreign jurisdictions investigating “grand corruption” during the year. This is defined as abuse of high level power causing serious and widespread harm to society.This year IACCC intelligence supported the arrest of senior corrupt officials, the identification of over £100 million worth of suspicious assets, and the return of stolen money to affected states, the NCA said.NCA director-general Lynne Owens said: “The threat to the UK from serious and organised crime remains chronic and corrosive. Criminals work across international boundaries and are using new technologies to find different ways to identify victims, exploit the vulnerable and hide both their identities and the proceeds of their crime”.“The NCA leads the UK’s fight against these criminals, and in 2019/20 we recorded our biggest ever disruptive impact against them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/businessman-s-frozen-190-million-uk-assets-returned-to-pakistan/story-VrlgCMCVYx1rulTyCwtWeJ.html
25-07-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro says new Covid-19 test came back negative||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Saturday that he has tested negative for the novel coronavirus after weeks quarantined in his residence due to an infection.In a photo posted to social media, Bolsonaro appeared with a box of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug he credited for his recovery despite a lack of scientific evidence about its effectiveness. In an accompanying text, he said his RT-PCR test for Sars-Cov 2 was negative.He did not say when he took the test nor did he provide any further details.Bolsonaro reported testing positive three times this month, including an initial diagnosis on July 7 for Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.Since then he has been in partial isolation at the presidential residence, filling his official agenda with videoconferences. He was spotted outdoors occasionally, including at a rally where he greeted supporters, removing his mask occasionally when at a distance of a few meters.Bolsonaro’s coronavírus infection was one of more than 2.3 million cases in Brazil, second only to the United States. The pandemic has killed more than 85,000 people in Brazil.Bolsonaro has played down the risks of the virus he called “a little flu” and defied public health experts and fought against governors and mayors imposing lockdowns to fight the pandemic. The right-wing populist has warned such policies are worse than the virus itself and urged businesses to reopen quickly.Bolsonaro has said he would start traveling around the country after recovering from his illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-says-new-covid-19-test-came-back-negative/story-5Zn0Hyd6FC5vxaysRQaGtI.html
25-07-2020||World||Thousands of stranded Filipinos crammed into baseball stadium amid coronavirus risks||Thousands of Filipinos were crammed into a baseball stadium in Manila on Saturday, breaking social distancing rules despite coronavirus risks, after people wanting to return to their home provinces flooded a government transportation program.Officials had reserved the stadium as a place to test people before transporting them back to their home provinces under a program to help people who had lost their jobs in the capital return to their families elsewhere.Officials had planned for 7,500 people to arrive at the stadium from Friday, but were caught out when another 2,000 people who were not yet scheduled to travel headed there anyway. “Because of the overflowing number of people, we can no longer control (the situation) and the relevance of social distancing had been diminished,” Assistant Secretary Joseph Encabo, who is overseeing the government’s transportation assistance program, told Reuters by phone.Police were deployed to urge social distancing, but people, including the elderly, children and pregnant women, were seen in close contact with each other. Some were not wearing masks.Many of those at the stadium had got stuck in the capital when it imposed one of the strictest and longest lockdowns in mid-March in response to the coronavirus pandemic. That was eased at the start of June, allowing businesses to reopen in a limited capacity, but schools remain shut and mass gatherings are banned. People must wear masks in public and observe one-metre social distancing, while children and the elderly are urged to stay at home.Coronavirus cases have more than quadrupled since restrictions were eased to 78,412, with more than half of those in the capital and surrounding areas.Among those at the stadium was Fred Marick Ukol, 40, who became stuck in Manila after his flight to Australia, where he had found work as a welder, was cancelled.“We don’t have work and now all of our savings have dried up because of the lockdown,” Ukol said, referring to himself and fellow overseas Filipino workers. Encabo said everybody at the stadium would undergo rapid testing for COVID-19 and must be cleared before being allowed to board the buses, sea vessels, and trains the government has prepared.

25-07-2020||World||‘You will destroy vaccines’: Supply chain to save the world is unprepared||The industries that shepherd goods around the world on ships, planes and trucks acknowledge they aren’t ready to handle the epic challenges of shipping an eventual Covid-19 vaccine from drugmakers to billions of people.Already stretched thin by the pandemic, freight companies face problems ranging from shrinking capacity on container ships and cargo aircraft to a lack of visibility on when a vaccine will arrive. Shippers have struggled for years to reduce cumbersome paperwork and upgrade old technology that, unless addressed soon, will slow the relay race to transport fragile vials of medicine in unprecedented quantities.Making a vaccine quickly is hard enough but distributing one worldwide offers a host of other variables, and conflicting forces may work against the effort: The infrastructure powering the global economy is scaling down for a protracted downturn just as pharmaceutical companies need to scale up for the biggest and most consequential product launch in modern history.“We’re not prepared,” Neel Jones Shah, global head of air carrier relationships at San Francisco-based freight forwarder Flexport, said during a webinar this week with other logistics executives.“Let’s all be honest here, vaccine supply chains are exponentially more complex than PPE supply chain,” he said, referring to personal protective equipment like surgical masks and gloves. “You can’t ruin PPE by leaving it on the tarmac for a couple of days. You will destroy vaccines.”8,000 Cargo PlanesJulian Sutch, head of Emirates SkyCargo’s pharmaceutical division, estimated recently that a single Boeing Co. 777 freighter can carry 1 million individual doses of a vaccine. That means airlifting double-dose regimens to protect half the world’s population would require the space in about 8,000 cargo planes.It’s doable, but not without a coordinated global strategy. For now, what’s helping to free up air freight capacity is retrofitting idled passenger planes so they can carry products ranging from medical gear to mangoes. Emirates is using 70 passenger 777s to move cargo, according to Sutch.Another capacity issue involves refrigeration. Health officials have said a vaccine that eventually comes to market will likely need to be maintained at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35.6 to 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit) throughout the shipping process. Some newer technologies could require more advanced freezers that can keep them at a frigid minus 80 degrees Celsius. Any deviation can ruin the shots.Among the big questions involving fairness and accessibility: Exactly how will medicine requiring such delicate and expensive transportation reach remote, impoverished areas where drones are now used to distribute pharmaceuticals?Such details aren’t sorted out yet and shippers are aware of the need to get organized. But they’re waiting on signals from the drugmakers.Shah said Flexport is in early discussions with a number of pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine manufacturing that are still unsure about what they’re going to need. “To a T, they’re all extremely nervous about being able to bring these to market as quickly as people might expect,” he said.There are more than 160 coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization, though only 25 are currently in human studies. The candidates furthest along are now launching late-stage trials, and have ambitions of securing an emergency use authorization from regulators before year end. That could allow for a limited availability of shots for health-care workers and other vulnerable groups.Targeting 2021Ultimately, countries will need far broader access to Covid-19 shots to halt the virus that has devastated economies and so far taken more than 633,000 lives globally. But by all accounts that’s not likely to occur until well into 2021 at the earliest.In the meantime, manufacturing deals are being clinched, and facilities are getting retrofitted to produce the still-experimental shots at the risk they fail in the clinic. Though the science underscoring the inoculations is still unproven, and mass production remains a daunting task, top pharmaceutical executives speculate that distribution will pose the greatest challenge of all.“Often people are talking about the scientific conundrum of coming forward with a vaccine that works. In some ways, maybe even a harder problem is what you just put your finger on, which is distribution,” Merck & Co. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier said in an interview on Leadership Live With David Rubenstein on Bloomberg Television. “None of us are safe until all of us are safe, so it’s got to be given broadly to humanity. We need a vaccine that we can make and distribute around the world.”Throughout nearly six months of the crisis, the closing and reopening of economies has thrown out of sync the usual seasonal flow of goods from China and other large manufacturing hubs, rendering forecasts useless for shipping plans. Making the future even harder to predict is the wide time range health experts are discussing for the arrival of an antidote to the coronavirus.Airport Readiness“I don’t think we’re ready because I don’t think we know what to expect,” said Emir Pineda, manager of aviation trade and logistics at Miami International Airport, which is among a limited number of airports around the world with carriers certified to handle pharmaceuticals. “If all of a sudden 20 to 30 charter flights land at Miami International Airport full of pharmaceuticals for distribution throughout the Americas, we’re going to have a challenge.”Another complicating factor could be the behavior of some protectionist governments intent on hobbling international cooperation by exerting sovereignty over supply chains.That attitude was on display this week at a hearing in Washington before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, where some lawmakers grilled executives of AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. about whether their vaccines would be made in the U.S., and what countries they would acquire materials from.“Systemic health threats are the least promising subjects for global cooperation,” said Simon Evenett, a professor at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland who tracks trade barriers.If private industry doesn’t rise to the delivery task, one option is outright government intervention. In the U.S., for instance, the Pentagon can call on commercial airlines contracted as part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, a program established in 1951 after the Berlin airlift that can be invoked in peacetime for national security reasons.Amid the political noise is the steady hum of economies trying to recover, and the busy time of year for companies to stock up ahead of the end-of-year holidays typically is in August and September. Vaccine distribution aside, already elevated shipping prices may stay that way and remain more volatile than ever given the capacity shortages and the demand uncertainty.“We are going to see spikes driven by commercial freight” over the next several months, said Michael Steen, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at the Purchase, New York-based shipping company Atlas Air Worldwide. “The typical calendar peak will be strong -- that’s what we’re expecting.”The branded and generic drug industry has already stomached the high cost of transportation as the pandemic has thrown the airline industry into chaos. Even at the outset of February, industry trade groups and nonprofits struggled to help drug companies navigate the dearth of commercial and cargo flights.“This is an issue of demand where the pricing is four, five, ten times of what they normally would be,” said Anne McDonald Pritchett, the senior vice president of policy and research for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, during a virtual meeting meeting on supply-chain hurdles in June.Companies are getting creative, with some going through Canada and using trucks to haul products into the U.S. Others have chartered private planes to deliver finished therapeutics into the country. Those quick-fix, costly solutions aren’t likely to work when combined with the complex transport requirements of a coronavirus vaccine.Hence the urgent need for a game plan.“We’re not planning proactively for accommodating that vaccine distribution going forward because the various parties here are not connecting,” Steen said Thursday during the industry webinar, hosted by STAT Media Group, a trade industry publisher in Mumbai. “Shippers and manufacturers are not connecting.”The good news, he said, is that drug manufacturers, companies along the distribution chain and governments still have time to understand how to “take this very scarce capacity and support the distribution of those vaccines in order to stimulate the economies and most importantly make people healthy again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-will-destroy-vaccines-supply-chain-to-save-the-world-is-unprepared/story-D0WKzH5hrQuaVWHhHDTqlI.html
25-07-2020||World||Prince Harry, Meghan distance from new book on royal rift||Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, on Saturday distanced themselves from a new unofficial biography, which claims to expose details behind the rift that saw the couple step back from Britain’s royal frontline earlier this year.‘Finding Freedom’, which is being serialised in ‘The Times’ this weekend, has claimed that Harry and Meghan were barely speaking to Harry’s elder brother, Prince William, and his wife Kate Middleton by March. It also claims friends of the Sussexes, who are now based in California, referred to some Buckingham Palace officials as “vipers”.“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to ‘Finding Freedom’,” a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said.“This book is based on the authors’ own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting,” the spokesperson said.The book’s authors, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, write about a culture of increasing tension between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and other members of the royal family in the lead up to the royal split which became official from April 1.They say the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press.“There were just a handful of people working at the palace they could trust,” the authors write. “A friend of the couple’s referred to the old guard as ‘the vipers’. Meanwhile, a frustrated palace staffer described the Sussexes’ team as ‘the squeaky third wheel’ of the palace.” In extracts from the book published in the newspaper, the authors claim Prince William was hurt by internal royal family affairs being made public.“As Meghan tearfully told a friend in March: ‘I gave up my entire life for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are. It’s very sad’,” the book notes.The biography, which is formally released on August 11, is expected to portray Harry and Meghan as pioneering forces with the ability to modernise the monarchy, thwarted by “grey suits” at the palace who they feel failed to support them as well as a hostile tabloid press.It will cover actress Meghan Markle’s arrival as Prince Harry’s girlfriend a few years ago and dramatic events ever since, leading up to their decision to forge a new life in the US with their son Archie this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-meghan-distance-from-new-book-on-royal-rift/story-VNEn6MyUuZOckQbnkk05yI.html
25-07-2020||World||Study reveals Covid-19 can infect ears||While Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the globe, a recent study suggests that the virus can infect the ear as well. The study, which was published in the scientific journal JAMA, was based on the autopsy carried out on three patients who died from Covid-19. The findings revealed the virus’ presence inside the middle ear and in the mastoid area of the head. The mastoid is a hollow bone behind the ear.The research was carried out with the team removing the mastoids from the deceased patients’ bodies and taking specimens from their middle ears. Mastoid specimens from two patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.“Two of the 3 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus in the mastoid or middle ear, with viral isolation from 2 of 6 mastoids and 3 of 6 middle ears. Results for case 1 were positive for the right middle ear only. Case 2 had negative results for all samples,” the study stated. Also read: Nearly 49,000 fresh Covid-19 take India’s tally to over 13.36 lakh“This study confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the middle ear and mastoid, with significant implications for otolaryngology procedures,” it added. The team calls for taking proper precautions to stop the spread of infection in patients visiting hospitals or during surgical procedures. “Droplet precautions (including eye protection and proper N95 level mask) are warranted for outpatient procedures involving the middle ear due to proximity to these potentially infectious spaces. Given the high asymptomatic rate of Covid-19 cases, caution is warranted for all elective ear surgery, and negative status by testing is indicated,” the study stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-reveals-covid-19-can-infect-ears/story-lCbx8IrdZnbyfi6t8la2wI.html
25-07-2020||World||US court rejects bail plea of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana being sought by India||A US court has rejected the USD 1.5 million bail application of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who has been declared a fugitive by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack case, describing him a flight risk. Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He is a declared fugitive in India. US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian, in her 24-page order dated July 21, denied bail to Rana arguing that he is a flight risk. Describing Rana as a flight risk, the US government opposed his release on bail, arguing that if he were to flee to Canada, he may escape the possibility of a death sentence in India. “Given the stakes, an allowance of bail in any amount would not guarantee Rana’s presence in court. Granting bail would invite the possibility of embarrassing the United States in the conduct of its foreign affairs, straining its relationship with India,” Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian had told the court. On the other hand, Rana’s attorney told the court that the 26/11 accused is not a flight risk and has proposed a USD 1.5 million bond for his release. Rana, in his defence, has argued that the US’ decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition. While Rana “has presented a robust bail package and proffered conditions which significantly mitigate the risk of flight, the court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight and accordingly grants the Detention Request (of the government) on that basis,” Judge Chooljian said. For someone facing conspiracy to murder and murder charges in India, the incentive to flee to avoid extradition is strong, the court said. Pakistan-born Rana completed Army Medical College there, and served in the Pakistani Army as a doctor for more than a decade, but eventually deserted. He is currently a Canadian citizen, but was a resident of Chicago where he had a business. According to the court papers, he has also resided in and travelled to Canada, Pakistan, Germany and England and speaks seven languages. If he flees to Canada, he could effectively avoid exposure to the death penalty as such country’s extradition treaty with India contains a provision which allows extradition to be refused if the offence for which extradition is requested is punishable by death in India and is not punishable by death in Canada unless India gives assurances that a death penalty would not be executed, federal prosecutors had said. “There is no question in the court’s mind that given” Rana’s significant foreign ties, particularly to Canada, and the potential death penalty awaiting him in India if he is extradited on and convicted of the most serious pending charges, he is a flight risk, the court said. According to the court papers, Rana had tested positive for Covid-19 at Terminal Island in Los Angeles on April 28, 2020, but was asymptomatic and has since recovered. He tested negative in the last three tests on June 13, June 15 and June 25. According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack. India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is sought for his role in 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem. Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-26-11-accused-tahawwur-rana-being-sought-by-india/story-jQytpovCzAY4VksaTefRLP.html
25-07-2020||World||Hurricane Hanna expected to hit southern Texas coast||Tropical Storm Hanna is expected to hit the southern Texas coast as a hurricane on Saturday afternoon or early evening, forecasters said, all while another tropical storm approached the Caribbean.Hanna was centered about 140 miles (225 kilometers) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said early Saturday. The storm had maximum sustained winds around 65 mph (100 kph) and was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph).A hurricane warning is in effect for Port Mansfield to Mesquite Bay, a span that includes Corpus Christi. A tropical storm warning is in effect from Barra el Mezquital, Mexico, to Port Mansfield, Texas, and from Mesquite Bay to High Island, Texas.A storm surge warning is in effect for Baffin Bay to Sargent. Storm surge up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) was forecast for that area. People were advised to protect life and property from high water.Forecasters said Hanna could bring 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain through Sunday night — with isolated totals of 15 inches (38 centimeters) — in addition to coastal swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.Hanna broke the record as the earliest eighth Atlantic named storm, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The previous record was Harvey on Aug. 3, 2005, Klotzbach tweeted.Tropical Storm Gonzalo was also the earliest Atlantic named storm for its place in the alphabet. The previous record was held by Tropical Storm Gert, which formed on July 24, 2005. So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard and Fay also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storm for their alphabetic order.Gonzalo was moving west at 17 mph (30 kph) while its maximum sustained winds held at 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center’s update early Saturday. It was centered about 240 miles (390 kilometers) east of Trinidad.Officials said that those in the Windward Islands should monitor the storm as it is expected to approach the islands Saturday afternoon or evening. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves into the Caribbean Sea.A tropical storm warning has been issued for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tobago and Grenada and its dependencies.

It said the imported cases included 36 South Korean workers who returned from Iraq and 32 crew members of a Russia-flagged cargo ship docked in the southern port of Busan.South Korean officials consider imported cases as less threatening than local transmissions as they mandate tests and enforce two-week quarantines on all overseas arrivals.Kwon Jun-wook, director of South Korea’s National Institute of Health, said during a briefing Friday afternoon that the newly reported cases the next morning would likely exceed 100 for the first time since April 1 and urged the public not to be overly alarmed by it.He said 89 of the 293 South Korean workers who arrived home Friday aboard two military planes from Iraq were exhibiting symptoms.South Korea has been dealing with a virus resurgence since easing social distancing guidelines in mid-April. Health authorities over the past week have found new clusters tied to churches, welfare centers, office buildings and a front-line army unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-records-113-new-covid-19-cases-most-from-overseas/story-J3qGmkaLPu9ku1g7WzYdaJ.html

The Governor General is the equivalent of India’s President and is considered the British Queen’s representative in Canada.According to a report from the outlet CBC News, anonymous sources accused Payette of verbally harassing and abusing staff, leading to the departure of some among those allegedly attacked.The country’s Cabinet Secretariat, the Privy Council Office has now launched a formal inquiry into these charges.CBC quoted PCO spokesperson Stéphane Shank as saying, “Harassment has no place in any professional workplace. It is a public service priority to advance efforts to more effectively prevent and resolve issues of harassment.”Also read: Canada to not recognise results of Punjab 2020 Referendum organised by SFJPayette, a former astronaut selected for the post by the Government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2017, said in a tweet that she took “workplace harassment issues very seriously.” She added that she was committed to “ensuring that every employee” who worked at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Governor General, “enjoys a secure and healthy work environment at all times and under all circumstances.” She also said she “requested the conduct of an independent review.”As this probe was announced, Trudeau and his finance minister Bill Morneau continue to face calls for their resignation from Opposition parties even as both are being investigated by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner and Parliamentary panels over a nearly billion-dollar contract given to a charitable organisation despite their families having ties to it.The contract to the WE Charity was later cancelled following an uproar as it emerged that Trudeau’s wife, mother and brother were paid for appearances by it or allied outfits that came under the same parent umbrella. Meanwhile, Morneau’s daughter worked for the organisation and he and his family enjoyed a complimentary vacation costing over CA $41000 at the organisation’s expense. Morneau apologised for the lapse this week while appearing before the House of Commons Finance Committee and said he had repaid the charity that amount, though that was done just earlier the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-leadership-in-turmoil-governor-general-faces-official-probe-on-harassment/story-LONGu5maryQ2IahpaMgSeM.html
25-07-2020||World||Trump administration denies entry to foreign students enrolled for online-only classes||Newly-enrolled international students, many of them from India, would not be allowed to enter the United States (US) if their courses were to be taught online in the upcoming fall semester, the US agency that runs the student and exchange visitors visa programme said on Friday.The fall semester starts in September.“Non-immigrant students in new or initial status after March 9 will not be able to enter the US to enroll in a US school as a non-immigrant student for the fall term to pursue a full course of study that is 100% online,” said the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) in a statement.It directed authorised universities to not issue Form 1-20s to newly-enrolled students if their classes were to be online only. These documents are required by international students to apply for student visa.March 9, the cut-off date, is when ICE issued guidelines allowing non-immigrant foreign students to continue to stay in the country and pursue their classes online, wholly, as required by the universities, making an exception in view of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from a rule under which foreigners are not issued student visas for online-only classes.The number of foreign students impacted by this order could not be immediately ascertained.There were nearly 270,000 new foreign students enrolled in graduate, under-graduate and non-degree courses for the academic session starting 2019 fall, according to Open Doors, a standard resource on international students.India is the second-largest source of foreign students in the US, with around 200,000, of an estimated 1 million in all.This new order came just days after the Donald Trump administration rescinded a controversial order that would have led to the deportation of non-immigrant international students if their courses were being held fully online in the fall semester, a preventative measure adopted by many institutions as they reopen after a prolonged Covid-19-enforced break.To stay in the US, these foreign students would have had to ensure a majority of their courses were conducted in-person and if that was not offered by their institution, transfer to one that did.The universities are being extra vigilant, as the US is reporting a second surge in Covid-19 cases and fatalities.Harvard University, for instance, has declared its fall classes will be all online. It is not even allowing all its students to return to their on-campus accommodations.Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had challenged that earlier order in a lawsuit that was eventually joined by over 200 universities.Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator, and former presidential candidate, had weighed in with a stinging denunciation. It is “dangerous & xenophobic”, she had written in a tweet and had gone on to compare the order to the travel ban the president had ordered targeting people from certain countries, called the “Muslim travel ban”.The Trump administration told a Boston court at the first oral arguments in the case it was rescinding the order.But the administration is not done with foreign students evidently. It is understood to be considering suspending OPT (Optional Practical Training), a temporary post-graduation work authorisation foreign students use as a stepping stone to H-1B visa, and, eventually, Green Cards and citizenship.And now this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-denies-entry-to-foreign-students-enrolled-for-online-only-classes-in-us/story-pvkxmAX8a5eveh4UEgZJGI.html
25-07-2020||World||US eases export rules on drone sales to allies||The US on Friday relaxed norms to allow American defence companies to sell more drones to allies by changing the decades-old Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), an agreement involving 35 countries to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.The White House said in a statement that while the 1987 missile control pact is critical in slowing proliferation and promoting peace and security, it is in dire need of modernisation as it applies to unmanned aerial systems (UAS).“This action, which is consistent with the MTCR guidelines will increase the US’s national security by improving capabilities of its partners and increase economic security by opening the expanding drones market to the US industry,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement.McEnany said the MTCR standards are more than three decades old in a sector which has rapidly evolving technology and these outdated standards give an unfair advantage to countries outside MTCR and hurt the United States industry.They also hinder the deterrence capability abroad by handicapping the US’ partners and allies with subpar technology, she said. More than two years of discussion with MTCR partners were unable to produce consensus on this overdue reform, she added.“Therefore, the President has decided to invoke our national discretion to treat a carefully selected subset of MTCR Category I UAS, which cannot travel faster than 800 kilometers per hour, as Category II,” McEnany said.“As such, the United States has determined that it will overcome the MTCR’s strong presumption of denial for this UAS subset,” she added.McEnany said the action, which is consistent with MTCR guidelines and the objectives of the UAS export policy of April 2018, will increase the US’ national security by improving the capabilities of its partners and increase the country’s economic security by opening the expanding UAS market to United States industry.“It also sets a strong example for other MTCR partners to adopt the same standard,” she added.Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political military affairs, said the policy change modernises the US’ approach to implementing MTCR commitments and makes it more reflective of the technological realities.“It helps our allies, it helps our partners — it helps them all meet their urgent national security and commercial requirements, and it also advances the US’ national security and economic interests,” Cooper said during a conference call.Cooper, however, said higher-speed systems such as cruise missiles, hypersonic aerial vehicles, and advanced unmanned combat aerial vehicles are not affected by this revision.The United States remains a committed member of the MTCR and holds it as an important non-proliferation tool to curb the spread of high-end missile technologies to countries such as North Korea and Iran.He said preventing the use and spread of the weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery remains a Trump administration priority.As of now only the United Kingdom, France and Australia are allowed to buy larger, armed drones from US manufacturers.Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said for too long, the restraint of the international community with regard to exports of large unmanned aircraft has created an opportunity for the Chinese military to advance its defence technology and industrial base, and build new defence relationships around the world, including with traditional US partners.“I commend the administration for its robust, years-long diplomatic effort to modernise the MTCR to account for China’s actions. It has become clear, however, that one MTCR member state will inevitably block any consensus within the regime on necessary changes. Therefore, the United States has no choice but to make the policy changes that the administration has outlined today,” he said.However, Senator Bob Menendez, ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump administration has once again weakened international export controls by this action.“It is important to appreciate that the Missile Technology Control Regime originally adopted stringent controls on exports of advanced drones at the urging of the United States. To disregard this policy now is likely to undermine the credibility and influence of the MTCR generally, which also coordinates international controls on the sale and spread of dangerous ballistic missiles and technology around the world,” he said.Congressman Eliot Engel, the chairperson of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Trump is unilaterally abrogating a long-standing arms control agreement because it is inconvenient for his ‘anything goes’ policy to sell dangerous weapons seemingly anywhere to anyone.“In this case, it is the MTCR, set up by President Reagan, to restrict exports of unmanned aerial vehicles that can carry nuclear weapons. Trump wants to be free to sell UAVs that can carry heavy warheads, bombs, and other explosive devices more than 300 km,” Engel said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-eases-export-rules-on-drone-sales-to-allies/story-9gAbARY5ComkLcyH8O5ulM.html
25-07-2020||World||No Covid-19 bill yet: White House, GOP at odds over jobless aid||Negotiations over a new Covid-19 rescue bill were in flux Friday after the White House floated cutting an unemployment benefits boost to as little as $100 and President Donald Trump turned to a new priority, adding money to build a new FBI headquarters.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent senators home, promising a Republican proposal would be ready on Monday. Outraged Democrats warned that time was being wasted on GOP infighting as the virus worsens, jobless aid expires and the death toll rises.“We call upon Leader McConnell to get serious,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a statement.During a head-spinning week of start-and-stop efforts, McConnell abruptly halted the rollout of the Republicans’ $1 trillion plan, which was supposed to provide a counter-offer to the Democrats’ $3 trillion bill in an opening bid for negotiations. Trump was forced to abandon his push for a payroll tax break, which his party opposed, and the White House turned to new priorities.As Republicans struggled, the nation’s infections topped 4 million, deaths rose by several thousand, to nearly 145,000, and the $600 unemployment benefit boost for millions of out-of-work Americans was on track to expire.As McConnell shut down the Senate, he promised to return with “a strong, targeted piece of legislation aimed directly at the challenges we face right now.”The GOP leader, who is up for reelection in November alongside Trump, dashed home to Kentucky for an event with the nation’s drug czar, Jim Carroll, in a part of Appalachia confronting opioid addiction and skyrocketing overdose deaths.As for the Covid-19 crisis, McConnell said in Ashland, Kentucky, “This has been one heck of a challenge for everybody in the country. Hopefully we can come together behind some package we can agree on in the next few weeks.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOne sticking point for Republicans trying to resolve their differences with the White House is how to cut the $600 weekly jobless benefit boost that is expiring.Republicans largely believe the add-on, which had been approved in an earlier aid bill, is too much and becoming a disincentive for returning to work. In some situations, the boost gives the unemployed more money than if they were working. Under McConnell’s plan, senators proposed cutting it to $200 and then transitioning over the next few months to a new system more closely linked to a state’s own payment levels.An administration official granted anonymity to discuss the private talks said the White House viewed the Senate GOP’s proposal as too “cumbersome” and the $200 boost as too high.A number of different solutions were being discussed, the official said Thursday, including dropping the add-on to $100.Democrats warned time was running out. The benefit officially expires July 31, but due to the way states process unemployment payments, the cutoff is effectively Saturday.Rep. Richie Neal, D-N.J., chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, said the nation is on “the eve of an economic catastrophe.”The US registered its 18th straight week of new jobless claims topping 1 million, with an unemployment rate at 11 percent, higher than during last decade’s Great Recession. A new AP-NORC poll said half of Americans laid off now believe their jobs will not return.“People need the sustenance of day-to-day life,” Neal said at the Capitol. He said the extra aid not only helps cash-strapped families, but is key to fueling the economy as Americans go without paychecks. “The recovery is going to be slow,” he said.The unemployment debate is only one of many issues dividing Republicans as they enter negotiations with Democrats over how best to respond to the prolonged coronavirus crisis and devastating economic fallout.McConnell’s emerging CARES Act II, named after the earlier effort, was expected to include a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to many Americans, a repeat of the money sent in spring, along with $105 billion to help reopen schools, $25 billion for virus testing and McConnell’s top priority of a liability shield to protect businesses, hospitals and others against Covid-19 lawsuits.Trump was pushing the payroll tax cut, but Senate Republicans didn’t want to include it because they say it does little to help out-of-work Americans. It would also pull revenue away from the tax that funds Social Security and Medicare.The president relented, but the White House also inserted new priorities — rethinking the jobless benefit and Trump’s preference for a new building to replace the FBI’s aging J. Edgar Hoover Building in downtown Washington, across the street from the Trump hotel.“This is disarray,” Pelosi said Friday at the Capitol.Next steps are uncertain after days of closed-door GOP negotiations at the Capitol with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and others.“We had expected to be working throughout this weekend,” the Democratic leaders said.“It is simply unacceptable that Republicans have had this entire time to reach consensus among themselves and continue to flail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-covid-19-bill-yet-white-house-gop-at-odds-over-jobless-aid/story-HNEVDWaGrkt91GEfZmAvRP.html
25-07-2020||World||No Covid-19 herd immunity yet, says WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan||The WHO’s chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Friday said “herd immunity” -- which is when enough people become resistant to a disease to stop its spread -- is still a long way ahead for Covid-19 since 50 to 60 per cent of the population will need to be immune to the novel coronavirus to protect the uninfected. In a social media live event organised by the World Health Organisation from Geneva, the scientist said that more waves of the infection would be required to get to a stage of natural immunity.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Therefore, she warned, that at least for the next year or so, the world needs to be “geared up” to do everything possible to keep the novel coronavirus at bay while scientists work on vaccines. Meanwhile, therapeutics will help keep death rates low and allow people to get on with their lives. “For this concept of herd immunity, you need 50 to 60 per cent of the population to have this immunity to be actually able to break those chains of transmission,” explained Swaminathan. “That’s much easier to do with a vaccine; we can achieve it faster and without people getting sick and dying. So, it is much better to do it that way, to achieve herd immunity through natural infection. We would have several waves [of infection] and unfortunately also the mortality that we see,” she said. She added: “Over a period of time, people will start developing natural immunity. We know now from the studies that have been done in many of the affected countries that usually between 5 to 10 per cent of the population has developed antibodies. In some places it’s been higher than that, up to 20 per cent. “As there are waves of this infection going through countries, people are going to develop antibodies and those people will be hopefully immune for some time and so they will also act as barriers and brakes to the spread of this infection,” said Swaminathan, a paediatrician from India and a globally-recognised researcher on tuberculosis and HIV.The scientist, who was addressing a range of questions on coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics, said that for the foreseeable future, it is important to be focussed on doing the “right thing” such as public health measures that are known to work while the world waits for a vaccine. “Even if the clinical trials are successful and we have a couple of vaccines by the end of this year, we still need the hundreds of billions of doses, which will take time,” she said. Elaborating on vaccine development, the chief scientist said there are over 200 candidates in some stage of development as she highlighted the extraordinary speed at which the science has been moving around the understanding of the novel coronavirus. “Vaccine development is normally quite a lengthy and laborious process… the more candidates we have, the more opportunities we have for success,” she said. “Most people who recover from Covid-19 develop neutralising antibodies, which means a vaccine has a good chance of offering protective immunity,” she said. Asked about the fearful prospect of never getting a vaccine for Covid-19, Dr Swaminathan admitted that “we have to entertain the possibility that we may have to learn to live with this virus”. “Right now it seems frightening; what will we do if we don’t have a vaccine? But it is a possibility, there is no 100 per cent guarantee that we will have one. Let’s hope we do. But we know, now, what are the measures that we can take to minimise the spread of this infection, such as maintaining distance, hand washing, respiratory hygiene and wearing of masks,” she said. According to Johns Hopkins University, the Covid-19 pandemic has so far infected more than 15.5 million people and killed over 6.3 lakh across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-covid-19-herd-immunity-yet-says-who-chief-scientist-soumya-swaminathan/story-ho7p9cZpArmLMIDbpNolvO.html
25-07-2020||World||Chilean suspect jailed in French murder case of Japanese||A Chilean man was order jailed in eastern France on Friday while he is investigated in the disappearance nearly four years ago of his ex-girlfriend, a Japanese student, in a case of suspected murder spanning continents but in which the body has not been found.Nicolas Zepeda, 29, extradited from Chile earlier in the day, was ordered detained by a judge in Besancon after hours of deliberation.The prosecutor in Besancon, where the missing Narumi Kurosaki had been studying, said the extradition of the suspect by Chile was a “new start” for the investigation even though Zepeda refused to answer questions of the investigating judge.“He simply declared that he is innocent” and expressed hope the real killer would be found, prosecutor Etienne Manteau told reporters.Being placed under investigation is a step short of formally being charged, under French legal procedure. Formal charges would come if the investigating judge concludes there is sufficient evidence to put the suspect on trial.Manteau predicted a trial could be held next year.It was a “major advance ... but it’s not over,” he said of the extradition. He himself had traveled to Chile as part of the murder probe.The regional press, which has followed the investigation, has described a love affair that allegedly went awry. Zepeda reportedly had met Kurosaki in Japan then traveled to France to see her after she ended the relationship.With Zepeda in custody, investigators must now plumb the personality of the suspect and “understand who Nicolas Zepeda really is,” the prosecutor said.Kurosaki disappeared in the early hours of Dec. 5, 2016, from her residence at the Besancon university campus. Zepeda had already returned to Chile before her disappearance was investigated.Despite long searches in the region’s thick forests and elsewhere, investigators failed to find her body, but police believe he killed her.During court proceedings in Chile, Zepeda acknowledged that he had visited Kurosaki at her apartment on the night she disappeared, even though their romantic relationship had ended. He said they had consensual sex.“We’re obviously interested in everything that might be proposed by the defense,” the prosecutor said.Until his extradition, Zepeda had been under house arrest at his mother’s apartment in the resort of Viña del Mar, 120 kilometers (75 miles) northwest of Santiago.Zepeda was turned over to French officials and put on a Paris-bound flight with police escort. From Charles de Gaulle airport, he was transferred Friday by car to Besancon, in the foothills of the Alps. His extradition was approved by Chile’s Supreme Court in May, but was delayed because of the coronavirus crisis and the cancellation of many international flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chilean-suspect-jailed-in-french-murder-case-of-japanese/story-hSakEevTdMLef9QdXE9KIJ.html

In January, they announced plans to lead a more independent life and to finance it themselves.Harry and Meghan, a former actress, married in May 2018 in a wedding which was heralded at the time as infusing a blast of Hollywood glamour and modernity into the monarchy, and made them one of the world’s biggest celebrity couples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-meghan-distance-themselves-from-upcoming-book-on-time-in-royal-family/story-JsrTS7US3gvYcOCYqWTDlJ.html
25-07-2020||World||New foreign students can’t enter US if courses online: US||A week after revoking sweeping new restrictions on international students, federal immigration officials on Friday announced that new foreign students will be barred from entering the United States if they plan to take their classes entirely online this fall.In a memo to college officials, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said new students who were not already enrolled as of March 9 will “likely not be able to obtain” visas if they intend to take courses entirely online. The announcement primarily affects new students hoping to enroll at universities that will provide classes entirely online as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.International students who are already in the US or are returning from abroad and already have visas will still be allowed to take classes entirely online, according to the update, even if they begin instruction in-person but their schools move online in the face of a worsening outbreak.The policy strikes a blow to colleges a week after hundreds united to repel a Trump administration policy that threatened to deport thousands of foreign students. That rule sought to bar all international students in the US from taking classes entirely online this fall, even if their universities were forced to switch to fully online instruction amid an outbreak.The new order was released Friday as a clarification to earlier guidance from March 9 that suspended existing limits around online education for international students. The March guidance was meant to provide flexibility as schools across the nation closed campuses amid the pandemic, but universities said it was unclear whether it extended to new students.In its memo, ICE clarified that the flexibility applies only to students “who were actively enrolled at a US school on March 9.” Officials at some schools — including Harvard University and the University of Southern California, which are offering classes online this fall — had feared as much and already told first-year students they could not come from abroad,.The American Council on Education, a group of university presidents, said it was disappointed by the guidance. “We have been fearing this and preparing for this. We’re still disappointed,” said ​Brad Farnsworth, vice president of the group.Harvard officials said they’re asking Congress to extend the March guidance to new students but don’t anticipate any changes by the fall term. New students can take classes online from abroad or defer their enrollment, the school said.In a message to students Tuesday, Harvard’s undergraduate dean, Rakesh Khurana, said the school “abhors” any policy that forces officials to choose between “our community’s health and the education of our international students.”The rule threatening to deport thousands of foreign students if they took all their classes online was widely seen as part of Trump’s recent campaign to pressure the nation’s schools and colleges to reopen this fall.Immigration officials rescinded the policy July 14 after it was challenged by eight federal lawsuits from states and universities. More than 200 schools had signed briefs supporting a suit brought by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The policy was issued as a growing number of colleges make the decision to hold classes entirely or primary online this fall. As virus cases continue to rise, schools including the University of California, Berkeley, and Rutgers University have announced the move this week.Several education groups issued letters this week urging ICE to allow all international students, including new ones, to enter the country even if their schools were operating entirely online. They said many colleges had already prepared housing for international students, even at universities offering online instruction only.The Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a coalition of college leaders, said it was disappointed by ICE’s decision on new students. It places undue pressure on schools to offer at least some in-person instruction, the group said.But other elements of the guidance took a step in the right direction, the group said, including the clarification that students can remain in the US even if their schools switch to fully online instruction during the semester.Colleges across the US are already expecting sharp drops in the number of students coming from abroad amid the pandemic and a slowdown in visa processing. It’s likely to deliver a financial hit to colleges that rely on revenue from international students, who typically pay higher tuition rates.The nation attracted roughly 1.1 million international students in the 2018-19 school year. The American Council on Education estimates about 250,000 international students will enroll at US universities this fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-foreign-students-can-t-enter-us-if-courses-online-us/story-vkFZazTZMdhRQ7vJSHcccO.html
25-07-2020||World||China’s consulate in Houston cleared out ahead of eviction||Consular officials departed the Chinese consulate in Houston on Friday afternoon after the Trump administration ordered the facility to shut down.Vans bearing diplomatic plates departed the consulate as the 4pm Friday deadline arrived for the consulate to close. At that point, federal agents checked the locked doors of the consulate and a locksmith was seen working to crack the lock on one door.Meanwhile, a small group of protesters gathered across the street and played a recording criticizing the Chinese government.It was unclear at the scene if the consulate had been cleared of consular staff. A Houston Police Department spokesman referred all questions to the FBI and State Department, which did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.The US alleged that the consulate was a nest of Chinese spies who tried to steal data from facilities in Texas, including the Texas A&M medical system and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.China called the allegations “malicious slander” and responded by ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in the western Chinese city of Chengdu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-consulate-in-houston-cleared-out-ahead-of-eviction/story-7ttwf09TNrQE7SeaCv26uJ.html
25-07-2020||World||Facebook, Twitter remove accounts of Bolsonaro supporters following court order||Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc took down the accounts of several high-profile supporters of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro following a Supreme Court order, a move that underlines the tricky territory the social media titans are navigating in some of the world’s largest jurisdictions.Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the removal of 16 Twitter accounts and 12 Facebook accounts on Friday, a decision tied to an ongoing probe into the alleged dissemination of disinformation by supporters of the right-wing Bolsonaro.Among the purposes of the “fake news” investigation, as it is known in Brazil, is to discover if misinformation and threats against Supreme Court officials are being funded illicitly.Among the owners of the suspended accounts is Roberto Jefferson, a former congressman and president of the conservative PTB party, as well as businessmen Luciano Hang, Edgar Corona and Oscar Fakhoury, and activist Sara Giromini, widely known as Sarah Winter.Moraes had ordered the accounts blocked in a separate ruling in May, though the accounts were not removed at the time.Friday’s order, Moraes said, was meant to stop the accounts from “being used as a means of committing possible criminal conduct.”Facebook said in a statement that it “respects the judiciary and complies with valid legal orders.” Twitter in a statement said, “Twitter acted strictly to comply with a legal order related to a Supreme Court investigation.”The blocked Twitter accounts themselves, on the pages where their accounts would be, said Friday evening they were suspended “in response to a legal order.”The reaction among Brazil’s conservatives was swift.The PTB party said in a statement that it was surprised by “yet another arbitrary measure” ordered by Moraes, which “impedes the exercise (of Jefferson’s) right to liberty of expression and opinion on social media.”Winter, the activist, said she would complain to “international human rights organizations about the serious offense against free speech.”While Bolsonaro did not immediately address the removal of the accounts, he has previously spoken against the inquiry, calling it a grave threat to free speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-twitter-remove-accounts-of-bolsonaro-supporters-following-court-order/story-jOH6SukVL7v0NrgYKvzZzI.html
25-07-2020||World||US records over 1,000 coronavirus deaths for fourth straight day||The United States recorded more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19 for the fourth day in a row on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, as the Trump administration stressed the need for children to go back into the classroom despite fears about safety.Early June was the last time the United States recorded over 1,000 deaths a day for four days in a row, resulting from fallout from infections in April. In the most recent outbreak, cases began rising in early June and deaths increased about six weeks later.So far in July, 19 US states have broken one-day records for increases in Covid-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Texas lost a record 206 lives on Wednesday, Florida had a record increase of 173 deaths on Thursday and California’s record was 159 on Wednesday.US deaths rose by at least 1,019 to a total of 145,352 on Friday compared with a rise of 1,140 on Thursday, 1,135 on Wednesday and 1,141 on Tuesday. Total cases across the United States rose by at least 68,800 on Friday to over 4 million total.Even though deaths are rising in the United States for a second week in a row, they remain well below levels seen in April, when 2,000 people a day on average died from the virus. The outbreak in March and April ravaged many nursing homes while infections this summer have been in younger, healthier individuals. Hospitals have also found better treatments, such as putting patients on their bellies and using the antiviral drug Remdesivir.Among the 20 countries with the largest outbreaks, the United States ranks seventh highest globally for deaths per capita, according to a Reuters analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-over-1-000-coronavirus-deaths-for-fourth-straight-day/story-5vEzmeko14vErSDHu5fFhJ.html
25-07-2020||World||Trump says he had regrets about his tweets ‘too often’||President Donald Trump acknowledged in an interview released Friday that he’s “often” had regrets about his tweets. “Too often,” he added. Trump, in an interview with Barstool Sports, said it’s not like the old days when people wrote a letter and let it sit for a day before sending it, giving them time to reconsider. “But we don’t do that with Twitter, right?” Trump said. “We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls, ‘Did you really say this?’” Trump said that more often than not, “it’s the retweets that get you in trouble.” He added, “You see something that looks good and you don’t investigate.” Among other things, Trump has been criticized in recent months for retweeting posts with “white power” and anti-Semitic messages as well one that included a “FireFauci” hashtag, referring to Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-had-regrets-about-his-tweets-too-often/story-jPYud8kBMrUPaTUiOJq1DI.html
25-07-2020||World||UK PM Johnson admits govt didn’t understand Covid-19 in first weeks, months||After over 45,600 deaths and nearly 3 lakh cases in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday night admitted that the government did not understand the coronavirus in the first few weeks and months, adding things could have been done differently.The UK has registered the worst death toll in Europe and one of the highest in the world, with questions swirling over the Johnson government’s handling of the situation: from initial ideas about ‘herd immunity’, a late lockdown (on March 23) and a track-and-trace system.Johnson, who recovered after being severely infected by the virus, told the BBC in an interview to mark the first anniversary of his entering Downing Street that “we didn’t understand (the virus) in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months”.He said there were “very open questions” about whether the lockdown had started too late, adding that there were lessons to be learned and that ministers could have done some things “differently”. He has promised an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic.According to him, “the single thing that we didn’t see at the beginning” was the extent to which coronavirus could be transmitted asymptomatically between people. But he said this is not the time for the independent inquiry to take place.He said: “Maybe there were things we could have done differently, as I’ve said, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently. But what I think the public wants us to do now is to focus on getting the preparations ready for what, as I say, could be a resurgence of the virus this winter.”The number of deaths and cases have come down in recent weeks, prompting the government to ease lockdown and reopen large sectors of the economy, besides picking up 80 per cent of the salary bill of private sector employees and paying similar grants to the self-employed. Labour has accused the Johnson government of ‘mishandling’ the crisis. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Boris Johnson has finally admitted the government has mishandled its response to the coronavirus. It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously.”On the death toll, which the Office for National Statistics has put at over 50,000, Johnson said in the interview: “We mourn every one of the of those who lost their lives and our thoughts are very much with their with their families. And I take full responsibility for everything that government did.”Johnson, who took over after Theresa May resigned and won the Conservative leadership contest last July, later won a comfortable majority in the December election on the back of the slogan of ‘Get Brexit done’. He admitted that the outbreak of coronavirus had caused ‘many difficulties’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pm-boris-admits-uk-did-not-understand-it-in-first-weeks-months/story-l6Z0p2R9idlcfePimlh9cI.html
25-07-2020||World||Mike Pompeo sets agenda for a new Cold War with China. Russia will be key||On the day his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was goading the world to rise up against the tyranny of Chinese President Xi Jinping, US President Donald Trump dialled his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to discuss the inclusion of Beijing in future talks on strategic arms control, oil security and Iran developments.According to diplomats based in Washington and Moscow, this was President Trump’s fifth call to President Putin in the past two months as Russian Federation is the key to holding a rampaging China accountable in the long term interests of global peace.While the US President understands the importance of Russia in handling Beijing, he faces stiff resistance from the cold warriors and anti-Trump activists in Washington who still see Moscow, not China as the enemy number 1. President Trump’s conversation on Iran was to dissuade President Putin from supporting Tehran who wants to join hands with China for a long term anti-US alliance.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on his part, virtually upended the 1970s Nixon-Kissinger doctrine of engaging China in the belief that Beijing rulers would assimilate in the global comity of nations. The Nixon-Kissinger engagement of China was at the cost of US relations with India as Washington held New Delhi responsible for the division of Pakistan in 1971 and moved the USS carrier Enterprise in opposition to the move.By saying that his past army record during the Cold War taught him that Communists always lie, Secretary Pompeo made it clear that the new mantra with Beijing was “distrust and verify,” refitting President Ronald Regan’s ‘trust but verify’ slogan vis-a-vis Soviet Union through the 1980s to present day China.Also Watch | ‘Closing more Chinese consulates in US always possible’: Donald Trump General Secretary Xi Jinping is not destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever, unless we allow it….maybe it is time for a new grouping of like minded nations, a new alliance of democracies,” Pompeo said.While it is early days for Pompeo’s statement to be translated on ground, it is quite evident that China will do everything to ensure that President Trump does not return to power in November. His Secretary of State did sound like US diplomat George F Kennan, who sent an 8,000-word telegram to the US State Department in February 1946 - the now-famous ‘long telegram’ - where he articulated the US philosophy of “containment” to deal with the Soviet Union.Pompeo said he wasn’t advocating containment because the challenge facing the US and the world from China was much more complex. “The USSR was closed off from the free world. Communist China is already within our borders,” he said.Identifying China as a clear and present danger, Mike Pompeo turned President Nixon’s statement that “ world cannot be safe until China changes” on its head, saying that the world must change the Chinese Communist Party or China will change us as it is happening in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.Following up on US National Security Advisor Richard O’ Brien, FBI Director Chris Wray and Attorney General William Barr’s caustic remarks on China, Secretary Pompeo has set the agenda for the dawn of a new Cold War. The last one ended with the disintegration of the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1991. Only this time the enemy is China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-sets-agenda-for-a-new-cold-war-with-china-russia-will-be-key/story-pqOH74cFjqfZFzYashstJJ.html
25-07-2020||World||Canada to not recognise results of Punjab 2020 Referendum organised by SFJ||The Justin Trudeau Government will not recognise the results of the Punjab 2020 Referendum being organised by the pro-Khalistan group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). A statement sent to the Hindustan Times made this position explicit for the first time.Responding to queries from Hindustan Times about Canadian Government’s stand on the referendum scheduled for November this year, aimed at carving out a separate state of Punjab from India, a spokesperson of the country’s Foreign Ministry, stated in an email response: “Canada respects the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of India, and the Government of Canada will not recognize the referendum.”The spokesperson also said that the bilateral relationship between Canada and India “is a priority for the Government of Canada.”Indian officials did not want to comment on this development on record, though one described it as “significant” that this was put in writing and a change from the earlier stance that the referendum was protected by freedom of speech and expression rights in Canada. An official also pointed out that a recent message in this respect from Ottawa, stating its opposition to the referendum, was also communicated to New Delhi, via the High Commission in Canada.India’s High Commissioner in Ottawa Ajay Bisaria also refused to address this particular matter, but said, “We continue to engage closely with Canadian partners, including security agencies on a range of bilateral security issues. Canada has been requested to check anti-India activities and to proscribe individuals and entities declared illegal in India.”Following the return of Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister in October, New Delhi made it clear in official interactions that the issue of support for Khalistan in Canada had hindered relations between the two nations and expected more from the Canadian side. India, an official said, has noticed a perceptible difference in the attitude with which Canada has approached this contentious matter in recent months, a development described as “positive”.Coordination between security and intelligence agencies has also improved, with a delegation of the Royal Canadian Mounter Police (RCMP) holding discussions with counterparts in the National Investigative Agency (NIA) late last year. “There is active diplomacy and conversations going on,” an official said.In January this year, SFJ had written to Trudeau seeking his support for the non-binding referendum. The separatist organization plans to hold it in November, with in-person voting at various venues across the world including the Canadian cities of Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Edmonton.Reacting to the statement, SFJ’s legal advisor Gurpatwant Pannun said they were “not seeking recognition” of the right to freedom of expression from the Trudeau Government since it was guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. He went on to say that such “political statements hold no water.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-not-recognize-results-of-punjab-2020-referendum-organized-by-sfj/story-H7Ur7veEX9Nn2VBf8BJLYJ.html
