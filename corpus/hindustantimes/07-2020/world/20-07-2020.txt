UK is also extending to Hong Kong the arms embargo that is in force on mainland China since 1989. This includes no exports from the UK to Hong Kong of potentially lethal weapons, their components or ammunition, besides a ban on the export of any equipment not already banned, which might be used for internal repression, such as shackles, intercept equipment, firearms and smoke grenades.Calling upon China to live up to its international obligations, Raab said: “We want to work with China. There is enormous scope for positive, constructive, engagement…But, as we strive for that positive relationship, we are also clear-sighted about the challenges that lie ahead”.“We will always protect our vital interests, Including sensitive infrastructure, and we won’t accept any investment that compromises our domestic or national security. Mr Speaker, we will be clear where we disagree, and I have been clear about our grave concerns regarding the gross human rights abuses being perpetrated against the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang”.The opposition Labour supported the measures announced, calling it a step in the right direction. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the measures should lead to a “new era” in the two countries’ relationship.She said: “This must mark the start of a more strategic approach to China based on an ethical approach to foreign policy and an end to the naivety of the ‘golden-era years’.”“Like him, our quarrel is not with the people of China, but the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, the actions of the Chinese government in the South China Sea and the appalling treatment of the Uighur people is reason now to act. We will not be able to say in future years that we did not know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-frost-in-uk-china-ties-as-extradition-pact-is-suspended/story-iMavlBPa1hivoYOZk6w21H.html
20-07-2020||World||2020 Watch: Does Donald Trump have a strategy to win in November?||Presidential politics move fast. What we’re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:Days to general election: 106Days to first state offering early voting (Pennsylvania): 56___THE NARRATIVEPresident Donald Trump insists he’s not losing, but by virtually every objective measure he’s struggling through one of the worst moments of his presidency. Trump demoted his campaign manager last week, acknowledging through his actions, if not his words, that things are not moving in the right direction.Republican allies have begun to share concern publicly about Trump’s political strategy and his inconsistent leadership, most notably his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Daily infections are exploding, the death rate is ticking up and the economic recovery is in jeopardy.Trump on Sunday charged, without evidence, that Democratic state and local officials were planning to close schools and roll back reopening plans just to hurt him. Multiple polls suggest that a majority of voters, including many Republicans, simply don’t believe what Trump says about the pandemic.Meanwhile, Trump also refused to say whether he would accept the results of the general election. Early voting begins across multiple swing states in just eight weeks.___THE BIG QUESTIONSDoes Trump have a strategy to win?Scott Walker, the former Wisconsin governor and a Trump ally, tells us that he sees no clear strategy coming from the Trump campaign. Some might think that’s why Trump downgraded campaign manager Brad Parscale last week, except that his replacement, Bill Stepien, had largely been running the political operation already.There is little evidence that Trump is working to expand his coalition. He seems to be betting everything that he can win by energizing his base while depressing turnout among would-be Biden supporters by redefining the lifelong politician with a flood of negative advertising. Trump’s campaign has reserved $146 million in television ads this fall, the vast majority of which is going to must-win states like Florida and Ohio he carried four years ago.Trump’s team continues to embrace a kitchen sink messaging campaign against Biden that features questions about his mental competence, his allegiance to the far left, his inconsistent record and conspiracy theories about the integrity of the election itself. The scattershot approach is frustrating allies like Walker, although it’s not likely to change anytime soon.Are school closures already America’s next major crisis?Several weeks before many elementary and secondary schools are scheduled to open, there are clear signs that surging coronavirus infections will force education officials in several states to keep their doors closed. That leaves millions of children and their parents in limbo and threatens the economic recovery.Trump told Fox News Channel on Sunday that Democrats were planning to close schools just to hurt him but cited no evidence for his claim. He also threatened to strip federal funding from public schools if they refuse to open. Such rhetoric won’t help ensure that it’s safe for children and their teachers to get back to the classroom.Is Biden’s veep search actually expanding?The biggest decision of Biden’s campaign looms as he continues his search for a running mate. As few as six serious contenders advanced in the search earlier this summer. But amid pressure for Biden to make a selection that would satisfy a wide range of priorities and constituencies, additional candidates have joined the vetting process in recent weeks, according to multiple Democrats with knowledge of the dynamics. That’s yielding an unusually large field of contenders, including some of the nation’s best-known politicians and others who have a lower profile.Those known to be under consideration earlier include Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Florida Rep. Val Demings, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance-Bottoms and Susan Rice, who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth and California Rep. Karen Bass have come under greater consideration more recently.Are we headed toward a constitutional crisis?Trump on Sunday refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost. “I have to see,” he told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. “No, I’m not going to just say ‘yes.’ I’m not going to say ‘no.’”Trump made a similar statement that frightened constitutional scholars four years ago, although it was quickly forgotten after Trump’s victory. With his numbers looking worse heading into 2020, some are taking the threat more seriously this time. Of course, the president has also spent several weeks working to undermine the integrity of the election by raising unfounded questions about mail voting. Combine that rhetoric with an array of ballot issues expected as the coronavirus forces changes into the election system this fall, and it’s not hard to imagine a legitimate constitutional crisis in November.___THE FINAL THOUGHTWe’ve seen over and over that it doesn’t matter much who Trump taps to serve as his campaign manager or chief of staff. One man and one man only is making the big decisions that will decide the president’s political future and the immediate future of the United States.Trump told us he was his own best strategist four years ago, yet many still believed he would put experienced and effective leaders around him to guide his decisions. Four years later, it’s become clear that history will remember the 45th president as a man whose fate was decided almost exclusively by his own instincts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-watch-does-donald-trump-have-a-strategy-to-win-in-november/story-6OXk50mJPOG4qlaOaSpU9O.html
20-07-2020||World||US NSA chief vows to hit back at nations interfering in 2020 elections||One of America’s top spy chiefs vowed that the US will hit back at foreign nations attempting to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, a warning delivered days after fresh charges of Russian hacking against the West.“We’re going to act when we see adversaries attempting to interfere in our elections,” General Paul Nakasone, director of the National Security Agency and head of US Cyber Command, said Monday during a virtual event hosted by the Association of the US Army.NSA efforts to secure the November election include broadening the agency’s interagency partnerships and studying the techniques of US adversaries, Nakasone added.“We’re going to know our adversaries better than they know themselves,” he said.Nakasone’s comments come after reports of Russian hacking once again surfaced last week, with the U.K., U.S. and Canada accusing Russia of attempting to steal international research to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. Britain also accused Russia of attempting to interfere in the country’s general election last year by disseminating documents relating to trade talks with the US Russia rejected the charges.The 2018 US midterm elections demonstrated the country’s enhanced “agility” across government agencies, Nakasone said, adding that the NSA’s capabilities were now “battle-tested.”The cyber chief also addressed the ongoing debate over 5G technology as countries across the world assess the role of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co.“Part of the 5G conversation has been, do nations want to entrust the security of what will likely be the most important platform for their communications to nations that do not share their values?” he asked. “We’re in an era of great power competition. We see it every day in cyberspace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nsa-chief-vows-to-hit-back-at-nations-interfering-in-2020-elections/story-IBxsCb0T6sZDYEWSFMVgwO.html
20-07-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic advances the march of ‘cobots’||While a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Texas has brought many businesses to a screeching halt, eight robots have kept All Axis Machining’s metal fabrication facility in Dallas humming.The small, nimble robots perform multiple jobs, such as machine-tending, sanding, deburring, part inspection and laser marking, leaving owner Gary Kuzmin far less dependent on manual labour. When all the workers on one shift went into self-quarantine last month, it had no impact on the facility’s productivity.All Kuzmin had to do was to move a couple of workers from other shifts to supervise the robots. “I have not lost any spindle time because of the pandemic,” he said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Companies of all sizes are leaning on automation to keep factories running without compromising the health and safety of their workers. Half of the chief financial officers surveyed last month by PricewaterhouseCoopers said they were planning to accelerate automation.With the US economy grappling with a double-digit unemployment rate, however, industry’s rush to robots will fuel worries about semi-skilled or unskilled workers as low-paid, routine tasks become more likely to be automated.“It is the most productive thing for us to have the robots,” said Kuzmin. “I don’t even look at a machine these days without thinking how I would automate it.”Since August 2018, when All Axis Machining began using robots, its productivity has doubled with the same headcount. If not for the robots, the company would have needed to expand its staff of 30 by 50% to keep up with increase in demand.“We are less dependent upon a semi-skilled employee,” said Kuzmin. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The pandemic has changed companies’ calculations about investments in automation, said Jeremie Capron, research chief at research and investment-advisory firm ROBO Global. “The cost of operating without a robot today in a factory is higher than it was pre-COVID,” he said.Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director at Washington-based the Brookings Institution, says the automation drive will result in a net reduction in the workforce as companies invest in technology not just for social distancing, but also to boost productivity and protect profits from the pandemic-induced recession. “Technology has improved and gotten cheaper, and the financial pressure on companies is higher,” he said.He noted, however, that since middle class and lower-paid workers tend to spend a larger share of their income than the higher-paid, it is important that productivity gains eventually result in more jobs.“If there is... too little sharing of the gains of automation-supported growth, we will wind up with little economic activity,” Muro said. Lower cost, faster payback The affordable cost of the so-called collaborative robots, or “cobots,” promises payback in months, making the changeover easier, even for small and medium-sized enterprises. All Axis Machining, for example, spent $85,000 per robot and was able to recover the cost in five months. There are cheaper collaborative robots on the market, as well.One of the most popular cobots sold by Denmark-based Universal Robots - a unit of Massachusetts-based Teradyne Inc. and a market leader in collaborative robotics technology - costs about $35,000, with a payback period of three to four months.The robots are very easy to use, safe to be around and can easily be adapted to new tasks. It takes just hours to train employees to work with them, saving companies huge training expense.Although they are not suited for heavy-duty jobs, they are designed to work alongside humans, making them the robots of choice in the age of social distancing.California-based DCL Logistics, a third-party logistics company, decided to employ cobots to manage a 30% increase in orders in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak.Normally, the company would have hired temporary workers to deal with the surge in orders. But bringing in new workers was fraught with safety risks, said Chief Revenue Officer Brian Tu. The robots have led to a 300% increase in productivity and a 60% jump in labor cost savings, Tu said.DCL plans to deploy more cobots this year at its facilities in California and Kentucky.At All Axis Machining, the cobots have allowed owner Kuzmin to stagger the shifts. The facility now runs three shifts seven days a week, with robots working the late night shift alone, without any roving inspector.This has allowed workers in the facility to stay 30 feet apart from each other. Having seen the benefits, the company is automating its remaining machines as well.Kuzmin, who also runs a robotics services company, says several Dallas-based manufacturers have approached him recently to install similar robots in their factories.Economic uncertainty Universal Robots is fielding inquiries from companies seeking social distancing solutions, as well as tools to re-shore production and make their operations more flexible.“Some companies... are talking about dozens and dozens of robots,” said Joe Campbell, senior manager of applications development at Universal Robots.Still, the virus-induced recession is keeping many companies on the sidelines, wary of making new investments.Tacoma, Washington-based Tool Gauge, which makes metal and plastic parts and assemblies for aerospace companies, including Boeing Co., planned to add two mobile industrial robots to its fleet of two cobots and 10 industrial robots before the novel coronavirus hammered the aviation industry.But Tool Gauge put the robots on hold after a production shutdown at Boeing’s Washington state factories and an overall drop in orders, General Manager Jim Lee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-advances-the-march-of-cobots/story-gBnE98joSA7a2bSj6I4iXK.html
20-07-2020||World||UK’s Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine prompts immune response in early trial||Scientists at Oxford University say their experimental coronavirus vaccine has been shown in an early trial to prompt a protective immune response in hundreds of people who got the shot.British researchers first began testing the vaccine in April in about 1,000 people, half of whom got the experimental vaccine. Such early trials are usually designed only to evaluate safety, but in this case experts were also looking to see what kind of immune response was provoked.In research published Monday in the journal Lancet, scientists said that they found their experimental Covid-19 vaccine produced a dual immune response in people aged 18 to 55 that lasted at least two months after they were immunized.“We are seeing good immune response in almost everybody,” said Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University. “What this vaccine does particularly well is trigger both arms of the immune system,” he said.Hill said that neutralizing antibodies are produced — molecules which are key to blocking infection. In addition, the vaccine also causes a reaction in the body’s T-cells which help to fight off the coronavirus.The experimental Covid-19 vaccine caused minor side effects like fever, chills and muscle pain more often than in those who got a control meningitis vaccine.Hill said that larger trials evaluating the vaccine’s effectiveness, involving about 10,000 people in the U.K. as well as participants in South Africa and Brazil are still underway. Another big trial is slated to start in the U.S. soon, aiming to enroll about 30,000 people.How quickly scientists are able to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness will depend largely on how much more transmission there is, but Hill estimated they might have sufficient data by the end of the year to decide if the vaccine should be adopted for mass vaccination campaigns.He said the vaccine seemed to produce a comparable level of antibodies to those produced by people who recovered from a Covid-19 infection and hoped that the T-cell response would provide extra protection.“There’s increasing evidence that having a T-cell response as well as antibodies could be very important in controlling Covid-19,” Hill said. He suggested the immune response might be boosted after a second dose; their trial tested two doses administered about four weeks apart.Hill said Oxford’s vaccine is designed to reduce disease and transmission. It uses a harmless virus — a chimpanzee cold virus, engineered so it can’t spread — to carry the coronavirus’ spike protein into the body, which should trigger an immune system response.Hill said Oxford has partnered with drugmaker AstraZeneca to produce their vaccine globally, and that the company has already committed to making 2 billion doses.“Even 2 billion doses may not be enough,” he said, underlining the importance of having multiple shots to combat the coronavirus.“There was a hope that if we had a vaccine quickly enough, we could put out the pandemic,” Hill said, noting the continuing surge of infections globally. “I think its going to be very difficult to control this pandemic without a vaccine.”Numerous countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, U.S. and the U.K. have all signed deals to receive hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine — which has not yet been licensed — with the first deliveries scheduled for the fall. British politicians have promised that if the shot proves effective, Britons will be the first to get it.In an accompanying editorial, Naor Bar-Zeev and William Moss of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health called the Oxford results “encouraging” but said further judgment should wait until the vaccine is tested on much bigger populations.Last week, American researchers announced that the first Covid-19 vaccine tested there boosted people’s immune systems just as scientists had hoped and the shots will now enter the final phase of testing. That vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna, produced the molecules key to blocking infection in volunteers who got it, at levels comparable to people who survived a Covid-19 infection.About a dozen different experimental vaccines are in early stages of human testing or poised to start, mostly in China, the U.S. and Europe, with dozens more in earlier stages of development.British officials said Monday they had also signed a deal to buy 90 million doses of experimental Covid-19 vaccines being developed by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and others.In a statement, the British government said it had secured access to a vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, in addition to another experimental vaccine researched by Valneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-prompts-immune-response-in-early-trial/story-mSlgah339RyQYfAt3oYD0N.html

20-07-2020||World||Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is safe, early results show||The vaccine candidate developed at the University of Oxford is safe and induces immune reaction, preliminary results published in medical journal The Lancet on Monday said, raising hopes for a cure for Covid-19 that has killed tens of thousands and disrupted human activity across the globe.The widely-followed trial is currently at an advanced stage, with trials in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. A collaboration has already been reached between Oxford, UK government and biopharma major AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the final results are also positive. The Serum Institute of India is one of the global partners for its production.The journal also reported that phase 2 of a vaccine trial in China has also been found to be safe and induces an immune response. The randomised controlled trial of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored Covid-19 vaccine (Ad5-vectored Covid-19 vaccine) was conducted in China in April and involved more than 500 people.Mene Pangalos of AstraZeneca said: “We are encouraged by the Phase I/II interim data showing AZD1222 was capable of generating a rapid antibody and T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2. While there is more work to be done, today’s data increases our confidence that the vaccine will work and allows us to continue our plans to manufacture the vaccine at scale for broad and equitable access around the world.”ALSO WATCH | Covid update: Bill Gates on Indian pharma; Oxford vaccine hope; curbs tightenedExplaining how the Oxford vaccine works, study lead author Andrew Pollard said: “The new vaccine is a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector (ChAdOx1) vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein”.“It uses a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzees, which has been weakened so that it can’t cause any disease in humans, and is genetically modified to code for the spike protein of the human SARS-CoV-2 virus”.“This means that when the adenovirus enters vaccinated people’s cells it also delivers the spike protein genetic code. This causes these people’s cells to produce the spike protein, and helps teach the immune system to recognise the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”He added: “The immune system has two ways of finding and attacking pathogens – antibody and T cell responses. This vaccine is intended to induce both, so it can attack the virus when it’s circulating in the body, as well as attacking infected cells”.“We hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period. However, we need more research before we can confirm the vaccine effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for how long any protection lasts.”The early stage trial finds that the vaccine is safe, causes few side effects, and induces strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system – provoking a T cell response within 14 days of vaccination (ie, a cellular immune response, it could find and attack cells infected with the virus), and an antibody response with 28 days (ie, humoral immune response, it could find and attack the virus when it was circulating in the blood or lymphatic system).Reacting to the news, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “This is very positive news. A huge well done to our brilliant, world-leading scientists & researchers at the University of Oxford. There are no guarantees, we’re not there yet & further trials will be necessary – but this is an important step in the right direction”.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: “Today’s results are extremely encouraging, taking us one step closer to finding a successful vaccine to protect millions in the UK and across the world. Backed by £84 million Government investment for the vaccine’s development and manufacture, the agility and speed with which the University of Oxford have been working is outstanding. I am very proud of what they have achieved so far.”An ideal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should be effective after one or two vaccinations, work in target populations including older adults and those with other health conditions, confer protection for a minimum of six months, and reduce onward transmission of the virus to contacts.The Lancet said the current trial is too preliminary to confirm whether the new vaccine meets these requirements, but phase 2 (in the UK only) and phase 3 trials to confirm whether it effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection are happening in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.The new trial included 1,077 healthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of Covid-19, and took place in five UK hospitals between April 23 and May 21, 2020. The data included in the paper covered the first 56 days of the trial and is ongoing.The participants either received the new Covid-19 vaccine (543 people) or the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (534 people). 113 participants (56 given the Covid vaccine, and 57 in the control group) were also asked to take paracetamol before and for 24 hours after their vaccination to help reduce vaccine-associated reactions (as the Covid-19 vaccine was given in a high dose to help induce a strong immune response).All participants gave additional blood samples and underwent clinical assessments to determine if the vaccine was safe and whether it provoked an immune response. Participants were also asked to record any adverse events throughout the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-s-initial-results-show-it-is-safe/story-SO1USJvXyCi3hVWp0h4g4L.html

Offices of both the Home Affairs and Attorney-General are discussing TikTok’s operations, the sources said.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government was “having a good look” at TikTok, which has also fallen under US scrutiny for “national security risks”.Also read: TikTok considers London and other locations for headquarters“If we consider there is a need to take further action than we are taking now, then I can tell you we won’t be shy about it,” Morrison told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday.Separately, Labor Senator Jenny McAllister, the chairwoman of a parliamentary inquiry into foreign interference through social media, has identified TikTok as needing further scrutiny, noting 1.6 million young Australians used the app.“Some of these approaches to moderating content might be inconsistent with Australian values,” she told ABC radio.“For example, removing material about Tiananmen Square, or deprioritising material about Hong Kong protests,” she added, referring to student protests in Beijing in 1989 and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong over the past year.Also read: Decision on TikTok, other Chinese apps within weeks, not months: White HouseTwo of the three directors of the new Australian TikTok operation are senior executives of Chinese parent company ByteDance, company records seen by Reuters show.TikTok Australia general manager Lee Hunter, who was recruited from Google in June, has written to Australian politicians saying TikTok was “being used as a political football”.It was “critical you understand that we are independent and not aligned with any government, political party or ideology”, the letter said, adding TikTok Australia’s data was stored securely in Singapore and the United States.Last week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern appeared with an impersonator in a video posted on the highly popular social media app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-under-australia-scanner-over-security-data-concerns/story-MRRFdIzSbekxMlOuCFBrBN.html
20-07-2020||World||Awaiting trials success, UK seals early access to 3 Covid-19 vaccine candidates||Britain’s business secretary Alok Sharma on Monday announced that the UK would get early access to 90 million doses of three promising Covid-19 vaccine candidates, including the one developed at the University of Oxford, whose initial results are due to be released later.The three vaccine classes that the Boris Johnson government has secured through partnerships are: adenoviral vaccines (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca); mRNA vaccines (BioNTech/Pfizer, Imperial College London) and the inactivated whole virus vaccines (Valneva).The United Kingdom is the worst affected country in Europe, with at least 45,300 deaths and nearly 3 lakh cases.Sharma said: “The hunt to find a vaccine is a truly global endeavour and we are doing everything we can to ensure the British public get access to a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible”.“This new partnership with some of the world’s foremost pharmaceutical and vaccine companies will ensure the UK has the best chance possible of securing a vaccine that protects those most at risk”, he added.Monday’s announcement follows an existing global licensing agreement signed with AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford to research, develop and manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine for the UK public. AstraZeneca will work to produce 100 million doses for the UK in total.As part of a wider £131 million investment by the government, support has also been given to Imperial College London to develop their vaccine candidate, which started human studies in June.Officials said the UK government has committed £250 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations – the biggest investment of any country - to support equitable and affordable access to new coronavirus vaccines and treatments around the world.The government on Monday also launched the NHS Covid-19 vaccine research registry to enlist volunteers for future vaccine studies. To enable large-scale vaccine studies to take place across the UK, the aim is to get 500,000 people signed up by October.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “A safe and effective vaccine is our best hope of defeating coronavirus and returning to life as normal”.“We have some of our best scientists and researchers working on this, but members of the public have a vital role to play too. So I urge everyone who can to back the national effort and sign up to the NHS Covid-19 vaccine research registry to help find a vaccine as soon as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/awaiting-trials-success-uk-seals-early-access-to-3-vaccine-candidates/story-gPXLhSjBu3aZut9Wdh08jM.html
20-07-2020||World||UK firm declares positive results from Covid-19 protein treatment||A UK-based biotech company on Monday declared positive “breakthrough” results from a clinical trial of a protein-based treatment for Covid-19, which “greatly” reduced patients requiring intensive care.Synairgen said its SNG001 formulation uses a protein called interferon beta, which the body produces when it gets a viral infection, and is inhaled directly into the lungs of patients with coronavirus, using a nebuliser, in the hope that it will stimulate an immune response.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here “This assessment of SNG001 in COVID-19 patients could signal a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients,” said Richard Marsden, CEO of Synairgen, a respiratory drug discovery and development company which originated from research at the University of Southampton.“We are all delighted with the trial results announced today, which showed that SNG001 greatly reduced the number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients who progressed from ‘requiring oxygen’ to ‘requiring ventilation’. It also showed that patients who received SNG001 were at least twice as likely to recover to the point where their everyday activities were not compromised through having been infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19),” he said.In addition, SNG001 significantly reduced breathlessness, one of the main symptoms of severe Covid-19, the company said, which is now focused on working with the regulators and other key groups to progress the potential Covid-19 treatment as rapidly as possible.Also read: Mylan launches Remdesivir’s generic version ‘Desrem’ in India for Covid-19 patientsThe trials showed that the average time coronavirus patients spent in hospital was reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug – down from an average of nine days to six days.The double-blind trial involved 101 volunteers who had been admitted for treatment at nine UK hospitals for Covid-19 infections. Half of the participants were given the drug, the other half got placebo – an inactive substance.The results, published by the company under its stock market obligations, have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal as yet.“The results confirm our belief that interferon beta, a widely known drug that, by injection, has been approved for use in a number of other indications, has huge potential as an inhaled drug to be able to restore the lungs’ immune response, enhancing protection, accelerating recovery and countering the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus,” said Professor Tom Wilkinson, Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the University of Southampton and Trial Chief Investigator.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Professor Stephen Holgate, Medical Research Council Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton and Co-Founder of Synairgen, added, “recognising that SARS-CoV-2 is known to have evolved to evade the initial antiviral response of the lung, our inhaled treatment of giving high local concentrations of interferon beta, a naturally occurring antiviral protein, restores the lung’s ability to neutralise the virus, or any mutation of the virus or co-infection with another respiratory virus such as influenza or RSV, as could be encountered in the winter if there is a resurgence of COVID-19.” Synairgen’s drug trial was the template for the Accord programme, a fast-track clinical trial scheme set up by the UK government in April to accelerate the development of new drugs for patients with Covid-19.The team believes the drug could be even more effective at the early stages of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-firm-declares-positive-results-from-covid-19-protein-treatment/story-4vVfeM4D4j14aqv4UEN8kK.html
20-07-2020||World||France has 400-500 coronavirus clusters but no ‘second wave’ yet: Health Minister||French authorities have reported 400 to 500 active coronavirus outbreak clusters but there are no signs of an imminent “second wave,” Health Minister Olivier Veran said Monday.Many of the current virus clusters involve abattoirs or other contained professional settings such as old age homes, he said.Others had resulted from family reunions during the summer holidays.“At this point we are very far from a second wave,” Veran told Franceinfo radio, as face masks were made mandatory in all enclosed public spaces including shops, covered markets and administrative buildings.“The goal is not to worry people excessively, but to keep them on their guard,” he said.Nationwide the “R” number indicating the viral transmission rate now stands at 1.2, meaning 10 infected people will infect an additional 12 on average, according to the Sante Publique France health agency.But in some areas on the French mainland, the rate is much higher, with the southern Mediterranean region including Marseille and Nice now reporting a rate of 1.55.Brittany in western France stood at 2.6 percent -- meaning 10 infected people could infect on average 26 more people.If the “worrying trends” continue the government will again consider regional lockdowns or even new nationwide confinement orders, Veran said, adding: “All options are on the table.”People without face masks in public spaces risk fines of 135 euros ($155), but “we’re not going to start handing out fines for people reuniting with their families!” he added.Asked if France had enough masks to go around, having been caught woefully short when the outbreak gained speed in March, Veran said he was focusing on ensuring there were stocks in vacation hotspots as well as the Paris region.The government aims to have a stockpile of 60 million face masks by October, compared with just 3.5 million when the outbreak began.France has been one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, with a coronavirus death toll of over 30,150 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-has-400-500-coronavirus-clusters-but-no-second-wave-yet-health-minister/story-6AHUC0M59cdliPsZqG6XEJ.html

Vaccines. Just saying,” Richard Horton tweeted on Sunday. Tomorrow. Vaccines. Just saying. Looking forward to the results of the Oxford #covid19 vaccine study tomorrow. @AstraZeneca https://t.co/aifjy1y5ftGlobally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is tracking around 140 candidates vaccines, of which around two dozen are in various phases of human clinical trials.Chinese company Sinovac Biotech is moving into phase III trials in Brazil while University of Oxford/AstraZeneca is in a combine phase II/III trial in the UK and has recently gone into phase III trials in South Africa and Brazil.Among other leading players, German firm BioNTech is collaborating with pharma major Pfizer to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. The companies have received fast track designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for two investigational vaccine candidates being developed to help protect against SarS-CoV-2. Vaccines typically provide the immune system with harmless copies of an antigen: A portion of the surface of a bacterium or virus that the immune system recognises as foreign. A vaccine may also provide a non-active version of a toxin - a poison produced by a bacterium - so that the body can devise a defence against it.They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.Vaccine testing is a four-stage process - pre-clinical testing on animals, phase I clinical testing on a small group of people to determine its safety and to learn more about the immune response it provokes, phase II trials are expanded safety trials, and phase III testing is done by administering it to thousands of people to confirm its efficacy.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-results-to-be-out-today-lancet-editor-s-tweet-creates-buzz/story-YxA09d0svj82Urz9Iz3zKM.html

20-07-2020||World||Marathon EU summit breaks up after all-night talks, to resume later||A marathon European Union summit has broken up temporarily after four-days of acrimonious haggling over an unprecedented 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.1 trillion) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund to tackle the crisis. The weary leaders were scheduled to resume the meeting in the afternoon.The summit of the 27 EU leaders began Friday and was scheduled to end on Saturday. Instead deep ideological differences between leaders forced the talks into Sunday and then through the night to Monday morning.The bitter negotiations pitted a group of five wealthy northern countries - the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland - against southern nations hardest hit by the pandemic, supported by European heavyweights Germany and France.Leaders did not comment as they left the summit venue early Monday.Seeking to tug at the hearts of all European Union leaders, EU Council president Charles Michel implored them late Sunday to overcome their fundamental divisions and agree on an unprecedented 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.1 trillion) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund to tackle the crisis.After three days of fruitless talks, Michel conjured up during an official dinner the vision of the 600,000 dead that COVID-19 has claimed around the world and the unprecedented recession it has wrought on the bloc.“Are the 27 EU leaders capable of building European unity and trust or, because of a deep rift, will we present ourselves as a weak Europe, undermined by distrust,” he asked the leaders at the end of another day of divisive negotiations. The text of the behind-closed-doors speech was obtained by The Associated Press.“I wish that we succeed in getting a deal and that the European media can headline tomorrow that the EU succeeded in a Mission Impossible,” Michel said.Early on the fourth day of talks - the summit was meant to last only two - the leaders still had not reached a compromise. As dawn broke Monday in Brussels, they were still in the marathon summit after haggling through the night over the size and terms of the recovery fund.Even with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron negotiating as the closest of partners, the traditionally powerful Franco-German alliance could not get the bloc’s 27 quarrelling nations in line.Often negotiating outdoors on a sundeck in the Europa summit centre in Brussels, the blue skies and fresh breeze had no impact on the mood. Undiplomatic terms like “hate” and “grumpy” have been thrown around between leaders during marathon negotiations that should have drawn everyone closer together to fight a historic recession in the bloc.“Whether there will be a solution, I still can’t say,” Merkel said.The pandemic has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing around 135,000 of its citizens and sending its economy into an estimated contraction of 8.3% this year.The bloc’s executive has proposed a 750 billion-euro coronavirus fund, partly based on common borrowing, to be sent as loans and grants to the countries hit hardest by the pandemic. That comes on top of the seven-year 1 trillion-euro EU budget that leaders have been haggling over for months even before the pandemic hit.All nations agree they need to band together but five richer countries in the north, led by the Netherlands, want strict controls on spending, while struggling southern nations like Spain and Italy say those conditions should be kept to a minimum.At their dinner table Sunday night, the leaders could mull a proposal from the five wealthy northern nations that suggested a coronavirus recovery fund with 350 million euros of grants and the same amount again in loans. The five EU nations nicknamed “the frugals” - the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark - had long opposed any grants at all.Merkel and Macron walked out of heated talks before dawn Sunday with the frugals, bemoaning their lack of commitment to a common cause. “They ran off in a bad mood,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.Rutte has long been known as a European bridge builder, but this weekend his tough negotiating stance is being blamed for holding up a deal. He and his allies are pushing for labor market and pension reforms to be linked to EU handouts and a “brake” enabling EU nations to monitor and, if necessary, halt projects that are being paid for by the recovery fund.“He can’t ask us to do specific reforms,” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. “Once (the aid) is approved, each country will present its proposals.” Another member of the frugals, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, said he still believed a deal was possible, but there is a “long way to go,” the Austria Press Agency cited Kurz as saying.Rutte also wants a link to be made between the handout of EU funds and the rule of law - a connection aimed at Poland and Hungary, countries with right-wing populist governments that many in the EU think are sliding away from democratic rule.That drew a harsh response from hardline Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.“I don’t know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary, but he’s attacking so harshly and making very clear that because Hungary, in his opinion, does not respect the rule of law, (it) must be punished financially,” Orban said.Macron said leaders need to compromise but still respect the underlying principles and goals of the EU.“It is still possible, but these compromises, I say very clearly, will not be made at the cost of European ambition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/marathon-eu-summit-breaks-up-after-all-night-talks-to-resume-later/story-6iQ2oej8affa1RSfrXZO6O.html

The companies plan to seek approval as early as October and could produce as many as 100 million doses by the end of this year.The UK described the order as that alliance’s first binding agreement with any government. The US has been supporting Pfizer and BioNTech’s efforts through its $10 billion Operation Warp Speed research program. The vaccine uses a novel technology called mRNA.Valneva agreed to supply 60 million doses of a shot it’s developing. The UK previously struck a supply agreement for a vaccine being tested by AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford.The UK also said Monday it ordered treatments containing antibodies that neutralize Covid-19 from AstraZeneca.Valneva, a French drugmaker, will supply a further 40 million doses if its vaccine is found to be safe, effective and suitable, the U.K. said. The company is producing the vaccine at a factory in Livingston, Scotland. Valneva said it expects the government to help fund clinical studies and it’s negotiating funding to expand the Livingston facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-orders-90-million-vaccine-doses-from-pfizer-valneva/story-C2HLRAOtMqWeYTkkdHU79K.html
20-07-2020||World||Donald Trump refusing to commit to accept results of upcoming election||President Donald Trump is refusing to publicly commit to accepting the results of the upcoming White House election, recalling a similar threat he made weeks before the 2016 vote, as he scoffs at polls showing him lagging behind Democrat Joe Biden. Trump says it’s too early to make such an ironclad guarantee.“I have to see. Look ... I have to see,” Trump told moderator Chris Wallace during a wide-ranging interview on ”Fox News Sunday.” “No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say no, and I didn’t last time either.”The Biden campaign responded: “The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”Trump also hammered the Pentagon brass for favoring renaming bases that honor Confederate military leaders — a drive for change spurred by the national debate about race after George Floyd’s death. “I don’t care what the military says,” the commander in chief said.The president described the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, as a “a little bit of an alarmist” about the coronavirus pandemic, and Trump stuck to what he had said back in February — that the virus is “going to disappear.” On Fox, he said, “I’ll be right eventually.” The United States tops the global death toll list with over 140,000 and confirmed infections, with 3.7 million.It is remarkable that a sitting president would express less than complete confidence in the American democracy’s electoral process. But for Trump, it comes from his insurgent playbook of four years ago, when in the closing stages of his race against Hillary Clinton, he said he would not commit to honoring the election results if the Democrat won.Pressed during an October 2016 debate about whether he would abide by the voters’ will, Trump responded that he would “keep you in suspense.” The president’s remarks to Fox are certain to fuel conversation on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers had already been airing concerns in private about a scenario in which Trump disputes the election results.Trump has seen his presidential popularity erode over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and in the aftermath of nationwide protests centered on racial injustice that erupted after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis nearly two months.Trump contends that a series of polls that show his popularity eroding and Biden holding an advantage are faulty. He believes Republican voters are underrepresented in such surveys.“First of all, I’m not losing, because those are fake polls,” Trump said in the taped interview, which aired Sunday. “They were fake in 2016 and now they’re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016.”Trump was frequently combative with Wallace in defending his administration’s response to the pandemic, weighing in on the Black Lives Matter movement and trying to portray Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, as lacking the mental prowess to serve as president.Among the issues discussed was the push for wholesale changes in policing that has swept across the nation. Trump said he could understand why Black Americans are upset about how police use force disproportionately against them.“Of course I do. Of course I do,” the president said, adding his usual refrain that “whites are also killed, too.”He said he was “not offended either by Black Lives Matter,” but at the same time defended the Confederate flag, a symbol of the racism of the past, and said those who “proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism.”“They love their flag, it represents the South, they like the South. That’s freedom of speech. And you know, the whole thing with ‘cancel culture,’ we can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that, otherwise we’ll end up fighting again. You can’t just cancel all,” Trump said.Wallace challenged Trump on some of his claims and called out the president at time, such as when Trump falsely asserted that “Biden wants to defund the police.” The former vice president has not joined with activists rallying behind that banner. He has proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.Trump continues to insist that Biden “signed a charter” with one of his primary rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. At one point in the interview, Trump calls on aides to bring him documentation to support his assertion. Trump, however, is unable to point to language from a Biden-Sanders task force policy document released this month by the Biden campaign.Trump stood behind his pledge to veto a $740 billion defense bill over a requirement that the Defense Department change the names of bases named for Confederate military leaders. That list includes Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia.The president argued there were no viable alternatives if the government ever tried. “We’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton?” Trump asked, referring to a prominent civil rights leader. “What are you going to name it?”Trump, 74, stuck to a campaign charge that Biden, 77, is unable to handle the rigors of the White House because of his age. As for polls showing the incumbent is trailing, Trump noted he was thought to be behind for much of the 2016 contest. “I won’t lose,” he predicted.The president and top advisers have long accused Biden of using the pandemic as an excuse to stay in “his basement” in his Delaware home. Biden has indeed shifted much of his campaign online, but frequently travels in Delaware and Pennsylvania, organizing speeches and small gatherings with voters and community leaders that are within driving distance of his home. Biden’s campaign says it will begin resuming normal travel and campaign activities, but only when health officials and state and local authorities say it is safe.Questioned about the coronavirus, Trump chided Fauci, the National Institutes of Health expert, and repeated false claims that anybody could get a test and that increased testing was the only reason that the U.S. was seeing more cases. When Wallace cited criticism about the lack of a national plan to confront the virus, Trump said, “I take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job, too,” and claimed, “I supplied everybody.”Case are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down. The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus has been on the rise across nearly the entire country.___Associated Press writers Hope Yen and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-refusing-to-commit-to-accept-results-of-upcoming-election/story-UdZR92qOfDE7XR1Zo8AVfK.html
20-07-2020||World||Astrophysicists unveil biggest-ever 3D map of Universe||Astrophysicists on Monday published the largest-ever 3D map of the Universe, the result of an analysis of more than four million galaxies and ultra-bright, energy-packed quasars.The efforts of hundreds of scientists from around 30 institutions worldwide have yielded a “complete story of the expansion of the universe”, said Will Percival of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.In the project launched more than two decades ago, the researchers made “the most accurate expansion history measurements over the widest-ever range of cosmic time”, he said in a statement.The map relies on the latest observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), titled the “extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey” (eBOSS), with data collected from an optical telescope in New Mexico over six years.The infant Universe following the Big Bang is relatively well known through extensive theoretical models and observation of cosmic microwave background -- the electromagnetic radiation of the nascent cosmos.Studies of galaxies and distance measurements also contributed to a better understanding of the Universe’s expansion over billions of years.‘Troublesome gap’But Kyle Dawson of the University of Utah, who unveiled the map on Monday, said the researchers tackled a “troublesome gap in the middle 11 billion years”.Through “five years of continuous observations, we have worked to fill in that gap, and we are using that information to provide some of the most substantial advances in cosmology in the last decade,” he said.Astrophysicist Jean-Paul Kneib of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, who initiated eBOSS in 2012, said the goal was to produce “the most complete 3D map of the Universe throughout the lifetime of the Universe”.For the first time, the researchers drew on “celestial objects that indicate the distribution of matter in the distant Universe, galaxies that actively form stars and quasars”.The map shows filaments of matter and voids that more precisely define the structure of the Universe since its beginnings, when it was only 380,000 years old. For the part of the map relating to the Universe six billion years ago, researchers observed the oldest and reddest galaxies.For more distant eras, they concentrated on the youngest galaxies -- the blue ones. To go back even further, they used quasars, galaxies whose supermassive black hole is extremely luminous.The map reveals that the expansion of the Universe began to accelerate at some point and has since continued to do so.The researchers said this seems to be due to the presence of dark energy, an invisible element that fits into Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity but whose origin is not yet understood.Astrophysicists have known for years that the Universe is expanding, but have been unable to measure the rate of expansion with precision.Comparisons of the eBOSS observations with previous studies of the early universe have revealed discrepancies in estimates of the rate of expansion.The currently accepted rate, called the “Hubble constant”, is 10 percent slower than the value calculated from the distances between the galaxies closest to us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrophysicists-unveil-biggest-ever-3d-map-of-universe/story-iuOHBUIi98MRLgKNJ0gtqL.html
20-07-2020||World||84-year-old Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz hospitalised||Saudi Arabia’s 84-year-old ruler, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, has been admitted to hospital in the capital Riyadh, suffering from inflammation of the gall bladder, state news agency SPA said on Monday.The king, who has ruled the world’s largest oil exporter and close U.S. ally since 2015, was undergoing medical checks, the agency added, without giving details.King Salman, the custodian of Islam’s holiest sites, spent more than 2-1/2 years as the Saudi crown prince and deputy premier from June 2012 before becoming king. He also served as governor of the Riyadh region for more than 50 years.The defacto ruler and next in line to the throne is the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, widely known by his initials MBS, who has launched reforms to transform the kingdom’s economy and end its “addiction” to oil.The 34-year-old prince, who is popular among young Saudis, has won praise at home for easing social restrictions in the conservative Muslim kingdom, giving more rights to women and pledging to diversify the economy. To the king’s supporters, this boldness at home and abroad was a welcome change after decades of caution, stagnation and dithering. But state control of the media and a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom make it difficult to gauge the extent of domestic enthusiasm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-king-salman-84-admitted-to-hospital/story-Qb9Bdo6ek6rdOYZ7vQQP3N.html

According to Namibian prosecutors, in May 2008, three suspects allegedly received $12.8 million in kickbacks to help Nuctech secure a $55-million X-ray scanner contract, the Times reported.Critics of state-owned enterprises alleged that the Chinese government subsidises its companies to allow them to bid at lower prices than Western competitors.Meanwhile, in Europe, some analysts are complaining that Nuctech is making rapid inroads providing services to border security facilities due to China’s state-backing, unfair practices, and potentially Beijing’s influence over some European politicians.Carleton University professor Stephanie Carvin, a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service official, said the Nuctech contract for Canadian embassies presents security concerns, but she believes China’s “geo-economic” strategy is the bigger concern.“This is not Huawei. I am not as concerned as I would be with telecommunications,” Carvin said.“The issue is the fact companies like Nuctech are inherently anti-competitive, they may in some cases be beneficiaries of stolen technologies, and they want to fundamentally take over and undermine western technologies,” Carvin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-promises-review-of-6-8-million-worth-security-equipment-purchased-from-chinese-govt-owned-firm/story-myeCmLZAPtWFD4xhsCkxZL.html
20-07-2020||World||Indian-Americans hold protest in front of Chinese embassy in Washington||A group of Indian-Americans from in and around the national capital has held a peaceful demonstration in front of the Chinese embassy here, protesting against China’s aggression along the Line of Actual Control. Displaying anti-China banners and shouting slogans like “China Communist: Down Down”, the protesters on Sunday said that “the Chinese virus has killed lakhs of people across the world and has brought the global economy to a standstill”. Community activist Manoj Sreenilayam said: “We condemn the unprovoked Chinese aggression, landgrab and killing of Indians on Indian territory in Ladakh, while the world is distracted with the Covid-19 pandemic”. For the past several decades, China has been bullying India and other smaller nations, said another activist Mahindra Sapa. “In the South China Sea, China has been illegally capturing land and islands of smaller nations. It has killed 20 Indian soldiers. We are here to raise awareness and urge the world to do horizontal escalation and economically decouple from China,” Sapa said. The peaceful protest represented a cross-section of the Indian-American cultural and social organisations from Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC. Prominent among them being Kerala association of Greater Washington, Durga Temple friends, Tamil cultural groups and Indian cultural Associations of Howard County, National Council of Asian Indian Associations and Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America. Recently formed New York-based Oppose Chinese Imperialism (OCI) Group 23 also sent its representatives to participate in the protest. “We are here to protest against the Chinese aggression on the Indian land and territories of the neighbouring countries,” said Sanjay Patel. In recent weeks, Indian-Americans in major US cities have held peaceful protests against China. The first of those was held in Chicago by eminent Indian-American Dr Bharat Barai at New York’s Times Square where members of the Tibetan community also demonstrated against China. Another group led by Prem Bhandari in New York recently formed OCI Group 23 to mobilise people in the 23 countries with whom China has territorial disputes. The group last week held a webinar on the Chinese imperialism addressed by India’s former ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale and former Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman D R Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-hold-protest-in-front-of-chinese-embassy-in-washington/story-CI7ZtTE2MpB30MhHs8TGBK.html

Despite record levels of new cases nationwide, the Trump administration is pushing for school to reopen in a few weeks and resisting a federal mandate to wear masks in public. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump defended his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in an interview broadcast on Sunday, including his statement that there were only embers of the virus popping up around the country. The United States, with 3.7 million total cases, has almost as many infections as the next three hardest-hit countries combined - Brazil, India and Russia.“We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but it’s - it’s going to be under control.” Trump on “Fox News Sunday” repeated his assertion that the virus will eventually disappear. “I’ll be right eventually,” he said. “It’s going to disappear and I’ll be right.” Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned cases and deaths could rise this autumn and winter. Nearly all 20 forecasting models used by the CDC project rising deaths in the coming weeks.Throughout the United States, every metric to measure the outbreak is going in the wrong direction - rising cases, deaths, hospitalizations and positivity rates of test results. At least 14 states have reported record coronavirus hospitalizations so far in July, including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Texas.Trump said he did not agree with CDC Director Robert Redfield that this fall and winter will be one of the most difficult times in American public health, as hospitals deal with the seasonal flu on top of Covid cases. “I don’t know and I don’t think he knows,” Trump said.Trump also called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases expert, “a little bit of an alarmist.” Fauci has warned that cases could soon top 100,000 a day if Americans do not come together to take steps necessary to halt the spread of the virus. The country is averaging 60,000 new cases a day and reported a record one-day increase of 77,299 on Thursday.Testing shortages and delayed results in some states are hampering efforts to curb the outbreak, similar to situations that frustrated state officials and health experts at the start of the pandemic in March and April. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that people were waiting up to a week to learn if they tested positive.“The average test delay is too long,” said Collins. “That really undercuts the value of the testing.”Instead of expanding testing, the Trump administration wants to block $25 billion for states to conduct testing and contact tracing, according to reports in The Washington Post and the New York Times. The White House declined on Sunday to comment to Reuters on those reports.The number of Covid tests performed each day has doubled since late May but remains lower than recommended by some health experts. The United States set a record on Friday with over 850,000 tests performed, according to data from the Covid-Tracking Project https://Covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-daily-tests.

20-07-2020||World||United Arab Emirates launches space mission to Mars from Japan, calls it ‘Hope’||The first Arab space mission to Mars blasted off Monday aboard a rocket from Japan, after weather delays set back the launch of the probe dubbed “Hope.”A live feed of the launch showed the rocket carrying the unmanned probe, known as “Al-Amal” in Arabic, lifting off from the Tanegashima Space Centre in southern Japan.“We have launched the H-IIA Launch Vehicle No. 42 (H-IIA F42) carrying aboard the Emirates Mars Mission’s (EMM) HOPE spacecraft... at 6:58:14 (JST) (2158GMT),” rocket manufacturer Mitsubishi Heavy Industries said in a statement shortly after the launch.Five minutes after launch, the rocket carrying the probe was on course, carrying out the first separation of its flight.The Emirati project is one of three racing to Mars, including Tianwen-1 from China and Mars 2020 from the United States, taking advantage of a period when the Earth and Mars are nearest.In October, Mars will be a comparatively short 38.6 million miles (62.07 million kilometers) from Earth, according to NASA.“Hope” is expected to reach Mars’s orbit by February 2021, marking the 50th anniversary of the unification of the UAE, an alliance of seven emirates. Once there, it will loop the planet for a whole Martian year, or 687 days.While the objective of the Mars mission is to provide a comprehensive image of the weather dynamics in the Red Planet’s atmosphere, the probe is a foundation for a much bigger goal -- building a human settlement on Mars within the next 100 years.The UAE also wants the project to serve as a source of inspiration for Arab youth, in a region too often wracked by sectarian conflicts and economic crises.Several dozen probes -- most of them American -- have set off for the Red Planet since the 1960s. Many never made it that far, or failed to land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-arab-emirates-launches-space-mission-to-mars-from-japan-calls-it-hope/story-khjJtnsX0EaMR6MMYPsqRP.html
20-07-2020||World||FDA approves Quest Covid-19 test for ‘pooled’ sample use||The Food and Drug Administration has given emergency approval to a new approach to coronavirus testing that combines test samples in batches instead of running them one by one, speeding up the process.The FDA said Saturday that it reissued an emergency use authorization to Quest Diagnostics to use its Covid-19 test with pooled samples. It is the first test to be authorized to be used in this way.With pooling, instead of running each person’s test individually, laboratories would combine parts of samples from several people and test them together. A negative result would clear everyone in the batch. A positive result would require each sample to be individually retested. Pooling works best with lab-run tests, which take hours — not the much quicker individual tests used in clinics or doctor’s offices.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The potential benefits of sample pooling include stretching laboratory supplies further, reducing costs and expanding testing to millions more Americans who may unknowingly be spreading the virus. Health officials think infected people who aren’t showing symptoms are largely responsible for the rising number of cases in more than half the country. The approach might enable mass testing at schools or businesses, though it’s unclear when that could happen.“It’s a really good tool. It can be used in any of a number of circumstances, including at the community level or even in schools,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, told a Senate hearing last month.Pooling is not always be the best option. It won’t save time or resources when used in a Covid-19 hot spot such as a nursing home outbreak. That’s because the logistical and financial benefits of pooling only add up when a small number of pools test positive.Experts generally recommend the technique when fewer than 10% of people are expected to test positive. For example, pooling would not be cost-effective in Arizona, where a surge has pushed positive test results to well over 10%. But the approach could make sense in areas with a lower rate of positive results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-approves-quest-covid-19-test-for-pooled-sample-use/story-386oQskj0anPlx2gxzAHQL.html

A later statement said Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmad Al Sabah had assumed some of Sheikh Sabah’s powers temporarily, without explaining why that was necessary.However, the visit comes as the tiny nation fights the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen over 58,000 cases and 400 deaths in the country of 4.1 million. Its Health Ministry says over 49,000 people have recovered from the virus and the Covid-19 illness it causes.In August 2019, Kuwait acknowledged the emir suffered an unspecified medical “setback” that required him to be hospitalized. That came after visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter that he was “praying for Emir’s speedy recovery,” without elaborating.Sheikh Sabah has ruled Kuwait since January 2006. He’s pushed for diplomacy to solve regional issues, such as the ongoing boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations, and hosted major donor conferences for war-torn nations like Iraq and Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-s-ruler-hospitalised-crown-prince-steps-in/story-1SuReIogAAeowHWR5ulBYJ.html
