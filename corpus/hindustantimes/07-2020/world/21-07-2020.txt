First, he tried to put a citizenship question on the census but got blocked by the Supreme Court. Now he’s back at it with an unconstitutional order that has no purpose other than to silence and disempower Latino voices and communities of color.”The Census Bureau said last month that more than 90 million households had already responded to the 2020 Census with the majority doing it online. People can still respond on their own online, over the phone or by mail — all without having to meet a census taker. Only this week, door-knockers started heading out to households in six areas whose residents hadn’t yet answered the questionnaire.Opponents of the citizenship question said it would discourage participation by immigrants and residents who are in the country illegally, resulting in inaccurate figures for a count that determines the distribution of some $675 billion in federal spending and how many congressional districts each state gets.Trump’s efforts to add the citizenship question had drawn fury and backlash from critics who alleged that it was intended to discourage participation in the survey, not only by people living in the country illegally but also by citizens who fear that participating would expose noncitizen family members to repercussions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-excluding-those-in-us-illegally-from-reapportionment/story-SqvSIcgB1h9E8QFvINquwJ.html
21-07-2020||World||WHO warns new Ebola outbreak in Congo faces funding gap||The World Health Organization said Tuesday it is facing a “serious funding gap” to battle the new outbreak of Ebola in remote corners of northern Congo amid the global Covid-19 pandemic.The $1.75 million raised so far will only last for a few more weeks, the WHO warned, adding that the response effort is particularly expensive because of how difficult it is to get health teams and supplies into the densely forested area.Already there have been 24 deaths since the outbreak was declared on June 1. The emergence of Ebola in Congo’s northern Equateur province came just as the world’s second deadliest Ebola outbreak was nearing its end.“The response to Ebola in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic is complex, but we must not allow Covid-19 to distract us from tackling other urgent health threats,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa.The funding shortage threatens to unravel early gains in this epidemic. When Equateur province last had Ebola cases in 2018, it took health officials two weeks to start vaccinating people. This time around, vaccination teams were mobilized within four days of the outbreak declaration, Moeti said.No licensed vaccine existed when Ebola killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa between 2014-2016. After Ebola cases emerged in eastern Congo in August 2018, health teams eventually were able to combat the disease with two different vaccines.Still, misinformation about those vaccines flourished in a region long wracked by armed militias. Communities fearful of outsiders in some cases refused to allow health teams in, allowing the virus to spread.At least 2,280 people died of Ebola over the nearly two-year span of the epidemic in eastern Congo before it ended on June 25.Previous outbreaks in northern Congo have been more limited — the 2018 one killed 33 people before it was brought under control within months.Congolese health officials have determined through genetic sequencing that the new outbreak in the north is unrelated to the epidemic in the east,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-new-ebola-outbreak-in-congo-faces-funding-gap/story-A9tKS3g91EiDPSqwXShKaI.html
21-07-2020||World||Mike Pompeo urges ‘entire world’ to stand up to China||US secretary of state Mike Pompeo urged “the entire world” Tuesday to stand up to China but denied forcing Britain’s hand in its decision to ban the communist superpower’s private telecoms giant Huawei.Pompeo met prime minister Boris Johnson in the heat of an emerging crisis in relations between London and Beijing over everything from China’s treatment of Hong Kong to its persecution of more than one million ethnic Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities.The top US diplomat used a press conference with his UK opposite number Dominic Raab to air a host of grievances President Donald Trump’s administration had built up against Beijing.He accused China of engaging in “a cover-up and co-opting” the World Health Organization by allegedly suppressing early details of the “preventable” coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 610,000 people globally.The Chinese Community Party’s “exploitation of this disaster to further its own interest has been disgraceful”, he said.Pompeo also castigated China for claiming disputed areas of the South China Sea “you have no lawful claim to” and trying to “threaten and bully” its neighbours.“We think that the entire world needs to work together to ensure that every country, including China, behaves in the international system in ways that are appropriate and consistent with the international order,” he said.‘Right thing to do’Pompeo’s last visit to London in January came just days after Johnson ignored Washington’s warnings and allowed Huawei to take a leading role in building Britain’s next-generation mobile data network.This trip was announced just a day after Johnson last week decided to risk drawing the wrath of China and phasing out Huawei from the speedy new system.The Chinese foreign ministry responded by accusing Britain of becoming “America’s dupe”.But Pompeo and Raab both tried to dispel suggestions the White House was dictating British affairs.“I think that decision was made not because the United States said it was a good decision but because the leadership here in the United Kingdom concluded (that it was) the right thing to do,” Pompeo said.Johnson is keen to avoid being too closely associated with Trump -- whose approval in Britain is languishing at around 20 percent -- despite the “special relationship” between the two historical allies.The UK government stresses it only ditched Huawei after new US sanctions imposed in May endangered the safety of future 5G equipment produced in China.“The reality is it is a result of US sanctions,” Raab said.Washington argues that the Chinese Community Party can force Huawei to either intercept UK data or shut down the British network in times of war.Huawei has always denied this and Britain had previously concluded that it could mitigate any security flaws.‘Golden decade’But the range of steps taken by Johnson in the past month threaten to bring an early end to a “golden decade” in cooperation that former British finance minister George Osborne promised on a visit to Beijing in 2015.London has also outraged Beijing by offering nearly three million residents of Hong Kong a pathway to UK citizenship in response to a highly controversial security law that China imposed on the former British colony last month.Britain followed that up on Monday by suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and extending an arms embargo of “potentially lethal weapons” that had previously applied only to mainland China.Pompeo’s visit includes a sideline meeting with exiled Hong Kong protest leader Nathan Law aimed at further stressing the seemingly new understanding about Beijing.The UK parliament’s release of a delayed report that took the government to task for failing to properly look into any Russian meddling in the 2016 Brexit referendum also hung over Pompeo’s visit.The report was commissioned in response to concerns that Moscow attempted to help Trump win the presidency in 2016.Trump and Pompeo reject suggestions that Russia played any meaningful role in the vote.Raab said Britain viewed Russia as “a top national security priority” but Pompeo did not address the issue in his public remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-urges-entire-world-to-stand-up-to-china/story-QVnX49Qe3DFWP7Vq9uKY3J.html

21-07-2020||World||US House of Representatives passes NDAA amendment slamming Chinese aggression against India||The US House of Representatives has unanimously passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), slamming China’s aggression against India in the Galwan Valley and its growing territorial assertiveness in and around disputed areas like the South China Sea.The NDAA amendment, moved by Congressman Steve Chabot along with Indian-American lawmaker Ami Bera and passed on Monday, said that India and China should work towards de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control.The troops of India and China are locked in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.Passed unanimously by the House of Representatives along with scores of other amendments, it said that the expansion and aggression of the People’s Republic of China in and around disputed territories, such as the Line of Actual Control, the South China Sea, the Senkaku Islands, is of significant concern. The bipartisan amendment states Congress’ opposition to Chinese aggression against India in the Galwan Valley on the India-China border, and expresses its concern toward the growing territorial assertiveness of China. China has used the distraction of the coronavirus to attempt to seize territory belonging to India, as well as to press its territorial claims in the South China Sea, it said.China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.China has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.Ties between China and Japan have been strained by a territorial row over a group of islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China. “India is a critical, democratic partner in the Indo-Pacific,” Chabot said in a statement after the House passed the NDAA amendment.“I am a strong supporter of our bilateral relationship, and I stand with India, and all our partners in the region, as they confront China’s hostile acts of aggression,” he said.“I am proud to be joined by Congressman Ami Bera, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, to bring this important amendment to the floor in a bipartisan manner,” he added.The Chabot amendment said that in the months leading up to June, 15, along the Line of Actual Control, China reportedly amassed 5,000 soldiers; and is believed to have crossed into previously disputed territory considered to be settled as part of India under the 1962 truce.China and India have reached an agreement to de-escalate and disengage along the Line of Actual Control, the Chabot amendment said, adding that on June 15, at least 20 Indian soldiers and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers were killed in skirmishes following a weeks-long standoff in Eastern Ladakh, which is the defacto border between the two countries.Following the deadly violence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India stated, ‘‘whenever there have been differences of opinion, we have always tried to ensure that those differences never turned into a dispute,” the amendment said.Another bipartisan amendment moved by Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi along with eight others urging Beijing to de-escalate the situation at the border through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not by force is slated to come up for vote before the House on Tuesday.The two resolutions comes days after the House of Representatives Caucus on India and Indian-Americans in a letter to India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, said that over the last few months, the Chinese authorities have been acting with impunity and have attempted to transgress on the LAC, which resulted in diplomatic discussions to implement a process for de-escalation along the LAC on July 6.It was led by Congressmen Holding and Brad Sherman and signed by seven other lawmakers.“It is my hope that they scale back on their excessive weaponry and infrastructure at the Line of Actual Control and uphold both their longstanding and new founded agreements with India,” said the lawmakers who offered their condolences to the families of the fallen soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-of-representatives-passes-ndaa-amendment-slamming-chinese-aggression-against-india/story-yIZgq1EAjj97mQaQf0TlbO.html
21-07-2020||World||China reiterates it has border dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector||China on Tuesday reiterated its stand that it has a border dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, adding that Beijing and Thimphu were in communication on the issue.Beijing’s claim is significant as the area in question borders Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as part of south Tibet.Beijing had made the claim regarding Bhutan in June while stalling a request from Bhutan to develop the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in the eastern sector’s Trashigang district during a virtual meeting of the US-based Global Environment Facility (GEF).Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks between 1984 and 2016 to settle their border issue and, according to discussions in the Bhutanese parliament and other public records of these meetings, the discussions have only centred on disputes in the western and central sections of the boundary.Answering a query on a media report on the GEF meeting and China’s objection to funding the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary, Chinese foreign minister spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said China and Bhutan have border disputes in the middle, western and eastern sectors.“China’s position has been consistent and clear. The boundary between China and Bhutan is yet to be demarcated, and the middle, eastern and western sections of the border are disputed,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday.“China has proposed a package solution to these disputes. China is opposed to making an issue of such disputes at multilateral forums and China remains in communication with the relevant parties regarding this issue,” he added.“I already made China’s position clear. The China-Bhutan border has not been demarcated. The middle, eastern and western sections of the boundary are disputed between China and Bhutan,” he said.Earlier in July, in an exclusive statement to the Hindustan Times, the Chinese foreign ministry had put on record its claims in the eastern sector.The Chinese foreign ministry had then said the China-Bhutan boundary has never been delimited and there “have been disputes over the eastern, central and western sections for a long time”.The statement in Mandarin added “a third party should not point fingers” in the China-Bhutan border issue – an apparent reference to India.Without elaborating on the actual areas of dispute, the Chinese foreign ministry’s statement said: “The boundary between China and Bhutan has never been delimited. There have been disputes over the eastern, central and western sectors for a long time, and there are no new disputed areas.”At the GEF meeting in June, the Chinese representative’s attempts to formally record his country’s objections through an amendment of GEF’s documents did not receive consensus. Bhutan’s views were also made part of the record: “Bhutan totally rejects the claim made by the Council Member of China. Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is an integral and sovereign territory of Bhutan and at no point during the boundary discussions between Bhutan and China has it featured as a disputed area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reiterates-it-has-border-border-dispute-with-bhutan-in-the-eastern-sector/story-IlwvqRvqyOL6oYNz21oIvN.html
21-07-2020||World||Phase II trial finds Chinese Covid-19 vaccine is safe, induces immune response||A phase II clinical trial of a Covid-19 vaccine candidate, conducted in China, has found that it is safe and induces an immune response, a study published in The Lancet says.Scientists, including those from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the trial sought to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate.They said the results provide data from a wider group of participants than their earlier phase I trial, including a small sub-group of participants aged over 55 years and older.However, the researchers cautioned that no participants in the current trial were exposed to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, after vaccination. So they said it is not possible for the current study to determine whether the vaccine candidate effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.In the trial, the researchers used a weakened human common cold virus (adenovirus, which infects human cells readily but is incapable of causing disease) to deliver the genetic material which codes for the novel coronavirus spike protein into the cells. The scientists said these cells then produced the coronavirus spike protein, and travel to the body’s lymph nodes where the immune system creates antibodies. They said these antibodies then recognise the spike protein and fight off the coronavirus.“The Beijing approach is based on the backbone of a conventional human, common-cold virus to which some people have pre-existing antibodies and they therefore make a lower response in some people to the vaccine because people have pre-existing antibodies to their vector, so may clear it before it has a chance to work properly,” explained Danny Altmann, Professor of Immunology at Imperial College London in the UK, who is unrelated to the research team. According to the scientists, 508 participants took part in the trial of the new vaccine candidate. Of these, they said 253 people received a high dose of the vaccine, 129 received a low dose, and 126 received a dummy treatment, a placebo. The study noted that about two thirds of the participants were 18-44 years old, a quarter were aged 45-54 years, and 13 per cent were 55 years or older.The participants were monitored for immediate adverse reactions for 30 minutes after injection, and were followed for any injection-site reactions within 14- and 28-days post-vaccination, the study noted.It said serious adverse events reported by participants during the whole study period were also documented, and blood samples were taken from them immediately before treatment, and 14- and 28-days post-vaccination to measure antibody responses.The findings revealed that 95 per cent (241/253) of the participants in the high dose group, and 91 per cent (118/129) of those in the low dose group showed either T cell or antibody immune responses at day 28 post-vaccination.According to the researchers, the vaccine induced a neutralising antibody response in 59 per cent (148/253) and 47 per cent (61/129) of the participants, and binding antibody response in 96 per cent (244/253) and 97 per cent (125/129) of participants, in the high and low dose groups, respectively, by day 28. The study noted that the proportion of participants who had any adverse reactions like fever, fatigue and injection-site pain were significantly higher in vaccine recipients, than those who were given the placebo.However, the scientists said, most adverse reactions were mild or moderate. They said the most common severe reaction was fever. The researchers cautioned that pre-existing immunity to the human adenovirus which was used as the vector (the Ad5 vector) for this vaccine, and increasing age could partially hamper the specific immune responses to vaccination, particularly for the antibody responses. “Since elderly individuals face a high risk of serious illness and even death associated with Covid-19 infection, they are an important target population for a Covid-19 vaccine. It is possible that an additional dose may be needed in order to induce a stronger immune response in the elderly population, but further research is underway to evaluate this,” said study co-author Wei Chen from the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology in China.Since the trial participants were not exposed to the coronavirus after vaccination, the scientists said it is not possible for the current study to determine the efficacy of the candidate vaccine. They said it is also not possible to say from the current research if there are any risks associated with the antibody induced by vaccination when exposed to the novel coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/phase-ii-trial-finds-chinese-covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-induces-immune-response/story-AXEVVhR5aNxfzC4PfNHf8H.html
21-07-2020||World||Pakistan bans live streaming app Bigo, gives final warning to TikTok||Pakistan has banned live streaming application Bigo and issued a final warning to China-based video-sharing service TikTok over “obscene and immoral” content on these platforms.In a statement, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said that numerous complaints were received from different segments of society against immoral, obscene and vulgar content on social media applications particularly TikTok and Bigo.“PTA had issued necessary notices to the aforementioned social media companies under law to moderate the socialisation and content within legal and moral limits, in accordance with the laws of the country,” the statement from Pakistan’s telecom regulator said.The PTA said the response of these companies was “not satisfactory”.A civil miscellaneous application was filed in the Lahore High Court earlier this month demanding an immediate ban on TikTok. The petitioner said that the app was a “great mischief of modern times” and had become a source of spreading pornography for the sake of fame and ratings on social media.The country’s digital rights groups, however, said that they will challenge the ban as there is no legal basis for it.TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, is already currently facing problems with authorities in a number of countries including in Australia, India, and the United States due to security and privacy issues.Both TikTok and Singapore-based Bigo Technology, which owns the live video streaming app Bigo Live, have not made any public comment regarding Pakistan’s move.TikTok is one of the world’s most popular social media apps, with over 2 billion downloads globally.In Pakistan, it has been downloaded almost 39 million times and is the third-most downloaded app over the past year after WhatsApp and Facebook, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.Bigo Live has been downloaded over 17 million times in Pakistan and is the 19th most downloaded app in the country.In July, the PTA had banned PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) platform, with over 16 million users in Pakistan, because it had received complaints “that the game is addictive, wastage of time and poses serious negative impact on physical and psychological health of the children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-bans-live-streaming-app-bigo-gives-final-warning-to-tiktok/story-ILgBKNRxab9agOTKEHM6eJ.html
21-07-2020||World||China warns UK of ‘forceful counter-attack’ after London axes HK extradition treaty||China on Tuesday warned the UK of a “forceful counter-attack” after London suspended an extradition treaty with Beijing-ruled Hong Kong weeks after the mainland implemented a controversial security bill in the former British colony.“China will make a forceful counter-attack to the UK’s wrong actions,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, said at the daily news conference in Beijing.“China urges the UK to give up its fantasies of continuing colonial influence in Hong Kong and immediately correct its mistakes,” Wang said, adding that London’s decision violated international law and norms.The two countries have had testy exchanges over the new security law for Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Ties have been further soured after the UK banned Chinese technology giant Huawei from taking part in the rollout of 5G network. Calling the decision to suspend the treaty an interference in China’s internal affairs, Wang added that the Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs, and no foreign country has the right to interfere. He added that the Chinese government is unwavering in its determination to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and in its determination to fully and accurately implement the “one country, two systems” policy. In London, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy said that recently London has repeatedly made wrong remarks on the national security law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to interfere in China’s internal affairs.“The Chinese side has lodged solemn representations to the UK side on many occasions to express our grave concern and strong opposition,” the spokesperson said.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new law “violates Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong Basic Law,” the de-facto constitution of Hong Kong that came into effect in 1997.Beijing had responded strongly to Johnson’s offer to extend residency rights and a path to citizenship for up to 3 million people in Hong Kong after the law was ratified.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had then urged countries to “stop making use of Hong Kong issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs”.Zhao reiterated in a statement that China is “…Nobody and nothing could shake the Chinese government and people’s resolution and will to safeguard national sovereignty and security and uphold Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.”His statement concluded: “Any attempt seeking to undermine China’s sovereignty, security and development interests is doomed to fail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-uk-of-forceful-counter-attack-after-london-axes-hk-extradition-treaty/story-KsnZF65aDDY8kg83wVDc6L.html

He didn’t say when Phase 3 large-scale trials would take place or when production of the vaccine may begin.The Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tests of the vaccine are continuing, the Interfax news service reported, citing the Health Ministry in response to the statement.“They’re all getting ahead of themselves,” said Sergei Netesov, a former executive at Vector, a state-run virology center in Novosibirsk that’s also working on an inoculation. “The third phase has not started yet, or even been announced. The reason they’re in such a rush is completely incomprehensible.”The army is developing a vaccine with the state-run Gamaleya Institute in Moscow and the Russian Direct Investment Fund. Phase 3 trials, which will include thousands of people in Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are scheduled to begin Aug. 3 and distribution of the vaccine could start as early as September, RDIF’s head Kirill Dmitriev said last week.Russia could make 30 million doses domestically in 2020, and 170 million abroad, with five countries expressing interest in producing the vaccine and others willing to produce it, according to Dmitriev.Russia, which has the fourth-most coronavirus cases in the world, has accelerated the testing process and is funding production even before the vaccine is known to work, amid a global race to find defenses against the deadly pandemic that has wreaked economic havoc. In developed economies, Phase 3 trials typically take months to run in order to better understand a drug’s effectiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-covid-19-vaccine-phase-2-trials-complete-claims-it-s-ready-for-use/story-aozmsj1Z5nxE20HQGEIFHI.html
21-07-2020||World||Mandatory for all foreign arrivals to carry negative Covid-19 report: China||Passengers on China-bound flights from abroad will need to carry a negative Covid-19 test report, the civil aviation authority announced Tuesday as the Chinese government steps up measures to control “imported” coronavirus cases.The nucleic acid tests would have to be carried out within five days before the scheduled flight at institutes vetted by Chinese embassies in the host countries, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced on Tuesday.The new rule will apply to both Chinese citizens and foreigners travelling to China amid a graded increase in international travel.“Passengers who are Chinese citizens are required to take photos of and upload the nucleic acid test results via an epidemic prevention mini program on the Chinese instant messaging platform WeChat,” the announcement said.Foreigners have to contact the Chinese embassy to get the process started.“Overseas travelers need to apply for a declaration of health status from the Chinese embassy with a valid written report of a negative test result,” the announcement added.Local Chinese embassies have been tasked with assessing the testing capacity of host countries and formulate travel procedures when testing conditions are met, CAAC said.According to Reuters, the CAAC has allowed more foreign airlines to resume services in China and add flights to the country as the economy recovers.“Deutsche Lufthansa AG on Friday said it would double the number of flights to and from mainland China in coming weeks, and Air France KLM SA said it has received approval to add more China flights,” the news agency reported.Last week, health authorities announced that all overseas arrivals still need to undergo quarantine and medical observation at designated sites.However, entry with diplomatic, service, courtesy or ‘C’ visas were not affected, the ministry of foreign affairs had announced.According to the national health commission (NHC), by the end of Monday, a total of 2,015 imported cases had been reported on the mainland.As of Monday, the overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 83,693, including 242 patients who were still being treated, with seven in severe conditions.The death toll remains at 4634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mandatory-for-all-foreign-arrivals-to-carry-negative-covid-19-report-china/story-e8ehCZLKub5JlR3TEb1A3H.html
21-07-2020||World||US adds 11 companies to economic blacklist over China’s treatment of Uighurs||The US Commerce Department on Monday added 11 Chinese companies implicated in what it called human rights violations in connection with China’s treatment of its Uighurs in Xinjiang in western China to the US economic blacklist.The department said the companies were involved in using forced labor by Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups. They include numerous textile companies and two firms the government said were conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.Blacklisted firms cannot buy components from US companies without US government approval.It was the third group of companies and institutions in China added to the US blacklist, after two rounds in which the Trump administration cited 37 entities it said were involved in China’s repression in Xinjiang.“Beijing actively promotes the reprehensible practice of forced labor and abusive DNA collection and analysis schemes to repress its citizens,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.The Chinese Embassy in Washington declined to comment.In May the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized US entity list additions, arguing the United States “overstretched the concept of national security, abused export control measures, violated the basic norms governing international relations, interfered in China’s internal affairs.”The companies added to the blacklist include Nanchang O-Film Tech, a supplier for Apple’s iPhone, which hosted Apple chief executive Tim Cook in December 2017, according to O-Film’s website. It is also a supplier to Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft, according to an April congressional letter. The US companies did not immediately comment.The list includes two subsidiaries of Beijing Genomics Institute, a genomics company with ties to the Chinese government, Senator Marco Rubio said.He said the additions will “ensure that US technology does not aid the Chinese Communist Party’s crimes against humanity and egregious human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, including the forced collection of DNA.”Also added are KTK Group Co, which produces more than 2,000 products used to build high-speed trains, from electronics to seats; and Tanyuan Technology Co, which assembles high thermal conductive graphite reinforced aluminum composites.Another company is Changji Esquel Textile Co, which Esquel Group launched in 2009. Esquel Group produces clothing for Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss.In a letter to Ross on Monday, Esquel Chief Executive John Chen asked its unit be removed from the list. “Esquel does not use forced labor, and we never will use forced labor. We absolutely and categorically oppose forced labor,” Chen wrote.Efforts to reach other companies in China for comment were unsuccessful outside of normal business hours.Also on the blacklist is Hetian Haolin Hair Accessories Co. On May 1, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it was halting imports of the company’s hair products, citing evidence of forced labor.On July 1, CBP seized in Newark a shipment of almost 13 tons of hair products worth over $800,000 with human hair that it said originated in Xinjiang.Commerce previously added 20 Chinese public security bureaus and companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology in connection with China’s treatment of Muslim minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-11-companies-to-economic-blacklist-over-china-s-treatment-of-uighurs/story-Wuedsz34tvo6DBRR6BceLJ.html

The vaccine appears safe and induces a strong immune response within the body, the results published in leading scientific journal The Lancet show.The results are based on the doses given to 1,077 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 in five UK hospitals in April and May as part of the phase one clinical trial. The results show they induced strong antibody and T-cell immune responses for up to 56 days after they were given. T-cells are crucial for maintaining protection against the virus for years.Here are the main details about AstraZeneca’s experimental vaccine:• The shot, AZD1222, is a recombinant viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University. It is licensed to British pharma giant AstraZeneca. It is a chimpanzee adenovirus viral vector (ChAdOx1) vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.• The experimental vaccine uses weakened version of a common-cold virus that infects chimpanzees which are given encoded instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to build immunity. It is likely to provide protection for about a year.• An AZD1222 shot would cost about 2.5 euros ($2.8) per dose in Europe, according to Italy’s health ministry. AstraZeneca does not expect to profit from it during the pandemic. The costs in other regions have not been disclosed.• Late-stage trials are currently underway in Britain, Brazil And South Africa and are due to start in the United States.• Data showed that the vaccine was safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials in healthy volunteers, with a stronger immune response in 10 people given an extra dose of the vaccine after 28 days. Data from late-stage studies is expected by August to September. Delivery of first dose expected between September and October.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-was-azd1222-made-when-is-first-dose-expected-things-to-know-about-oxford-university-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-MNrJE0iEw5pwpCzeEQZHNP.html

It says the additional figures brought the country’s total to 13,816 with 296 deaths.The agency says 20 of the newly recorded cases were locally infected patients while the rest 25 were associated with international arrivals.South Korea on Monday confirmed 26 new virus cases, four of them domestic infections and the rest 22 coming from overseas. Health officials said it was the first time for the number of daily local infections to come below 10 since May 19.South Korean officials consider imported cases as a lesser threat than local transmissions because the country is mandating Covid-19 tests and enforcing two-week quarantines on all people arriving from abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-new-covid-19-cases-bounce-back-after-drop-on-monday/story-qYzWwSYutqsSFQym7byfRI.html
21-07-2020||World||Decoding Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine results and why they offer hope||A coronavirus vaccine in development by the University of Oxford and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc showed promising results in early human testing and is now set to move into larger trials. The data was released on Monday, raising hopes that the world could soon find a way to stop the virus that has taken an unprecedented human and economic toll across the planet.The data was published in leading medical journal The Lancet based on the study done on 1,077 health adults. The AZD1222 vaccine did not develop any serious side effects in them.The OutcomeA single dose led to antibodies by Day 28 and there was a marked increase in Sars-CoV-2 spike-specific T-cell response as early as day 7, peaking at day 14 and maintained upto day 56.The vaccine caused minor side effects, which could be reduced by taking paracetamol.What This MeansThe fact that the vaccine also triggered a T-cell response is an encouraging sign. A T-cell response means the vaccine was able to stimulate the part of the immunity that ‘learns’.“We hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so thatg pour vaccine will protect people for an extended period,” said Andrew Pollard, University of Oxford professor.AstraZeneca has late-stage trials underway in the UK, Brazil and South Africa and aims to start studies in the United States, where the coronavirus prevalence is higher. Results can be accrued much more quickly in regions with high rates of active infection.AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the company hopes the vaccine will be available this year depending on how quickly late-stage trials can be completed.A coronavirus vaccine under development by CanSino Biologics Inc and China’s military research unit, likewise showed that it appears to be safe and induced an immune response in most of the 508 healthy volunteers who got one dose of the vaccine, researchers reported.Both the AstraZeneca and CanSino vaccines use a harmless cold virus known as an adenovirus to carry genetic material from the novel coronavirus into the body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decoding-oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-results-and-why-it-offers-hope/story-ayguteU5ndf0ehTn5iV7WK.html
21-07-2020||World||Canadian PM Trudeau skips opening session of parliament as WE Charity debate intensifies||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau skipped the opening day of a session of Parliament that his Government had scheduled even as discussions in the House of Commons were dominated by the controversy over the grant of a contract worth nearly a billion dollars to a charity with close links to his family.The contract to WE Charity has already been cancelled after an outcry and revelations that Trudeau’s mother, brother and wife was paid fees by the organisations at various times. This has already led to a formal investigation being launched by the country’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioners while two Parliamentary panels are also looking into the matter.Also Read: WE Charity controversy: Trudeau’s finance minister to be investigatedThe new sitting on Monday was to discuss legislation to extend a sweeping subsidy package to businesses in the country to help them retain employees in the wake of the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Trudeau was missing and his official schedule said that he had taken a personal day.While one Opposition party Bloc Quebecois has already asked Trudeau to step aside and for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland to take charge in his place, on Monday, the leader of principal opposition Conservative Party Andrew Scheer said the onus was on Liberal MPs to seek Trudeau’s resignations. In a press conference in Ottawa, Scheer said, “If they allow him to continue, if they don’t demand that he resign, then they are telling Canadians that they are comfortable with his corruption.”Freeland, in fact, bore the brunt of questioning in the House of Commons, and her response was, “Obviously, the way this unfolded was regrettable, and that is why the charity is no longer administering the project.”The Opposition attack came after Liberal members of the House of Commons Ethics Committee prevented the resolution of a motion to examine the contract and question some of the parties involved by resorting to the tactic of a filibuster, which meant taking up the prescribed time for the meeting with long-winded speeches. As the outlet CBC News reported this included “30-minute long monologues on various topics — their personal resumes, democracy, ancient Greece, French political theory and the virtues of the University of Sherbrooke, among others — that pushed the committee meeting’s duration well past its scheduled end time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-skips-opening-session-of-parliament-as-we-charity-debate-intensifies/story-2OQkbkm9svMqt32jNGkRgP.html
21-07-2020||World||Double-shot Covid-19 vaccine tests raise new pandemic challenge||When it comes to protecting the world from the coronavirus, two doses of a vaccine may be better than one. But doubling the number of jabs each person needs could complicate efforts to immunize billions of people.The latest results from front-runners in the sprint to come up with a vaccine, including the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca Plc partnership and Moderna Inc., highlight that prospect. Both efforts are conducting final-stage testing with two doses.Producing vaccines and deploying them to the world’s population in the midst of a pandemic would be a massive challenge even if researchers are able to deliver one-dose inoculations. A need for two would make manufacturing and logistics even more complex.Those challenges would get even tougher if -- as some experts think is possible -- a vaccine’s efficacy wanes over time and repeat doses are needed, potentially every year.“A one-shot vaccine would be ideal, but the first vaccines are highly unlikely to meet this very high threshold,” said Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis. “As we hopefully move from whether there will be a vaccine to how to apply this, logistics are going to become the absolute most important topic.”AstraZeneca gained 21% this year through Friday in London, then rose 10% at one point Monday as investors looked for breakthrough results from its phase 1 study. The shares faded, finishing the day with a 1.5% gain after Oxford researchers said that further studies would prioritize a two-dose regimen. The US-traded shares fell 4% in New York.In China, the two-shot approach is also looking increasingly likely. One front-runner vaccine developed by Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics Inc. and the Chinese military does not seem to elicit a strong response in people with pre-existing immunity to the adenovirus used as the vector, and researchers are exploring a booster shot three to six months later to shore up the immune response.Surest ApproachEarly study of more than 1,000 participants receiving the Oxford vaccine achieved the strongest immune response in 10 who received two doses, according to research published Monday in The Lancet medical journal, indicating that it might be the surest approach. The university’s researchers noted that some recipients may get protection from just one dose, and that ultimately the data may show that the majority of people are protected by a single shot.“We are actually really pleased we get a stronger immune response with two doses than we can with one,” Sarah Gilbert, a vaccinologist who leads the work at Oxford, said in a briefing. “We don’t know what we’re aiming at. We don’t know how strong the immune response needs to be to protect people.”AstraZeneca officials also highlighted the logic of a two-dose strategy. The company is exploring other regimens, but the first readout of its final-stage tests will almost definitely be from two doses, Mene Pangalos, Astra’s head of biopharma research, told reporters.The company has committed to delivering first of 30 million doses to the U.K. by September and 100 million by the end of the year.“I think we want to right now maximize our chance of getting an efficacious readout,” Pangalos said. “The last thing we want is to miss because we haven’t dosed enough, so the safest approach and making sure we hit efficacy is doing two high doses.”But a two-shot vaccine will not be easy to distribute widely, and likely disadvantage developing nations even more.“Years of experience in disease eradication in resource-limited countries show you may only get a single chance to vaccinate a large population,” said William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School researcher who chairs non-profit Access Health International. “Many people may not be available for economic or other reasons for a second chance. Therefore it’s a great advantage to have a cold chain-insensitive, cold chain-independent single-shot vaccine.”Leaning to OneYet not all vaccine developers are leaning that way. From the outset of its search for viable coronavirus vaccine candidates, US drug giant Merck & Co. made a point of only pursuing one-dose shots. Those can more easily and seamlessly be deployed across the world in a global vaccination campaign, Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier told Bloomberg in May.It is “extremely important,” he said then, that “these have to be vaccines we have reasonable confidence could be effective with just a single dose.”Merck’s Covid vaccine has yet to enter human trials.Even a perfect inoculation could take weeks to raise immunity to protective levels. That presents the risk that people might return to normal life after just one dose, while the immune system is still processing the vaccine, Washington University’s Kinch said. In that time, they might become infected and potentially pass the virus on to others.“This will be a particular problem if two shots are needed,” Kinch said.Vaccine experts have warned that the first shots to gain approval against Covid-19 might not be the most effective or efficient. In fact, history shows two doses is a more likely scenario. Almost all standard vaccines are multiple-shot regimens, according to Tony Moody, an immunologist at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.“We would like to do better, and we are all working to get to those better vaccines,” Moody said, “but having something effective soon is the top priority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/double-shot-covid-19-vaccine-tests-raise-new-pandemic-challenge/story-mceWUlyEwaVOtN9BUFzXuO.html
21-07-2020||World||China expands amphibious forces in challenge to US beyond Asia||China launched its military build-up in the mid-1990s with a top priority: keep the United States at bay in any conflict by making the waters off the Chinese coast a death trap. Now, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is preparing to challenge American power further afield.China’s shipyards have launched the PLA Navy’s first two Type 075 amphibious assault ships, which will form the spearhead of an expeditionary force to play a role similar to that of the US Marine Corps. And like the Marines, the new force will be self-contained - able to deploy solo with all its supporting weapons to fight in distant conflicts or demonstrate Chinese military power.The 40,000-tonne Type 075 ships are a kind of small aircraft carrier with accommodation for up to 900 troops and space for heavy equipment and landing craft, according to Western military experts who have studied satellite images and photographs of the new vessels. They will carry up to 30 helicopters at first; later they could carry fighter jets, if China can build short take off and vertical landing aircraft like the US F-35B.Also read| ‘We are a battleground now’: In Southeast Asia, US-China tensions flare on social mediaThe first Type 075 was launched last September and the second in April, according to reports in China’s official military media. A third is under construction, according to the May edition of a Congressional Research Service report.Eventually, the PLA Navy could have seven or more of these ships, according to reports in China’s official military press.Chinese military commentators quoted in official media say China’s shipyards are now building and launching amphibious ships so rapidly it is like “dropping dumplings” into water.The military rivalry between China and the United States is only growing sharper. Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared most of Beijing’s claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea illegal, throwing Washington’s weight behind the rival claims of Southeast Asian nations over territory and resources in the strategic waterway that were supported by international law. China said the US position raised tensions in the region and undermined stability.China’s nascent amphibious forces still lag far behind those of the United States, but the speed of China’s military rise has already shifted the balance of power in Asia. Over the past two decades, China has deployed an arsenal of missiles and a massive surface and sub-surface fleet to deter potential enemies from sailing in its coastal waters. Now, as part of an accelerated modernization of the PLA since Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, these new amphibious ships and the specially trained marines they carry will boost Beijing’s firepower and political influence far from its shores, according to Chinese and Western military analysts.As shipyards churn out amphibious vessels, China is expanding its force of marines under the command of the PLA Navy. These troops are being trained and equipped to make landings and fight their way ashore. China now has between 25,000 and 35,000 marines, according to US and Japanese military estimates. That’s a sharp increase from about 10,000 in 2017.“Without an amphibious force, any military force is greatly constrained in where and how it can conduct operations,” said Grant Newsham, a retired US Marine Corps colonel and researcher at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies. Newsham advised the Japanese military on the formation of Tokyo’s own Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, formed in 2018. “Jets can drop bombs and ships can fire missiles at the shore - but you might need infantry to go ashore and kill the enemy and occupy the ground.”China’s Ministry of National Defense and the Pentagon did not respond to questions from Reuters.At home, too, the PLA marines have become an important tool in the ruling Communist Party’s efforts to showcase China’s increasingly powerful military to its domestic audience. The state-controlled media regularly reports on the gruelling training and military skills of the Jiaolong, or Sea Dragon commandos - a unit from the marines special forces brigade based on Hainan Island off southern China.“We should be the point of the sword in joint operations to strike terror into the heart of the enemy,” said Gong Kaifeng, a Jiaolong commandos company commander, in a report last year on the unit’s training broadcast on state television.When the Type 075 ships enter service, China will have the capacity to combine them with its other new amphibious and support vessels, Chinese and foreign analysts say. These self-contained fleets can be sent to distant conflicts, deployed as a show of force to deter potential enemies or to protect Chinese investments and citizens abroad. They would also allow the PLA to provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, competing with the US for prestige and soft power.INVADING TAIWANFor Beijing, these amphibious forces will also contribute to the PLA’s mounting capacity to make a landing on Taiwan or seize other strategically important or disputed territory in China’s offshore regions, according to specialists in amphibious warfare.Beijing regards self-governing Taiwan a province of China. Xi Jinping has said unifying Taiwan with the mainland is a vital step in realizing the Chinese people’s dream of a powerful, rejuvenated nation. In a key speech early last year calling on Taiwan to open talks on peaceful reunification, Xi warned that this long-standing dispute could not be deferred indefinitely. “We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,” Xi said.China has this year stepped up military operations and exercises around Taiwan, according to US and Taiwanese military analysts. PLA Air Force jets, including at least one bomber and a fighter, briefly entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone on June 22, before being warned off by the Taiwanese air force, the island’s military said. It was the eighth such encounter in two weeks, the military said.Taiwan launched its annual Han Kuang defense exercise on July 13 with an emphasis on joint operations between land, sea and air forces to defend the island from attack, according to the island’s military. The exercise also involved an expanded role for reservists as the military strives to boost its firepower, senior Taiwan government officials said.“Our military is always working hard to prepare for war, closely monitoring the dynamics of the Chinese Communist’s military and the development of the situation in the Taiwan Strait,” Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. “We have a complete defense plan and appropriate actions to deal with the threat of the Chinese Communists attacking Taiwan and the seizure of offshore islands, which can ensure national security.”Experts on amphibious forces note the PLA already has powerful army units that are trained and equipped to make the kind of landings necessary for an invasion of Taiwan. In expanding the marines, they argue, PLA military planners are looking at operations across the globe, in places where China has extensive offshore investments. These commercial interests are likely to multiply as Beijing presses ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious bid to put China at the center of global trading routes.China’s marines will also be important to man what is expected to become a network of strategic military bases around the world, including fortifications on territory Beijing has seized in the South China Sea, according to Chinese and Western military commentators.Beijing has already deployed marines and their armored vehicles to its first overseas base at Djibouti on the Horn of Africa, according to Pentagon reports. Marines are also deployed on the flotillas China sends on naval anti-piracy missions to the Gulf of Aden, these reports said.“We are currently only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Ian Easton, the senior director of the Project 2049 Institute, an Arlington, Virginia-based security research group. “Ten years from now, China is almost certainly going to have marine units deployed at locations all over the world. The Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions are global. Its interests are global. It plans to send military units wherever its global strategic interests require.”Short of war, capable amphibious forces will also become a powerful diplomatic or coercive tool for Beijing, military analysts say. So far, Washington has had a monopoly on this type of engagement with other governments, routinely sending marine expeditionary units abroad for port visits, joint training exercises and disaster relief.US expeditionary flotillas, packed with marines, all their heavy equipment and air support, are a potent reminder of American power. A raw demonstration came in the tense period in 1999 when an Australian-led United Nations peacekeeping force intervened to stop violence in what was then Indonesian-controlled East Timor. American forces didn’t become heavily involved on the ground. But the presence of the USS Belleau Wood, a 40,000-tonne amphibious assault ship carrying 900 marines and heavy lift and attack helicopters, served as formidable back-up as the UN troops restored order without any significant resistance from Indonesia.SEIZING ISLANDSChina’s first two Type 075 amphibious assault vessels are now berthed together undergoing final fit-out at a state-owned Shanghai shipyard, China’s official military media has reported. Photographs in the official media and commercial satellite images show that the 250-meter-long vessels appear similar to flat-top amphibious assault ships in service with other advanced navies, including the US fleet. America currently has a fleet of eight Wasp and two America-class amphibious assault vessels.However, in a blow to US efforts to blunt the challenge from China, the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard caught fire on July 12 while tied up at its home port in San Diego. The ship was extensively damaged in the fire which burned for four days. It was unclear if the ship would be salvaged, the US Navy said.Since 2005, China has also built a fleet of six Type 071 amphibious ships, according to a 2019 report from the US Defense Intelligence Agency. These vessels can carry up to four air-cushion landing craft, similar to the hovercraft carried on US amphibious landing ships, as well as four or more helicopters, armored vehicles and troops on long-distance deployments, the report said. A seventh Type 071 is under construction, according to Western military analysts.China’s official shipbuilding industry journals have reported the 29,000-tonne Type 071 has command and control capabilities, a medical unit and accommodation for hundreds of marines. The 210-meter long vessel has a range of 10,000 nautical miles and reached a speed of 25 knots in trials, these reports said.To build the force that will embark on these ships, China began a rapid increase in the size of its marine force in 2017, according to Pentagon reports. Earlier, marines had been a low priority in the decades when China’s military built a massive ground force to defend the mainland. A regiment of marines was formed in 1953 and expanded to a division but then disbanded in 1957, according to an official timeline of major events in PLA history. It was reformed in 1979, the timeline shows.The US Defense Intelligence Agency report said China’s marine force is now organized into seven brigades, each with armor, infantry, artillery and missiles, and is the strongest force of this type among the rival claimants to disputed territories in the South China Sea. China’s marines “can simultaneously seize multiple islands in the Spratlys,” the report said, referring to a contested group of islands and reefs in the South China Sea. They could also rapidly reinforce China’s outposts in the Paracel Islands, another disputed territory in the same waterway. China does not publish detailed accounts of the disposition of its forces.Amphibious warfare specialists say these marines would also be useful for seizing other disputed territory, including the uninhabited group of isles in the East China Sea that are claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing - known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China.Selected army units are being transferred to the marines to boost the force’s capability, according to reports in the official Chinese military media and Western defense analysts. China’s official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, reported in April that two army units trained in aerial assault had been transferred to a marines brigade dedicated to helicopter landings.The Pentagon’s annual report on Chinese military power in 2018 revealed that a newly established headquarters under the command of the navy was responsible for staffing, training and equipping the expanding force. And, the report said, a new commander had been appointed to lead the marines. China’s state-controlled media has identified him as Major General Kong Jun, a former army officer who transferred to the marines in early 2017.Despite this build-up, the Pentagon and other Western military experts argue the PLA marines remain far less capable than the 186,000-strong US Marine Corps, with its extensive experience of amphibious and land operations.In its 2019 report on China’s military power, the Pentagon said most of the new PLA marines brigades were not yet manned and equipped to be fully operational. It said China’s marines lacked sufficient armored vehicles, helicopters and training to conduct complex amphibious operations.Some Western military experts suggest one reason for this: The top priorities for the PLA brass are the army amphibious units and air force airborne troops that would spearhead an attack on Taiwan. So, the marines “don’t have priority when it comes to things like amphibious tanks and helicopters,” said Easton of the Project 2049 Institute, who has written a book, The Chinese Invasion Threat, on the PLA’s preparations to conquer Taiwan.The ruling Communist Party has long wanted control of Taiwan for political reasons. The island also has huge strategic importance. It would give the PLA a key foothold in the so-called first island chain, the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China’s coastal seas. From bases on Taiwan, Chinese warships, strike aircraft and missiles would dominate the sea lanes vital to Japan and South Korea. And Taiwan would be an ideal jump-off point for operations aimed at seizing further territory in the island chain.Newsham, the retired US Marine colonel, said the PLA had assembled a formidable army amphibious force and sufficient ships, military and civilian, to probably land enough troops on Taiwan as part of a full-scale attack that includes air, missile, naval and cyber assaults. “The PLA already has a lot lined up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expands-amphibious-forces-in-challenge-to-us-beyond-asia/story-2iZc6whAtgSJ4gZGxQB3GJ.html
21-07-2020||World||‘We are a battleground now’: In Southeast Asia, US-China tensions flare on social media||Tensions between the United States and China over the South China Sea have erupted into a war of words on social media, in what analysts see as a change in US strategy amid a burgeoning superpower rivalry in Southeast Asia.After Washington last week hardened its position by explicitly rejecting Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, US embassies in the region produced an unprecedented flurry of op-eds and statements criticising Beijing’s actions.China’s response was fiery, accusing Washington of “defaming China with untrue words so as to mislead the public” in the region.“We are a battleground now,” Renato de Castro, an analyst with the Albert Del Rosario Institute for Strategic and International Relations in the Philippines, told Reuters by phone. “It will be a long game.”A week ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Beijing’s claim to about 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea “completely unlawful” and accused Beijing of seeking a “maritime empire”.US embassies in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia followed up with comments on Facebook and in editorials in local news outlets saying that Beijing’s actions fitted a pattern of encroachment on others’ sovereignty.The US ambassador to Thailand accused Chinese dams of holding back water from the region’s Mekong river during a drought last year.The embassy in Yangon drew parallels between the South China Sea and ways it said China was interfering in Myanmar, citing investments it said could become debt traps, the trafficking of women to China as brides, and the inflow of drugs into the country.In a swift counterattack, China’s ambassador to Thailand accused Washington of “attempting to sow discord between China and other littoral countries”.In a Facebook post that twice referred to the United States as “dirty”, China’s Myanmar embassy said its agencies abroad were doing “disgusting things” to contain China and showed a “selfish, hypocritical, contemptible, and ugly face”. The statements attracted thousands of regional social media comments, many attacking China while questioning the motives of both countries.“Thank you USA for doing what is the law requires,” commented Chelley Ocampo under the U.S embassy in the Philippines’ Facebook post. After someone wrote on the US embassy in Malaysia’s page, “Imperial Yankee Go Home !!!!!!”, American diplomats replied, “Are you saying that you are ok with the PRC’s bullying tactics in the SCS?”‘CLARIFICATIONS AND REBUTTALS’Wang Wenbin, China’s foreign ministry spokesman, told a news conference in Beijing it was the “US that first published comments attacking and condemning China” and its diplomats were issuing clarifications and rebuttals in response.The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the apparently coordinated social media offensive.The war of words marks a strident new tack for U.S diplomacy in the region, analysts said.The US statements aimed to tie the South China Sea to local concerns “to depict Beijing as an unequivocal threat to the sovereignty of the Southeast Asian nations”, said Sebastian Strangio, author of an upcoming book on China’s regional influence.Meanwhile, China’s response was consistent with “pugnacious ‘Wolf-Warrior’ diplomacy” since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, he said, referring to increasingly nationalist Chinese rhetoric.Strains have become more evident in the South China Sea recently, with US and Chinese navies holding simultaneous exercises in a waterway that China claims over smaller rivals, including the Philippines and Vietnam, on the basis of history.China “couldn’t afford allowing the U.S to make appreciable gains in turning regional opinion”, said Collin Koh Swee Lean, a research fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.“At least some of the Southeast Asian governments... may secretly, if not publicly, welcome the latest Pompeo statement and thereby possibly be emboldened to resist its moves in the disputed waters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-a-battleground-now-in-southeast-asia-us-china-tensions-flare-on-social-media/story-qK6ZEXVXtncwGYf6rHTUmJ.html
21-07-2020||World||Joe Biden campaign pitches Indian American voters as key to White House||Indian Americans have mostly voted for Democrats in the presidential elections. On November 3, they can do more, Democrats believe, and put former Vice-President Joe Biden in the White House.“The Indian American vote — the AAPI more broadly — can be an absolute difference maker,” Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said at a power-packed pitch to them at a virtual ton-hall recently, pointing to their demographics in the three Rust Belt swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that put Donald Trump in the White House in a stunning upset in 2016. The broader group AAPI in Perez’s remarks, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, include people of Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese and Indonesian descent.President Donald Trump won these three states narrowly by 0.2, 0.7 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively — 10,704, 46,765 and 22,177 votes. Together, they gave him their cumulative 46 electoral votes, a 304-227 victory over Hillary Clinton and the White House. (There are in all 538 electoral votes that decide a presidential elections in the US, not the popular vote, which Clinton won, in this instance by more than 3 million; 7 electors voted against their pledges).Indian Americans of voting age are in sufficient numbers in these states to obliterate Trump’s lead and put Biden across the finishing line, Democrats have argued. There are 125,000 Indian American voters in Michigan, 156,000 in Pennsylvania and 37,000 in Wisconsin, according to an analysis by AAPI Victory Fund, a Democratic group dedicated to ensuring the victory of AAPI candidates that had hosted the town-hall.The number of Indian Americans who voted in these three states in 2016, or did not, could not be immediately ascertained. But the countrywide turnout for the community was 62%, according to AAPI Data, the study cited by AAPI Victory Fund. It was the highest among AAPI communities with Japanese Americans, and was 6 points above the national turnout of 56%. There are an estimated 4 million people of Indian origin in the United States, but only about a third are eligible to vote — 1.3 million, according to AAPI Data. The rest are not, because they are either still on Green Card or are awaiting the completion of their naturalization process.Notwithstanding Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, both Republican governors; and Ami Bera, Raja Krishnamurthi, Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal and Kamala Harris, members of US congress, and many state and city officials, Indian Americans are not a major factor in US elections yet. But they can play an outsize role in closely contested battleground states, also called swing states, that are neither deeply committed Democratic (such as New York and California) nor Republican (Texas and South Carolina) and who determine presidential elections.Apart from Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the Biden campaign is eyeing five other states that they believe are in play — Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas where Indian Americans can help the effort with their votes of 66,000, 193,000, 150,000, 111,000 and 475,000 respectively.“We know that there are important sectors of the Indian American community through out our country, throughout our battleground states,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, and added, “And we want to make sure we were engaging and connecting directly” with them, their key leaders in these battleground states. And the key radio stations, newspapers, whatever else outlet it is that are speaking to them.Vinay Reddy, a new addition to Biden’s team of campaign speech writers, chipped in at the virtual town hall with an appeal to “uncles and aunties”, deploying a playful inside-joke among second generation Indian Americans about their parents, their “distant” relatives and their friends.The most poignant moment of the town-hall was Dr Murthy’s recollection of his swearing in as Surgeon General, after a brutal confirmation process. He choked up.“I will always remember what he did at that swearing in before it started when the cameras were off, in the back room behind the stage,” Murthy started, in a controlled and steady monotone that has become so familiar from his appearances on the Covid-19 epidemic on national television news networks.“I was gathered there with my mother, my father, my sister, my wife Alice, and my grandmother, who I was fortunate to still have with me and is still here about 15 feet away from me here in my house today. She was in a wheelchair. “When the Vice President walked in, he immediately saw her and went straight up to her. He got down on the floor on one knee and he took her hand in his hand and he looked into her eyes and said, ‘Grandma, look at what you’ve done’.“And he pointed to all the people who had assembled there. He knew our story. He knew that our story and the story of the Indian American community is the story of the sacrifices our parents and the generations before us made in order for us to build a life in America.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-campaign-pitches-indian-american-voters-as-key-to-white-house/story-EdbGnB3p8YBW2JFl7yGGUJ.html

The Chinese tech giant has however denied reports that alleged it as a threat to any country’s security.Shortly after the ban was announced, British government officials on Thursday met representatives from Japanese government bodies, including the National Security Secretariat as well as the National Centre of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, to seek cooperation.The Japanese side also acknowledged the need to collaborate with British companies in developing 5G technology.Three companies, including Huawei, Ericsson, and Nokia, control nearly 80 per cent of the global 5G base station market. NEC and Fujitsu control less than 1 per cent. Although Ericsson and Nokia are dominant in Britain at present, Japanese companies may be able to expand their market share in the country if they can meet their quality demands and offer low-cost products.A source from NEC told Nikkei that the company is already “in discussions” with the British side, while a source from Fujitsu said it is seeking opportunities to sell its products in Europe.The Japanese government has already decided to invest 70 billion yen (USD654 million) to support companies such as NEC to develop base station equipment and backbone networks. The funds come from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation, an independent administrative agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seeks-japan-s-help-to-develop-its-5g-wireless-networks/story-OKTwbrhEzxuvlPBvqxCanK.html
21-07-2020||World||Donald Trump tweets image of himself wearing mask, calls it ‘patriotic’||US President Donald Trump on Monday took to social media to post an image of himself wearing a face mask and indirectly called the act “patriotic” -- a clear pivot away from his earlier reluctance to wear a facial covering in public.“We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance,” the President wrote on Twitter with a photo of himself wearing a Covid mask-- nearly three months after the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended wearing masks in public.“There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favourite President!” he added.The image shows Trump wearing a mask with a presidential seal during his visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre earlier this month -- his first and only time so far donning a facial covering in public after months of refusing to be seen doing so in public amid the coronavirus pandemic.The shift to encouraging mask-wearing was primarily motivated by floundering poll numbers, a source close to the President told CNN.  We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President! pic.twitter.com/iQOd1whktNFor months, aides tried to get Trump to wear a mask, saying they could have “MAGA”, “Trump-Pence 2020” or even the American flag printed on them. But he steadfastly refused and only wore a mask once in public.But it wasn’t until a meeting with campaign aides at the White House last week, where aides bluntly told him even internal numbers showed Americans did not approve of his response to the contagious outbreak, according to an official who attended that meeting.Trump’s agreement to don a mask in public at Walter Reed came after heavy “pleading” by aides, according to a presidential adviser, who urged the President to set an example for his supporters by wearing a mask on the visit.On a trip to a Ford plant in May, for example, Trump said he wore a mask on parts of the plant tour where reporters were not allowed, saying he “didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.”But as the number of coronavirus cases grew across several states, more Republicans publicly endorsed mask-wearing in an attempt to depoliticise it as well as ramping up efforts to convince the President to support wearing a mask.Earlier in the spring, Trump had mocked Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden for wearing a mask, and during a press briefing in April, he suggested that it wouldn’t seem presidential.“(S)omehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk ... I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don’t know, somehow I don’t see it for myself. Maybe I’ll change my mind,” Trump had said then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tweets-image-of-himself-wearing-mask-calls-it-patriotic/story-sZLmYdTWWeVK2z0anCctOM.html
21-07-2020||World||Melania Trump delivers lunch to firefighters and families in DC||Lunch was on the first lady during the coronavirus pandemic. The White House delivered lunch and possibly some reassurance to people in the nation’s capital who could use a helping of both.Melania Trump made some of the deliveries herself in her first public appearances in a face mask.Mrs. Trump had been making regular visits to schools, hospitals and other venues to promote her youth welfare initiative, “ Be Best. ” But after the pandemic forced classrooms to close and hospitals to bar visitors, it appears she turned to the White House kitchens for inspiration.The first lady showed up unannounced to visit with District of Columbia firefighters and emergency medical services personnel last week.She brought White House-prepared boxed lunches, tote bags, reusable face masks and hand sanitizer, her office said. She also met with police officers.The courtesy call came as President Donald Trump has made it clear that he stands with police and other law enforcement amid the nationwide calls for racial justice and changes to policing sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.She echoed her husband’s message — minus his finger-pointing blaming unrest on Democratic city leaders.“The president and I will continue to support our dedicated firefighters, police members, EMS personnel and other critical first responders who put their lives at risk each day in order to keep our neighborhoods safe,” Mrs. Trump said afterward in a written statement.A week earlier, the first lady slipped out of the White House on a surprise visit to deliver lunches, tote bags and other unspecified items to The Mary Elizabeth House, her office said.The center provides comprehensive family support to single mothers and their children.Video shared on her Twitter and Facebook accounts show the first lady in a yard at The Mary Elizabeth House and speaking through a face mask with women, some holding young children.She’s also seen handing out lunch boxes stamped with “Be Best,” and tote bags.It was the first public glimpse of the first lady in a face covering, in keeping with federal and local coronavirus guidelines.Mrs. Trump has offered the public a more consistent message about mask-wearing than the president, who flouted the guidelines before allowing himself to be seen wearing a mask in public on a visit earlier this month to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.In May, the first lady sent White House executive chef Cris Comerford, pastry chef Susie Morrison and other staff to deliver 150 boxed meals of chicken macaroni and cheese and broccoli florets to patients and staff at Children’s Inn at the National Institutes of Health.She has spent every Valentine’s Day since 2018 doing arts and crafts with children who stay at the inn while they receive medical treatment.In an accompanying letter addressed to her “dear friends” at the inn, Mrs. Trump said the meals were a “token of my sincere gratitude for your tireless work.” The lunch boxes were delivered cold, but with “perfect reheating instructions,” Javin Smith, the program operations manager at Children’s Inn, said in an email through a spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melania-trump-delivers-lunch-to-firefighters-and-families-in-dc/story-OSwCfXHmWV3VyGXWUabNcL.html

Moderna, which is among biotech’s hottest stocks, was also down as much as 18% as JPMorgan downgraded its rating to the equivalent of a hold. AstraZeneca data “fail to impress” in a competitive context, “the titers from immunized patients were lower than convalescent patients, whereas BioNtech and Moderna vaccines both elicited IgGs substantially higher than convalescent controls,” said Bernstein, Ronny Gal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-data-fails-to-impress-some-experts/story-kLiKahWVvipJnpbtorAO1O.html
21-07-2020||World||CanSino’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate shows promise||A Covid-19 vaccine developed by CanSino Biologics Inc and China’s military research unit has shown to be safe and induced immune response in most of the recipients, researchers said on Monday.The CanSino candidate, named Ad5-nCOV, is one of a handful of vaccines that have shown some promise in human testing and are gearing up for late-stage trials, along with projects involving Moderna Inc, BioNTech SE and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.While CanSino’s vaccine has yet to start late-stage large-scale clinical trials to assess how well it works to prevent people from becoming infected, it has received the green light to be used in China’s military.The results from the mid-stage study, published in the medical journal Lancet, supports the testing of the vaccine candidate in a large trial, the study authors said.The vaccine candidate uses a virus called adenovirus to carry genetic material from the new coronavirus’ protein into the human body, a method also used by researchers at the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca for their vaccine candidate.The immune responses elicited by the vaccine might be undermined if the inoculated person has already developed high-level adenovirus immunity from a previous infection, Chinese researchers said in a peer-reviewed paper.CanSino counts Lilly Asia Ventures, backed by US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co, as its top shareholder, according to Refinitiv data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cansino-candidate-shows-promise/story-CkHQ7279kkOUCNCCYcyQYL.html

Human trials for the vaccine candidate in India are set to start in August this year. Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses produced and sold globally, spoke to deputy health editor Rhythma Kaul about his company’s plans to manufacture the vaccine in India to ensure equitable access to low- and middle-income countries.How promising are the initial clinical trial results of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine?The trials have shown promising results and we are extremely happy about it. We will be applying for the licence for trials to the Indian regulator in a week’s time. As soon as they grant us permission, we will begin with the trials for the vaccine in India. In addition, we will soon start manufacturing the vaccine in large volumes.When do you expect to start human clinical trials of the vaccine candidate in India?We are planning to start human trials in India around August 2020.How many doses of vaccines will be produced in your Pune facility?We plan to produce at one billion doses of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine over the next one year.What kind of partnership exists between Serum Institute of India and AstraZeneca?At present, the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine is undergoing Phase-III clinical trials in different countries. The Serum Institute of India has entered a manufacturing partnership with AstraZeneca to produce the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine in India. Is it just for India, or are you also looking at markets outside the country?The vaccines will be for India and middle- and low- income countries across the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/august-target-for-trial-of-oxford-vaccine-adar-poonawalla/story-0JpubqKQFkPyamopN4begJ.html
21-07-2020||World||Ray of light enters dark Covid tunnel||In the race for a vaccine for Covid-19, the Oxford University team was seen to be miles ahead in a fray that now includes 165 teams of researchers. While the first peer-reviewed study of its early-stage trials was published only Monday (two others beat it to that milestone earlier), the advantage the researchers have is in volumes – the Oxford team will have involved thousands of people in the trials by next month, a point at which others are likely to only be starting recruitment of such numbers.“It’s the most advanced vaccine anywhere,” Bloomberg Businessweek quoted Kate Bingham, chair of the UK government’s Vaccine Taskforce, as having told a parliamentary committee in early July. Behind this feat, however, is research that has spanned over two decades in search for a vaccine – first for Malaria, before it was tweaked to target Mers and Ebola. In particular, it involves two Oxford University professors: Adrian Hill and Sarah Gilbert. The two are part of Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, and Hill – who heads the institute – has worked with the particular technology behind the Covid-19 vaccine for decades now. The technique involves bioengineering a familiar virus (in this case, it’s a chimpanzee virus) to make it mimic the pathogen against which the researchers want inoculation. Also read: Vaccine results shot in the arm for Covid fightAccording to a New York Times report, Hill worked on this with Malaria as his target, and the first breakthrough came in 2014 when a vaccine based on the chimp virus that Hill tested was manufactured in a large enough scale to provide a million doses. Around the time, Gilbert tweaked the same chimpanzee virus – technically called an adenovirus -- to make a vaccine for Mers, which was also a coronavirus, the report said. This would lay the foundation on which the Covid-19 vaccine was built, and lessons that allowed the Oxford team to short-circuit some parts of the trial process.  This is because most other teams first start with small clinical trials of a few hundred participants to demonstrate safety. But since the platform was already tested, the Oxford researchers let ahead and enrolled thousands of people from the beginning – merging Phase 1 and Phase II. “We know the adverse event profile and we know the dose to use, because we’ve done this so many times before,” Bloomberg Businessweek quoted Gilbert as saying. “Obviously we’re doing safety testing, but we’re not concerned,” she added, according to a report published on July 15.In addition to being poised to complete late-stage trials sooner than the others, the Oxford vaccine is also likely to race ahead because of the ease with which it can be manufactured, the funding and collaborations involved, and the support it has received. Usually, traditional vaccines use a weakened version of a virus to trigger an immune response. But this technology comes requires painstaking precautions as well. Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe technology used in this case involves a virus that does not infect humans, making it safer and easier to scale up in the production stage. The pandemic, which has exacted a near-unprecedented human and economic toll, also led to a never-before-seen mobilisation of vaccine funding and development efforts. AstraZeneca has inked a $750 million deal with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to manufacture and distribute 300 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2020, the drugmaker said in early June. It also agreed to a licensing deal with the Serum Institute of India to provide one billion doses of the vaccine to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the goal of 400 million produced by year’s end. In total, the deals will bring AstraZeneca’s overall supply capacity for Oxford’s vaccine candidate to more than two billion doses per year, the drugmaker said. The agreement will task CEPI with manufacturing the vaccine, while Gavi will handle procurement.While several countries, such as the United States and Russia, have struck separate deals with AstraZeneca, it remains to be seen how the licensing arrangement will work for India, which is among LMICs. Seventy-five countries have submitted expressions of interest to protect their populations and those of other nations through joining the COVAX Facility, a mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide, according to a statement by WHO last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ray-of-light-enters-dark-covid-tunnel/story-q4za3fF6YrkUVPGcE3e32J.html
21-07-2020||World||Vaccine results shot in the arm for Covid fight||A vaccine for Covid-19 developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca was safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, data showed on Monday, raising hopes that the world could soon find a way to stop the virus that has taken an unprecedented human and economic toll across the planet.Published in The Lancet, the peer-reviewed report showed that the 1,077 healthy adults who were given the AZD1222 vaccine did not develop any serious side effects, and their bodies developed an immune response that could protect people for a significant amount of time. The results came separately as two other vaccine candidates – one being developed in China and the other in Germany – reported positive results from their studies. The Oxford vaccine candidate is largely considered the front-runner since it has carried out trials on the widest set of people among all.Also read: Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is safe, early results showAdrian Hill, the head of the Oxford University’s Jenner Institute that invented the vaccine candidate, said that it was possible that the vaccine would become available by the end of the year, news agency Reuters reported. “There might be a million doses manufactured by September: that now seems like a remarkable underestimate, given the scale of what’s going on,” said Hill, referring to the manufacturing capability of partner AstraZeneca.“Certainly there’ll be a million doses around in September. What’s less predictable than the manufacturing scale-up is the incidence of disease, so when there’ll be an endpoint,” he added. The widely followed Oxford vaccine trial is currently at an advanced stage, with studies being carried out in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. A collaboration has already been reached between Oxford, UK government and biopharma major AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the final results are also positive.  The Serum Institute of India is one of the global partners for its production, a deal that would involve the Pune-based facility producing 400 million doses that will be distributed across dozens of lower and middle-income countries such as India.The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) hailed the findings about the vaccine as “good news”. “We now need to move into larger-scale real-world trials,” Dr Michael Ryan told reporters at a news conference in Geneva, while warning: “there’s a long way to go”. “But it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery.”“There is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the Covid-19 pandemic,” vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said, according to Reuters. “We still do not know how strong an immune response we need to provoke to effectively protect against Sars-CoV-2 infection,” she said, adding researchers needed to learn more about Covid-19 and continue late stage trials which have already commenced. More than 165 possible vaccines are in various stages of development with US drugmaker Pfizer and China’s CanSino Biologics also reporting positive responses for their candidates on Monday. Last week, another US company – Moderna – had its successful first phase trials reported in the journal NEJM.To date, Covid-19 has killed about 610,000 people worldwide and infected over 14 million in 196 countries since the outbreak first emerged in China late last year.Also read | Initial human trial of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine brings hope, found safe: All you need to knowExplaining how the Oxford vaccine works, study lead author Andrew Pollard said: “It uses a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzees, which has been weakened so that it can’t cause any disease in humans, and is genetically modified to code for the spike protein of the human Sars-CoV-2 virus.”“This means that when the adenovirus enters vaccinated people’s cells it also delivers the spike protein genetic code. This causes these people’s cells to produce the spike protein, and helps teach the immune system to recognise the Sars-CoV-2 virus,” he added.The immune system, Pollard explained, has two ways of finding and attacking pathogens: antibody and T cell responses. “This vaccine is intended to induce both, so it can attack the virus when it’s circulating in the body, as well as attacking infected cells. We hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period,” he said. According to The Lancet, an ideal vaccine should be effective after one or two shots, work in target populations including older adults and those with other health conditions, confer protection for a minimum of six months, and reduce onward transmission of the virus to contacts.The Lancet said the current trial is too preliminary to confirm whether the new vaccine meets these requirements, but Phase 2 (underway in the UK only) and phase 3 trials to confirm whether it effectively protects against Sars-CoV-2 infection are happening in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.“This is very positive news. A huge well done to our brilliant, world-leading scientists & researchers at the University of Oxford. There are no guarantees, we’re not there yet & further trials will be necessary – but this is an important step in the right direction,” said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“We are encouraged by the Phase I/II interim data showing AZD1222 was capable of generating a rapid antibody and T-cell response against Sars-CoV-2. While there is more work to be done, today’s data increases our confidence that the vaccine will work and allows us to continue our plans to manufacture the vaccine at scale for broad and equitable access around the world,” said AstraZeneca’s Mene Pangalos.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-results-shot-in-the-arm-for-covid-fight/story-E1trn7Ptg1EwCNnwTyrWVI.html

The timing of the hajj is determined by the position of the moon, in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar.Last month, Saudi Arabia announced it would hold a “very limited” hajj, a decision fraught with political and economic peril as it battles a surge in coronavirus infections.It has seen some 253,349 cases so far including 2,523 deaths -- the highest toll among the Arab Gulf states.Although hajj officials said the pilgrimage would be restricted to 1,000 people already present in the kingdom, 70 percent of them foreigners and the rest Saudis, some press reports have said that 10,000 people may take part.The ritual will be restricted to medical professionals and security personnel who have recovered from the virus, the hajj ministry said.- Heavy blow -The decision to exclude pilgrims arriving from outside Saudi Arabia is a first in the kingdom’s modern history and has sparked disappointment among Muslims worldwide, although many accepted it was necessary due to the pandemic.The pilgrims will be tested for coronavirus before arriving in Mecca and are required to quarantine at home after the ritual, according to health officials.Saudi Arabia has seen an uptick in both confirmed infections and deaths from COVID-19 since easing movement restrictions in late May. It has yet to restore international air links.The hajj -- a must for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime -- could be a major source of contagion, as it packs millions of pilgrims into congested religious sites.The Saudi-based Muslim World League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation have backed the government’s move for the health and safety of pilgrims.But the decision still risks angering hardline Muslims for whom religion trumps health concerns.A scaled-down hajj represents a major loss of revenue for the kingdom, already reeling from the twin shocks of the virus-induced slowdown and a plunge in oil prices.The smaller year-round umrah pilgrimage was already suspended in March.Together, they add $12 billion to the Saudi economy every year, according to government figures.Hosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam’s holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.But a series of deadly disasters over the years, including a 2015 stampede that killed up to 2,300 worshippers, has prompted criticism of the kingdom’s management of the pilgrimage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scaled-down-hajj-pilgrimage-to-start-july-29-saudi-officials/story-s3C0YXAORmF8cH1ZYNfBWP.html

Bridger, a native of Wyoming, US, according to his aunt, got bit on his face “several times” when he stood in the way of a dog attacking his younger sister.   My nephew is a hero who saved his little sister from an attacking dog. He, himself, took on the attack so that the dog wouldn’t get his sister. He later said, "If someone was going to die, I thought it should be me." He got home from the hospital last night. I know it’s a long shot, but I’m reaching out to the Avengers and other heroes so that they can learn about this latest addition to their ranks. Please, check your DM’s for my sweet nephew’s story. @tomholland2013 @chrishemsworth @robertdowneyjr @markruffalo @prattprattpratt @twhiddleston @chadwickboseman @vindiesel @chrisevans @vancityreynolds @thehughjackman Edit: I never expected my sweet nephew’s story to reach so many. Please, follow my other post (I only have two so far 😅) for the latest info regarding my sweet nephew and his family.A post shared by  Nikki Walker (@nicolenoelwalker) on Jul 11, 2020 at 7:42am PDTThe injuries he received were gruesome, as he had “90 stitches (give or take)” on his face, yet he chose to grab his younger sibling’s hand and run towards safety. Bridger’s heroic saga has gone viral, ever since his aunt shared the account on Instagram, and many on screen superheroes have praised the young boy. “People who put the well beings of others in front of themselves are the most heroic and thoughtful people I know. I truly respect and admire your courage and your heart,” actor Mark Ruffalo, who portrays the role of Hulk/Bruce Banner in the Avengers film franchise, commented on the post. “Real courage isn’t dominating people or fighting against people or walking around like a tough guy. Real courage is knowing what is right to do and doing it even when it might end up hurting you somehow. You are more of man than many, many I have seen or known. With Admiration… Mark Ruffalo (Bruce Banner/Hulk/Professor),” he wrote further.   I’m not an Avenger, but I know a superhero when I see one. I can only hope I’m half as brave in my life as you are in yours, Bridger. Wishing you an easeful recovery, and many cool looking rocks. ⁣ ⁣ Hey @markruffalo, do you need a teammate?? ⁣ ⁣⁣ Via @blackculturenews_ & @nicolenoelwalkerA post shared by  Anne Hathaway (@annehathaway) on Jul 14, 2020 at 8:42pm PDTJust like Ruffalo, several other Hollywood superheroes and stars praised the his courageous efforts, many of them wishing they were “half as brave” as the six year old Bridger, who certainly proved the old saying that not all superheroes wear capes.
