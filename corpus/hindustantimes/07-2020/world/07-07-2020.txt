Three times that number survive but may require amputations or suffer permanent disabilities.CGHR executive director and senior author of the snake bite study, Dr Prabhat Jha, told the Hindustan Times there is “evidence of avoidability here.” “A set of measures targeted at high-burden states, during the peak period during the monsoon, could result in an appreciable reduction in fatalities. Some of the measures could be simple,” Jha said.Jha added that as the deaths primarily occur in rural areas at lower elevations, provision of rubber boots, rechargeable torches, and aligning anti-venom availability with need, education about preventative measures including safe harvesting practices during farming, are among the steps required.The regional hotspots lie in the high-burden states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Jharkhand.“The risk of an Indian dying from snakebite before age 70 is about 1 in 250, but notably higher in some areas,” the study said. It recommended innovative outreach to tackle the menace. “Increased use of antivenom would require tactful cooperation with local traditional healers and ayurvedic practitioners to persuade them to refer severely ill patients for treatment with antivenom, and raising awareness of the effectiveness of antivenom,” it said.The study’s lead author Wilson Suraweera, senior research analyst and Bio-statistician at CGHR, noted, “We wanted to provide the most complete picture of snakebite epidemiology in India to better understand the volume of untimely deaths, case-fatality patterns and important snakebite characteristics, while analysing 20 years of scientific data to drill down to regions on which public health measures should be focused.”“India has sufficient manufacturing capacity for large snake antivenom production. Better understanding of the distribution of India’s many venomous snake species could help in the development of more appropriate antivenoms.”Among the species identified in the study are Russell’s viper, four types of cobras, eight varieties of kraits, and saw-scaled viper, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-2-million-died-from-snake-bite-in-india-between-2000-2019/story-zvG8RyFWr5F6ySoDofeuAM.html
07-07-2020||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak urged to go further to protect young from recession||The UK opposition Labour Party has urged Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak to focus more effort on protecting young people from the effects of what could be the worst recession in three centuries.Sunak will on Wednesday unveil the next stage of his program to reduce the damage done to the British economy by coronavirus. The government is trying to restart businesses that have been closed since the country went into lockdown in March, with pubs and restaurants the latest to reopen their doors. But Labour is concerned that the young will be particularly badly hit.Ed Miliband, Labour’s business spokesman, told the Resolution Foundation think tank he hoped the government would recognize “the particular impact on particular groups in this crisis” such as young people. Over one million young people could be out of work by the end of the year, according to research by the Institute for Public Policy Research.“Governments tend to think that the danger is that they do too much too quickly, when really the danger is doing too little too late,” Miliband said. “I hope we see a response which is equal to the scale of the emergency, particularly facing young people. What you don’t want is a kind of abyss between the end of furlough and the job-creation measures in place.”Among Sunak’s announcements on Wednesday will be a 111 million-pound ($140 million) program to triple the number of traineeships for young people, but Labour argues that more is needed.Sunak Eyes $3.8 Billion of Green Spend to Fuel UK RecoveryLabour’s Treasury spokeswoman Anneliese Dodds told Sunak in Parliament on Tuesday the government’s current proposal “hardly reflects a focus on jobs, jobs, jobs.” The Chancellor replied that tens of thousands of “good local jobs” would be created through new grants for energy-efficient housing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-rishi-sunak-urged-to-go-further-to-protect-young-from-recession/story-RCaNN2bFIXqDVUQJzHmFmN.html
07-07-2020||World||Bolsonaro gets Covid after downplaying its impact on Brazil||Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, who has consistently belittled the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic while his country has soared to the world’s second-most cases and deaths, tested positive for Covid-19.“I’m perfectly well,” Bolsonaro told journalists in a live interview on Tuesday, after announcing the result of his test. He’s taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria medicine that he has touted as being effective against the virus though its use hasn’t been authorized by most health experts globally and could carry dangerous side effects.He joins other world leaders who have been contaminated by the virus, including Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, both of whom were hospitalized during the treatment.“Everyone knew that sooner or later it would affect a good part of the population,” he said. “Life continues. But if the economy doesn’t work it will bring new forms of death and suicide.”He told reporters his latest temperature reading was 36.7 degrees Celsius, or 98 Fahrenheit.He asked reporters to step away and then pulled off his face mask to say, “See, I am fine. See you next week, God willing.”Bolsonaro has refused to use a mask in public and even battled the court over an order forcing him to. During the announcement of his test results, he refrained from suggesting that Brazilians use masks, saying that any precautions should be weighed against the economic damage they might cause.The 65-year-old president, who during his campaign to reopen the economy called the virus “just a little flu,” has repeatedly disobeyed medical recommendations to avoid contamination, mingling in crowds without a face mask and shaking hands.Late on Monday, however, a video posted on YouTube showed a masked Bolsonaro trying not to get too close to supporters who awaited him in front of the presidential palace. He told them he was following social distancing orders from a doctor after showing symptoms of the virus, and added that an exam had shown his lungs were “clean.”But Bolsonaro has had recent health troubles. In September 2018 while campaigning for president, he was stabbed in the abdomen, leading to multiple surgeries. For months, he relied on a feeding tube and colostomy bag. During his interview Tuesday he appeared weary with dark circles around his eyes.Brazil has become a global hotspot for the virus, trailing only the U.S. with more than 65,000 confirmed deaths and over 1.62 million total cases. Its response has been erratic, with the president often clashing with state governors and other officials over quarantine measures and possible treatments. Brazil’s health ministry is currently headed by an army general after Bolsonaro fired his first minister and a second resigned.The Brazilian real, which was leading gains earlier in the day, fell after the announcement, joining a slide in other emerging-market currencies. Stocks held onto losses.“So What?“Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus since Brazil confirmed its first case in late February. In a televised speech in March, he said he wasn’t worried about being infected by the illness because he was “an athlete” in the past.“If I am infected by the virus, I wouldn’t have to worry,” Bolsonaro said at that time. “I wouldn’t feel anything. I would be affected by only a little flu.”In April, when questioned about news that Brazil surpassed had China in terms of virus deaths, Bolsonaro replied by saying, “so what?” When asked about virus fatalities at another point in the same month, he said “I’m not a gravedigger, ok?”Still, Bolsonaro could be seen coughing during a Thursday broadcast on his social networks, when he sat next to six other people, none of whom wore a mask. Officials who were present included Regional Development Minister Rogerio Marinho and the chief executive officer of state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal, Pedro Guimaraes. Guimaraes was tested for the virus on Tuesday, his office said.Since then, Bolsonaro has mingled with members of his administration and the general public, and had lunch with the U.S. ambassador to Brazil on Saturday. That day, Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo tweeted an image from the lunch showing the president with his arm around the minister and seated beside the ambassador, Todd Chapman. Both the ambassador and his wife tested negative and will remain under quarantine, the U.S. embassy said on Tuesday.On Monday, Bolsonaro didn’t participate in a ceremony that he was supposed to host, opting instead to go to the hospital. The president later canceled most of his agenda for the rest of the week, including a scheduled trip to the state of Bahia.It is not the first time Bolsonaro has been tested for Covid-19. In March, after multiple members of his delegation to a U.S. visit contracted the virus, he said he tested negative.On June 25, he said during a Facebook live broadcast that he thought he had already contracted the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-gets-covid-after-downplaying-its-impact-on-brazil/story-bdrolgeZ7ta3wOkL8l7Z0N.html
07-07-2020||World||New UK sanctions could apply to Indians too: Dominic Raab||A new sanctions regime against abusers of human rights unveiled on Monday could be applied to individuals in India or those in countries that are allies or friends of the United Kingdom, foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said.The first list of individuals and entities facing asset freeze and visa bans include those from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and North Korea. Raab came under pressure on Tuesday to name individuals in China (on abuses related to Uyghur Muslims) and Hong Kong.During the debate in the House of Commons, Scottish National Party MP Brendan O’Hara asked Raab about imposing sanctions on the UK’s allies, including India, which is one of the key markets with which the post-Brexit UK is keen to reach a free trade deal.He asked: “Can the Foreign Secretary assure the House that the application of the sanctions regime will be transparently even-handed and will not be blind to human rights abuses carried out by or in the name of our so-called allies and friends such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Israel or India, or indeed countries with which we are seeking to secure a post-Brexit trade deal?Raab responded: “If the hon. Gentleman looks at the designations, he will see that we have answered that in the first round that we are making today”. The UK has a ‘long-standing relationship’ with Saudi Arabia, which is one of the countries whose citizens named on Monday.Raab said MPs, civil society groups and others could suggest names for future sanctions. Britain’s crime officials have been dealing with several cases of foreign nationals with controversial backgrounds who have bought property and other assets in London and the UK.Raab told MPs: “(This) Government and this House send a very clear message, on behalf of the British people: those with blood on their hands, the thugs of despots, the henchmen of dictators, will not be free to waltz into this country, to buy up property on the Kings Road, do their Christmas shopping in Knightsbridge or siphon dirty money through British banks or other financial institutions”.Labour MP Gagan Mohindra, who was one of the new Indian-origin MPs elected in the December 2019 election, asked Raab if the sanctions regime would include the issue of freedom of religion and belief around the world.Raab responded: “The regime focuses on the most serious human rights abuses—those against the right to life, the prohibition against torture, and the prohibition against slave labour and forced labour—but of course many of those abuses can be directed at journalists and those practising their religion, and if he looks at the designations that we have made today, he will find that that is true even in relation to the first wave”.Those named in the first list of sanctions include Myanmar army commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and Soe Win, deputy commander-in-chief – both named in relation to Rohingya Muslims in the Rakhine state.The regime is expected to allow the UK to target individuals and organisations around the world unlike conventional geographic sanctions regime, which only target a country. It could also include those who commit unlawful killings perpetrated against journalists and media workers, or violations and abuses motivated on the grounds of religion or belief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-sanctions-could-apply-to-indians-too-dominic-raab/story-g5s1NZTOO7iGtZUFwEpXXM.html
07-07-2020||World||UK’s home secretary Priti Patel, daughter of shopkeepers, vows to tackle shop crime||Home secretary Priti Patel on Tuesday remembered her background as a daughter of immigrants from Uganda who ran shops after arriving in the UK, and set out plans to crack down on abuse and violence by customers against workers in shops.The plans include guidance on reporting crime, strengthening and making full use of existing laws and improving data sharing between businesses and police. The focus will be on theft of goods valued up to £200 from a shop being prosecuted as a criminal offence.Responding to a consultation on the issue, Patel said: “As the daughter of shopkeepers, I know what a vital role they play within our communities and just how tirelessly they have worked during the coronavirus pandemic”.“I will not tolerate violence and abuse against any shopworker and it’s right that those who commit these crimes must be caught and punished,” she said.The majority of nearly 3,500 individuals, businesses and other organisations that engaged with the consultation believed that abuse toward shop staff had increased in recent years and a significant number said they did not report incidents to the police.Officials said that respondents gave many examples of behaviour they faced at work; the most common being violence or abuse in the context of preventing shop theft. Other commonly cited issues included attacks, or threat of attack, involving a weapon.Respondents said they were subjected to anti-social behaviour, typically committed by young people; organised criminal activity by gangs or groups of individuals; racial abuse; armed robberies; criminal damage; sexual harassment; spitting; biting; and, acts of violence, or threats to commit acts of violence, including use of, or threats to use, a weapon.A large number of Asian immigrants set up shops – known as ‘Patel corner shops’ – after arriving in the UK over the decades, often facing racism. The character of the mostly family-run shops has changed over the years, with younger generations preferring other vocations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-home-secretary-priti-patel-daughter-of-shopkeepers-vows-to-tackle-shop-crime/story-6EzpJvY8suS4UltPMmcEXL.html
07-07-2020||World||Joe Biden promises to up US production of key medical equipment||Joe Biden is promising to shift production of medical equipment and other key pandemic-fighting products “back to U.S. soil,” creating jobs and bolstering a domestic supply chain he says has been exposed as inadequate and vulnerable by the coronavirus outbreak.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s campaign released a plan Tuesday to reinforce stockpiles of a “range of critical products on which the U.S. is dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers.” That includes medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, but also energy and grid resilience technologies, semiconductors and key electronics, as well as telecommunications infrastructure and raw materials.It marked the Biden campaign’s most comprehensive statements yet on how it would better equip the nation to fight the coronavirus and future pandemics — though it did not include specifics on how much doing so would cost. If elected in November, Biden promises to initiate immediately a 100-day review of “critical national security risks across America’s international supply chain,” while asking Congress to create a permanent, mandatory review process.The former vice president envisions creating a “critical supply chains workforce” that would be part of a larger job creation and economic recovery plan his camp has spent weeks promising it will soon release.In a conference call with reporters, senior Biden campaign officials said public health officials have indicated that there were positive signs around the creation of coronavirus vaccines but that there’s no guarantee any might be ready by January. The officials said Biden’s camp is preparing for the possibility that a vaccine isn’t available by then, or that one is but will need to be mass produced and distributed in equitable ways around the country.Biden has long criticized President Donald Trump’s administration for failing to press more private companies into production of ventilators and other critical medical and protective equipment during the virus outbreak under the Defense Production Act. The Republican president has countered that his use of the authority has saved lives by “removing obstacles in the supply chain.”The Biden plan released Tuesday promises to rely more heavily on the Defense Production Act while seeking to harness federal purchasing power to improve manufacturing capacity for products deemed vital to national security.It also includes an emphasis on increasing long-term pharmaceutical production, citing the Food and Drug Administration in reporting that more than 70% of active pharmaceutical ingredient facilities that currently supply the U.S. market are located abroad.The campaign officials said the goal was not to make U.S. manufacturing “purely self-sufficient” but to decrease dependence on foreign producers like China. Biden also wants a system that is resilient.The plan aims to increase critical stockpiles while also creating national “surge capacity” to further ramp up production in times of crisis. It also includes provisions to work with U.S. allies globally and use regulatory tools to bolster their own critical supply chains while potentially creating new markets for American manufactured goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-promises-to-up-us-production-of-key-medical-equipment/story-j3autL2fie6XE57y1Yk6NJ.html

07-07-2020||World||ICE guideline forces students enrolled in colleges holding online classes out of US||Panic has gripped Indian and international students in US colleges over the new guideline announced Monday by the Trump administration. The guideline forces foreign non-immigrant students to leave the country if they are enrolled in institutions holding only online classes for the fall semester. The state department will not issue visas to students on F-1 and M-1 — for academic and vocations students — enrolled in online-only institutions and the US border and customs will not let them enter the country, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) department said in the guideline. This would apply, presumably, to new enrolments.Students who were already in the United States and were enrolled at these online-only institutions will be allowed a maximum of one online class or three credit hours to remain in status or they would have to switch to a school that allows them to take the minimum number of in-person classes.At institutions that are moving towards a “hybrid model” — a mix of online and in-person teaching or “blended” programme as some universities call them — students will be allowed to take more than one course online, or three credit hours. However, the university must certify that the “program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program”.But these exemptions did not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students pursing vocational degrees, ICE said. These students are “not permitted to enroll in any online courses,” it added.With an eye on his re-election bid coming November, President Donald Trump has been pushing for the country to reopen after Covid-19 lockdown to get the economy back on track. “Schools must reopen in the fall,” he wrote on twitter, in all-caps, around the time as the ICE announcement was made.“There is a sense of panic among students,” said Onkar Joshi, a doctoral candidate at the University of Maryland in Maryland. “The order forces us to choose between our health and staying in the US,” he added.There are approximately 200,000 Indian students in the United States. It was not clear immediately how many of them would be impacted and in what way as universities do not have a uniform model for reopening. Not all of them have announced their programmes for the fall semester, which starts mid-August.India raised the issue with the US at foreign office consultations Tuesday morning. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and US under-secretary of state for political affairs David Hale discussed ways to further enhance mutually beneficial trade and people-to-people ties, including through visa facilitation for students and professionals, the ministry of external affairs said in a readout of the meeting.An estimated 1 million international students enrolled in US colleges every year. Their impact on US economy is worth $41 billion and they support more than 450,000 jobs.Harvard University announced earlier Monday — just before the ICE guideline — that it will hold all classes online and will allow only 40% of these students to return live on campus for the fall semester, according to The Harvard Crimson.“We are deeply concerned that the guidance issued today by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement imposes a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach to a complex problem, giving international students, particularly those in online programs, few options beyond leaving the country or transferring schools,” Harvard University president Lawrence S Bacow said in a statement.“This guidance undermines the thoughtful approach taken on behalf of students by so many institutions, including Harvard, to plan for continuing academic programs while balancing the health and safety challenges of the global pandemic,” he added.The American Council on Education (ACE), which represents US colleges and universities, slammed the ICE guideline as “horrifying”.“At a time when institutions are doing everything they can to help reopen our country, we need flexibility, not a big step in the wrong direction,” the organization said further in a statement. “ICE should allow any international student with a valid visa to continue their education regardless of whether a student is receiving his or her education online, in person, or through a combination of both, whether in the United States or in their home country, during this unprecedented global health crisis.”Foreign students are not allowed into the United States through online-only institutions and an exemption was made , ICE said in the statement, in view of the Covid-19 epidemic. “This policy permitted non-immigrant students to take more online courses than normally permitted by federal regulation to maintain their non-immigrant status during the Covid-19 emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panic-among-indian-students-due-to-new-ice-guideline/story-OGnJrhSTGPjX5xDD5eNhwK.html

07-07-2020||World||Trump insists that school open, but teachers aren’t so sure||President Donald Trump has made his position clear: “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” he tweeted Monday. As Covid-19 surges in parts of the US, many teachers aren’t convinced.The pandemic’s ever-shifting nature has robbed school districts of the ability to plan with certainty -- not only for instruction, but to provide protective equipment and intensive cleaning. Even if a sustained decline in infections allows them to open their doors, many are preparing a mix of in-person and remote education that is certain to fall short of the president’s expectations.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The reality is that they have to map out several scenarios for the fall with the real possibility that they don’t know what the scenario will be on the first day of school,” said Betheny Gross, associate director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington at Bothell, which has been tracking districts’ responses to the coronavirus shutdown.In Washington on Tuesday, Trump will host a gathering of health and education leaders -- as well as students and parents -- for an event billed as a “National Dialogue on Safely Reopening America’s Schools.”The event comes as many students approach five months without setting foot in a classroom. Proponents of returning say distance learning is hobbling children’s development and the economy, with parents trying to juggle work and their offspring. Many teachers say they’re well aware of the benefits of face-to-face instruction, but worry about endangering students and peers.“The Trump Administration is committed to working in partnership with university presidents, superintendents, principals, counselors, teachers, health professionals, parents, and students to ensure in-person learning resumes in a safe and healthy way,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.Economic dragTrump’s demand that schools open this fall was a reminder of how politicized the issue has become. “It’s not surprising,” said Douglas Harris, chair of the Department of Economics at Tulane University in New Orleans and a public-education expert. “The economy can’t really open back up again until kids go back to school.”Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the nation’s biggest teachers union, said schools need a massive allocation of federal stimulus funds to purchase protective equipment and hire cleaners. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday predicted Congress this month will pass one final rescue package.Teachers agree that remote instruction isn’t optimal, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. The real debate, she said, is around how to return to school safely -- and the need for money to do it right.“Either you have to be a moron about not understanding how government or schools work, or you have to be really callous and craven that you’d wait till the end, till it’s almost too late,” Weingarten said.To maintain social distancing, schools will have to use lunchrooms, gyms, libraries and trailers as classrooms. Some are considering rotating classes in mornings and afternoons or three days a week. Others may keep older pupils online, while using high-school classrooms for younger children who don’t learn well via Zoom, Garcia said.Gross said schools may also need to rotate through different scenarios as the school year goes on and the pandemic changes anew.In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday reiterated that no decision has been made on whether students across the state will be able to return for in-person learning in the fall.“We obviously very much would like to,” Cuomo said, adding that New York City and 700 school districts are in the process of developing reopening plans that must be submitted to the state.In Texas, where Covid-19 cases have surged since the state embarked on one of the country’s most aggressive reopening plans, most teachers surveyed by the Houston Federation of Teachers have said they would prefer to not return to in-person learning until it is “safe,” according to Andy Dewey, the group’s executive vice president.Defining safe“The definition of safe is where we have disagreement,” he said by phone Monday. “The problem is this: The district hasn’t given us any guidance on it because the district says the state hasn’t given any guidance on it.”The latest survey conducted by the El Paso branch of the AFT showed that just 7% of 790 respondents were in favor of full face-to-face learning at the start of the school year. About 20% said they supported a “hybrid” return, while roughly 72% said they favored remote learning. The city and surrounding area’s two main school districts both plan to start the first few weeks of the year virtually.Teachers for the Houston Independent School District have until the end of this week to decide whether they want to resign to avoid potentially being required to return to classrooms. After that, they risk having their teaching certificates suspended for a year if they defy an in-person start to the school year, with a permanent notation that could make it harder for them to get hired in other districts, Dewey said.Leslie LaFollette, a third-grade teacher at Kiker Elementary in Austin, said she’s prepared to move to Massachusetts, where her wife has family, if educators aren’t allowed to stick to online learning.“It’s drastic, but I’m willing to do that if we lose the option,” said LaFollette, 46. “I miss my kids, I want to be with them. But not to the detriment of their health and my health.”In Seattle, site of the first major US outbreak, officials are pursuing a hybrid reopening. Parents have been asked to fill out a questionnaire with their preferences so the district can plan. In August, families must finalize their pick.“We’re focusing on making that as equitable and safe as possible,” said Julie Popper, spokeswoman for the Seattle Educational Association, which represents some 6,000 members, including teachers and staff.Before opening, the union wants to make sure Seattle is spending enough on staff and protective equipment to meet state health and safety rules, as well as adding custodial workers to disinfect, and having nurses and mental-health professionals in every school daily, Popper said.Peer interactionIn North Carolina, Angie Mangin is optimistic about getting her two incoming eighth-graders back to school, especially her daughter, after having them home-learning since March.“My son wasn’t too affected by the change, but my daughter needs that interaction with her peers,” said Mangin, 54, who works in the insurance and risk department of Circle K convenience stores.Tulane’s Harris, who studies the economics of education and education policy, said there’s simply no guarantee everyone is going back. “It’s hard to imagine that schools will reopen fully in person on a large scale,” he said.Trump, who avoids wearing a mask in public and has convened rallies without social-distancing requirements, has urged local governments to reopen. Stacy Davis Gates, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union and executive vice president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, said she didn’t trust him to lead on education policy.“President Trump has been virtually missing in action with respect to keeping Americans safe countrywide,” Gates said. “It gives me a great amount of anxiety to know that he is going to set the standard for my children and America’s children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-insists-that-school-open-but-teachers-aren-t-so-sure/story-6G2MS5pwH82cKkNOfZyBkM.html
07-07-2020||World||TikTok quits Hong Kong as US giants suspend processing data requests||Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok announced on Tuesday it would pull out of Hong Kong within days, as global tech giants struggle to figure out how to operate in the city under sweeping new security rules imposed by Beijing.Major U.S. internet companies including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Zoom have all announced they have suspended the processing of requests for user data from the Hong Kong authorities while they study the new law.The U.S. companies’ social media platforms are generally banned in China, where access is blocked by Beijing’s “great firewall”. Most have operated freely in Hong Kong, but will now have to determine how to comply with new rules for the city, which rights groups say threaten freedoms enjoyed for decades.Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, said in a statement on Monday it was pausing reviews of user data requests for all of its services “pending further assessment of the National Security Law.”Google and Twitter said they had suspended their reviews of data requests from Hong Kong authorities immediately after the law went into effect last week. Zoom and Microsoft’s LinkedIn issued similar statements on Tuesday.Apple said it does not receive requests for user content directly from Hong Kong, but requires authorities there to submit requests through the U.S. department of justice under a legal assistance treaty.“We’re assessing the new law, which went into effect less than a week ago, and we have not received any content requests since the law went into effect,” Apple said in a statement. Tuesday’s announcement by TikTok of its plan to quit Hong Kong is notable because the short-form video app is owned by a Chinese company but operates only outside of mainland China. Its parent company, ByteDance, runs a separate, similar service inside China, while saying TikTok is intended to appeal to users worldwide. Its exit means Hong Kong users, like those in mainland China, will now be cut off from the global version.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday Washington was considering banning TikTok in the United States. Asked if Americans should download it, he told Fox News: “Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”A source familiar with TikTok’s decision to exit Hong Kong said the city was a small, loss making market for the platform.RADICAL CHANGESChina’s parliament passed the national security legislation last week, setting the stage for the most radical changes to the former British colony’s way of life since it returned to Chinese rule 23 years ago. Hong Kong late on Monday published more details about how the new law will strengthen police powers over the internet, including the ability to ask publishers to remove information deemed a threat to national security.Asked about the moves by the U.S. tech firms, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a news conference on Tuesday: “Ultimately, time and facts will tell that this law will not undermine human rights and freedoms.”Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in response to a question on TikTok’s plan to exit Hong Kong, said the business environment would improve after the law was established. “We hope the relevant sides will view China’s rights in safeguarding its sovereignty and safety in a fair, objective and reasonable manner, to speak and act cautiously on the Hong Kong issue, to not selectively create barriers and politicize the issue,” he said.King-wa Fu, an associate professor at The University of Hong Kong’s Journalism and Media Studies Centre, said he expected Hong Kong to introduce measures to regulate media and the Internet, with a system of censorship similar to that in mainland China.“That’s why (the platforms) are ‘suspending’ and evaluating the situation. I don’t have a crystal ball. But I believe the national security office wouldn’t tolerate a free Internet in Hong Kong to continue and further restrictions would be imposed,” he said.Some Hong Kong residents say they are reviewing their social media posts, deleting ones that could be viewed as sensitive.“It’s not safe anymore if the government really does this,” said Richard Lai, 26, a former medical worker. “I’ll keep using the social media platforms but will just use it for obtaining information but will not post anything.”Messaging app Signal, which promises end-to-end encryption, has seen a surge in sign-ups by Hong Kong residents.“We’d announce that we’re stopping too, but we never started turning over user data to HK police. Also, we don’t have user data to turn over,” it said on Twitter on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-quits-hong-kong-as-us-giants-suspend-processing-data-requests/story-PndLAo7Z7WdDNKkVSH0BeJ.html
07-07-2020||World||Doctors say experimental treatment may have rid man of HIV||A Brazilian man infected with the AIDS virus has shown no sign of it for more than a year since he stopped HIV medicines after an intense experimental drug therapy aimed at purging hidden, dormant virus from his body, doctors reported Tuesday.The case needs independent verification and it’s way too soon to speculate about a possible cure, scientists cautioned.“These are exciting findings but they’re very preliminary,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. “This has happened to one person, and one person only,” and it didn’t succeed in four others given the same treatment, she said.Another UCSF specialist, Dr. Steven Deeks, said: “This is not a cure,” just an interesting case that merits more study.The case was described at an AIDS conference where researchers also disclosed an important prevention advance: A shot of an experimental medicine every two months worked better than daily Truvada pills to help keep uninfected gay men from catching HIV from an infected sex partner. Hundreds of thousands of people take these “pre-exposure prevention” pills now and the shot could give a new option, almost like a temporary vaccine.If the Brazil man’s case is confirmed, it would be the first time HIV has been eliminated in an adult without a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Independent experts want to see whether his remission lasts and for the intense drug combination that he received to undergo more testing.“I’m very moved because it’s something that millions of people want,” said the 35-year-old man, whose spoke to The Associated Press on condition that his name not be published. “It’s a gift of life, a second chance to live.”Transplants are how two other men, nicknamed the Berlin and London patients for where they were treated, were cured previously.“I’m the living proof it’s possible to be cured,” Adam Castillejo, the London patient, said in a news conference at the AIDS meeting, which is being held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.He and the Berlin patient, Timothy Ray Brown, had donors with a gene that confers natural immunity to HIV infection. Such transplants are too medically risky and impractical to attempt on a large scale, so doctors have been trying other approaches.It’s hard to eliminate HIV because it establishes an early “reservoir” of blood cells where it lies dormant and can’t be attacked by medicines or the immune system. Infections can be controlled with drugs, but as soon as patients stop taking them, the dormant virus activates and renews the disease.Dr. Ricardo Diaz of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil led a study testing strong and new drug combinations to try to purge this reservoir.“We are trying to wake up the virus” and boost the immune system’s ability to eliminate it once it’s flushed out of hiding, Diaz explained. The Brazil man had been taking a standard three-drug combo to suppress his virus. In September 2015, Diaz added two newer ones to intensify his treatment — dolutegravir and maraviroc — plus nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3 that may help expose dormant virus.After nearly a year, the patient went back to the standard three drugs for two more years, then stopped all HIV medicines in March 2019. The virus has been undetectable in many blood and tissue samples since then.“We can’t search the entire body, but by the best evidence, we do not have infected cells,” Diaz said.The most convincing evidence: Tests show the man has lost nearly all HIV antibodies — substances the immune system makes when fighting the virus.Eager for independent verification, the patient said he went to a counseling center for an anonymous HIV test in February. It was negative.“He made a picture of the results” and sent a photo of them, Diaz said.The antibody results are “the most fascinating part of this story,” said Deeks. “These are solid scientists” and “the team may have come up with something that helps,” but it’s going to take verification of these results and much more testing to know, he said.In particular, doctors will want to see proof from blood tests that the patient truly had stopped his HIV medicines. Diaz said all HIV patients in Brazil get their medicines from a government health program and that he verified the man had stopped.“I think it’s very promising. This patient might be cured,” but it will take more time to know, Diaz said.The treatment did not succeed in four others treated the same way, or in any of the others in the 30-person study testing related approaches.Diaz said he has approval for a new study in 60 patients, sponsored by government grants in Brazil and by ViiV Healthcare, the British company that makes maraviroc.Dr. Anton Pozniak, head of the AIDS conference and an HIV specialist at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, said more time is needed to see if the virus rebounds.“I’m waiting. I’m a skeptic about all of this ... until a couple of years go by,” he said.The separate study on prevention involved nearly 4,600 people in North and South America, Asia, and Africa. It tested shots of ViiV’s experimental drug cabotegravir against daily pills of Truvada, the Gilead Sciences drug already approved for preventing HIV infection.The study was stopped early, in May, when the shot seemed at least as effective as the pills. Final results now show the shot works better — there were 13 new infections among those who got it versus 39 among those taking Truvada, said the study leader, Dr. Raphael Landovitz of the University of California, Los Angeles.“People can stay protected without having taken a pill every day,” he said. “You get a shot and you don’t have to do anything for two months. That’s incredibly powerful.”The results “could revolutionize prevention for HIV worldwide” and give a new option for people who don’t want to take a daily pill, Gandhi said.ViiV has said it will seek U.S. approval for cabotegravir; its eventual price is unknown. Truvada costs $1,600 to $1,800 a month, but what patients pay out of pocket depends on insurance and other factors. With either drug, people are still urged to use condoms to prevent other sexually spread diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctors-say-experimental-treatment-may-have-rid-man-of-hiv/story-Zofp8NRPI5cvnMArU1eAIP.html
07-07-2020||World||Hong Kong local coronavirus cases jump rapidly, alarming health officials||Hong Kong reported its largest number of local coronavirus transmission cases in almost three months, stumping local health officials and reflecting the difficulty of eradicating the pathogen.The city found nine new local cases, government officials said in a press briefing Tuesday. That’s the most since at least April 8, according to government data. Authorities have yet to determine how five of the patients contracted the disease.“Over the weekend, Hong Kong’s local epidemic rapidly changed,” said Wong Ka-hing, an official with the Department of Health. “The situation is very severe. The new local cases are quite a lot. We will increase monitoring.”The emergence of hidden transmission chains of the virus, which can be spread via asymptomatic carriers, is a setback for a city that had largely succeeded in containing the disease for months. It also occurs two weeks after the government’s latest easing of social-distancing restrictions.Hong Kong isn’t alone in battling flare-ups of the disease. Australia’s second-largest city recently re-entered virus lockdown, while Tokyo continues to find more than a hundred new coronavirus cases daily. In Beijing, the city is showing signs of emerging from a second wave of virus cases after reporting zero new patients on Tuesday for the first time in 26 days.Hong Kong had only reported about a dozen of new local cases in June. The latest outbreak threatens to further undermine the battered economy, which shrank by a record 8.9% in the first quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-local-coronavirus-cases-jump-rapidly-alarming-health-officials/story-3dWVhh6dkwKUMvClTLJJYK.html
07-07-2020||World||Kenya declares school year ‘lost’, classes back in 2021||Kenya on Tuesday declared that its school year was considered lost because of the coronavirus pandemic, and primary and secondary pupils would return to class next January.The school year in the East African country runs from January to November, when it climaxes with end-of-term exams.But Education Minister George Magoha said in a statement that the curve of Covid-19 infections was expected to flatten only by December.As a result, no primary and secondary school examinations will be held and “the 2020 school calendar year will be considered lost due to Covid-19 restrictions”, he said.Kenya closed schools on March 15 when it had only three confirmed cases, among a raft of measures taken that month including a nighttime curfew to combat the spread of the virus.President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday announced a “phased reopening” of the country, with international flights resuming on August 1 and the lifting of internal travel restrictions that had cordoned off the capital for four months. The 9pm to 4am curfew will remain in place.However cases are surging, with over 8,000 reported infections and 164 deaths.“Faced with this uncertain environment, the stakeholders have resolved to reopen all basic education learning institutions in January 2021,” said Magoha. “This is based on the assumption that the infection curve will have flattened by December, 2020.”The decisions “will apply to all children,” the statement said, specifying that this included schools offering international curriculum.Initially Kenya had planned to reopen schools in September for those in their final years of primary and secondary school to allow them to take their exams, however the mounting infection rate resulted in the shelving of this plan, the statement said.The re-opening of universities will take place on a “case-by-case” basis, and the institutions were encouraged to consider phased re-opening and continue holding virtual classes and graduation ceremonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenya-declares-school-year-lost-classes-back-in-2021/story-zpxZsoACtqn4hGtLsPAirJ.html

However, Trudeau has turned down the invitation from Trump.The official version for Trudeau avoiding the Washington trip is that Trudeau is participating in a virtual Cabinet retreat leading up to a session of Parliament where Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present a fiscal update relating to the economy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in lieu of a regular budget.However, Trudeau has been miffed with Trump in recent days. In a media briefing last week, he said, “We’re obviously concerned about the proposed issue of tariffs on aluminum and steel that the Americans have floated recently,” according to the outlet CBC News.Trudeau had also expressed concern over having to self-isolate for two weeks on returning from the United States, as is now mandated in Canada.Trudeau spoke to Mexican President Obrador on Monday and “expressed regret that he is unable to travel to Washington D.C. this week and wished President López Obrador a successful meeting with the President of the United States, Donald Trump,” according to a readout issued by the Canadian PMO.They also “agreed” that the recent entry into force of the new NAFTA will “strengthen the deep economic ties and longstanding friendship between Canada and Mexico, and advance social as well as economic development in both countries.” There was no word on whether Trudeau held a similar call with Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-to-skip-usmca-pact-meet-with-trump-obrador-in-washington/story-hQ5dKcnYtuIfEFruNgOQ6O.html
07-07-2020||World||New at Saudi hajj: Bottled holy water, sterilized pebbles||Saudi Arabia has issued guidelines for the 1,000 or so pilgrims that will be allowed to perform the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca later this month, an experience that will be unlike any before because of the coronavirus pandemic.The pilgrims will be only be able to drink holy water from the Zamzam well in Mecca that is packaged in plastic bottles, and pebbles for casting away evil that are usually picked up by pilgrims along hajj routes will be sterilized and bagged ahead of time. Pilgrims will also have to bring their own prayer rugs.The guidelines were announced on Monday as Saudi authorities prepare to carry out a very limited hajj, which for the first time will not include pilgrims from outside the country. Instead, the kingdom said that 70% of pilgrims allowed to participate this year will be from among foreign residents of Saudi Arabia while 30% would be Saudi citizens.Saudi pilgrims will be selected from among healthcare workers and security personnel who have recovered from Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. The government said their selection represents a “token of appreciation for their role in providing care” during the pandemic.Saudi Arabia has one of the Middle East’s largest outbreaks of the virus, with infection rates rising by 3,000-4,000 cases daily. More than 213,000 people have contracted the virus in the kingdom so far, including 1,968 who have died.The new guidelines also mandate that foreign residents in Saudi Arabia who want to participate in this year’s pilgrimage should be between the ages of 20 and 50, and that have not performed the hajj before. The pilgrims will have to quarantine before and after the hajj, and they will be tested for the coronavirus. Those eligible have until Friday to submit an application through the kingdom’s Hajj Ministry’s website.The hajj is not only a once-in-a-lifetime requirement for Muslims but also a chance to wipe away past sins and connect with Muslims from different walks of life.Saudi Arabia dramatically scaled back the hajj due to concerns about overcrowding at the annual pilgrimage, which usually draws 2.5 million people. The crowds move, pray and stand in extremely close proximity, often squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder, as they carry out five days of rites around Mecca.Saudi Arabia said its decision to curtail the hajj was aimed at preserving global public health because of the risks associated with large gatherings.Pilgrims normally crowd and push their way toward the cube-shaped Kaaba, which is Islam’s holiest site and the metaphorical house of God. This year, authorities said anyone participating in the hajj will not be allowed to touch the Kaaba as part of the new safety measures.Pilgrims this year will also have to wear masks, maintain physical distance during prayers and sleep in tents that follow guidelines on social distancing.Elsewhere in the Mideast, Israel’s parliament early on Tuesday passed an emergency bill allowing the government to bypass the house in making immediate decisions on combating a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus.Lawmakers supporting the bill said it was essential, given the fast-spreading nature of the virus, but some opposition lawmakers decried the sidelining of the legislature as another step in undermining the foundations of Israeli democracy.On Monday, the Israeli government reimposed new restrictions on the public, limiting gatherings and ordering reception halls, restaurants, bars, theaters, fitness centers and pools be shut down again.Just weeks ago, Israel appeared to have contained its initial outbreak after imposing strict measures early on in the pandemic. But after reporting just a handful of new cases a day in early May, it has experienced a steady uptick following an easing of restrictions. Currently, Israel is reporting upward of 1,000 new cases a day — higher than its peak during the previous wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-at-saudi-hajj-bottled-holy-water-sterilized-pebbles/story-FudGVDmoBLapbm8G2Z6XIO.html

Biegun is to discuss “allied cooperation” on the “final, fully verified denuclearisation” of North Korea, among other issues, during his meetings with officials in Seoul and Tokyo this week, according to the US State Department.The phrase is Washington’s goal for its negotiations with Pyongyang, but the North has made clear it has no intention of giving up its arsenal while it sees itself as threatened by a US invasion.Biegun’s plane landed at Osan air base south of Seoul, local media reported.Hours before his arrival, senior North Korean foreign ministry official Kwon Jong Gun released a statement reiterating the North had no intention to sit down with the US, while urging Seoul to “stop meddling”.“It is just the time for it to stop meddling in others’ affairs but it seems there is no cure or prescription for its bad habit,” Kwon said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.“Explicitly speaking once again, we have no intention to sit face to face with the United States.”Talks over Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal have been stalled since a Hanoi summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed in early 2019 over what the North would be willing to give up in exchange for sanctions relief.Kim declared in December an end to moratoriums on nuclear and ballistic missile tests, and Pyongyang has repeatedly said it has no intention to continue talks unless Washington drops what it describes as “hostile” policies toward the North.Biegun also suggested last month that another meeting between Trump and Kim is unlikely, although he held out hope for progress in nuclear negotiations. Even so, rumours surrounding the possibility of another summit swirled last week, after former US national security advisor John Bolton reportedly said Trump might pursue another meeting with Kim in October, if it would help his re-election chances.South Korean President Moon Jae-in -- who has long backed engagement with the North -- also called for another Kim-Trump meeting before the US presidential election in November, saying the South would make “utmost efforts” to help arrange it.But the North’s Kwon described Moon as a “meddlesome man”, saying his administration was “guided by the habit of always talking in their own favour”.Kwon’s statement came days after North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said the Trump administration considered diplomacy with the North as “nothing more than a tool” to deal with its own political crisis, adding the North does not feel “any need” to sit down with the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-to-north-korea-arrives-in-south-after-pyongyang-rejects-talks/story-ROI3889hut2qLbyKoao7UP.html
07-07-2020||World||Covid-19: Face covering a must, says Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan||Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan on Tuesday told those who remain sceptical about using face coverings that not using them should be considered as much an anti-social act as driving after imbibing alcohol or driving without putting on seat-belts.Ramakrishnan, who is president of Royal Society, made the intervention as two new reports added to studies highlighting the benefits of wearing face coverings to prevent coronavirus infection for the wearer as we all for those around her.He said: “It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts. Today both of those would be considered anti-social, and not wearing face coverings in public should be regarded in the same way”.“If all of us wear one, we protect each other and thereby ourselves, reducing transmission. We lower the chances of future surges and lockdowns which are economically and psychologically disruptive, and we increase the chance of eliminating the virus. Not doing so increases the risk for everyone”.One of the two reports presents mounting evidence for the effectiveness of wearing face coverings in reducing the risk of transmission, authored by Paul Edelstein of the University of Pennsylvania and Lalita Ramakrishan of the University of Cambridge.The second report, by the Royal Society’s SET-C (Science in Emergencies Tasking – Covid-19) group looks at the effectiveness of different face mask types and coverings and isolates behavioural factors that have limited adherence such as public understanding of the virus transmission, risk perception, trust, effectiveness of public messages and perceived barriers to wearing a mask.In Britain, the people are much less likely to wear face coverings in public compared to other countries, including the United States.Ramakrishnan said: “The UK is way behind many countries in terms of wearing masks and clear policies and guidelines about mask wearing for the public. The public have taken to hand-washing and distancing but remain sceptical about face coverings”.“You only need to go on public transport, where they are supposed to be mandatory, to see how many people are ignoring this new rule based on the growing body of evidence that wearing a mask will help protect others – and might even protect you”.According to him, there are multiple factors why the people have not taken to face coverings. Since the message has not been clear enough, the people may not understand the benefits or are not convinced of them.“Whatever the reasons, we need to overcome our reservations and wear face coverings whenever we are around others in public”, he said.The Royal Society has sent up groups comprising leading experts to find the most important factors that can help slow the spread of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-face-covering-a-must-says-nobel-laureate-venki-ramakrishnan/story-xuKejxtiZ0CkqBL5mcNCAK.html

We’re not going to stand by and let China or anyone else take the reins in terms of being the most powerful, dominant force, whether it’s in that region or over here,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News on Monday.“And the message is clear. Our military might stands strong and will continue to stand strong, whether it’s in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else,” Meadows said in response to a question.He was told that India banned Chinese apps because Indian soldiers were killed by Chinese troops last month and asked what’s mission of the two aircraft carriers - the Ronald Reagan and the Nimitz - and what’s America’s mission.The troops of India and China are locked in an eight-week standoff in several areas in eastern Ladakh including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and Gogra Hot Spring. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC.Also Read: The Middle Kingdom’s rush of blood and the need for strong Indian deterrenceThe Chinese military on Monday began withdrawing troops from the Galwan Valley and Gogra Hot Spring after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held lengthy talks on Sunday. Doval and Wang are also the special representatives on the India-China boundary talks. The United States has sent two of its aircraft carriers to the South China Sea. “Our mission is to make sure that the world knows that we still have the preeminent fighting force on the face of the globe,” Meadows said.President Donald Trump has invested more in the US military, more in not only the hardware, but the men and women who serve so sacrificially each and every day, he said. “He (Trump) continues to do so,” he added.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the area.Meadows also hinted that President Trump might sign an executive order that relates to China, among other issues.“I’ll give you a couple of hints, all right. So, a sneak preview here. We’re going to be looking at how we make sure that China is addressed, how we bring manufacturing back from overseas to make sure the American worker is supported,” he said.“We’re also going to look at a number of issues as it relates to immigration. We’re going to look at a number of issues as it relates to prescription drug prices and we’re going to get them done when Congress couldn’t get them done,” Meadows said.Appearing on the same Fox News on Monday talk show with host Brian Kilmeade, influential Republican Senator Tom Cotton said that the US aircraft carriers are headed to the South China Sea to thwart off any Chinese misadventure against Taiwan or other countries in the region.“That’s one of the reasons why we have those aircraft carrier groups in the South China Sea. I mean, look what China did in the southwest. It’s essentially invaded India over the last few weeks and killed Indian soldiers,” Cotton said.“No country on China’s periphery, right now, is safe from Chinese aggression. All those countries want a close relationship with the United States. We ought to have one,” Cotton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-to-stand-with-india-in-conflict-with-china-indicates-white-house-official/story-lCB1yu2KrOLuNKz4g7c1FI.html
07-07-2020||World||China urges Canada to correct mistake on extradition treaty||China condemned Canada’s suspension of its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, calling it a “serious violation” of international law and a “flagrant interference” in its domestic affairs.“We urge the Canadian side to correct its mistake and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China’s domestic affairs to prevent further damage to bilateral relations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing in Beijing on Monday, responding to a question about new Canadian measures including the treaty’s suspension and an updated Hong Kong travel advisory.“China condemns that and reserves the right to take further actions,” Zhao said. “All consequences shall be borne by the Canadian government.”Shortly following the briefing, the Chinese embassy in Canada advised Chinese citizens traveling to the country to exercise caution citing “frequent use of violence from local law enforcement” and protests in Canada, according to the embassy’s official WeChat account.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced measures including the suspension of the extradition treaty last week, making his country the first to break law enforcement links with Hong Kong since China handed down a sweeping new national security law that’s raised concerns about the city’s autonomy from the mainland. Hong Kong’s large expatriate community includes some 300,000 Canadians.Trudeau’s move stands to inflame already-heightened tensions between Canada and China stemming from the 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. Her case has been closely linked to Beijing’s subsequent detention of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were charged with espionage last month.Other steps announced by Trudeau will include a ban on the export of sensitive military equipment to the Asian financial hub Hong Kong and a travel advisory warning of the security law’s impact. Hong Kong has extradition pacts with 30 countries and jurisdictions around the world.“Canada’s erroneous remarks on Hong Kong and its measures show a disregard of the basic fact that the national security law in Hong Kong is conducive to the sustained implementation of ‘one country, two systems,’” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-urges-canada-to-correct-mistake-on-extradition-treaty/story-l8o8JHLi1llfffLGC5ujfL.html
07-07-2020||World||Melbourne Australia’s second-largest city re-enters 6-week virus lockdown||Australia’s second-most populous state announced a six-week lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne as a coronavirus outbreak risks triggering a second wave of infections in the nation.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said from midnight Wednesday people must stay home except for work, essential services, medical treatment or school. The state recorded 191 new cases overnight, the biggest daily increase since the crisis began.“These are unsustainably high numbers of new cases,” he told reporters. At such levels it is impossible to “suppress and contain this virus without taking significant steps.”The lockdown dashes the hopes of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who’d aimed for most social-distancing restrictions across the nation and border closures to be lifted by the end of July in a bid to revive the crippled economy. The Victoria outbreak risks deepening and prolonging the nation’s first recession in almost three decades, while wearying Australians who’d hoped the first wave of restrictions imposed in late March had crushed the infection curve.The Australian dollar fell 0.2% to 69.57 US after the announcement, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index hit a session low.“The overall recovery of the Australian economy is expected to be significantly hindered by the second lockdown,” IBISWorld said in an emailed statement on Tuesday, pointing out that Victoria contributed almost 24% to the nation’s gross domestic product in fiscal 2019.Victoria’s northern neighbor New South Wales will close their shared border from midnight, for the first time since the 1919 Spanish Flu pandemic.The lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne is a dramatic escalation of the state’s response, after it recorded more than two weeks of double-digit daily increases in case numbers. In recent days, authorities have ordered residents in 12 of the city’s poorer and more multicultural suburbs to stay at home except for work and essential shopping. At the weekend, about 3,000 residents of public-housing tower blocks were barred from leaving their apartments.Melbourne Covid Second Wave Sets Back Tourism, Education HubWhile Australia has been one of the standout performers globally in limiting the spread of the virus to less than 9,000 cases, Victoria’s flare-up shows just how hard it will be to eradicate without a vaccine.“I know there will be enormous amounts of damage that will be done because of this,” Andrews told reporters. “But we can’t pretend it’s over. It is not over in so many parts of the world and it is not over in metropolitan Melbourne and to a certain extent right across Victoria.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-australia-s-second-largest-city-re-enters-6-week-virus-lockdown/story-xiMgGleea84Az4zKsnRrAP.html
07-07-2020||World||France: Emmanuel Macron ousts security chief after police protests||French President Emmanuel Macron ousted his top security official Monday following protests over police brutality as part of a government shakeup aimed at focusing on France’s post-pandemic economic recovery for the remaining two years of Macron’s term.In a surprise move, Macron named a provocative lawyer who has defended WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and suspected terrorists as head of the Justice Ministry. A former Green Party lawmaker was appointed to lead the powerful Ministry for Ecological Transition after Macron came under criticism for lagging on promises to cut emissions.The 42-year-old centrist leader, whose presidency has been buffeted by protests and now the virus crisis, promised that the new government would be one of “purpose and unity.” Macron tweeted that his 2017 campaign promises to modernize France and free up its businesses remain central to his agenda, but he “must adapt to the international upheavals and crises we are experiencing. A new path must be forged.”First among the priorities that Macron listed is helping the world’s sixth-largest economy recover from the battering delivered by the coronavirus pandemic. His new lineup includes some new faces but also leans heavily on loyalists as Macron seeks to steady the country.One key change is at the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police. Former budget minister Gerald Darmanin was named to replace Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, who had come under fire amid widespread French protests against racial injustice and police violence spurred by the death of George Floyd in the United States.In response, Castaner initially announced a ban on the use of chokeholds in policing, but he then backed down in the face of counter-demonstrations and pressure by police unions. He also launched an experiment with expanded Taser use.Darmanin, a member of Macron’s young guard, is a former conservative who joined Macron’s centrist party in 2017 and is seen as outspoken but effective.The new government reflects a balance of figures from the left and right and from outside politics altogether -- like Eric Dupond-Moretti, arguably France’s most famous lawyer.Among his clients have been Assange; accomplices to Mohamed Merah, who killed Jewish children, a rabbi and paratroopers in a 2012 rampage around Toulouse; and former French government ministers accused of tax fraud or sexual harassment.Two other important changes are at the Labor Ministry, whose new chief, Elisabeth Borne, will have to deal with a pending surge in unemployment, and the Ministry for Ecological Transition, to be led by former Green Party legislator Barbara Pompili.Macron didn’t change the finance or health ministers, posts central to helping France through the virus crisis and recession, or the foreign and defense ministers.The new government will be led by Prime Minister Jean Castex. who was appointed Friday. Macron last week ditched Edouard Philippe, who as prime minister steered France through its coronavirus lockdown and the first three years of Macron’s presidency.Castex is a career civil servant, and his low profile suggests that Macron doesn’t want to be overshadowed should he choose to seek reelection in 2022. Macron has not yet said if he’ll run for a second term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-emmanuel-macron-ousts-security-chief-after-police-protests/story-4xmzNc087hRxRvHx47YpWL.html

Sinovac said the study, which will be done in partnership with Brazilian vaccine producer the Instituto Butantan, would recruit nearly 9,000 healthcare professionals working in Covid-19 specialised facilities and start this month.AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine, developed by researchers at the University of Oxford, and China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) are the only other candidates in late-stage Phase III trials.Moderna also plans to start its late-stage trial this month.Sinovac initiated the development of the vaccine candidate in late January and is preparing a coronavirus vaccine plant, which it hopes will be ready this year and capable of making up to 100 million shots a year. Phase I and Phase II trials typically test the safety of a drug before it enters Phase III trials that test its efficacy. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there are 19 vaccine trials in clinical evaluation and hundreds being developed and tested around the world to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and ravaged the global economy.No Covid-19 vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis last year found that about one in three vaccines in the first stage of testing later gains approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinovac-starts-late-stage-trials-for-its-covid-19-vaccine/story-PtIj0xhL57Z2kDOZ4zqbXP.html

US lawmakers have raised national security concerns over TikTok’s handling of user data, saying they were worried about Chinese laws requiring domestic companies “to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.”The app, which is not available in China, has sought to distance itself from its Chinese roots to appeal to a global audience and has emphasized its independence from China.Pompeo’s remarks also come amid increasing US-China tensions over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, China’s actions in Hong Kong and a nearly two-year trade war.TikTok, a short-form video app owned by China-based ByteDance, was recently banned in India along with 58 other Chinese apps after a border clash between India and China.Reuters reported late on Monday that TikTok would exit the Hong Kong market within days, deciding to do so after China’s establishment of a sweeping new national security law for the semi-autonomous city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tik-tok-could-be-banned-in-us-says-pompeo-report/story-HNU6F3v6iCiRUdzXc4VKNP.html
07-07-2020||World||‘They need food’: Yemen’s starving children, grim legacy of six years of war||Masirah Saqer could barely open her eyes, as she struggled to swallow the milk her grandmother attempted to feed her with a syringe.Nearby the cries of other malnourished children reverberated around the pink-walled hospital ward, a vivid reminder of the human cost of Yemen’s devastating conflict, which drags into a seventh year on Tuesday.Masirah, just short of three months old, was undergoing treatment at Al-Sabyine hospital’s infant malnutrition department in the capital Sanaa.Swaddled in a pink and white comforter, her tiny frame and slender limbs were dwarfed by the full-sized bed on which her grandmother sat as she tried to feed her.The war in Yemen, the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, has mutated into what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.After years of protests and political crises that escalated into violent clashes, the conflict took a decisive turn on July 8, 2014.Huthi rebels from the north pulled off a decisive victory in the battle for the city of Amran north of Sanaa, comprehensively defeating government troops.The major battlefield win opened the way for the rebels to march on the capital and take it with ease -- but not without a dire human cost, with millions eventually pushed to the brink of starvation.Brink of famineMasirah was one of the many thousands of infants affected by the conflict.Weighing just 2.4 kilograms (5.3 pounds), she suffered from acute malnutrition, her grandmother told AFP.“We needed a medical checkup, milk, and food. If the medicines are available in the hospital, they give them to us, if not we have to buy them outside,” she said.Millions of children in Yemen now face starvation due to a lack of aid for the country, UNICEF said in June.The long conflict has devastated the health system and displaced 3.3 million people who live in camps where cholera and other diseases are rife.The humanitarian situation has worsened since Saudi Arabia intervened in March 2015, leading a coalition in support of government forces against the rebels, who are in turn backed by Riyadh’s arch-rival Iran.Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, including hundreds of children, in air strikes and raids.Serious shortagesYemen, a country with scarce clean water supplies, is now facing another threat -- the spread of the novel coronavirus. Officially, the respiratory disease has killed 330 people in the country.Doctors at Al-Sabyine’s malnutrition department, a facility with capacity for 25 patients, have warned that COVID-19 coupled with fuel shortages have worsened the situation and acted as a barrier to treatment.Many parents fear their children are at risk of the deadly respiratory disease if they are hospitalised, said doctor Hazaa Abdallah al-Farah.“Some people ... won’t send their children to hospital any more” due to fears about the virus, he said.But the true scale of the impact of coronavirus in the Huthi-controlled north of Yemen remains a mystery. The internationally recognised government accuses the rebels of a cover-up.NGOs and the UN are braced for a catastrophe. UNICEF, the latter’s children’s agency, has called for $461 million to fund humanitarian work in Yemen and an additional $53 million to fight COVID-19.Despite the urgent need, only 39 percent of the first sum and just 10 percent of the second have so far been amassed, UNICEF says.The agency has also sounded the alarm over the reduction to its services on the ground.In June, the UN raised just $1.35 billion of the $2.41 billion it was aiming to secure for Yemen during a virtual donor conference.“They die in their homes unable to get to the health centre or hospital or a clinic because of their bad financial situation,” said Amin al-Aizari, another doctor at Al-Sabyine.“They need food,” he said. “The children of Yemen die every hour and every minute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-need-food-yemen-s-starving-children-grim-legacy-of-six-years-of-war/story-L957wCl40gHZHBoY2nOm0L.html

The bureau would take serious follow-up actions if any problems arise over the issue,” he added.Earlier on Sunday, South China Morning Post had reported that Hong Kong libraries have taken at least nine titles written by localist or democracy advocates out of circulation for conducting a review of whether the books run afoul of the new national security law.Bar Association chairman Philip Dykes had called the move to be alarming and said authorities needed to justify restricting the public’s right to seek information.The Leisure and Cultural Services Department, which manages the city’s public libraries, had confirmed it was scrutinising some books for compliance with the new law, without naming them.The Chinese-language books were written by activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung, localist Horace Chin Wan-kan and Civic Party lawmaker Tanya Chan. A search of the nine titles on the library website on Saturday found all the titles marked “under review”.Beijing drafted and passed the legislation late last month that targets acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison for the most serious offences.The move came after months of social upheaval triggered by opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill but that morphed into wider demands, including universal suffrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-schools-told-to-remove-books-that-might-violate-new-national-security-law/story-edoXM5ciV16iVTHDV0ZpkI.html
07-07-2020||World||TikTok says it will exit Hong Kong market within days||TikTok will exit the Hong Kong market within days, a spokesman told Reuters late on Monday, as other technology companies including Facebook Inc have suspended processing government requests for user data in the region.The short form video app owned by China-based ByteDance has made the decision to exit the region following China’s establishment of a sweeping new national security law for the semi-autonomous city.“In light of recent events, we’ve decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,” a TikTok spokesman said in response to a Reuters question about its commitment to the market.The company, now run by former Walt Disney Co executive Kevin Mayer, has said in the past that the app’s user data is not stored in China. TikTok has also said previously that it would not comply with any requests made by the Chinese government to censor content or for access to TikTok’s user data, nor has it ever been asked to do so. The Hong Kong region is a small, loss-making market for the company, one source familiar with the matter said. Last August, TikTok reported it had attracted 150,000 users in Hong Kong. Globally, TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times through the Apple and Google app stores after the first quarter this year, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. The source said the move was made because it was not clear if Hong Kong would now fall entirely under Beijing’s jurisdiction. TikTok was designed so it could not be accessed by mainland China. That was part of a strategy to appeal to a more global audience. ByteDance operates a similar short video sharing app called Douyin in China. Although there are no current plans to introduce Douyin to the Hong Kong market, a ByteDance spokesman said, the app already has a sizeable audience in the Asian financial centre as Chinese on the mainland travel and stay in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-says-it-will-exit-hong-kong-market-within-days/story-ZKSYt4caM83KnUJLBWnDmO.html

However, Trudeau has turned down the invitation from Trump.The official version for Trudeau avoiding the Washington trip is that Trudeau is participating in a virtual Cabinet retreat leading up to a session of Parliament where Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau will present a fiscal update relating to the economy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in lieu of a regular budget.However, Trudeau has been miffed with Trump in recent days. In a media briefing last week, he said, “We’re obviously concerned about the proposed issue of tariffs on aluminum and steel that the Americans have floated recently,” according to the outlet CBC News.Trudeau had also expressed concern over having to self-isolate for two weeks on returning from the United States, as is now mandated in Canada.Trudeau spoke to Mexican President Obrador on Monday and “expressed regret that he is unable to travel to Washington D.C. this week and wished President López Obrador a successful meeting with the President of the United States, Donald Trump,” according to a readout issued by the Canadian PMO.They also “agreed” tthat the recent entry into force of the new NAFTA will “strengthen the deep economic ties and longstanding friendship between Canada and Mexico, and advance social as well as economic development in both countries.” There was no word on whether Trudeau held a similar call with Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-to-skip-dinner-usmca-dinner-hosted-by-trump/story-bRbdIVrDZ9vMmrB34plI3I.html

He then proceeded on foot into the area before he was arrested by Royal Canadian Mounter Police or RCMP personnel patrolling there. Rideau Hall is the official residence of Canada’s Governor General Julie Payette while Trudeau and his family live close by at Rideau Cottage.Some Canadian media like the National Post said the documents suggested this may have been an “assassination attempt.” Neither Trudeau nor Payette were present in the area when the incident occurred. However, Rideau Cottage has been the venue for Trudeau’s high-profile media briefings during the period of the coronavirus crisis.While investigators did not comment on his motive, court documents cited by the outlet Global News appear to indicate he may have posed a threat to Trudeau. They alleged that Hurren “did knowingly utter a threat to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or convey a threat to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau or cause Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to receive a threat to cause death or bodily harm to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.”Hurren, who is from the town of Bowsman in the province of Manitoba, faces 22 criminal charges related to that episode. Police documents submitted to the court alleged he was carrying four loaded firearms, including two shotguns, a rifle and a revolver.He remains in custody and has a hearing scheduled for later this month. Hurren owned a sausage products business, GrindHouse Fine Foods which may have suffered from the restrictive measures implemented to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Before arriving a 1 Sussex Drive, where Rideau Hall is located, Hurren posted a link to a coronavirus-related conspiracy theory on the Facebook page for the business. He had made a similar post even earlier.The investigation into the intrusion is being led by the RCMP’s integrated national security team. Security in and around Rideau Hall has been enhanced since the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-held-near-canadian-pm-trudeau-s-home-may-have-attempted-assassination-report/story-pANGjSTK3z29Y2zjoUHWhP.html

Bolsonaro told supporters outside the presidential palace that he had just visited the hospital and been tested.“I can’t get very close,” he said in comments recorded by Foco do Brasil, a pro-government YouTube channel. “I came from the hospital. I underwent a lung scan. The lung’s clean.”The president’s office said in a statement that the president is at his home and is “in good health.”The right-wing populist has often defied local guidelines to wear a mask in public, even after a judge ordered him to do so in late June.Over the weekend, Bolsonaro attended several events and was in close contact with the U.S. ambassador to Brazil during July 4 celebrations. The U.S. embassy in Brasilia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bolsonaro tested negative for the coronavirus after several aides were diagnosed following a visit to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, Florida, estate in March.CNN Brasil reported that Bolsonaro has begun taking the drugs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which he touts as a Covid-19 treatment despite little proof of their effectiveness.Bolsonaro’s official events on Tuesday have been canceled, according to CNN Brasil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/my-lung-is-clean-bolsonaro-says-as-he-awaits-his-covid-19-results/story-FOxcBscce379JZtmg1oAVJ.html

Mexico has recorded 261,750 total cases and 31,119 overall deaths, putting it in fifth place worldwide for most fatalities from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally.Mexican Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell, the coronavirus czar, has continually walked back forecasts about when the crisis would peak, and has said the death toll and infection tally are likely higher than reported figures. In an interview with Mexico’s Radio Formula, he warned that coronavirus infections may persist in significant numbers into the winter, carrying the pandemic into spring.“Flu season begins in October and there are some reasonable assumptions that we could also have a spike in COVID-19 along with the flu throughout the fall-to-winter season,” he said.When asked about the length of the pandemic in Mexico, Lopez-Gatell said it could last “until March to April of next year.”The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has estimated that Mexico will exceed 88,000 deaths from the coronavirus by October.

07-07-2020||World||UK chooses fights as it seeks its place in a post-Brexit world||The UK reaffirmed its collision course with Beijing and Moscow on Monday as it sought to establish its place in the world after Brexit.China’s ambassador to London warned of “consequences” if Britain treats his country as a “hostile” power in its dealings over Hong Kong and Huawei Technologies Co., while Russian officials topped the list of people sanctioned for human rights abuses, sparking a threat of retaliation from the Kremlin.“As we forge a dynamic new vision for a truly global Britain, this Government are absolutely committed to the United Kingdom becoming an even stronger force for good in the world,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Parliament as he introduced the sanctions. He pledged “to keep the flame of freedom alive for those brave souls still suffering in the very darkest corners of the world.”The announcement of targeted sanctions on 49 individuals and organizations for human rights abuses immediately sparked calls from senior lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party for similar curbs on China. The demands highlight a tension for the UK as it seeks trade deals around the world after Brexit while trying to assert itself as a champion of freedom.“Britain’s future means balancing different interests and some tough choices,” said Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative and chairman of Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee. “But to get through this we need to remember what really matters and hold on to core beliefs -- none more than the rule of law.”Tensions, ‘Consequences’Tugendhat was joined by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith as senior MPs called for the sanctions, currently limited to Russia, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and North Korea, to be extended to Chinese officials for the suppression of protests in Hong Kong and human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. Some said Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam should be added to the list.Raab didn’t rule out including Chinese nationals and said he is already working on the next round of sanctions, which he told MPs are “a forensic tool” and have to be legally watertight before they are applied.The escalation of tensions came after it emerged Britain is preparing to phase Huawei out of plans for fifth-generation telecommunications networks, sparking a robust response from Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador in London.He accused the UK of following the bidding of the US over the Chinese technology giant and criticized its response to a crackdown on demonstrations in Hong Kong. Last week Johnson offered a fast-track to citizenship to almost 3 million residents of Britain’s former colony.“We want to be your friend, we want to be your partner, but if you want to make China a hostile partner you have to bear the consequences.” Liu said on a video call with reporters Monday. “If you dance to the tune of other countries, how can you call yourself Great Britain?”‘Significant Impact’A report from the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre concluded that new US sanctions mean Huawei will have to use untrusted technology, making security risks impossible to control, a person familiar with the matter said.Officials are drawing plans to speed up the removal of existing Huawei kit, although an exact timetable is yet to be set, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing unpublished proposals.Johnson, who set a US trade deal as the centerpiece of his international plans after Britain leaves the European Union, has been under heavy pressure from US President Donald Trump’s administration to drop Huawei from his plans. Washington warned future security cooperation could be under threat if London pressed on with the company after ministers cleared its participation in January.Monday’s sanctions were announced as Raab set out the British version of the US Magnitsky Act. They included visa bans and assets freezes for 20 Saudi citizens suspected of involvement in the killing of the columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, and two government entities in charge of North Korea’s prison camps.‘Unfriendly Decision’The action against Saudi nationals marks a change for the UK, which has long regarded the kingdom as a crucial ally and trade partner in the Middle East. Raab was asked in Parliament if the sanctions would be extended to others in the Saudi regime and neighboring countries, including Bahrain and the UAE.“It would be welcome if it marked the start of a more consistent approach from the Government towards Saudi Arabia, and in particular the arms sales from this country that are being used to harm innocent civilians in Yemen,” Lisa Nandy, foreign affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, told Parliament.The Magnitsky Act is named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in jail in 2009 after alleging officials were involved in tax fraud, and the list includes individuals implicated in his case. Twenty-five Russians were named by the Foreign Office.Raab, who compared Magnitsky to the Soviet-era dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn, said targeting individuals rather than states, will “allow us to continue to engage bilaterally with countries that, frankly, we need to.”That view was not shared by Russia, which said the UK’s targeting of judges and prosecutors was an “assault” on judicial independence.“Russia reserves the right to respond to today’s unfriendly decision by the UK on the basis of reciprocity,” Russia’s Embassy in London said in a statement. “It will not improve Russian-British relations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-chooses-fights-as-it-seeks-its-place-in-a-post-brexit-world/story-984d2ApNP9BvbyRFgc9gIK.html
07-07-2020||World||Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Google CEOs to testify to House on July 27||The chief executive officers of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. will testify on July 27 before a congressional panel investigating competition in the technology industry, according to an announcement from the House Judiciary Committee.Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook are likely to face a torrent of critical questions from lawmakers on the panel’s antitrust subcommittee as the investigation builds a case for revamping antitrust enforcement.Bezos may be in for a particularly tough session. Unlike the other chiefs, the world’s richest man will be addressing Congress for the first time, and his company has sparred with subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline over previous testimony by another company official and allegations of anticompetitive conduct.The appearances may be virtual, according to the Monday evening announcement, which said additional details on the format would be forthcoming.“Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming,” said Cicilline and Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler in a joint statement. “As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation.”Some of the companies had been reluctant to send their top executives even though Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has said he would be willing to subpoena CEOs. He has said he wants to use their appearances to inform a final report recommending changes to antitrust law.Antitrust scrutiny of giant technology companies is accelerating. Facebook and Alphabet’s Google both face competition inquiries by federal enforcers and nearly all 50 states. Amazon is under investigation in California, Bloomberg has reported, and both the e-commerce giant and Apple are facing scrutiny from the European Union.The Judiciary Committee had previously announced that the four men would testify, but had not set a date or format.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-facebook-apple-google-ceos-to-testify-to-house-on-july-27/story-zXQPxesMx5q5u30e7wzCYP.html
07-07-2020||World||US to force out foreign students whose classes move online due to Covid-19||The United States said Monday it would not allow foreign students to remain in the country if all of their classes are moved online in the fall because of the coronavirus crisis.“Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States,” US Immigration and Custom Enforcement said in a statement.“Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status,” ICE said.“If not, they may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.”ICE said the State Department “will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will US Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States.” F-1 students pursue academic coursework and M-1 students pursue “vocational coursework,” according to ICE.Universities with a hybrid system of in-person and online classes will have to show that foreign students are taking as many in-person classes as possible, to maintain their status.Critics quickly hit back at the decision. “The cruelty of this White House knows no bounds,” tweeted Senator Bernie Sanders.“Foreign students are being threatened with a choice: risk your life going to class-in person or get deported,” he said.For Gonzalo Fernandez, a 32-year-old Spaniard doing his doctorate in economics at George Washington University in the US capital, “the worst thing is the uncertainty.”“We don’t know if we will have classes next semester, if we should go home, if they are going to throw us out.”Plans up in the airMost US colleges and universities have not yet announced their plans for the fall semester.A number of schools are looking at a hybrid model of in-person and online instruction but some, including Harvard University, have said all classes will be conducted online.Harvard said 40 percent of undergraduates would be allowed to return to campus -- but their instruction would be conducted remotely.There were more than one million international students in the United States for the 2018-19 academic year, according to the Institute of International Education (IIE).That accounted for 5.5 percent of the total US higher education population, the IIE said, and international students contributed $44.7 billion to the US economy in 2018.The largest number of international students came from China, followed by India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada.According to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, who works as the policy counsel at the Washington-based think tank American Immigration Council, the new rule is “almost certainly going to be challenged in court.”He explained on Twitter that foreign students will likely struggle to continue their studies while abroad, due to time differences or a lack of access to technology or academic resources.President Donald Trump, who is campaigning for reelection in November, has taken a bullish approach to reopening the country even as virus infections continue to spike in parts of the country, particularly the south and west.“SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” he tweeted Monday.With more than 130,000 deaths linked to the novel coronavirus, the United States is the hardest-hit country in the global pandemic.While cracking down on immigration is one of his key issues, Trump has taken a particularly hard stance on foreigners since the health crisis began.In June, he froze until 2021 the issuing of green cards -- which offer permanent US resident status -- and some work visas, particularly those used in the technology sector, with the stated goal of reserving jobs for Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-to-withdraw-visas-for-foreign-students-whose-classes-move-online/story-QYjIu1Pz50BwatSdNvBzjO.html
07-07-2020||World||US coronavirus death toll passes 130,000: Johns Hopkins tally||The United States passed another grim coronavirus milestone Monday as the death toll from the virus climbed past 130,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.The country has had 2,888,729 Covid-19 cases and 130,007 deaths as of midday in Washington, the university reported.The world’s hardest hit country, both in confirmed cases and deaths, the United States has experienced a resurgence of the disease since June that has forced several states to suspend their phased economic reopenings.On Saturday, the number of new daily infections hit a record 57,683.When the death toll passed the 100,000 mark May 27, President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction that the number of new infections was declining, even though experts warned of a possible resurgence.Despite the worsening trend, White House officials say the US economy, which went into a nosedive in March and April due to lockdowns, will not be shut down again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-130-000-johns-hopkins-tally/story-kEWJcGu6RUXVh5prVXZ9fM.html
07-07-2020||World||Hong Kong police granted sweeping powers under national security law||In implementing the national security law for Hong Kong, police will have sweeping authority that allows them to take actions including conducting searches without a warrant, restricting suspects from leaving the city, and intercepting communications.Hong Kong’s government gazetted the details of Article 43 in the city’s national security law on Monday night, which outlines the measures that the police force can take to implement the legislation in the city.According to the rules, police may be authorized to conduct searches for evidence without a warrant in “exceptional circumstances.” Police may also apply for a warrant that requires a person suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, thus restricting them from leaving Hong Kong.Additionally, under the rules, written notices or restraining orders may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there is “reasonable grounds” to suspect that the property is related to an offence endangering national security.Platforms and publishers, as well as internet service providers, may also be ordered to take down electronic messages published that are “likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.”Service providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of six months.Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.Prior to the release of the implementation rules on Monday, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram said that they would deny law enforcement requests for user data in Hong Kong as they assess the impact of the national security law.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new implementation rules.Under the implementation rules, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam may also authorize police to intercept communications and conduct surveillance to “prevent and detect offences endangering national security.”Finally, written notices may also be served to a foreign political organisation or Taiwan political organisation, or individual agents, to furnish details on their activities related to Hong Kong. This includes details such as personal particulars, assets, income, and expenditure of the organisation in Hong Kong. Failure to comply or providing false or incomplete information can result in a fine of 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) or imprisonment of six months or two years respectively.The details of the implementation rules come into effect Wednesday and details were released after the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, chaired by Lam, convened its first meeting on Monday.Hong Kong’s national security law, imposed last week following anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, makes secessionist, subversive, and terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the city’s internal affairs. Any activities such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the city’s independence are a violation of the law regardless of whether violence is used. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment.Critics see it as Beijing’s boldest step yet to erase the legal firewall between the former British colony and the mainland’s authoritarian Communist Party system.Hanscom Smith, US consul general to Hong Kong and Macau, said Monday that it is a “tragedy” to use the semi-autonomous Chinese territory’s new national security law to chip away at freedoms in the Asian financial hub.“Using the national security law to erode fundamental freedoms and to create an atmosphere of coercion and self-censorship is a tragedy for Hong Kong,” Smith told reporters. “Hong Kong has been successful precisely because of its openness and we’ll do everything we can to maintain that.”Since the law went into effect, the government has specified that the popular protest slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time” has separatist connotations and is thus criminalized.In Hong Kong’s public libraries, books by pro-democracy figures have been pulled from the shelves, including those written by prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong and politician Tanya Chan. The authority that runs the libraries said it is reviewing the books in light of the new legislation.Many pro-democracy shops that publicly stood in solidarity with protesters have removed pro-democracy notes and artwork that adorned the walls of their stores, fearful that they might violate the new law.A 23-year-old man, Tong Ying-kit, was the first person in Hong Kong to be charged under the new law, for allegedly driving a motorcycle into a group of policemen while bearing a flag with the “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time” slogan.Tong appeared in court Monday facing charges of incitement to secession and terrorist activities. He was denied bail.Separately, pro-democracy activists Agnes Chow, Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam also appeared in court Monday over charges related to a protest last June. Chow pleaded guilty to inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, as well as to participating in an unauthorized assembly.Wong, who was indicted on similar charges, pleaded not guilty. Lam, who was charged with inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly, also pleaded not guilty. All three were released on bail.“With the risk of our personal safety, with the threat of life sentencing, we might be worried, and also being targeted by Beijing, but we also encourage the global community to let our voice be heard in the world,” Wong told reporters Monday. “We still hope to let the world know that now is the time to stand with Hong Kong, and now is the time for Hong Kongers to keep our momentum.”The cases will move to trial and sentencing following a pretrial review for Wong and Lam scheduled for Aug. 5.A group of about 10 protesters gathered at a shopping mall in Hong Kong’s Central business district on Monday holding up signs calling for city leader Carrie Lam to step down, as well as reiterating protesters’ demands from the pro-democracy movement last year. The demands include an independent inquiry into the police and greater democracy.Others held up blank pieces of paper as a sign of protest against the suppression of political protest in the city. About 20 riot police later entered the mall, detaining protesters holding up signs, although they did not appear to make any arrests.“We feel worried that we may be convicted for expressing our views,” said protester Anthea Wong. “That’s why we are using white paper instead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-granted-sweeping-powers-under-national-security-law/story-SjAMahUGZN9TVxCQOjoIkM.html
