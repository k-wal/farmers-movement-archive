A U.S. official confirmed a U.S. jet had passed by the Iranian airliner, but at a safe distance.According to Iranian state TV, two fighter jets came within a distance of 100 meters (328 feet) of the Iranian Airbus A310. The pilot of Mahan Air Flight 1152 quickly took the aircraft to a lower altitude to avoid a collision, the report said. The sharp maneuver caused slight injuries among some of the passengers.However, U.S. Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, told The Associated Press that a U.S. F-15 fighter jet “conducted a standard visual inspection” of the Iranian plane “at a safe distance of approximately 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) from the airliner.”He said the inspection was meant to ensure the safety of U.S. coalition troops in al-Tanf in Syria as the plane was flying over that area. He said once the aircraft was identified as a passenger plane, “the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft.”Aircraft at that altitude are to maintain a distance of at least 600 meters (2,000 feet) to ensure they don’t hit each other, though planes traveling that close can encounter wake turbulence.Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Friday that what happened was an act of “lawlessness upon lawlessness.”Zarif tweeted: “U.S. illegally occupies territory of another State and then harasses a scheduled civil airliner—endangering innocent civilian passengers—ostensibly to protect its occupation forces.”Iran’s Transportation Minister Mohammad Eslami described the incident as a “terrorist act” and said Tehran would complain to the International Civil Aviation Organization. “We expect this to lead to condemnation of the terrorist act by the U.S. government,” Eslami said.The ICAO said Friday it had not yet received a complaint from Iran.Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group echoed Elsmai and said the close encounter could have had “incalculable ramifications” across the region. The Iran-backed group, which has militiamen fighting in Syria on the side of President Bashar Assad’s forces, called the U.S. an occupier of Syrian skies and territories.The interception comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers over two years ago.In the time since, there have been several incidents across the Mideast between the two countries, including the U.S. airstrike that killed an Iranian general in Baghdad and Tehran launching ballistic missiles that targeted American forces in Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-slams-interception-by-us-jet-over-syria-as-illegal/story-PwPln2xC2i6UOdQ8HOqvuJ.html
24-07-2020||World||Donald Trump reverses his stance, says schools in hotspots should delay reopening||President Donald Trump on Thursday stepped back from his insistence on the reopening of schools and said those in Covid-19 hotspots could remain closed longer.Continuing his retreat from unconditional reopening generally, the president also announced the cancellation of Republican convention in Florida, one of states his the hardest by the second surge in Covid-19 cases.Trump has reversed himself on an increasing number of positions he had taken earlier to get the country back on the rails irrespective of the ferocity of the epidemic that is raging through the south and the west. He has embraced the use of masks, acknowledged the epidemic “will get worse before it gets better”.“In cities or states that are current hotspots,” Trump told reporters at the daily coronavirus that he resumed earlier this week after a gap of three months, “districts may need to delay reopening (of schools) for a few weeks, and that’s possible.”The president had earlier threatened to cut federal funds for schools that refused to reopen. And had alleged that were being kept closed for political reasons.Trump had been pushing for the return of normalcy, lifting of restriction, reopening of businesses, schools and colleges with an eye on elections in November, when he will seek a second term. Then came the a slew of polls showing him falling way behind his presumptive Democratic rival, Joe Biden, even in swing states that he had won in 2016. “It’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP Convention,” Trump said, replaying a conversation he had with his campaign team earlier in the day.Some parts of the event will move back to Charlottesville in North Carolina, the original venue which he had abandoned for Florida when local officials had refused to yield to his demands for an in-person convention with all the attendant pomp and pageantry and without social-distancing norms.Florida is among the souther and western states hit the hardest by a second surge of Covid-19 cases and fatalities. It has reinstated many of the restrictions and officials have publicly expressed concerns about the convention and their ability to ensure the and it has slapped back restrictions Biden cancelled his Milwaukee convention weeks ago, turning it into a largely on-line event. Now Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-reverses-himself-on-school-reopening-cancels-convention/story-rGnnxpvARvdc0x2V5heDgJ.html
24-07-2020||World||Amid new Covid-19 cases, masks becoming mandatory in Europe||New rules on wearing masks in England came into effect Friday, with people going to shops, banks and supermarkets now required to wear face coverings. The move came a day after Belgium imposed its own mask requirement to slow increasing coronavirus infections.Those in England can be fined as much as 100 pounds ($127) by police if they refuse. The British government had given mixed signals for weeks before deciding on the policy. Venues like restaurants, pubs, gyms and hairdressers are exempt.John Apter, the national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, says officers will be available as a last resort but that he hopes the public “will continue to do the right thing” to protect other citizens.In Belgium, health authorities said a three-year old girl has died after testing positive for COVID-19 as new infections surged 89% from the previous week.On Thursday, Belgian authorities beefed up restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including making masks mandatory in crowded outdoor public spaces. A country of 11.5 million, Belgium has been hard hit by the pandemic with 64,847 cases and 9,812 deaths recorded so far.In Italy, the number of daily new infections reported Thursday jumped to over 300, the first time they had surpassed more than 300 since mid-June. Most of the new cases have occurred in northern Italy, where the outbreak in Europe began in February. But southern regions, relatively spared from the worst of the pandemic, have lately been seeing clusters of infections.Many recent cases have been traced to people returning from abroad, most of them foreign workers from Asia, Eastern Europe or the Balkans. Other clusters were among migrants rescued at sea and southern Italy.But there have also been clusters sparked among vacationers, including in Riccione, a beach resort town on the Adriatic Sea, linked to a young woman’s contacts in a disco.Last week, the mayor of Capri, one of the two main towns on the tourist-mecca island in the Mediterranean off Naples, ordered people to wear masks while walking in the streets. Capri’s main square, with its trendy cafes, and its narrow streets lined with luxury fashion shops, had been jammed with holiday-goers, many of them not wearing masks.Three young Romans who returned home this week after a holiday were positive for Covid-19, Italian media said Friday.In Italy, masks must be worn in shops, banks, churches, on public transport and in all places where it’s impossible to keep a safe distance apart, including outdoors.Amid fears in Spain that poor living conditions for seasonal agricultural workers are creating coronavirus hotspots, that nation’s farm minister on Friday said authorities are pressing employers to provide decent accommodations and transport. Spain’s Health Ministry reported 971 new infections on Thursday in the last 24 hours, the biggest daily increase in the country since lockdown ended.Some clusters in Europe have been linked to workplaces, including at a slaughterhouse in Germany. The company that runs the slaughterhouse that was at the center of a major outbreak last month said 30 more employees have tested positive for the coronavirus -- but most of them were old cases.Authorities have linked more than 2,000 cases to the outbreak at the Toennies slaughterhouse in the western German town of Rheda-Wiedenbrueck, which led last month to a partial lockdown of the surrounding area. Those restrictions have since been lifted and the facility has reopened after a four-week closure.And as scientists around the world search for a vaccine to halt the pandemic, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has dismissed activists seeking to oppose vaccinations as “nuts.”Johnson was promoting a campaign for flu vaccinations ahead of winter. Britain has Europe’s worst recorded pandemic toll at over 45,600 deaths.Overall, Europe has seen over 201,000 deaths in the pandemic, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll of the pandemic worldwide is much higher than all reported numbers, due to limited testing and other issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-new-covid-19-cases-masks-becoming-mandatory-in-europe/story-9EqB5HSXbkAIucxAjnLleN.html
24-07-2020||World||Positive progress made by soldiers to disengage, says China after border talks||Positive progress has been made by the border troops of both India and China to disengage and ease the situation on the ground, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Friday at the end of the latest round of diplomatic talks between the two countries.The talks focused on both New Delhi and Beijing aiming at further “cooling” the situation at the border, China said.“The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the recent Sino-Indian border situation and fully affirmed the positive progress made by the front-line border defence forces of the two countries to disengage from contact and ease the situation on the ground,” the foreign ministry said in a statement released Friday evening.The statement was referring to the 17th meeting of the India-China Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs held online between senior diplomats from the two countries on Friday.New Delhi and Beijing are closely monitoring each other’s disengagement process and levels of withdrawal as both countries cautiously attempt to resolve the latest – and the worst in decades – crisis in bilateral ties.China is yet to reveal the PLA’s casualty figures but the Indian army lost 20 soldiers in a violent brawl between the border troops of the two countries on the night of June 15. Both sides have amassed large numbers of well-armed troops on their side.Friday’s statement from China said both sides “…emphasised that they will maintain bilateral military and diplomatic dialogues and consultations in accordance with the important consensus reached by the two foreign ministers and special representatives on border issues, properly handle remaining issues on the ground, and promote further cooling of the border situation.”The statement, issued in Mandarin, added that New Delhi and Beijing will continue to hold both diplomatic and military talks to calm the situation along the line of actual control (LAC).“The two sides agreed that they will continue to hold meetings on the China-India border affairs consultation and coordination mechanism and the commander-level meeting of the border defence forces of the two countries to strengthen the building of confidence in the border area and jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border area,” the statement said.The WMCC meeting was co-chaired by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry and director general Hong Liang of the boundary and oceanic affairs department of China’s foreign ministry.Ahead of Friday’s talks, external affairs ministry spokesperson, Anurag Srivastava had spoken in New Delhi about the importance of maintaining peace along the LAC.“As we have stated earlier, the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the basis of our bilateral relationship. Therefore, it is our expectation that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at the earliest as agreed to by the special representatives,” Srivastava said a day earlier.Friday’s bilateral diplomatic interaction was the fourth round of WMCC talks between the two countries since the current tension at the LAC, which started in May – indicating the complex nature of the ongoing negotiations between the two neighbours.The two sides have had four rounds of commander-level military talks as well.Crucially, separate phone conversations have also been held between external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, national security adviser AK Doval with China’s Wang Yi, who has multiple designations including state councilor, foreign minister and China’s special representative for border talks with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/positive-progress-made-by-soldiers-to-disengage-says-china-after-border-talks/story-bkqR44NqhvZ1s1iuo0vwfO.html

The other two sectors are chemicals and services.India’s experience with existing FTAs with various countries has been mixed. The UK’s eagerness for the FTA with India has been met with a wait-and-watch approach in New Delhi, where a review of all FTAs is envisaged by Goyal to protect the interests of Indian industry and traders.In the long-stalled EU-India free trade talks, easier mobility of Indian professionals (the so-called Mode 4) is one of the key areas New Delhi has been insisting on. Brussels believes there will be better chances of reaching the agreement with India after Britain leaves the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-uk-set-stage-for-post-brexit-free-trade-pact/story-Jhxb06pVgcEheTzADZLNOL.html
24-07-2020||World||When a Premier League club was targeted by hackers, almost lost £1 million||A cyber-security wing of the British intelligence agency GCHQ has revealed that the UK’s sports sector has become a ‘high-value target’ for cyber criminals, who, in one instance, almost walked away with nearly £1 million during a Premier League transfer season.The National Cyber Security Centre has revealed that sports organisations experience more cyber attacks than companies. Its first such review concludes that nearly 30% of the incidents caused financial damage, averaging £10,000 each time; the biggest single loss was over £4 million.During the transfer negotiation with an overseas football team, the centre said the email address of the managing director of the club was hacked by cyber criminals. Only a late intervention from the bank prevented the club losing almost £1 million.The centre’s report focussing on the sports sector, titled ‘Cyber Threat to Sports Organisations’, says that in another instance, an employee at an organisation which holds athlete performance data had email address compromised, allowing hackers access to sensitive information over several months.The report does not identify the geographical location or source of the cyber attacks.An English Football League club also suffered a significant ransomware attack which crippled their corporate and security systems. As a result of the attack, the CCTV and turnstiles at the ground were unable to operate, almost leading to a fixture cancellation.The centre said that a member of staff at a UK racecourse identified an item of grounds keeping equipment for sale on eBay, and agreed to a price of £15,000. The sale turned out to be fraudulent – a spoofed version of eBay had been created.The centre identified three common tactics used by criminals to assault the sector on a daily basis. These are: business email compromise, cyber-enabled fraud, and ransomware being used to shut down critical event systems and stadiums. Paul Chichester of the NCSC said: ““While cyber security might not be an obvious consideration for the sports sector as it thinks about its return, our findings show the impact of cyber criminals cashing in on this industry is very real”.Hugh Robertson, chair of the British Olympic Association, added: “Improving cyber security across the sports sector is critical. The British Olympic Association sees this report as a crucial first step, helping sports organisations to better understand the threat and highlighting practical steps that organisation should take to improve cyber security practices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-a-premier-league-club-was-targeted-by-hackers-almost-lost-1-million/story-VZQ4HBJhJUsiKJw8CS1Y3J.html
24-07-2020||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccine candidate shows promise in animal tests||Animal tests of a potential Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Chinese researchers show it triggers an immune response against the novel coronavirus, offering some promise as it goes into early-stage human trials, according to a peer-reviewed study.ARCoV is a messenger RNA vaccine which uses technology similar to candidates being developed by Moderna and BioNtech and Pfizer. It is the second potential Covid-19 vaccine that China’s military-backed research unit has moved into clinical trials.Results of trials of ARCoV in mice and monkeys, published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Cell on Thursday, show both single and two-dose inoculations induced strong antibody and T-cell responses against several Covid-19-causing virus strains. However, researchers conducting the trial cautioned they were not yet able to see how long the ARCoV-induced antibodies might last or how strong their protection might be to other strains that cause Covid-19 but were not tested in the study.ARCoV is stable at 25°C (77°F) for at least a week, researchers said, which could make it more attractive for potential immunisation campaigns in hard-to-reach populations in places where cold-chain storage and transportation are not always reliable.While no Covid-19 vaccine has been approved for sale yet, more than 150 are in development globally with an aim to help end the global pandemic that has claimed over 600,000 lives. But whether any will succeed remains far from clear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-shows-promise-in-animal-tests/story-vmCzaKQFh5FeX37j0PaJPN.html

24-07-2020||World||Thousands gather around Hagia Sophia for first Friday prayers||Thousands of Turks gathered near Hagia Sophia early on Friday for the first prayers there since President Tayyip Erdogan declared the monument, revered by Christians and Muslims for almost 1,500 years, a mosque once again.Crowds formed at checkpoints surrounding the historic heart of Istanbul, where thousands of police maintained security. On entering the secured area the worshippers, wearing face masks, sat spaced out on prayer mats in the city’s Sultanahmet Square.“We are ending our 86 years of longing today,” said one man Sait Colak, referring to the nearly nine decades since Hagia Sophia was declared a museum and ceased to be a place of worship. “Thanks to our president and the court decision today we are going to have our Friday prayers in Hagia Sophia.”A top Turkish court announced this month it annulled Hagia Sophia’s status as a museum. Erdogan immediately turned back into a mosque a building which was a Christian Byzantine cathedral for 900 years before being seized by Ottoman conquerors and serving as a mosque until 1934.The president was scheduled to attend Friday prayers shortly after 1 pm (1000 GMT) along with several hundred invitees for the ceremony in the sixth-century building.During his 17-year rule, Erdogan has championed Islam and religious observance and backed efforts to restore Hagia Sophia’s mosque status. He said Muslims should be able to pray there again and raised the issue - popular with many pious AKP-voting Turks - during local elections last year.The conversion triggered fierce criticism from church leaders, who said the conversion to exclusively Muslim worship risked deepening religious divisions. Turkey says the site will remain open for visitors and its Christian artworks protected.Erdogan has reshaped Turkey’s modern republic, established nearly a century ago by the staunchly secularist Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, lifting a ban on Muslim headscarves in public, promoting religious education and taming Turkey’s powerful military, once a bastion of Ataturk’s secular values.Inside Hagia Sophia, the Christian frescoes and the glittering mosaics adorning the cavernous dome and central hall will be concealed by curtains during Muslim prayer times, but remain on display for the rest of the time.On Friday morning, the interior echoed to the sound of Koranic recitations from white-robed clerics, sat on blue carpets freshly laid this week ahead of the prayers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-gather-around-hagia-sophia-for-first-friday-prayers/story-DHVSKwcZtxW65Ae2XIuurO.html

24-07-2020||World||Critic of President Xi Jinping expelled from Communist Party||The ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has expelled a real estate tycoon and an outspoken critic of President Xi Jinping for violating party discipline in what is being seen as a message to the business elite to toe the party line.A court statement released late on Thursday announced the expulsion of Ren Zhiqiang from the party for “seriously” violating the “party’s political, organisational, integrity, work and life disciplines”.Ren, 69, was also accused of “corruption, bribe-taking and misappropriation of public funds” including buying “golf membership cards”.The expulsion was announced by the District Supervisory Committee, Xicheng District Commission for Discipline Inspection, Beijing.Ren, former chairperson of Huayuan Properties, a real estate development company, was detained in March for criticising President Xi’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Ren had a massive following on China’s social media and was known as “cannon” for his outspoken and controversial views.In early 2016, Ren was banned from Chinese social media after he criticised a much-publicised Xi speech on how the media should serve the CPC.According to Chinese state media, Ren also suggested controversial ideas like the “...poor young migrant workers who cannot afford apartments in cities should return to the countryside.”Ren was detained in March after his critique of Xi’s response to the coronavirus outbreak was published.In the essay, he called Xi a “clown” and raised several questions about the sequence of events leading to and in the aftermath of the outbreak.“The reality shown by this epidemic is that the party defends its own interests, the government officials defend their own interests, and the monarch only defends the status and interests of the core. Precisely this type of system is capable of a situation where only the ruler’s order is obeyed with no regard for the people,” Ren wrote in the essay attributed to him and translated in English by China Digital Times.The expulsion order was passed a day after Xi chaired a symposium with entrepreneurs where he, according to official media, said: “A cordial and upright relationship between government and business should be fostered”.Ren’s expulsion comes within weeks of Xu Zhangrun, 58, a law professor at Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University who had criticised Xi’s style of functioning and questioned the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic was taken away by the police.Xu published an essay in February blaming the culture of censorship under Xi for the spread of the coronavirus in China, which first appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.In the essay, which appeared on overseas websites, Xu wrote China’s “leader system is itself destroying the structure of governance”, adding that the chaos in the first virus epicentre of Hubei province reflected systemic problems in the Chinese state.Xu was released about a week later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/critic-of-president-xi-jinping-expelled-from-communist-party/story-t6Br0NgOMrfTkvYFrX6s6H.html
24-07-2020||World||From appreciating efforts to declaring a tyrant: How Covid hit US-China ties||The United States had its first Covid-19 case on January 21.“China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus,” President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter three days later, taking an indulgent view of Beijing’s alleged culpability. “The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American people, I want to thank President Xi.”Six months later, on Thursday, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, was declared a tyrant by Trump’s top diplomat Mike Pompeo.There have been more than four million Covid-19 cases in the United States, and over 144,000 fatalities. SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), may be the “China virus” or the “Wuhan virus”, as Trump and his aides have sought to portray it to shift blame, but it is an American problem, more than anything else.And one that could rob President Trump of a second term.Polls have been brutal on Trump’s handling of the epidemic. Joe Biden, the former vice-president and the presumptive Democratic nominee, leads the President by nearly nine points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Trump is also trailing Biden in the swing states that gave him the presidency in 2016.Trump is trailing Biden in more than just the polls.He is in such a desperately bad situation politically that he been forced to walk back his earlier attempts to downplay the epidemic. Trump has had to embrace masks (or any facial covering) after mocking Biden for wearing them; and cancel the Republican convention that he had wanted so badly to showcase his first term. He will accept the nomination virtually, it seems, following Biden’s lead.Also read: US abandons China appeasement policy, outsources hostilitiesHis frustration with China has grown exponentially at the same time. He has attacked Beijing for letting the virus escape its borders. “So it’s a shame that it happened. It shouldn’t have happened. China should have stopped it,” he said Thursday, re-litigating his case against China.Trump ran his 2016 campaign for the White House on the promise of ending China’s rogue behaviour on trade, including currency manipulation. He set into motion a series of measures soon after coming into office that led to a full-fledged trade war between the world’s two largest economies shortly.He pursued a trade deal even though it had become clear that China was not interested in conceding the main American asks, such as ending forced transfer of technology. He won a limited Phase 1 deal, but never got to the larger agreement that he had wanted to claim complete victory.It is no longer a priority. “The trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it,” Trump told reporters Thursday.Trade ceded centre stage to Covid-19 as the main China issue when infections and fatalities began shooting around March. New York city and state soon replaced China’s Wuhan and Hubei province as the new epicentres of the raging pandemic, and Trump was left defending his shoddy handling of his administration’s first major crisis.Also read: WHO chief says comments questioning his independence ‘untrue and unacceptable’Trump and his aides sought to deflect blame by putting it all on China, and soon US-China relations were in a precipitous downward spiral. This led to slew of sanctions, visa restrictions; and harsh remarks over the mistreatment of Uighur Muslims, restrictions in Hong Kong, and aggressive military postures in hot spots such as the South China Sea, and the disputed areas along its borders with India and Bhutan.Earlier this week, the Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, alleging it was being used as an intelligence-gathering hub. On Friday, China notified the US that it’s revoking the operating permit for the US consulate in Chengdu, according to a statement from Chinese foreign ministry.On Thursday, secretary of state Pompeo signalled the end of the decades-old US policy of engaging China with the hope of changing it and its behaviour.“The old paradigm of blind engagement with China has failed,” Pompeo said in a widely anticipated policy speech at a legacy California library run by the foundation of late President Richard Nixon, who re-established diplomatic ties with China and paved the way for its opening with a historic visit in 1972. “If the free world doesn’t change Communist China — [it] will surely change us,” Pompeo added, setting up his call for an international alliance of “like-minded” nations.There is a need for “a new grouping of like-minded nations -- a new alliance of democracies”, Pompeo said, without specifying which nations.In a question-answer session following the speech, the secretary of state said these nations will have the backing of the US for sure. When asked if he was urging nations to pick between the US and China, in line with a choice the US presented to the world in the 1940s between itself and the USSR, Pompeo said the choice for them was between “freedom and tyranny”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-appreciating-efforts-to-declaring-a-tyrant-how-covid-hit-us-china-ties/story-H7UxMOsljGyqDt7gisNYhO.html

The US move seriously breached international law, the basic norms of international relations, and the terms of the China-US Consular Convention. It gravely harmed China-US relations,” the statement added.Speaking at the regular Chinese foreign ministry briefing, spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that some personnel from the US consulate in Chengdu had “…engaged in activities inconsistent with their identities.”“China has made representations and the US side is fully aware of them,” he said.Wang added that China had made specific requirements for the US embassy to cease all operations and events by the mission in Chengdu.“Diplomacy is reciprocal,” Wang said.“The measure taken by China is a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified act by the US. It conforms with international law, the basic norms of international relations, and customary diplomatic practices,” the Chinese foreign ministry statement had said in the morning.“It conforms with international law, the basic norms of international relations, and customary diplomatic practices.”The statement added: “The current situation in China-US relations is not what China desires to see, and the US is responsible for all this. We once again urge the US to immediately retract its wrong decision and create necessary conditions for bringing the bilateral relationship back on track.”On Wednesday, Beijing had called the US’s decision to close the Chinese consulate in Houston an “unprecedented escalation” in Washington’s recent actions against China and warned of “legitimate and necessary” response against the decision.The tit-for-tat closing of consulates is sure to further sour the rapidly deteriorating bilateral ties with the two countries already at loggerheads over South China Sea disputes, the Hong Kong security bill, US arms-sales to Taiwan, the condition of minorities in Xinjiang, and the origin of the coronavirus besides an ongoing trade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-tit-for-tat-action-china-orders-closure-of-us-consulate-in-chengdu-after-its-houston-consulate-is-shut-down/story-NGK6U6NzRz8ahNffJ5oibM.html
24-07-2020||World||More than 1,000 people at Twitter had ability to aid hack of accounts: Report||More than a thousand Twitter employees and contractors as of earlier this year had access to internal tools that could change user account settings and hand control to others, two former employees said, making it hard to defend against the hacking that occurred last week.Twitter Inc and the FBI are investigating the breach that allowed hackers to repeatedly tweet from verified accounts of the likes of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg.Twitter said on Saturday that the perpetrators “manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials” to log into tools and turn over access to 45 accounts. https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html On Wednesday, it said that the hackers could have read direct messages to and from 36 accounts but did not identify the affected users. The former employees familiar with Twitter security practices said that too many people could have done the same thing, more than 1,000 as of earlier in 2020, including some at contractors like Cognizant.Twitter declined to comment on that figure and would not say whether the number declined before the hack or since. The company was looking for a new security head, working to better secure its systems and training employees on resisting tricks from outsiders, Twitter said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.“That sounds like there are too many people with access,” said Edward Amoroso, former chief security officer at AT&T. Responsibilities among the staff should have been split up, with access rights limited to those responsibilities and more than one person required to agree to make the most sensitive account changes. “In order to do cyber security right, you can’t forget the boring stuff.”Threats from insiders, especially lower-paid outside support staff, are a constant worry for companies serving large numbers of users, cyber security experts said. They said that the greater the number of people who can change key settings, the stronger oversight must be.StumblesThe former employees said that Twitter had gotten better about logging the activity of its people in the wake of previous stumbles, including searches of records by an employee accused last November of spying for the government of Saudi Arabia.But while logging helps with investigations, only alarms or constant reviews can turn logs into something that can prevent breaches.Former Cisco Systems Chief Security Officer John Stewart said companies with broad access need to adopt a long series of mitigations and “ultimately ensuring that the most powerful authorized people are only doing what they are supposed to be doing.”Who exactly pulled off the hacking spree isn’t clear, but outside researchers such as Allison Nixon of Unit 221B say the incident appears linked to a cluster of cybercriminals who regularly traded in novelty handles – especially rare one-or-two character account names – that are treated a bit like the vanity license plates of the online world.Although the public evidence tying the hacking to those was circumstantial, ultra-short Twitter handles were among the first to be hijacked.In addition, the forums where those hackers were active have long been replete with boasts about having access to Twitter insiders, according to Nixon and Nick Bax, an analyst with StopSIMCrime, a group that lobbies for greater protection against “SIM swapping” – a phone number hijacking technique often used by these kinds of hackers.Bax said he had seen reference on forums to “Twitter plugs” or “Twitter reps” – the terms used to describe cooperative Twitter employees – since as far back as 2017.The potential involvement of low-level cybercriminals has particularly alarmed professionals because of the implication that a hostile government might be able to cause even greater havoc.Access to accounts for national leaders was limited to a much smaller number of people after a rogue employee briefly deleted President Donald Trump’s account two years ago. That could explain why Biden’s account was hijacked but not Trump’s.Twitter should expand the number of protected accounts, said former Twitter security engineer John Adams. Among other things, accounts with more than 10,000 followers should at least need two people to change key settings.Security experts said they were worried that Twitter has too much work to do and too little time before the campaign for the Nov. 3 U.S. election intensifies, with potential inference domestically and from other countries.Said Ron Gula, a cybersecurity investor who co-founded network security company Tenable, “The question really is: Does Twitter do enough to prevent account takeovers for our presidential candidates and news outlets when faced with sophisticated threats that leverage whole-of-nation approaches?”On a call to discuss company earnings on Thursday, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey acknowledged past missteps.“We fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools,” Dorsey told investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-1-000-people-at-twitter-had-ability-to-aid-hack-of-accounts-report/story-PBgx6zmrABYwiPy1lD19jI.html
24-07-2020||World||Israel anti-govt protests: Police use water cannons to disperse protesters||Israeli police used water cannons to disperse protesters in central Jerusalem and arrested at least 55 of them as clashes broke out overnight after thousands staged a protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Israelis have held a series of demonstrations in recent weeks calling on Netanyahu to resign, citing his trial on corruption charges and his fractious unity government’s poor handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The protest near the prime minister’s residence began around sundown on Thursday and was initially largely peaceful. A smaller counterprotest in support of Netanyahu was held nearby, with the two camps separated by metal barricades and a large police presence.Police say they moved in to disperse the protesters when they tried to stage a procession through the city. Police scuffled with demonstrators before four large trucks roared into action, spraying water cannons back and forth, scattering the protesters.At times, it appeared the trucks were spraying protesters from behind as they tried to leave the area peacefully.Israel imposed a general lockdown when the first coronavirus cases appeared in March and by May had largely succeeded in containing the outbreak. But then it moved quickly to lift virtually all restrictions, and in the following weeks cases surged.The country has reported a total of more than 57,000 cases and at least 442 deaths. More than 24,000 patients have recovered.A unity government formed in May following three inconclusive elections in less than a year was supposed to prioritize the pandemic. Instead, it has been plagued by infighting and unable to agree on clear policies to combat the pandemic.Netanyahu meanwhile faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust over a series of long-running corruption investigations. Critics say he is more focused on escaping legal accountability than on containing the pandemic. Many have speculated he intends to call yet another election, allegations he dismissed as “absurd” in a Thursday press conference.At the same conference, held as the protests were underway, he called on demonstrators not to clash with police, saying it would “lead to anarchy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-anti-govt-protests-police-use-water-cannons-to-disperse-protesters/story-rTnFc34vejyQMZIkMukjpK.html
24-07-2020||World||WHO chief says comments questioning his independence ‘untrue and unacceptable’||The head of the World Health Organization said on Thursday that reported comments by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo questioning his independence were untrue and would not distract the organisation from its work in fighting the coronavirus.Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has come under criticism, especially from US President Donald Trump and Pompeo, who have accused him of being pro-China.“And the comments are untrue and unacceptable and without any foundation, for that matter,” Tedros said in response to a question at a Geneva briefing about remarks by Pompeo reported in London on Tuesday, questioning his independence.“Our sole focus - and the focus of the entire organisation - is on saving lives... And WHO will not be distracted by these comments. We don’t want the international community also to be distracted.”A WHO advance team has been in China for nearly two weeks, organising a WHO-led international mission to investigate the origins of the virus. Scientists believe it emerged in a food market in the central city of Wuhan late last year.“We are already beginning to reach out to experts at the international level to see who will be available and most appropriate to be able to support an international mission in the coming weeks,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergencies expert, said.Tedros said the WHO was seeing intense transmission of the coronavirus in relatively few countries.“Two-thirds of all cases are from 10 countries. Almost half of all cases reported so far are from just three countries,” he said, referring to the United States, Brazil and India.Worldwide more than 15 million cases have been reported and nearly 620,000 deaths, he said.Recorded US coronavirus infections exceeded 4 million on Thursday, with more than 2,600 new ones every hour on average, the highest rate in the world, according to a Reuters tally.Infections in the United States have rapidly accelerated since the first Covid-19 case was detected on Jan. 21. It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases. It took another 43 days to reach 2 million and then 27 days to reach 3 million.It has only taken 16 days to reach 4 million at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.Tedros also said that just because cases may be at a low level where someone lives, it doesn’t mean they should let down their guard.“Know your situation - do you know how many cases were reported where you live yesterday? Do you know how to find that information? Do you know how to minimise your exposure?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-says-comments-questioning-his-independence-untrue-and-unacceptable/story-ZMpCDkZe8JuSOcavfQvdML.html

Hundreds have been displaced as landslides have swept away their homes. They ended up taking refuge in local schools and community centers.Nepal’s Meteorological Forecasting Division earlier last week had predicted heavy downpour across the country. The Division had warned of monsoon winds being near the low-pressure line in the Terai belt, which would consequently cause more rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-due-to-floods-in-nepal-reaches-132/story-7npL0JEVuHFpZKi2Ogs52N.html
24-07-2020||World||Tropical storm Hanna forms; Gonzalo strength remains steady||A gulf depression strengthened into a tropical storm late Thursday, triggering watches and warnings along the southern coast of the continental United States. Tropical Storm Hanna was the earliest eighth Atlantic named storm on record, breaking the previous record of Harvey in 2005. Hanna was located 385 miles (620 kilometers) east, southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas, according to the 10 p.m. CDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The formation of Hanna came as Tropical Storm Gonzalo continued to move across the Atlantic about 730 miles (1,170 km) east of the southern Windward Islands. Forecasters said Gonzalo had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph). A U.S. National Hurricane Center advisory said the storm was heading west at 14 mph (22 kph). Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center. The Hurricane Center said that those in the Windward Islands should monitor the storm as it is expected to approach the islands late Friday and Saturday. As some strengthening is forecast, there is still a chance that Gonzalo could become a hurricane, but the storm is expected to weaken as it moves into the Caribbean Sea. A hurricane watch has been issued for Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Tobago and Grenada. When Gonzalo strengthened into a named storm Wednesday, it became the earliest named seventh tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. The previous record was held by Tropical Storm Gert, which formed on July 24, 2005. So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard and Fay also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storms of their respective place in the alphabet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-hanna-forms-gonzalo-strength-remains-steady/story-f9060RQvqTgYCZ6cE8CqDL.html

The earlier three were delivered by National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien who had focussed on ideological underpinnings of the Chinese Communist Party; Attorney General William Barr had addressed business and trade ties and FBI director Christopher Wray spoke on intelligence and hacking. Pompeo wrapped it up with the widely anticipated speech Thursday.The top US diplomat said, citing Nixon, the purpose of engaging with China was to “induce change”. The thinking among policymakers then was that as China became more prosperous it would become “freer at home” and “friendlier abroad”. It did not quite happen that way.“The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change in China that President Nixon hoped to induce,” Pompeo said, adding, “Whatever the reason, China today is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom abroad.”Nations must change the way they deal with China. “We cannot treat this incarnation of China as a normal country,” Pompeo said, adding the United States cannot do it alone because the Chinese have spread far too wide and deep into the world, unlike the Soviet Union, which had remained closed.There is a need for “a new grouping of like-minded nations - a new alliance of democracies”. He did not specify which nations. In a question-answer session following the speech, the secretary of state said these nations will have the backing of the US for sure.When asked if he was urging nations to pick between the US and China, in line with a choice the US presented to the world in the 1940s between itself and the USSR, Pompeo said the choice for them was between “freedom and tyranny”.“If we bend the knee now, our children’s children may be at the mercy of the CCP (the Chinese Communist Party), whose actions are the primary challenge to the free world,” he had said in his speech, as he was laying out the threat the world faced form China. President Xi Jinping “Xi isn’t destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever, unless we let him”.The secretary of state also argued for involving Chinese people. in changing the regime — not overthrow it. “We must also engage and empower the Chinese people...a dynamic, freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party.” he said. He has been meeting Chinese dissidents and victims and survivors of Chinese oppression in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and some of them were present in the audience at the invitation-only event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-abandons-china-appeasement-policy-outsources-hostilities/story-1bTN5CXWZb6NJZ64dBaSSL.html

He had to cancel upcoming travel plans after a new test came back positive again Wednesday.The far-right leader admitted in a live Facebook video Thursday that he was feeling “a bit wretched at being imprisoned here.”Photographs captured him taking a motorcycle for a spin on the palace grounds, stopping at one point to talk to a team of groundskeepers raking leaves -- despite his positive test result and the fact that neither he nor the workers appeared to be wearing face masks.The president’s office told AFP it “will not be commenting” on the pictures.Bolsonaro, who has been called a “Tropical Trump,” has repeatedly defied social distancing guidelines. He regularly hit the streets for rallies by his supporters even as the pandemic exploded in Brazil.The South American country has the second-biggest outbreak in the world, after the United States, with nearly 2.3 million infections and more than 84,000 deaths.Brazil registered its two highest daily numbers of new infections Wednesday and Thursday, with 67,860 and 59,961, respectively.Bolsonaro, who has compared the virus to a “little flu” and condemned the economic impact of stay-at-home measures to contain it, said on Facebook he was feeling “great.”“You have to be careful, but there’s no reason to live in terror,” he said.“We’re concerned with protecting lives, but the collateral damage from these (stay-at-home) policies is going to kill a lot more people than the virus.”Critics condemned the presidential outing.“This shows Bolsonaro’s monstrosity and contempt for Brazilians’ lives,” tweeted Congressman Marcelo Freixo, leader of the left-wing Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL).Bolsonaro has continued greeting supporters from quarantine, separated by a narrow reflecting pond but maskless.He has also been spotted in the gardens feeding -- and occasionally getting bitten by -- rheas, a South American bird related to the emu.val/jhb/to||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-infection-brazil-s-bolsonaro-takes-spin-chats-up-workers/story-lufc2cprBIM9GhMViRlT8J.html

Just this week, the US ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, and the Justice Department charged two Chinese hackers with targeting firms working on vaccines for the coronavirus.In a speech in California on Thursday, Pompeo said the consulate had been “a hub of spying”.“This week we closed down China’s consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft,” Pompeo said.This was the first major speech delivered by Pompeo after Washington’s surprise order this week for China to close its Houston consulate, where the US Secretary of State called for an end to “blind engagement” with China. He also repeated frequently levelled US charges about its unfair trade practices, human rights abuses and efforts to infiltrate American society.The remarks came after the US Justice Department said that the Chinese consulate in San Francisco is harbouring a harbouring a researcher who lied about her links with the country’s military. The justice department announced charges against that scientist and three others accused of concealing their government ties.According to federal prosecutors quoted by CNN, the scientist Tang Juan is hiding in China’s consulate in San Francisco. Juan is a researcher who focuses on biology, the CNN reported.She was charged with visa fraud on June 26.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), meanwhile, has interviewed visa holders in more than 25 American cities who are suspected of concealing their ties to the Chinese military. The Justice Department believes that the deception is part of an ongoing, government-sponsored effort to steal research and innovation from American universities for Beijing’s economic gain.China, meanwhile, said that the US decision to close its Houston consulate had “severely harmed” relations and warned it “must” retaliate, without detailing what it would do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-consulate-in-houston-was-hub-of-spying-mike-pompeo/story-ZgjQs3dTNBOWcLKdHr42AK.html

The move was met with dismay in Greece and the United States and from Christian church leaders.On Thursday, the Turkish leader, joined by a large entourage, paid a surprise visit to inspect final preparations at the structure, including the unveiling of a sign at the entrance that reads: “The Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque.”The head of Turkey’s religious authority, Ali Erbas, on Thursday announced the appointment of the three imams who will lead prayers at the reconverted mosque: Mehmet Boynukalin, a professor of Islamic law at Istanbul’s Marmara University, and Ferruh Mustuer and Bunjamin Topcuoglu, the imams of two other Istanbul mosques.Erbas also named five muezzins — the officials who make the Muslim call for prayer — for Hagia Sophia, including two from Istanbul’s famed Blue Mosque.Authorities have designated segregated areas outside of the Hagia Sophia for men and women wanting to join Friday’s inaugural prayers.Several roads leading to the building are being blocked. Authorities have said as many as 17,000 security personnel would be on duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-s-erdogan-to-join-hundreds-of-worshippers-for-prayers-in-hagia-sophia-after-conversion/story-VwYqowzFaO64cenh8HVqEJ.html
24-07-2020||World||US coronavirus deaths top 1,000 for a third day in a row||The United States on Thursday recorded more than 1,000 deaths from Covid-19, marking the third straight day the nation passed that grim milestone as the pandemic escalates in southern and western U.S. states.Fatalities nationwide were recorded at 1,014 on Thursday, with not all states reporting. Deaths were 1,135 on Wednesday and 1,141 on Tuesday. Even though deaths are rising in the United States for a second week in a row, they remain well below levels seen in April, when 2,000 people a day on average died from the virus.The United States on Thursday also passed a total of more than 4 million coronavirus infections since the first U.S. case was documented in January, according to a Reuters tally, reflecting a nationwide escalation of the pandemic.The United States took 98 days to reach one million confirmed cases of Covid-19 but just 16 days to increase from 3 million to 4 million, the tally showed. The total suggests at least one in 82 Americans have been infected at some point in the pandemic. The average number of new cases is now rising by more than 2,600 per hour nationwide, the highest rate in the world.As the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak has spread from New York to the South and West, federal, state and local officials have clashed over how to ease lockdowns imposed on Americans and businesses.Requirements that residents wear masks in public have become the subject of a fierce political divide, as many conservatives argue that such orders violate the U.S. Constitution.U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican who has rejected a nationwide mask rule and been reluctant to wear one himself, this week reversed course and encouraged Americans to do so.‘Wear mask, avoid crowds’“We have to do our mitigation steps: Wear a mask, avoid the crowds. We won’t see hospitalizations and deaths go down for a couple of weeks because (they are) lagging indicators, but we are turning that tide,” U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir told the Fox News Network in an interview.Trump told a White House briefing on Thursday that hot spot states may need to delay re-opening schools by a few weeks but pushed for most students to be able to return to classrooms in the fall. Schools have become another point of contention. In Florida, the state teachers’ union has sued to stop in-class instruction. Florida reported a record one-day increase in Covid-19 deaths on Thursday at 173.Florida’s health commissioner said earlier this month that schools must reopen, but Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has since said that parents should have the option to keep their children home. Trump administration officials have said a quicker reopening is essential to get the staggered economy moving again, a central plank of the president’s re-election campaign.Trump also said he would no longer hold part of the Republican Party’s nominating convention in Florida in August because of a spike in coronavirus cases in the state.“The timing for this event is not right,” Trump told the White House briefing. “It’s just not right with what’s happened recently, the flare-up in Florida. To have a big convention it’s not the right time.”Trump has been holding his first coronavirus briefings in months without the experts on his task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Fauci, who became a household name in the early days of the pandemic, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch on Thursday on Opening Day of the truncated Major League Baseball season at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.Trump’s rival for the presidency, Democrat Joe Biden, blasted his handling of the pandemic in a campaign video aired on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-coronavirus-deaths-top-1-000-for-a-third-day-in-a-row/story-Ju2avrvy4LhC6T0VDtYM2H.html

And yet it seemed as if the president was downplaying it and saying, you know, this virus is going to disappear,” Hogan said.The biggest mistake in the first couple of months, the governor said, was not developing a national testing strategy.“Throughout the pandemic, it (the federal government) was not assisting the states enough with testing and now as it’s spiking back up again and we have a resurgence of this virus all across the country, the No. 1 thing we can do is to put more into testing and contact tracing to identify and stop the spread,” Hogan said.Hogan criticized the president repeatedly in his upcoming book, “Still Standing: Surviving Cancer, Riots, a Global Pandemic and the Toxic Politics that Divide America,” which is set for release July 28.In the book, Hogan highlights a closed-door meeting in Washington on Feb. 9 between governors and leading health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert and Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Hogan wrote the governors received a series of detailed presentations about how the virus could be catastrophic; the death toll could be significant. Hogan described it as “a harrowing warning of an imminent threat” with a “huge contrast between the experts’ warnings and the president’s public dismissals.”Hogan writes that Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, advised the governors to consult with their legal teams to find out what public health emergency powers they had and whether they could order quarantines.“That eye-opening briefing in early February gave the governors a giant leg up before the epidemic was officially declared a global pandemic,” Hogan wrote. “With the president largely unengaged in this crucial early period, the governors were ready to step up and lead in the early months of what was quickly becoming a terrible plague.”The US Department of Health and Human Services announced the meeting in a brief news release, but without the details Hogan writes about concerning the gravity of the presentations.“The panel reiterated that while this is a serious public health matter, the risk to the American public remains low at this time, and that the federal government will continue working in close coordination with state and local governments to keep it that way,” the news release said.But Hogan said Thursday that he and most of the governors “came out of there with a sense of this was going to be the most serious health crisis that America’s ever faced.”Hogan wrote he was able to “feel the friction” with the president on calls Trump participated in with the nation’s governors due to earlier criticism.“I did not go out of my way to criticize the president,” Hogan said Thursday. “But unlike a lot of Republicans, I’m not the guy that’s just going to sit down and shut up and not stand up and say something if I think something’s going wrong.” Hogan said he will consider a run for the presidency in 2024.Hogan ran into friction with Trump in April, when the governor announced he had obtained 500,000 virus test kits from South Korea. At the time, Trump said Hogan didn’t need to go to South Korea for tests.“I think the president made some ridiculous comment that we didn’t have to go find tests, that we can just call Mike Pence and get all the tests we wanted. It was obviously not true,” Hogan said Thursday. “If I didn’t have to spend three weeks searching all over the world, to find these tests I certainly wouldn’t have.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-initially-downplayed-covid-19-threat-says-maryland-governor/story-1yua2ORxrHlP7TjjB1LpoN.html

I also want to thank the British public for all the sacrifices they are making to help keep this country safe,” he said.He said businesses are encouraged to take reasonable steps to encourage customers to follow the law, including through signs and providing other information in store.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Wearing a face covering will not be made mandatory in other venues that have measures in place to protect staff and the public from Covid-19, including eat-in restaurants and pubs, hairdressers and other treatment salons, gyms and leisure centres, cinemas, concert halls and theatres.For transport hubs in England, the requirements mean face coverings must be worn in indoor train stations and terminals, airports, maritime ports, and indoor bus and coach stations or terminals.Anyone who doesn’t abide by the regulations — and is not exempt under one of the categories set out in the regulations — could face a fine by the police of up to GBP 100, as is currently the case on public transport in most parts of the UK. The police say they have been very clear throughout the pandemic that they will “engage, explain, encourage and finally enforce as a last resort”.People wearing face coverings are still strongly advised to wash their hands or use hand sanitiser before putting one on or taking it off, avoid taking it off and putting it back on again a lot in quick succession, store it in a plastic bag in between washes or wearing, and avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth while wearing one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-masks-now-compulsory-in-uk-shops-supermarkets-to-check-covid-19-spread/story-l7zRgKJGpcxcm3RLZZWVjN.html
24-07-2020||World||Prince Harry, Meghan Markle sue publication over photo of son at California home||Prince Harry and Meghan Markle sued Thursday to stop the sale and publication of a photo of their son Archie that they say was shot at their Los Angeles-area home in invasion of their privacy.The royal couple gives a detailed account in the lawsuit of the media harassment they say they’ve had to constantly fight in the months since they moved to Southern California.“This action arises out of the relentless and quite frankly shocking efforts of the tabloid media to profit from serial intrusions of the privacy of a 14-month-old child in his own home,” the suit says, ”and the desire and responsibility of any parent to do what is necessary to protect their children from this manufactured feeding frenzy.” Meghan and Harry said the tabloid harassment finally came to a head when they saw that a photo of Archie was being offered to media outlets that was purportedly taken on a family outing in Malibu, when in fact it was clearly shot while he was in their yard, unbeknownst to them.“Archie has not been in public, much less in Malibu, since the family arrived here,” the lawsuit says.It alleges the picture is mislabled because the sellers knew it would be unlawful for them to sell a photograph of a child in his own home.The couple has not learned the identity of the shooters and sellers of the photos, who are listed as John Does in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.The plaintiffs are listed as Harry, The Duke of Sussex and Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex.The lawsuit seeks to identify the defendants, and for the court to issue injunctions requiring them to turn over all photos of Archie and cease harassing the family.The lawsuit says the family was forced to erect a large mesh fence to block photographers with telephoto lenses from shooting pictures of them from a ridge hundreds of yards away from the home of a friend in a gated community where they have been living.That led to the appearance of drones that flew as close as 20 feet above their home, as often as three times a day, in attempts to get photos, the suit says. Helicopters have flown over as early as 5:30 a.m., waking Archie and neighbors, and some photographers have cut holes in their mesh fence attempting to get shots of them.Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and sixth in line to the British throne, married Meghan Markle, an American actress who grew up in Los Angeles, at Windsor Castle in 2018, in a posh ceremony watched around the world.In January, the couple announced they planned to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America. The split became official at the end of March.The couple chose to live at least part-time in North America “to escape the incessant UK tabloid fabrications,” the lawsuit says. Meghan is also suing a pair of media outlets there for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement.They were able to live quietly in North Saanich, Canada, for six weeks, the lawsuit says, before a British tabloid published their exact location and hordes of photographers descended, prompting them to head to the California home where their location was again published and paparazzi appeared in droves again.“The plaintiffs have done everything in their power to stay out of the limelight, except in connection with their work, which they freely admit is newsworthy,” according to the lawsuit, which says they “simply want to continue the public impact work that is so important to them while having the private life to which any family or individual has the right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-and-meghan-sue-over-photo-of-son-at-california-home/story-hrg34J2ZgDllFrjG7w8PqM.html

24-07-2020||World||Pompeo urges more assertive approach to ‘Frankenstein’ China||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took fresh aim at China on Thursday and said the United States and its allies must use “more creative and assertive ways” to press the Chinese Communist Party to change its ways, calling it the “mission of our time.”Speaking at the Nixon Library in President Richard Nixon’s birthplace in Yorba Linda, California, Pompeo said the former US leader’s worry about what he had done by opening the world to China’s Communist Party in the 1970s had been prophetic.“President Nixon once said he feared he had created a “Frankenstein” by opening the world to the CCP,” Pompeo said. “And here we are.”Nixon, who died in 1994 and was president from 1969-74 opened the way for the establishment of US diplomatic relations with Communist China in 1979 through a series of contacts, including a visit to Beijing in 1972.In a major speech delivered after Washington’s surprise order this week for China to close its Houston consulate, Pompeo repeated frequently leveled US charges about Beijing’s unfair trade practices, human rights abuses and efforts to infiltrate American society.He said China’s military had became “stronger and more menacing” and the approach to China should be “distrust and verify,” adapting President Ronald Reagan’s “trust but verify” mantra about the Soviet Union in the 1980s.“The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change inside of China that President Nixon hoped to induce,” Pompeo said.“The truth is that our policies – and those of other free nations – resurrected China’s failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that were feeding it,” he said.“We, the freedom-loving nations of the world must induce China to change ... in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing’s actions threaten our people and our prosperity,” Pompeo said, adding: “If the free world doesn’t change, Communist China will surely change us.”Pompeo said “securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time,” and said America was perfectly positioned to lead it.He said one NATO ally, which he did not name, was unwilling to stand up for freedom on Hong Kong because it feared restricted access to China’s market.LOW POINTPompeo’s speech comes at a time when US-China relations have dipped to their lowest point in decades and President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden have appeared to compete with each other over who can appear toughest towards Beijing ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.Ties have deteriorated over issues ranging from the novel coronavirus pandemic, which began in China, to Beijing trade and business practices, its territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.In a dramatic escalation, Washington on Tuesday gave China 72 hours to close the consulate amid allegations of widespread spying.Pompeo said the consulate had been “a hub of spying and intellectual property theft.”China said the US move had “severely harmed” relations and warned it “must” retaliate, without detailing what it would do.The South China Morning Post reported that China may close the US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, while a source told Reuters on Wednesday that China was considering shutting the consulate in Wuhan, where the United States withdrew staff at the start of the coronavirus outbreak.Hu Xijin, editor of China’s Global Times tabloid, posted on Twitter: “Based on what I know, China will announce countermeasure on Friday Beijing time. One US consulate in China will be asked to close.”He had said earlier that shutting the Wuhan consulate would be insufficiently disruptive and suggested China could cut US staff at its large consulate in Hong Kong, which he described as an “intelligence center.”“This will make Washington suffer much pain,” he wrote.The other US consulates in China are in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang.China has four other consulates in the United States - in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York - as well as an embassy in Washington.Trump said in answer to a question at a news briefing on Wednesday it was “always possible” other Chinese missions could be closed too.Richard Grenell, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo who served until recently as acting director of US national intelligence, told Reuters the US strategy was “very much start with one and move on to others if need be.”“The whole goal is to change the behavior of the Chinese... this is emerging as the Trump doctrine, which is very harsh actions, sanctions and isolation while at the same time always offering a chance to exit if the behavior changes.”Chinese state media editorials said the US move against the Houston consulate was an attempt to blame Beijing for US failures ahead of Trump’s reelection bid. Opinion polls have shown Trump trailing Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-urges-more-assertive-approach-to-frankenstein-china/story-lSbXhEHAMWdScWBaUhK2FK.html
24-07-2020||World||Trump scraps big Republican convention in Florida as Covid-19 rages||President Donald Trump relented Thursday to worries about the coronavirus and canceled his Florida nominating convention, the biggest event of his re-election campaign, as the host state posted record deaths from the pandemic.“I told my team it’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida component of the GOP convention,” Trump said Thursday at the White House. “We didn’t want to take any chances.”Trump had insisted for months that he would still hold his four-day extravaganza despite worries that the gathering would become a super-spreader event. The party decided June 11 to move the convention from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, after Governor Roy Cooper refused to waive social-distancing and other measures to prevent contagion.But just as preparations for the Florida event got underway, Florida was hit with a surge of infections and now is one of the country’s hardest-hit areas, with a total so far of 389,868 confirmed cases of the virus — about 1.8% of the state’s population — and the number growing by an average of more than 10,000 cases a day. The state posted a record 173 deaths on Thursday.With support plunging in public opinion polls over his handling of the virus, Trump appeared to start over this week, offering daily news conferences where he encouraged people to wear masks after disdaining them for months, and acknowledging the seriousness of the virus after minimizing its impact.A Quinnipiac poll of Florida voters released Thursday showed him running 13 points behind Joe Biden.But Trump, who thrives on the large crowds that attend his campaign rallies, was clearly looking forward to an event that would give his campaign a jolt of enthusiasm.He tried that with a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, his only one so far since the pandemic began in March. The event was only filled to about one-third of capacity and numerous people, including state officials, became ill.Democrats scaled back their convention earlier this summer, dispensinf with the full pageantry and celebration that normally marks the nomination of a presidential candidate. The Democratic National Committee is allowing delegates to vote remotely and most of the speeches, except for the acceptance speech for Joe Biden, will be livestreamed. Biden will speak in Milwaukee but before a limited audience.The Republicans, urged on by Trump, had persisted in planning a full convention right up until Trump’s announcement at his daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.He offered few details of how the GOP virtual event would work, except to say there would be a “reasonably quick meeting in North Carolina.”“I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form but we won’t do a big crowded convention per se,”he said.“We’ll have a very nice something,” he added. “We’ll figure it out.”Local officials in the Republican-led city applauded the decision.In a joint statement, Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and Sheriff Mike Williams applauded the move. “We appreciate President Donald Trump considering our public health and safety concerns in making this incredibly difficult decision,” they said on Twitter.When Trump made the decision to move the convention in early June, Florida’s rate of coronavirus infections was well below the national average. But the rate spiked as beaches and Disney resorts started to reopen, fueled in part by growing infections in younger patients.As recently as two weeks ago, the White House denied there were any second thoughts about holding a convention. “No, we’re still moving forward with Jacksonville,” said press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. “It’ll be a safe event. It will be a good event. And it will be up to the RNC as to how those details are hashed out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-scraps-big-republican-convention-in-florida-as-covid-19-rages/story-Bk1xoYYKFfilyZwRKCsyQO.html
24-07-2020||World||India facilitating visa requests of Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh minorities||India said on Thursday it has been getting requests from members of the Hindu and Sikh minorities of Afghanistan to settle down in the country following a spike in terror attacks on these communities.“There has been a recent spurt in attacks on the Hindu and Sikh communities in Afghanistan. These attacks have been done by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing.“We have been receiving requests from the members of these communities, they want to move to India, they want to settle down here. Despite the ongoing Covid-19 situation, we have been facilitating these requests,” he added.The Indian embassy in Kabul is providing visas to members of the minority communities to come to the country. “Once they reach here, their requests will be examined and acted upon based on extant rules and policies,” Srivastava said.After Nidan Singh Sachdeva, a leader of Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan was released from captivity on July 18 after being kidnapped on June 22, the external affairs ministry had said the targeting and persecution of minority communities by terrorists was a “matter of grave concern”.“In a recent decision, India has decided to facilitate the return of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan to India,” the ministry had said in a statement at the time.The controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act provides for a speedy process for members of non-Muslim minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to seek refuge in India.In a separate development, India has again asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its minorities after a Gandhara-style Buddha statue found during the excavation of a house at Mardan in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province was demolished on July 18 at the behest of an Islamic cleric.This act was widely condemned and Buddhist monks in Gaya have condemned the vandalism, Srivastava said.“We have expressed our concerns to Pakistan. We have conveyed our expectation that they would ensure the safety, security and well-being of minority communities there, as well as protect their cultural heritage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-facilitating-visa-requests-of-afghanistan-s-hindu-and-sikh-minorities/story-bhT4CSKPXH4TmAiNkB52WN.html
24-07-2020||World||300-400 mn doses of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine to be ready by Dec: Serum Institute||Serum Institute of India (SII) has said the company is going to produce 300 to 400 million doses of the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca by December this year.Adar Poonawalla, SII’s chief executive officer, said Covishield is the first Covid-19 vaccine they hope to launch if the trials are successful both in the UK and in India.SII, the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, has been chosen by Oxford and its AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine once it gets ready.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe vaccine from AstraZeneca and Britain’s University of Oxford prompted no serious side effects and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses, according to trial results published in The Lancet medical journal on Monday.Poonawalla said they will start the trials of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary nods and launch the vaccine by June next year if all goes well.“We will be going for large scale manufacturing in mid-August-early-August… By the end of this year, we should be able to produce 300 to 400 million doses come end of December. That’s the target and I hope we can do that,” Adar Poonawalla said in an interview to news channel India Today.As he said they expect the vaccine to reach the people of India in large numbers by the first quarter of 2021, he added that is “still a bit early of how much is going to cost”. “We are going to give it at a very affordable price… We are planning to put it at about Rs 1000 or less than that… I don’t think any citizen of India or of any other country is going to have to pay for it because it is going to be bought by the government and distributed free,” he said.“It is going to be very affordable… in line with our general philosophy of giving everything at a very affordable price. We generally don’t want to make a profit at all, in fact, in the Covid crisis and after the pandemic is over, we may look at a more commercial price that could be available in the market,” he said.Oxford University had on Monday announced satisfactory progress with the vaccine, making it one of the leading ones among the dozens of vaccine candidates being developed around the world.It has tied up with Serum Institute to manufacture and supply the vaccine to India and over 60 other countries having a combined population of 3 billion.SII, he said, is putting $200 million at risk by manufacturing nearly 300 million doses before the final nod to launch the vaccine in market.“We are making this application within the next 48 hours to the Drug Controller General of India’s office. They will probably take about 1-2 weeks on what kind of study and trial we will have to do,” Poonawalla said, speaking to the CNBC-TV-18 news channel.It will take another three weeks to inject patients in hospitals, he said, adding, “We are talking about a month or month and a half maximum from today...maybe even sooner.”“The vaccine under development will be injected into 4,000-5,000 volunteers in Pune and Mumbai, which have high rates of coronavirus infections, as part of the crucial phase three of the trial which will determine if the antidote can be introduced in the market or not,” he said.Poonawalla said unlike the exclusion of older people in the initial phase of trials at Oxford, the Indian trials will include elderly people and health workers as well because the initial phase has conclusively proven the safety of the vaccine.Other than the process of applying for trials and having actual trials on humans in India, the company will also be applying for special permission to start manufacturing the vaccine in the country, which exposes it to a commercial risk if the vaccine fails at the last stage, he said.The company will manufacture up to 70 million doses of the vaccine per month up to October as part of the special permission and plans to take it up to 100 million per month by December so that it is ready to hit the market once the final approvals are in place.If this goes to plan, the phase three trials will take two months after the patients get injected and the vaccine gets a final nod by November, he said, adding that in such a scenario, it can get introduced either in the “first quarter of 2021”.The company has already manufactured around 2-3 million doses of the vaccine for getting the process correct and also stabilising its machinery, Poonawalla said, clarifying that these will never be used on humans.“If you look at the process right now, the risk of the opex (operating expenditure) which we are putting in is more than $200 million. If this vaccine fails, we will be down (by) $200 million,” he said, adding the expenses exclude the opportunity cost of using the same facility for some other purpose.Poonawalla also said SII is looking at external investors for the vaccine-related endeavour and added that it has tie-ups with five other vaccine candidates which will be housed into a separate step-down subsidiary, where the family will dilute its stake by 15-20%.Apart from the five tie-ups already forged, SII is in talks with two other candidates, he said, adding that a manufacturing plant with a capacity to produce 1 billion units of the vaccine per year will also get housed in the subsidiary.He said it is extremely likely that the Covid-19 vaccine would require two or more doses, like in the case of antidotes for measles and other diseases.“We have got a lot on the line and bet big on this (Oxford-AstraZeneca) candidate. And we really hope it works,” he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-4-million-doses-of-oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-ready-by-december-serum-institute/story-EFnyf1XN6HZcHW8DIm8W0I.html
